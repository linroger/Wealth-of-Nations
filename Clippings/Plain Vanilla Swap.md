## What Is a Plain Vanilla Swap?

A [plain vanilla](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plainvanilla.asp) swap is one of the simplest financial instruments contracted in the over-the-counter market between two private parties, both of which are usually firms or financial institutions. There are several types of plain vanilla swaps, including an [interest rate swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrateswap.asp), commodity swap, and a foreign currency swap. The term plain vanilla swap is most commonly used to describe an interest rate swap in which a floating interest rate is exchanged for a fixed rate or vice versa.

### Key Takeaways

- A plain vanilla swap is the simplest type of swap in the market, often used to hedge floating interest rate exposure.
- There are various types of plain vanilla swaps, including interest rate, commodity, and currency swaps.
- Generally, both legs of the swap are denominated in the same currency, and interest payments are netted.

## Understanding a Plain Vanilla Swap

A plain vanilla interest rate swap is often done to hedge a floating rate exposure, although it can also be done to take advantage of a declining rate environment by moving from a fixed to a floating rate. Both legs of the swap are denominated in the same currency, and interest payments are netted. The [notional principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/notionalprincipalamount.asp) does not change during the life of the swap, and there are no embedded options.

## Types of Plain Vanilla Swaps

The most common plain vanilla swap is a floating rate interest rate swap. Now, the most common floating rate index is the [London Interbank Offered Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR), which is set daily by the International Commodities Exchange (ICE). LIBOR is posted for five currenciesâ€”the U.S. dollar, euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and British pound. Maturities range from overnight to 12 months. The rate is set based on a survey of between 11 and 18 major banks.

### Important

The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. All other LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

The most common floating rate reset period is every three months, with semi-annual payments. The day count convention on the floating leg is generally actual/360 for the U.S. dollar and the euro, or actual/365 for the British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. The interest on the floating rate leg is accrued and compounded for six months, while the fixed-rate payment is calculated on a simple 30/360 or 30/365 basis, depending on the currency. The interest due on the floating rate leg is compared with that due on the fixed-rate leg, and only the net difference is paid.

## Example of a Plain Vanilla Swap

In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, Company A and Company B choose a maturity, principal amount, currency, [fixed interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp), floating interest rate index, and rate reset and payment dates. On the specified payment dates for the life of the swap, Company A pays Company B an amount of interest calculated by applying the fixed rate to the principal amount, and Company B pays Company A the amount derived from applying the floating interest rate to the principal amount. Only the netted difference between the interest payments changes hands.
