Definition

A cross-currency swap is a financial contract where two entities exchange an equivalent amount of principal in different currencies. Then each entity makes interest payments on the currency they received, with rates that can be fixed or floating.

Let's say a German company needs to borrow U.S. dollars to pay for building a factory in the U.S. It could go to an American bank and get one, of course. But it would have to pay a much higher interest rate than it could get at home, and would face the risk that the euro will [depreciate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depreciation.asp) against the dollar, making it more difficult to repay the loan.

The cross-currency swap offers an alternative. The German company would find an American company looking to borrow in euros. The two companies would both borrow an agreed-upon amount in their home country, where they could get better loan terms, and then simply exchange the principal amounts and make interest payments in the currency they received.

In short, they would swap [principal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal.asp) and interest payments in one currency for principal and interest payments in another.

### Key Takeaways

- Cross-currency swaps allow companies and financial institutions to hedge foreign exchange risk, manage funding costs, and optimize exposure to global interest rate differentials.
- The two parties swap principal and interest payments in different currencies, with the initial and final swap of principal at a pre-agreed exchange rate to eliminate currency risk.
- The risks of cross-currency swaps include counterparty risk, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity constraints, and basis risk.
- Some real world applications of the derivative are multinational companies aligning liabilities with revenue currencies, financial institutions engaging in interest rate arbitrage, and corporations issuing bonds in foreign markets while maintaining domestic currency exposure.

## How Does a Cross-Currency Swap Work?

To start, the parties need to agree on the terms of the swap. Companies can customize the terms of the contract based on market conditions and their views of future market conditions. For example, if a company believes interest rates are likely to fall in the borrowing country, from which they will receive the funding, they can ask their counterparty for a [floating rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatinginterestrate.asp).

Some of the points that need to be worked out include:

- The principal amounts in each currency
- The exchange rate to be used in the swap
- The type of interest rates (fixed for fixed; fixed for floating; or floating for floating)
- The payment schedule
- The contract's maturity date

The actual swap begins with an initial exchange of principal at the pre-agreed exchange rate. At the contract's end, the principal is swapped back at the same exchange rate, eliminating [foreign exchange risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreignexchangerisk.asp).

Currency-swap contracts are traded over the counter. It's generally quite difficult for a company to find a counterparty whose needs match its own, so in most cases, parties work with intermediary [swap banks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swapbank.asp) that facilitate the exchange for a fee.

## How Are Cross-Currency Swaps Used?

Cross-currency swaps have many uses. They include:

- **Hedging foreign-exchange risk**: Companies use cross-currency swaps to protect against foreign-exchange rate fluctuations by converting liabilities or revenues into a preferred currency at a fixed rate.
- **Aligning debt with revenue currency**: Companies operating internationally often generate revenue in multiple currencies but may not have access to [debt markets](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/071415/what-are-differences-between-debt-and-equity-markets.asp) in each currency. A cross-currency swap can give them access.
- **Reducing borrowing costs**: Some markets charge foreign companies higher borrowing costs. With a cross-currency swap, companies can borrow on better terms in their home market and use the swap to meet their needs in the foreign market.
- **Facilitating foreign investments**: A cross-currency swap enables companies to secure funding in their home market to invest in international assets, even when the investment requires payment in the currency of the target's home country.
- **Optimizing cash flow**: Multinational corporations use swaps to convert revenue streams into their reporting currency, stabilizing [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and reducing the impact of exchange rate volatility.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Cross-Currency Swaps

Advantages
- Hedging foreign exchange risk
- Lower borrowing costs
- Access to global capital markets
- Flexibility in interest rate structures
- Cash flow matching

Disadvantages
- Counterparty risk
- Interest rate risk
- Basis risk
- Liquidity risk
- Mark-to-market volatility
- Complex structuring and high transaction costs

### Advantages of Cross-Currency Swaps

Cross-currency swaps have the following advantages:

**Hedging foreign exchange risk**: These derivatives help companies manage currency risk by locking in exchange rates for future transactions (if they choose a [fixed rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedinterestrate.asp)). This provides stability in financial planning and reduces uncertainty in currency movements.

**Lower borrowing costs**: Some companies can reduce borrowing expenses by issuing debt in their home country where they have better credit conditions. Also, some can attain lower rates by swapping their debt into a foreign currency if benchmark rates are lower in that country.

**Access to global capital markets**: Businesses can issue debt in foreign markets with better financing terms and then use a swap to convert the proceeds into their local currency. This enables firms to take advantage of deeper liquidity and lower borrowing costs while still servicing their debt in their functional currency.

**Flexibility in interest rate structures**: Cross-currency swaps enable firms to choose between fixed or floating interest rates, depending on their strategy and market expectations. This enables companies to adjust interest rate exposure and optimize financing costs.

**Cash flow matching:** Multinational corporations can use swaps to align revenue and debt payments in the same currency. This reduces currency mismatch risk, stabilizes cash flows, and ensures smoother financial operations.

### Disadvantages of Cross-Currency Swaps

Conversely, cross-currency swaps have several disadvantages:

**Counterparty risk**: If one party fails to meet its obligations, the other is exposed to potential financial losses. This risk is particularly concerning for long-term swaps, as a counterparty's creditworthiness may deteriorate over time.

**Interest rate risk**: Companies that choose floating interest rates are exposed to rising benchmark rates, which can increase debt payments.

**Basis risk**: Mismatches between interest rate benchmarks can create unexpected cost variations. This risk can lead to additional financial exposure and complexity in managing swap agreements.

**Liquidity risk**: Cross-currency swaps are traded over the counter. This means exiting the swap before it matures could be difficult and costly because finding a counterparty is often challenging.

**Mark-to-market volatility**: The fair value of a cross-currency swap fluctuates with market conditions, affecting a company's financial statements. This can lead to earnings volatility.

**Complex structuring and high transaction costs**: Structuring a cross-currency swap requires specialized financial expertise and often involves significant legal, accounting, and administrative expenses. These costs can make swaps less attractive for smaller firms or those with limited financial resources.

## Example of a Cross-Currency Swap

A U.S.-based multinational corporation, Company A, is expanding operations in Germany. It needs 100 million euros for investment but prefers to keep its liabilities in U.S. dollars to avoid [currency risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencyrisk.asp). Interest rates in Europe, based on theÂ [Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euribor.asp), are lower than in the U.S., making borrowing in euros cheaper.

**Step 1: Exchange of Principal**

Firstly, instead of a direct euro loan, Company A borrows $100 million in the U.S. bond market at the [Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)](https://www.investopedia.com/secured-overnight-financing-rate-sofr-4683954) + 1%.

Next, the company enters into a cross-currency swap over five years with a European bank, Bank B. The swap details are as follows:

- Company A receives 100 million euros from Bank B.
- Company A gives $110 million to Bank B.
- The exchange rate is locked at 1.10 EUR/USD.

**Step 2: Swap Interest Payments**

Over the five years, Company A and Bank B pay each other interest.

Effectively, company A converts its dollar debt into euro debt, ensuring its liabilities match its euro revenues from German operations.

**Step 3: The Swap Matures**

At the end of the five-year contract, the principal amounts are exchanged again at the original agreed rate. Company A returns 100 million euros to Bank B, and Bank B returns $110 million to Company A.

## The Bottom Line

Cross-currency swaps are a valuable tool for managing foreign exchange risk, lowering borrowing costs, and accessing global [capital markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp). By allowing parties to exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies while locking exchange rates, they help mitigate foreign-exchange exposure and capitalize on interest rate differentials.

However, they come with risks that must be carefully managed, including counterparty default, interest rate volatility, and [liquidity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) challenges. When used strategically, cross-currency swaps can provide financial flexibility and cost savings.
