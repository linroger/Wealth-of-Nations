# China Reserve Requirements,  GFC
In 2008,  China experienced several natural disasters that slowed economic growth,  and,  fearing contagion from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC),  the central bank cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) three times for large financial institutions,  to 15.5%,  and four times for small and medium-size financial institutions,  to 13.5%.

Beginning in 2006,  the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) used required reserves to manage liquidity in the financial system,  sterilize foreign-exchange intervention, <sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-q748b">1</a></sup> manage credit allocation,  and implement macroprudential policy (Klingelhöfer and Sun n.d.). Between June 2006 and July 2011,  the PBOC changed the RRR 35 times. One explanation for the relatively frequent changes—the PBOC ranked among the world’s most frequent adjusters of RRR—was the increasing role of the RRR as an alternative and complement to the PBOC’s other monetary policy tools.

Besides the RRR,  the PBOC managed liquidity through open market operations,  including transactions with government deposits,  repurchase agreements (repos),  and the issuance of new,  longer-dated central bank bills (CBBs), <sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-35qzd">2</a></sup> a typically short-term debt instrument designed to absorb liquidity (Wang and Hu 2011). The PBOC came to rely on reserve requirement policy because of its efficacy in the face of large foreign reserve accumulation,  its practical benefits to the PBOC,  and its integration into a monetary policy framework that targeted quantities amid sometimes conflicting policy objectives (Ma,  Xiandong,  and Xi 2013).

In the midst of the GFC,  China was accumulating large amounts of foreign currency reserves (USD 2.2 trillion) from current account surpluses and foreign direct investment (Li,  Willett,  and Zhang 2012; Wang and Hu 2011). The PBOC issued local currency or sold domestic bonds<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-gd05c">3</a></sup> to finance the purchase of foreign currency revenue from exporters (via commercial banks),  but it needed to sterilize<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-kgdrz">4</a></sup> these purchases to prevent an increase in the local money supply (Wang and Hu 2011; Wu 2007).

The PBOC preferred adjusting the RRR to issuing CBBs for several reasons. First,  it was cheaper,  because the central bank typically paid a higher rate on CBBs than the rate at which it remunerated required reserves (Sun 2013; Wang and Hu 2011). Second,  a reserve requirement ratio hike “froze”<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-6sbi1">5</a></sup> funds more permanently than CBBs,  tightening monetary conditions and controlling inflationary pressure until the PBOC lowered the ratio again (PBOC 2011a; Wang and Hu 2011). Third,  RRR adjustments needed the approval of China’s State Council,  the highest government body,  but it may have been easier to gain approval for these adjustments than,  for example,  interest rate decisions,  which required the agreement of many other agencies (Wang and Hu 2011). Fourth,  the PBOC believed that RRR adjustments would affect liquidity within the banking sector only—not the funding cost to borrowers—and thus it was easier to reach consensus among policymakers (Ma,  Xiandong,  and Xi 2013). For all these reasons,  the RRR effectively replaced CBBs as a liquidity fine-tuning mechanism after 2006 (see Figure 1).

Leading up to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC),  China ran current account and capital account surpluses; GDP grew 13% in 2007 (Ma,  Xiandong,  and Xi 2013; PBOC 2008i). The PBOC began hiking reserve requirements in 2006 in order to sterilize increasing foreign-exchange interventions,  curb credit growth,  and tighten monetary conditions (Wong 2011). Between 2006 and 2008,  the PBOC hiked the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) 19 times,  from 8.5% to 17.0%. In 2007,  China virtually froze new lending through “window guidance, ” essentially telling banks to stop lending; in 2008 and again in 2010,  China imposed quarterly and monthly lending quotas (Wang and Hu 2011).

But in 2008,  China experienced a series of natural disasters that depressed economic growth, <sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-p39gd">6</a></sup> and the central government and PBOC were concerned about the potential for disruptions in global financial markets to spread to China. Some Chinese financial institutions became distressed,  but due to the small presence of foreign banks in China and the country’s strong capital controls,  the financial system was largely insulated<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-ytz1h">7</a></sup> from global contagion,  with losses limited to 2% of pre-crisis GDP between 2007 and 2009 (Li,  Willett,  and Zhang 2012; Morrison 2009; PBOC 2009a; Wu 2007). The more significant impact was the decreased demand from trade partners who *were* directly affected by the GFC,  which negatively impacted China’s export sector,  making up one-third of its pre-crisis GDP (Wong 2011). Meanwhile,  commodity markets,  after surging in the first half of the year,  crashed in August 2008,  contributing to the decline in China’s export growth rate from 20% in October to -2.2% in November (Li,  Willett,  and Zhang 2012; Zhang n.d.).

The government took several measures to ease financial and economic conditions. The PBOC reversed nearly two years of RRR hikes and,  for the first time,  it began to differentiate RRR policy based on institution size,  cutting the RRR from 17.0% to 15.5% for large banks and 13.5% for small and rural financial institutions in the fourth quarter of 2008. The PBOC also loosened monetary policy by eliminating credit quotas,  guiding credit toward agricultural sectors,  and cutting the benchmark<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-6q5ev">8</a></sup> deposit and lending rates over this period. (Cong et al. 2018; PBOC 2008d; PBOC 2008i; Wong 2011). The central government responded to the crisis on November 9,  2008 with an economic stimulus package totaling USD 586 billion, <sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-ipv1f">9</a></sup> or 12.5% of GDP (PBOC 2008i; Wong 2011).

The PBOC continued operating the new two-tiered required reserves regime from September 2008 through early 2011 (see Figure 2). Leading up to the GFC and throughout China’s response to it,  the PBOC’s required reserves policy evolved from a relatively simple system of one ratio applied to all Chinese financial institutions into a complex regime that applied different ratios to individual firms based on their size,  customer base,  and location,  as well as macroprudential factors such as the firm’s capital adequacy and liquidity ratios (Ma,  Xiandong,  and Xi 2013).<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-r1hhx">10</a></sup>

The PBOC’s monetary easing combined with the central government’s stimulus measures grew net new credit by USD 616 billion in 2008,  surpassing both the prior year’s growth and the State Council’s 2008 target of USD 586 billion.<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-9c854">11</a></sup> The PBOC’s loose monetary policy continued through 2009,  and so did the surge in bank lending,  which totaled USD 1.4 trillion<sup><a href="https://newbagehot.yale.edu/docs/china-reserve-requirements-gfc/#footnote-content-111gz">12</a></sup> that year,  or nearly 30% of GDP (see Figure 3) (Fungáčová,  Nuutilaine,  and Will 2015; Wong 2011).

The Chinese economy experienced explosive credit growth throughout 2009—along with increases in the base money supply (see Figure 4) and GDP,  leading the PBOC to return to a tight monetary policy stance. The central bank raised the RRR three times in the first half of 2010,  from 15.5% back to a pre-crisis level of 17.0% for large banks and from 13.5% to 15.0% for small and medium-size banks (PBOC 2010b; PBOC 2010c). In order to support rural communities and the agricultural sector,  the PBOC did not alter the RRR for small and rural financial institutions. By late 2010,  the PBOC observed excess liquidity in global markets washing into the Chinese financial system,  and it used required reserves to drain this excess liquidity,  repeatedly hiking the RRR until the headline ratio for large banks peaked at 21.5% on June 14,  2011 (PBOC 2010b; PBOC 2010c; PBOC 2010d). Between July 2006 and June 2011,  the PBOC changed the RRR 35 times,  averaging a change every two months (usually 50 bps each time),  for a net increase from 8.5% to 21.5% for large banks (see Figure 5) (Ma,  Xiandong,  and Xi 2013).
