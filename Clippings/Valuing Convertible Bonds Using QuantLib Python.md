# Valuing Convertible Bonds Using QuantLib Python

Provides an introduction to valuation of convertible bonds using QuantLib Python with a minimal example.

```python
import QuantLib as ql
```

In this blog I will work through an example of valuing convertible bonds in QuantLib. Lets start by doing the usual setup of creating a `calculation_date` and setting it as the `evaluationDate`.

```python
calculation_date = ql.Date(9, 1, 2004)
ql.Settings.instance().evaluationDate = calculation_date
```

One little quirk in the QuantLib convertible bond implementation is that there are places where the redemption amount is hard coded to `100`. So if you have conversion ratio evaluated as

$$\text{Conversion Ratio}=\frac{\text{Redemption Amount}}{\text{Conversion Price}}$$

you will need to scale to an appropriate value with a redemption amount of `100`. For instance,  vendors report conversion ratio with a redemption amount of 1000. The conversion ratio obtained this way should be divided by a factor of `10` to get the equivalent conversion ratio for use in the QuantLib calculations. This is a limitation right now (as of version 1.7),  which can be fixed in the future.

Following is the details of the convertible bond of interest.

```python
# St. Mary Land & Exploration Company 
# Bloomberg ticker: SM 5.75 03/15/22 

redemption = 100.00
face_amount = 100.0
spot_price = 29.04
conversion_price = 26.0
conversion_ratio = 3.84615  # BBG quotes 38.4615; had to scale by a factor of 10

issue_date = ql.Date(15, 3, 2002)        
maturity_date = ql.Date(15, 3, 2022)

settlement_days = 2
calendar = ql.UnitedStates(ql.UnitedStates.GovernmentBond)
coupon = 0.0575
frequency = ql.Semiannual
tenor = ql.Period(frequency)

day_count = ql.Thirty360()
accrual_convention = ql.Unadjusted
payment_convention = ql.Unadjusted

call_dates = [ql.Date(20, 3, 2007)]
call_price = 100.0
put_dates = [ql.Date(20, 3, 2007),  ql.Date(15, 3, 2012),  ql.Date(15, 3, 2017)]
put_price = 100.0

# assumptions
dividend_yield = 0.02
credit_spread_rate = 0.03  
risk_free_rate = 0.04
volatility = 0.40
```

The call and put schedule for this bond is created as shown below. Here for each call date,  we create a `CallabilityPrice`,  then use that to form the `Callability` object. This is appended to the `CallabilitySchedule` object to form a list of call and put schedules.

```python
callability_schedule = ql.CallabilitySchedule()

for call_date in call_dates:
   callability_price  = ql.CallabilityPrice(call_price,  
                                            ql.CallabilityPrice.Clean)
   callability_schedule.append(ql.Callability(callability_price,  
                                       ql.Callability.Call, 
                                       call_date)
                        )
    
for put_date in put_dates:
    puttability_price = ql.CallabilityPrice(put_price,  
                                            ql.CallabilityPrice.Clean)
    callability_schedule.append(ql.Callability(puttability_price, 
                                               ql.Callability.Put, 
                                               put_date))
```

Any dividend information for the underlying stock is used to form the `DividendSchedule`.

```python
dividend_schedule = ql.DividendSchedule() # No dividends
dividend_amount = dividend_yield*spot_price
next_dividend_date = ql.Date(1, 12, 2004)
dividend_amount = spot_price*dividend_yield
for i in range(4):
    date = calendar.advance(next_dividend_date,  1,  ql.Years)
    dividend_schedule.append(
        ql.FixedDividend(dividend_amount,  date)
    )
```

Now we build the fixed coupon convertible bond object

```python
schedule = ql.Schedule(issue_date,  maturity_date,  tenor, 
                       calendar,  accrual_convention,  accrual_convention, 
                       ql.DateGeneration.Backward,  False)

credit_spread_handle = ql.QuoteHandle(ql.SimpleQuote(credit_spread_rate))
exercise = ql.AmericanExercise(calculation_date,  maturity_date)

convertible_bond = ql.ConvertibleFixedCouponBond(exercise, 
                                                 conversion_ratio, 
                                                 dividend_schedule, 
                                                 callability_schedule,  
                                                 credit_spread_handle, 
                                                 issue_date, 
                                                 settlement_days, 
                                                 [coupon], 
                                                 day_count, 
                                                 schedule, 
                                                 redemption)
```

Build the Black-Scholes-Merton process to model the equity part

```python
spot_price_handle = ql.QuoteHandle(ql.SimpleQuote(spot_price))
yield_ts_handle = ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(
    ql.FlatForward(calculation_date,  risk_free_rate,  day_count)
)
dividend_ts_handle = ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(
    ql.FlatForward(calculation_date,  dividend_yield,  day_count)
)
volatility_ts_handle = ql.BlackVolTermStructureHandle(
    ql.BlackConstantVol(calculation_date,  calendar, volatility,  day_count)
)

bsm_process = ql.BlackScholesMertonProcess(spot_price_handle,  
                                           dividend_ts_handle, 
                                           yield_ts_handle, 
                                           volatility_ts_handle)
```

Build the convertible bond pricing engine

```python
time_steps = 1000
engine = ql.BinomialConvertibleEngine(bsm_process,  "crr",  time_steps)
```

Price the bond

```python
convertible_bond.setPricingEngine(engine)
print "NPV ",  convertible_bond.NPV()
```

```python
NPV  132.308276818
```
