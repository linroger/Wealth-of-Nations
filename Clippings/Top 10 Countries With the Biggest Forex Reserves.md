# Top 10 Countries With the Biggest Forex Reserves

Foreign currency reserves are vital to a nation’s economic well-being. Without adequate reserves,  a country may be unable to pay for critical imports,  such as crude oil,  or service its [external debt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/external-debt.asp). Inadequate reserves can also limit a central bank’s available responses in the event of an economic crisis.

[Foreign currency reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reservecurrency.asp) can also be used to [control exchange rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange-intervention.asp),  which in turn affects global trade. If a currency,  whether [fixed](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixedexchangerate.asp) or [floating](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floatingexchangerate.asp),  begins to deviate from its desired rate with a foreign currency,  the [central bank](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centralbank.asp) can buy and sell reserves as needed to restore the intended exchange rate.

Foreign currencies are not the only form of asset at a government’s disposal. The [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051415/how-does-international-monetary-fund-function.asp) defines foreign reserves as external assets that a country’s monetary authority can use to meet the balance of payment-financing needs,  affect [exchange rates](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) in currency exchange markets,  and other related purposes. These assets can include gold,  [special drawing rights (SDRs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sdr.asp),  and [reserve positions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reserve_tranche.asp) in the IMF. However,  foreign currency is the most abundant asset in most foreign reserves,  and most nations hold the vast majority of their foreign currency reserves in [U.S. dollars](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/u/usd-united-states-dollar.asp),  followed by [euros](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/euro.asp) and the [Japanese yen](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/j/jpy-japanese-yen.asp)0.\1

## Largest Foreign Reserves

Here are the 10 countries with the largest foreign currency reserve assets. All figures are as of May 2024.

Note that the above table lists China’s and Hong Kong’s reserves separately. China has by far the largest foreign currency reserves,  with over two and a half times more than the second-largest reserve holder,  Japan. When China’s and Hong Kong’s reserves are considered together,  the total is more than $4 trillion. Asian and South Asian nations dominate foreign currency reserves,  accounting for eight of the top 10.

Another important point to note is that Russia’s foreign exchange reserves totaled some $600 billion as of Q2 2024. However,  economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.,  the European Union (EU),  and other nations in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 have rendered most of those reserves inaccessible to the central bank0.\1

U.S. foreign currency reserves,  which are mostly euros and yen,  were valued at $244 billion in Q2 2024. The United Kingdom,  which did not make the top 10 list,  held $213 billion in foreign reserves as of June 2024.2

### India Foreign Reserves

To highlight one of the top 10 above,  India held $655 billion in foreign currency reserve assets as of May 2024. Its central bank,  the Reserve Bank of India,  intervenes in the foreign exchange market to stem excess volatility in its domestic currency,  the [rupee](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inr.asp)0.\1

## Why Do Countries Hold Foreign Reserves?

[Countries hold foreign reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange-reserves.asp) for several reasons,  including balancing international trade,  intervening in the currency markets to stabilize the domestic currency,  as liquidity in times of crisis,  and to provide confidence for foreign and domestic investors.

## Why Are China’s Foreign Reserves So Large?

China is a net exporter of goods,  with much of that foreign trade being conducted in U.S. dollars. Chinese companies thus receive U.S. dollars but must convert them into Chinese currency via the banking system. The banks then reconcile these with the central bank. The central bank then uses the dollars to purchase U.S. government securities,  which are considered to be among the safest investments on the planet.

## Why Might a Country Run Out of Foreign Reserves?

A country might draw down its foreign reserves if it needs to sell them in order to stabilize its currency or prop up its economy,  especially if the domestic currency falters.

## The Bottom Line

Maintaining foreign currency reserves is vital to the economic health of a nation. The top 10 nations in terms of foreign currency reserves had combined reserve assets of $9.3 trillion as of December 2023,  more than 43% of which was accounted for by China and Hong Kong.
