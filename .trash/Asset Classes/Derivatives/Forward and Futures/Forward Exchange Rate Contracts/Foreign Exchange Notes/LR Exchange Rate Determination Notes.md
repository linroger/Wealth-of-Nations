# LR EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION NOTES
## EXCHANGE-RATE DETERMINATION IN THE LONG RUN

- More recently, economists have sought to identify the long run equilibrium paths of currencies with econometric models, relating key economic variables to long-term trends in exchange rates.
- These studies have found that long-term trends in
- relative productivity growth,
- sectoral-productivity differentials,
- persistent trends in a country’s terms of trade,
- the net external investment position of a country as a percentage of its GDP,
- and trends in national savings and investment
- have had some success in explaining the longterm path of exchange rates.
- the IMF favors the macroeconomic-balance approach to long-term exchange-rate determination, in which the long-run equilibrium exchange rate is defined as the rate that would equalize a country's savings-investment balance with its underlying current-account balance.
- According to this approach, if there is a shift in a country's national savings, investment, or underlying current account, then the real long-run equilibrium exchange rate should adjust accordingly.

## PURCHASING POWER PARITY

- The purchasing power parity (PPP) approach to exchange rate determination contends that the long-run equilibrium value of a currency is completely determined by the ratio of domestic prices relative to foreign prices
- PPP is built on the notion of arbitrage across all tradable goods and services.
- Arbitrage ensures that the prices of similar goods in two countries will be equalized, when expressed in either local or foreign currency terms.
- For example, if the U.S. and Euroland produced a similar basket of goods, arbitrage should ensure that the prices of those goods would be the same in both regions.
- If the price of the U.S. basket suddenly rose relative to the price of the Euroland basket, the dollar would need to fall to offset the relative price change in order to keep the prices of the two baskets equalized.
- The evidence on PPP suggests that there are often significant and persistent departures from PPP in the short and medium run.
- One key reason is that arbitrage in tradable goods might be limited by transaction costs, tariffs, and entry and exit barriers.
- If such barriers to arbitrage were significant, a large "zone of inaction" might exist whereby firms would be unwilling to arbitrage traded-goods prices, and thus significant departures from PPP would exist over a certain range of exchange-rate movements.

## PURCHASING POWER PARITY AND THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE

- According to the relative version of PPP, the exchange rate over time will move to offset differences in national inflation rates.
- If, for example, the U.S. inflation rate averaged 5% higher than the Euroland inflation rate, the dollar would need to fall by 5% per annum versus the euro to offset the gap in relative inflation rates
- Thus, if PPP held at all times, we should expect the nominal exchange-rate path to parallel the inflation-differential path.

### REAL EXCHANGE RATE DETERMINATION

$$\Delta q = \Delta e-(p*-p)$$

- where:
- $\Delta q$= change in the real exchange rate
- $\Deltae$= change in the nominal exchange rate
- $(p* p)$= change in relative price levels
- A country's real exchange rate can be defined as the nominal exchange rate adjusted for changes in relative inflation rates.
- The dollar's real value would be unchanged if the dollar's nominal value moved exactly in line with changes in U.S./foreign inflation differentials
- Thus, if the U.S. inflated at a rate of 5% per annum above the Euroland inflation rate, and the dollar fell by 5% per annum versus the euro at the same time, the dollar's real value versus the euro would be unchanged over time.
- Indeed, if PPP holds over time, then the real exchange rate would be constant over time as well.
- Many analysts use the trend in real exchange rates as a gauge to assess a country’s long-run competitiveness.
- If a country inflated at a rapid rate relative to its trading partners, and its currency failed to decline in tandem,
- the currency's real value would, as a consequence, rise.
- The rise in the real exchange rate could be viewed as a measure of the loss in that country's competitiveness versus its trading partners.
- If, instead, the nominal exchange rate declined to exactly offset the difference in relative inflation rates,
- then the real exchange rate would have been constant and there would have been no change in trade competitiveness.

## REAL APPRECIATIONS AND EXCHANGE-RATE MISALIGNMENTS

- PPP misalignments occur when nominal exchange rates fail to move in line with relative inflation rates.
- PPP misalignments can also occur if the nominal exchange rate rises or falls by large amounts relative to modestly changing or unchanging inflation differentials.
- Consider what would happen if the U.S. inflation rate averaged 5% per annum faster than Euroland’s inflation rate but the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate was fixed. By preventing a decline in the dollar's nominal value that would offset the relatively higher U.S. inflation rate, the dollar's real value
- For example, if the U.S. and Euroland inflated at similar rates, but the dollar's nominal value nevertheless soared versus the euro, then the dollar's real value
- $$\Delta q = \Delta e-(pE-pUS)$$
- would rise as the gap between a rising dollar, e$, and an unchanged inflation differential, (pE pUS), steadily widened. The consequences of a steadily rising real value for the dollar would be a long-run decline in U.S. competitiveness.
- would be pushed steadily higher as the gap between the fixed nominal value for the dollar, e$, and a falling inflation differential, (pE-pUS), steadily widened. The more the U.S. inflates relative to Euroland, with no offsetting dollar depreciation, the less competitive the U.S. would be.
- $$\Delta q = \Delta e-(pE-pUS)$$
