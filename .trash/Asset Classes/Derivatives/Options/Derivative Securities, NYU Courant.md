This is the web page for my class Derivative Securities
(G63.2791.001) in Fall 2012. Lecture Notes and homeworks will
be posted as they become available. Items with restricted
circulation (like solution sheets) will be posted instead
on the course's Blackboard site.

The last time I taught this class was Fall 2007,  when
Steve Allen and I taught parallel sections. The lecture
notes include many contributions from Steve. The complete
website from Fall 2007 ishere. The Fall 2012 version will be
similar overall,  but different in some details (the
world has changed a lot since 2007).
