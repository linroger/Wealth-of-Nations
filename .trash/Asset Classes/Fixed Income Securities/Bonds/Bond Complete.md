**Lecture Notes on Debt Securities**

**Characteristics of Debt Securities**

- Debt securities have several defining characteristics,  including:
	 - **(a)** coupon rate
	 - **(b)** maturity date
	 - **(c)** issued amount
	 - **(d)** outstanding amount
	 - **(e)** issuer
	 - **(f)** issue date
	 - **(g)** market price
	 - **(h)** market yield
	 - **(i)** contractual features
	 - **(j)** credit-rating category
- On the **settlement date**,  the buyer and seller will exchange cash and security as per the terms agreed to on the **pricing date**. Therefore,  the **settlement date** is the relevant date for valuation and computing prices.
- **High liquidity** means that investors can buy or sell large amounts easily at a narrow bid-offer spread without an adverse price reaction.
- **Bid** is the price at which the market maker is prepared to buy the security
- **Offer** or **ask** is the price at which the market maker is prepared to sell the security
- This implies that the Treasury security has a **low liquidity risk**.
- The fact that this T-bond was not callable by the Treasury means that the investor has no uncertainty about the **timing of the cash flows**. Thus,  the security has **no timing risk**.
- If the issuer can call the security,  the investor will face timing risk because the issuer is likely to call the bonds when interest rates decline or when the credit quality of the issuer improves.
- Some securities are also subject to **event risk**. This risk arises if:
- the issuer’s credit risk suddenly deteriorates
- a major recapitalization (such as a leveraged buyout) occurs,  adversely affecting the risk of the bond.

**Cash Flow Rights of Debt Securities**

- **Debt contracts typically have precedence over residual claims such as equity.**
- When there are multiple issues of debt securities by the same issuing entity (as is typical),  priorities and relative seniorities are clearly stated by the issuer in bond covenants.
- This leads to some important types of debt contracts:

1. **Secured debt**,  such as a mortgage bond,  is backed by tangible assets of the issuing company.
	 - In the event of financial distress,  such assets may be sold to satisfy the obligations of debt holders.
1. **Unsecured debt**,  known as debentures in the United States,  is not secured by any assets.

- Debt securities sold by issuers such as banks and corporations are subject to a **positive probability of default**,  and they typically contain two important contingency provisions:

1. Debt contracts specify **events that precipitate bankruptcy**. Examples:
	 - Nonpayment of promised coupon payments
	 - Failure to make balloon payments
		  - The payment of principal at maturity is often referred to as a **balloon payment**
	 - Such events give the debt holders the right to take over the firm
1. Debt contracts also specify the **rules by which debt holders will be compensated upon bankruptcy and transfer of control.**
	 - Quite often,  the actual payments upon bankruptcy may differ from the payments specified in the debt contract and implied by absolute priority.

**Features of Debt Securities**

- Many corporate debt issues (especially those issues that are rated as noninvestment grade) are **callable** at predetermined prices,  which gives the issuer the right to buy back the debt issue at prespecified future times.
- Most are issued with **sinking fund provisions**,  which require that the debt issue be periodically retired in predetermined amounts.
- Some are **puttable** at the option of the buyer,  and some are **convertible** into a prespecified number of shares of common stock of the issuing company.
- Many convertible debt securities are also callable by the issuers.
- Since the T-note carried a fixed dollar coupon of 4.75%,  its price must respond to changes in the interest rates to compensate potential buyers for the prevailing market conditions.

**Contractual Risk**

- Debt securities may be callable by the issuer at the issuer’s option.
- Holders of mortgage loans have the right to prepay their loans.
- Homeowners will be more likely to prepay their old mortgages if they can refinance them at a cheaper rate.
- This implies that prepayments should increase when mortgage rates in the market drop.
- The lending bank has given the borrowing homeowner the right to call away the loan.
- The presence of a call feature introduces a **timing risk** to investors:
- When interest rates fall on similar debt instruments,  the probability that the issue may be called increases.
- In the early 1990s,  many of the mortgages experienced high speeds of prepayments,  which significantly shortened their effective lives.
- Banks originating mortgage loans must price this risk at the time that loans are extended:
- The lender will want to charge a higher interest rate to account for the fact that he or she is giving the borrower a valuable option to call away the loans when interest rates fall in the market.
- This is the “call risk” in mortgages.
- Hence mortgages must trade at a yield higher than similar noncallable Treasury debt securities.

**Inflation Risk**

- Most debt securities carry the risk of inflation.
- If the debt security is indexed to inflation,  the risk could be lower,  depending on the effectiveness of indexing.
- For example,  the U.S. Treasury has issued indexed 10and 5-year securities during the past several years.
- The difference between the promised yield of nominal Treasury debt securities and the promised yield of indexed debt security is a good measure of the **expected inflation and inflation risk premium**,  with one caveat:
- Nominal debt securities are more actively traded than indexed Treasury debt.
- This implies that part of the spread may also be due to liquidity differences.
- The indexed security compensates the investors for the realized inflation rate,  which includes both expected and unexpected inflation rates.
- But the nominal debt security only compensates for the **expected inflation rate** at the time it was issued.
- The difference between their promised yields is then a good measure of **inflation risk premium**,  subject to liquidity differences between these markets.

**Event Risk**

- Some debt securities may be sensitive to events such as **hostile reorganizations or leveraged buyouts (LBOs)**.
- Such events can lead to a significant price loss.
- Example:
- In October 1988 RJR Nabisco was taken over through an LBO.
- The resulting company took on heavy debt to finance the takeover.
- As a result,  Moody’s rating of RJR Nabisco’s debt went from A1 to B3.
- The prices of RJR bonds dropped about 15%,  and the yield spread went from about 100 basis points over Treasury to about 350 basis points over Treasury.
- In corporate debt securities this is referred to as **event risk**.
- Investors often require protection against this type of risk by requiring a right from the sellers of bonds that allows the investors to sell (or put) the bonds back to the seller at par value.
- This provision has come to be known as the **superpoison put provision**

**Tax Risk**

- If debt securities were originally issued with certain tax exemption features and subsequently there developed an uncertainty regarding their tax status,  it could lead to a price loss if the outstanding issues are not “grandfathered.”
- This type of risk is especially relevant for municipal debt markets,  which enjoy tax advantages that may change at the discretion of the U.S. Congress.

**Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk**

- Depending on the currencies in which the investor is domiciled,  debt securities may pose FX risk as well; for example,  for a Japanese pension fund that wants to fund liabilities in Yen,  investments in U.S. Treasury securities will pose FX risk.
- Central banks of Japan and China hold significant amounts of U.S. government debt as investments,  and consequently they are subject to the risk that the dollar could depreciate.

### **ANNUITY**

---

- A security paying _C_ (in dollars) per period for _N_ periods is known as an annuity.
- Future value of an annuity paying _C_ for two years can be determined as:
	 1. Reinvest first year's payment for one more year at rate $y: C \times y^{1}$﻿
	 1. Add to the payment of _C_ at the end of Year 2: 
		  1. **$FV = C + C \times y^{1}$**﻿
		  1. **$FV \times y = C \times y^{2} + C \times y$**﻿
	 1. Simplify to find: _FV_
		  1. **$FV = C \times \frac{y^{2} - 1}{y - 1}$**﻿
	 1. For _N_ years with an annual interest payment: _FV_
		  1. **$FV = C \times \frac{y^{N} - 1}{y - 1}$**
# THE BOND INSTRUMENT

Bonds are the basic ingredient of the U.S. debt-capital market,  which is the cornerstone of the U.S. economy. All evening television news programs include a slot during which the newscaster informs viewers where the main stock market indexes closed that day and where key foreign exchange rates ended up. Financial sections of most newspapers also indicate at what yield the Treasury long bond closed. This coverage reflects the fact that bond prices are affected directly by economic and political events,  and yield levels on certain government bonds are fundamental economic indicators. The yield level on the U.S. Treasury long bond,  for instance,  mirrors the market’s view on U.S. interest rates,  inflation,  public-sector debt,  and economic growth.

The media report the bond yield level because it is so important to the country’s economy—as important as the level of the equity market and more relevant as an indicator of the health and direction of the economy. Because of the size and crucial nature of the debt markets,  a large number of market participants,  ranging from bond issuers to bond investors and associated intermediaries,  are interested in analyzing them. This chapter introduces the building blocks of the analysis.

## THE BOND INSTRUMENT

- Bonds are debt instruments that represent cash flows payable during a specified time period. They are essentially loans. The cash flows they represent are the interest payments on the loan and the loan redemption. Unlike commercial bank loans,  however,  bonds are tradable in a secondary market. Bonds are commonly referred to as fixed-income instruments. This term goes back to a time when bonds paid fixed coupons each year. Today that is not necessarily the case. Asset-backed bonds,  for instance,  are issued in a number of tranches—related securities from the same issuer—each of which pays a different fixed or floating coupon. Nevertheless,  this is still commonly referred to as the fixed-income market.

## THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY

- Bond prices are expressed “per 100 nominal”—that is,  as a percentage of the bond’s face value. (The convention in certain markets is to quote a price per 1, 000 nominal,  but this is rare.) For example,  if the price of a U.S. dollar–denominated bond is quoted as 98.00,  this means that for every$100 of the bond’s face value,  a buyer would pay$98. The principles of pricing in the bond market are the same as those in other financial markets: the price of a financial instrument is equal to the sum of the present values of all the future cash flows from the instrument. The interest rate used to derive the present value of the cash flows,  known as the discount rate,  is key,  since it reflects where the bond is trading and how its return is perceived by the market. All the factors that identify the bond—including the nature of the issuer,  the maturity date,  the coupon,  and the currency in which it was issued—influence the bond’s discount rate. Comparable bonds have similar discount rates. The following sections explain the traditional approach to bond pricing for plain vanilla instruments,  making certain assumptions to keep the analysis simple. After that,  a more formal analysis is presented.

### BASIC FEATURES AND DEFINITIONS

- One of the key identifying features of a bond is its issuer,  the entity that is borrowing funds by issuing the bond in the market. Issuers generally fall into one of four categories:
	  - Governments and their agencies
	  - Local governments,  or municipal authorities
	  - Supranational bodies,  such as the World Bank
	  - Corporations
- Within the municipal and corporate markets there are a wide range of issuers that differ in their ability to make the interest payments on their debt and repay the full loan. An issuer’s ability to make these payments is identified by its credit rating.
- Another key feature of a bond is its term to maturity: the number of years over which the issuer has promised to meet the conditions of the debt obligation. The practice in the bond market is to refer to the term to maturity of a bond simply as its maturity or term. Bonds are debt capital market securities and therefore have maturities longer than one year. This differentiates them from money market securities. Bonds also have more intricate cash flow patterns than money market securities,  which usually have just one cash flow at maturity. As a result,  bonds are more complex to price than money market instruments,  and their prices are more sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates.
- A bond’s term to maturity is crucial because it indicates the period during which the bondholder can expect to receive coupon payments and the number of years before the principal is paid back. The principal of a bond—also referred to as its redemption value,  maturity value,  par value,  or face value—is the amount that the issuer agrees to repay the bondholder on the maturity,  or redemption,  date,  when the debt ceases to exist and the issuer redeems the bond. The coupon rate,  or nominal rate,  is the interest rate that the issuer agrees to pay during the bond’s term. The annual interest payment made to bondholders is the bond’s coupon. The cash amount of the coupon is the coupon rate multiplied by the principal of the bond. For example,  a bond with a coupon rate of 8 percent and a principal of$1, 000 will pay an annual cash amount of$80.
- A bond’s term to maturity also influences the volatility of its price. All else being equal,  the longer the term to maturity of a bond,  the greater its price volatility.
- There are a large variety of bonds. The most common type is the plain vanilla,  otherwise known as the straight,  conventional,  or bullet bond. A plain vanilla bond pays a regular—annual or semiannual—fixed interest payment over a fixed term. All other types of bonds are variations on this theme.
- In the United States,  all bonds make periodic coupon payments except for one type: the zero-coupon. Zero-coupon bonds do not pay any coupon. Instead,  investors buy them at a discount to face value and redeem them at par. Interest on the bond is thus paid at maturity,  realized as the difference between the principal value and the discounted purchase price.
- Floating-rate bonds,  often referred to as floating-rate notes (FRNs),  also exist. The coupon rates of these bonds are reset periodically according to a predetermined benchmark,  such as 3-month or 6-month LIBOR (London interbank offered rate). LIBOR is the official benchmark rate at which commercial banks will lend funds to other banks in the interbank market. It is an average of the offered rates posted by all the main commercial banks and is reported by the British Bankers Association at 11.00 hours each business day. For this reason,  FRNs typically trade more like money market instruments than like conventional bonds.

### PRESENT VALUE AND DISCOUNTING

Since fixed-income instruments are essentially collections of cash flows,  it is useful to begin by reviewing two key concepts of cash flow analysis: discounting and present value. Understanding these concepts is essential. In the following discussion,  the interest rates cited are assumed to be the market-determined rates.

- Financial arithmetic demonstrates that the value of$1 received today is not the same as that of$1 received in the future. Assuming an interest rate of 10 percent a year,  a choice between receiving$1 in a year and receiving the same amount today is really a choice between having$1 a year from now and having$1 plus$0.10—the interest on$1 for one year at 10 percent per annum.
- The notion that money has a time value is basic to the analysis of financial instruments. Money has time value because of the opportunity to invest it at a rate of interest. A loan that makes one interest payment at maturity is accruing simple interest. Short-term instruments are usually such loans. Hence,  the lenders receive simple interest when the instrument expires. The formula for deriving terminal,  or future,  value of an investment with simple interest is shown as:

$$
FV = PV(1 + r) 
$$

where

- FV = the future value of the instrument
- PV = the initial investment,  or the present value,  of the instrument
- r = the interest rate

The market convention is to quote annualized interest rates: the rate corresponding to the amount of interest that would be earned if the investment term were one year. To calculate the terminal value of a short-term investment—that is,  one with a term of less than a year—accruing simple interest,  equation (1.1) is modified as follows:

$$
FV = PV \left[ 1 + r \left( \frac{\text{days}}{\text{year}} \right) \right]  
$$

where FV and PV are defined as above,

- r = the annualized rate of interest
- days = the term of the investment
- year = the number of days in the year

Note that,  in the sterling markets,  the number of days in the year is taken to be 365,  but most other markets—including the dollar and euro markets—use a 360-day year. (These conventions are discussed more fully later in the chapter.)

Now consider an investment of$100,  again at a fixed rate of 6 percent a year,  but this time for three years. At the end of the first year,  the investor will be credited with interest of$6. Therefore for the second year,  the interest rate of 6 percent will be accruing on a principal sum of$106. Accordingly,  at the end of year two,  the interest credited will be$6.36. This illustrates the principle of compounding: earning interest on interest. Equation (1.3) computes the future value for a sum deposited at a compounding rate of interest:

$$
FV = PV(1 + r)^n
$$

where

- FV and PV are defined as before
- r = the periodic rate of interest (expressed as a decimal)
- n = the number of periods for which the sum is invested

This computation assumes that the interest payments made during the investment term are reinvested at an interest rate equal to the first year’s rate.

In general,  if compounding takes place$m$times per year,  then at the end of$n$years, $m*n$interest payments will have been made,  and the future value of the principal is computed using the formula:

$$
FV = PV\left(\left(1 + \frac{r}{m}\right)^n\right)
$$

This shows that the more frequent the compounding,  the higher the annualized interest rate. The entire progression indicates that a limit can be defined for continuous compounding,  i.e.,  where$m →o \infty$. To define the limit,  it is useful to rewrite equation (1.4) as:

$$
FV = PV\left[\left(1 + \frac{1}{w}\right)^{rn}\right]
$$

where

$$
w = \frac{m}{r}
$$

As compounding becomes continuous and m and hence w approach infinity,  the expression in the square brackets approaches the mathematical constant e (the base of natural logarithmic functions),  which is equal to approximately 2.718281.

Substituting e into the equation above gives us:

$$
FV = PVe^{rn}
$$

In this equation$e^{rn}$is the exponential function of$rn$. It represents the continuously compounded interest rate factor.

The convention in both wholesale and personal,  or retail,  markets is to quote an annual interest rate,  whatever the term of the investment,  whether it be overnight or 10 years. Lenders wishing to earn interest at the rate quoted have to place their funds on deposit for one year. For example,  if you open a bank account that pays 3.5 percent interest and close it after six months,  the interest you actually earn will be equal to 1.75 percent of your deposit. The actual return on a three-year building society bond that pays a 6.75 percent fixed rate compounded annually is 21.65 percent. The quoted rate is the annual one-year equivalent. An overnight deposit in the wholesale,  or interbank,  market is still quoted as an annual rate,  even though interest is earned for only one day.

Quoting annualized rates allows deposits and loans of different maturities and involving different instruments to be compared. Be careful when comparing interest rates for products that have different payment frequencies. As shown in the earlier examples,  the actual interest earned on a deposit paying 6 percent semiannually will be greater than on one paying 6 percent annually. The convention in the money markets is to quote the applicable interest rate taking into account payment frequency.

Just as future and present value can be derived from one another,  given an investment period and interest rate,  so can the interest rate for a period be calculated given a present and a future value. The basic equation is merely rearranged again to solve for r. This,  as discussed later,  is known as the investment’s yield.

### DISCOUNT FACTORS

An n-period discount factor is the present value of one unit of currency that is payable at the end of period n. Essentially,  it is the present value relationship expressed in terms of$1. A discount factor for any term is given by formula:

$$
d_n = \frac{1}{(1 + r)^n}  
$$

where n = the period of discount

It is possible to derive discount factors from current bond prices. This process can be illustrated using the set of hypothetical bonds,  all assumed to have semiannual coupons.

This technique of calculating discount factors,  known as bootstrapping,  is conceptually neat,  but may not work so well in practice. Problems arise when you do not have a set of bonds that mature at precise six-month intervals. Liquidity issues connected with individual bonds can also cause complications. This is true because the price of the bond,  which is still the sum of the present values of the cash flows,  may reflect liquidity considerations (e.g.,  hard to buy or sell the bond,  difficult to find) that do not reflect the market as a whole

### OVERVIEW OF THE BOND MARKET

- The bond market is an over-the-counter (OTC) market. That is,  there is no organized exchange on which buyers and sellers meet to trade. The dealer will quote a price at which the dealer will buy the bond (the bid price) or at which the dealer will sell the bond (the offer price). The customer always sells at the lower (bid) price and buys at the higher (offer) price. In some markets (such as UK Gilts) the convention is to quote a customer both a bid and offer price before the customer declares whether he is a buyer or seller (the customer asks for a two-way market). In other markets (such as US Treasuries) the convention is that the customer usually declares whether he is a buyer or seller before asking for a price (the customer asks for a bid or offer price).

### US TREASURY BONDS

- The US Government issues Bills,  Notes,  and Bonds. Bills are short-term discount securities with original issue maturity of 3 months,  6 months,  and 12 months. (Bills will be discussed in more detail in the money market section.) Notes are medium term bonds with original issue maturity of 2 to 10 years. Notes are not (and have never been) callable. Bonds are long term bonds with original issue maturity of over 10 years. Until about 10 years ago 30 year Bonds were callable,  but no callable Bonds are now issued. Currently the Treasury issues 2,  3,  5,  and 10 year Notes and 30 year Bonds. The only real distinction between Notes and Bonds is the name,  and we will refer to all of these generically as Treasury bonds. The US Government is the largest borrower in the world. In 1992 there was over$2, 500 billion of debt outstanding,  with about 15% in Bills,  43% in Notes,  and 12% in Bonds

### EUROBONDS

P These are bonds issued by international companies,  governments,  and supranational entities (such as the World Bank). The term Eurobond is a little misleading because these bonds now trade internationally and not just in Europe. The market arose during the 1960 s in response to restrictions on domestic bond issuance in the US. This led to US and foreign companies issuing bonds,  denominated in US dollars,  which were marketed across Europe. Now Eurobonds are issued in various countries and a variety of currencies.

---

- As for any set of fixed cash flows,  the relation between future cash and today’s value is the present value or discounting relation: future cash flows are discounted (at some appropriate interest rate) to convert them into today’s present value. Written in terms of an equation the relation between future value (future cash flow) and present value is:

$P V=\frac{F V}{[1+y]^{T}}$

PV = Present Value (today’s value)
FV = Future Value (future cash flow)
Y = yield or interest rate or discount rate
T = number of periods of discounting

$P =C\left[\frac{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^{n}}}{r} \right]+\frac{\mathit{M}}{(1+r)^{n}}$

- C = semiannual coupon payment ($)
	 N = number of periods (number of years times 2 for semiannual coupon payments)
	 R = periodic interest rate (required yield divided by 2) (in decimal)
	 M = maturity value

### PRICING A ZERO-COUPON BOND

- So far we have determined the price of coupon-bearing bonds. Some bonds do not make any periodic coupon payments. Instead,  the investor realizes interest by the difference between the maturity value and the purchase price. The pricing of a zero-coupon bond is no different from the pricing of a coupon bond: Its price is the present value of the expected cash flows. In the case of a zero-coupon bond,  the only cash flow is the maturity value. Therefore,  the price of a zero-coupon bond is simply the present value of the maturity value. The number of periods used to discount the maturity value is double the number of years to maturity. This treatment is consistent with the manner in which the maturity value of a coupon bond is handled.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REQUIRED YIELD AND PRICE AT A GIVEN TIME

- The price of an option-free bond changes in the direction opposite to the change in the required yield. The reason is that the price of the bond is the present value of the cash flows.
	 - As the required yield increases,  the present value of the cash flows decreases; hence the price decreases.
	 - The opposite is true when the required yield decreases: The present value of the cash flows increases,  and therefore,  the price of the bond increases.

## THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG COUPON RATE,  REQUIRED YIELD,  AND PRICE

- For a bond issue at a given point in time,  the coupon rate and the term-to-maturity are fixed. Consequently,  as yields in the marketplace change,  the only variable that an investor can change to compensate for the new yield required in the market is the price of the bond. As we saw in the preceding section,  as the required yield increases (decreases),  the price of the bond decreases (increases). Generally,  when a bond is issued,  the coupon rate is set at approximately the prevailing yield in the market. The price of the bond then will be approximately equal to its par value.
- Consequently,  we have the following properties:
	 - When the coupon rate equals the required yield,  the price equals the par value.
	 - When the price equals the par value,  the coupon rate equals the required yield.
- When yields in the marketplace rise above the coupon rate at a given point in time,  the price of the bond has to adjust so that the investor can realize some additional interest. This adjustment is accomplished by having the bond’s price fall below the par value. The difference between the par value and the price is a capital gain and represents a form of interest to the investor to compensate for the coupon rate being lower than the required yield. When a bond sells below its par value,  it is said to be selling at a discount.
- When the required yield is greater than the coupon rate,  the price of the bond is always less than the par value.
- Consequently,  we have the following properties:
	 - When the coupon rate is less than the required yield,  the price is less than the par value.
	 - When the price is less than the par value,  the coupon rate is less than the required yield.
- Finally,  when the required yield in the market is below the coupon rate,  the price of the bond must be above its par value. This occurs because investors who could purchase the bond at par would be getting a coupon rate in excess of what the market requires. As a result,  investors would bid up the price of the bond because its yield is attractive. It will be bid up to a price that offers the required yield in the market. A bond whose price is above its par value is said to be selling at a premium. Exhibit 4-1 shows that for a required yield less than the coupon rate of 9%,  the price of the bond is greater than its par value. Consequently,  we have the following properties: When the coupon rate is greater than the required yield,  the price is greater than the par value. When the price is greater than the par value,  the coupon rate is greater than the required yield.

## TIME PATH OF A BOND

- If the required yield is unchanged between the time the bond is purchased and the maturity date,  what will happen to the price of the bond? For a bond selling at par value,  the coupon rate is equal to the required yield. As the bond moves closer to maturity,  the bond will continue to sell at par value. Thus,  for a bond selling at par,  its price will remain at par as the bond moves toward the maturity date. The price of a bond will not remain constant for a bond selling at a premium or a discount. For all discount bonds,  the following is true: As the bond moves toward maturity,  its price will increase if the required yield does not change. This can be seen in Exhibit 4-3,  which shows the price of the 20-year,  9% coupon bond as it moves toward maturity,  assuming that the required yield remains at 12%. For a bond selling at a premium,  the price of the bond declines as it moves toward maturity. This can also be seen in Exhibit 4-3,  which shows the time path of the 20-year,  9% coupon bond selling to yield 7%.

## REASONS FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF A BOND

- The price of a bond will change because of one or more of the following reasons:
	 - A change in the level of interest rates in the economy. For example,  if interest rates in the economy increase (fall) because of Fed policy,  the price of a bond will decrease (increase).
	 - A change in the price of the bond selling at a price other than par as it moves toward maturity without any change in the required yield. As we demonstrated,  over time a discount bond’s price increases if yields do not change; a premium bond’s price declines over time if yields do not change.
	 - For non-Treasury bonds,  a change in the required yield due to changes in the spread to Treasuries. If the Treasury rate does not change but the spread to Treasuries changes (narrows or widens),  non-Treasury bond prices will change.
	 - A change in the perceived credit quality of the issuer. Assuming that interest rates in the economy and yield spreads between non-Treasuries and Treasuries do not change,  the price of a non-Treasury bond will increase (decrease) if its perceived credit quality has improved (deteriorated).
	 - For bonds with embedded options (callable bonds,  putable bonds,  and convertible bonds),  the price of the bond will change as the factors that affect the value of the embedded options change.
## BOND PRICING AND YIELD: THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH

The discount rate used to derive the present value of a bond’s cash flows is the interest rate that the bondholders require as compensation for the risk of lending their money to the issuer. The yield investors require on a bond depends on a number of political and economic factors,  including what other bonds in the same class are yielding. Yield is always quoted as an annualized interest rate. This means that the rate used to discount the cash flows of a bond paying semiannual coupons is exactly half the bond’s yield.

### BOND PRICING

The fair price of a bond is the sum of the present values of all its cash flows,  including both the coupon payments and the redemption payment. The price of a conventional bond that pays annual coupons can therefore be represented by formula:

$$P = \sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{C}{(1+r)^n} + \frac{M}{(1+r)^N}$$

where

- P = the bond's fair price
- C = the annual coupon payment
- r = the discount rate,  or required yield
- N = the number of years to maturity,  and so the number of interest periods for a bond paying an annual coupon
- M = the maturity payment,  or par value,  which is usually 100 percent of face value

Bonds in the U.S. domestic market—as opposed to international securities denominated in U.S. dollars,  such as USD Eurobonds—usually pay semiannual coupons. Such bonds may be priced using the expression:

$$P_d = \sum_{n=1}^{2N}\frac{C/2}{(1+\frac{1}{2}r)^n} + \frac{M}{(1+\frac{1}{2}r)^{2N}}$$

Note that$2N$is now the power to which the discount factor is raised. This is because a bond that pays a semiannual coupon makes two interest payments a year.

It might therefore be convenient to replace the number of years to maturity with the number of interest periods,  which could be represented by the variable$n$,  resulting in formula:

$$P_d = \sum_{n=1}^{n}\frac{C/2}{(1+\frac{1}{2}r)^n} + \frac{M}{(1+\frac{1}{2}r)^{n}}$$

where the variables C,  M,  n,  and r are as before.

This formula calculates the fair price on a coupon payment date,  so there is no accrued interest incorporated into the price. Accrued interest is an accounting convention that treats coupon interest as accruing every day a bond is held; this accrued amount is added to the discounted present value of the bond (the clean price) to obtain the market value of the bond,  known as the dirty price.

Another assumption embodied in the standard formula is that the bond is traded for settlement on a day that is precisely one interest period before the next coupon payment. If the trade takes place between coupon dates,  the formula is modified. This is done by adjusting the exponent for the discount factor using ratio i:

$$i = \frac{\text{Days from value date to next coupon date}}{\text{Days in the interest period}}$$

Using i,  the price formula is modified as:

$$P = \sum_{n=1+i}^{N+i}\frac{C}{(1+r)^{n}} + \frac{M}{(1+r)^{N+i}}$$

where the variables C,  M,  n,  and r are as before.

### BOND YIELD

- The discussion so far has involved calculating the price of a bond given its yield. This procedure can be reversed to find a bond’s yield when its price is known. This is equivalent to calculating the bond’s internal rate of return,  or IRR,  also known as its yield to maturity or gross redemption yield (also yield to workout).
- To differentiate redemption yield from other yield and interest rate measures described in this book,  it will be referred to as$r_m$. Note that this section is concerned with the gross redemption yield,  the yield that results from payment of coupons without deduction of any withholding tax. The net redemption yield is what will be received if the bond is traded in a market where bonds pay coupon net,  without withholding tax. It is obtained by multiplying the coupon rate$C$by$(1 – \text{marginal tax rate}).$The net redemption yield is always lower than the gross redemption yield.
- The key assumption behind the YTM calculation has already been discussed—that the redemption yield$r_m$remains stable for the entire life of the bond,  so that all coupons are reinvested at this same rate. The assumption is unrealistic. Still,  despite the limitations imposed by its underlying assumptions,  the YTM is the main measure of return used in the markets.
- Another problem with YTM is that it discounts a bond’s coupons at the yield specific to that bond. It thus cannot serve as an accurate basis for comparing bonds. Consider a two-year and a five-year bond. These securities will invariably have different YTMs. Accordingly,  the coupon cash flows they generate in two years’ time will be discounted at different rates (assuming the yield curve is not flat). This is clearly not correct. The present value calculated today of a cash flow occurring in two years’ time should be the same whether that cash flow is generated by a short or a long-dated bond.
### FLOATING RATE NOTES

- Floating rate notes (FRNs) are bonds that have variable rates of interest; the coupon rate is linked to a specified index and changes periodically as the index changes. An FRN is usually issued with a coupon that pays a fixed spread over a reference index; for example,  the coupon may be 50 basis points over the six-month interbank rate. Since the value for the reference benchmark index is not known,  it is not possible to calculate the redemption yield for an FRN. The FRN market in countries such as the United States and United Kingdom is large and well-developed; floating-rate bonds are particularly popular with short-term investors and financial institutions such as banks.
- The rate against which the FRN coupon is set is known as the reference rate. In the United States market,  FRNs frequently set their coupons in line with the Treasury bill rate. The spread over the reference note is called the index spread. The index spread is the number of basis points over the reference rate; in a few cases the index spread is negative,  so it is subtracted from the reference rate.
- Generally the reference interest rate for FRNs is the London interbank offered rate or LIBOR. An FRN will pay interest at LIBOR plus a quoted margin (or spread). The interest rate is fixed for a one-,  three or six-month period and is reset in line with the LIBOR fixing at the end of the interest period.
- In theory,  on the coupon reset date,  an FRN will be priced precisely at par. Between reset dates it will trade very close to par because of the way in which the coupon is reset. If market rates rise between reset dates,  an FRN will trade slightly below par; similarly,  if rates fall,  the paper will trade slightly above. (Note that changes in the credit quality of the issuer,  exemplified by a downgrade in credit rating,  will impact the price severely in between coupon reset dates). This makes FRNs very similar in behavior to money market instruments traded on a yield basis,  although of course FRNs have much longer maturities. Investors can opt to view FRNs as essentially money market instruments or as alternatives to conventional bonds. For this reason,  one can use two approaches in analyzing FRNs. The first approach is known as the margin method. This calculates the difference between the return on an FRN and that on an equivalent money market security. There are two variations on this,  simple margin and discounted margin.
- The simple margin method is sometimes preferred because it does not require the forecasting of future interest rates and coupon values. Simple margin is defined as the average return on an FRN throughout its life compared with the reference interest rate. It has two components: a quoted margin either above or below the reference rate,  and a capital gain or loss element which is calculated under the assumption that the difference between the current price of the FRN and the maturity value is spread evenly over the remaining life of the bond. Simple margin uses the expression at (1.25).

$$% Equation 1.25
\text{Simple margin} = \frac{(M - P_d)}{(100 \times T)} + M_q$$

$$% Equation 1.26
A_{P_d} = P_d + (re + QM) \times \frac{N_{sc} \times 100}{365} - \frac{C}{2} \times 100$$

$$% Or the alternate form of 1.26
A_{P_d} = P_d + (re + QM) \times \frac{N_{sc} \times P_d}{365} - \frac{C}{2} \times 100$$

$$% Equation 1.27
P_d = \left\{ \frac{1}{\left[1 + \frac{1}{2}(re + DM)\right]^{\frac{\text{days}}{\text{year}}}} \right\} \times \left\{ \frac{C}{2} + \sum_{t=1}^{N-1} \left[ \frac{ (re^{*} + QM) \times 100 }{2} \right] \times \left[ \frac{1}{ \left[1 + \frac{1}{2}(re^{*} + DM)\right]^t} \right] + \frac{M}{\left[1 + \frac{1}{2}(re^{*} + DM)\right]^{N-1}} \right\}$$

| 30E/360 | All months are assumed to have 30 days,  resulting in a 360-day year. If the first date falls on the 31st,  it is changed to the 30th. If the second date falls on the 31st,  it is changed to the 1st and the month is increased by one. |
| 30E+/360 | All months are assumed to have 30 days,  resulting in a 360-day year. If the first date falls on the 31st,  it is changed to the 30th. If the second date falls on the 31st,  it is changed to the 30th. |

**Price-Yield Relation**

- As we increase the yield to maturity,  the price will decline in general.
- This is due to the fact that the dollar coupon on debt securities is fixed,  and therefore,  to compensate for the increases in yields in the market,  the price must fall.
- The prices fall as yields increase,  but the rate of drop in price actually goes down at higher yields.
- The **convex relationship** between price and yield to maturity of a debt security is an important feature in understanding how the value of debt security changes when rates in the market move.
- In deriving this relationship,  we have assumed that the T-note is a “bullet” security with no call feature.
- We will see later that the price-yield relationship is more complicated when there are call features.
- This is due to the fact that an investor holding a callable bond faces the risk that the bond may be called away by the issuer when interest rates go down or when the issuer’s credit rating improves,  or both.
- These circumstances will warrant the issuer to refinance the old (callable debt) with cheaper new debt.
- As a result,  a callable bond will not show the price increase in a regime of falling interest rates,  as shown in Figure 2.10.
- Instead,  a callable bond price will approach the call price as interest rates fall.
- When corporate bonds are callable,  the yield computations are computed assuming that the bond will be called on each call date and the highest of the resulting yields is reported as **yield to worst**.

## PRICE OF BOND PAYING SEMIANNUAL COUPONS

$B(0,  T)=\frac{C}{\left(1+\frac{y}{2}\right)}+\frac{C}{\left(1+\frac{y}{2}\right)^{2}}+\ldots+\frac{C+F}{\left(1+\frac{y}{2}\right)^{n}}$

  
## DOLLAR DURATION DV01

DV01 is short for "dollar value of a 01",  that is 1 basis point. More formally,  if we denote the change in the bond price by AB and the change in the yield by Ay then DV01 is defined as follows

$DV01 =-\frac{\Delta B}{10, 000 \times \Delta y}=-\frac{d B}{10, 000 \times d y}$

  
- The price sensitivity itself is not constant as yields change.
- We have thus calculated by how much the bond price changes when the yield changes by 1 basis point. It turns out that this sensitivity is the definition of the dollar duration or DV01 measure.
- Note that dollar duration or DV01 is the change in price in dollars,  not in percentage. The negative sign is there by convention to assume that DV01 is positive for most fixed income securities if which prices fall as yields rise. As we will see in later chapters,  DV01 is the equivalent of the delta,  one of the Greeks in option pricing,  which measures the sensitivity of an option to changes in the underlying,  for example. One of the advantages of DV01 over other measures of interest rate risk (such as modified duration) is that it is useful for fixed income instruments with zero present value at inception such as interest rate swaps.

  

## 7.1 DV01/PVBP OR PRICE RISK

- The risk of a bond is the change in its price due to changes in the interest rates in the market. DV01 or PVBP measures the price change in debt securities for a basis point (or 0.01%) change in interest rates. If $P$ is the price of the bond and y is its yield,  a measure of the bond’s risk is the change in its price for a change in its yield. This is denoted by the fi rst derivative of the bond price with respect to its yield,  or $dP/dy$.
- Roughly we are estimating the slope of the tangent to the price-yield relationship at a given yield
- We can compute DV01 by first calculating the price at half a basis point below the prevailing yield and then computing the price at half a basis point above the prevailing yield. We can then compute the difference between these two resulting prices and evaluate the DV01.
    - $\frac{d P}{d y}$ ﻿is just the DV01 of the bond.

## PV01

There are some standard bond market terms that are often used in swap markets. The present value of a basis point or PV01 is the present value of an annuity of $0.0001$ paid periodically at times $t_i$,  calculated using the proper LIBOR rates,  or the corresponding forward rates:

$PV01 =\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(0.01) \delta}{\sum_{j=1}^{i}\left(1+L_{t_{j}} \delta\right)}$

  

## A PRIMER ON DURATION AND INTEREST RATE RISK

## I. INTRODUCTION TO BOND DURATION

### DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

- The concept of bond duration was first introduced by Frederick Macaulay in 1938,  and thus it’s often referred to as Macaulay Duration. In its essence,  bond duration measures the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates,  acting as a critical tool for gauging interest rate risk.
- Mathematically,  bond duration is the weighted average time until a bond’s fixed cash flows are received. Each cash flow’s weight equals the present value of the cash flow divided by the bond’s current price. Consequently,  bond duration quantifies the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  which is essential to its valuation.
- Let’s consider a real-world example to illustrate the importance of bond duration. If you,  as an investor,  hold long-duration bonds and interest rates increase,  the market price of your bonds will decrease significantly. This is due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields (interest rates). A more significant decrease will be observed for long-duration bonds than short-duration ones,  given the same increase in interest rates.
    - Thus,  understanding bond duration can help investors mitigate interest rate risk. For instance,  if an investor anticipates an increase in interest rates,  they may choose to reduce their exposure to interest rate risk by shifting their portfolio towards bonds with shorter durations.
- Furthermore,  duration serves as a critical metric in duration-matching or immunization strategies used in portfolio management. These strategies involve structuring a portfolio so that the duration of its assets matches the duration of its liabilities,  thereby making the portfolio’s value less sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the context of a pension fund,  for instance,  this strategy would aim to match the duration of its bond investments (assets) with the duration of its future pension obligations (liabilities).
- In summary,  bond duration is not just a theoretical concept but a practical tool that can guide investment decisions and risk management strategies in the world of fixed-income securities. An understanding of bond duration can significantly enhance an investor’s ability to navigate the risks and opportunities in this space.

## MACAULAY DURATION AND MODIFIED DURATION

### MACAULAY DURATION

Macaulay Duration (often simply referred to as duration) provides a measure of the weighted average time until a bond’s fixed cash flows are received. It’s a time measure in years and,  as such,  it quantifies the timing of a bond’s cash flows. It’s essentially an average time period for the receipt of the bond’s cash flows,  with each cash flow time period being weighted by the present value of that cash flow as a proportion of the bond’s total present value.

Let’s delve into the mathematical formulation of Macaulay Duration for a more rigorous understanding:

Suppose a bond has _T_ periods until maturity,  and it makes a cash payment (or cash flow) of _Ct_ in each period _t_,  where _t_ ranges from 1 to _T_. The bond’s price _P_ is the present value of these cash flows,  discounted at the bond’s yield to maturity _y_:
$$P = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1+y)^t}$$
Where:
- _D_ is the Macaulay Duration
- _P_ is the bond’s current price
- _C_ is the cash flow (i.e.,  coupon payment or principal repayment) in period _t_
- _T_ is the bond’s term
- _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

The Macaulay Duration (D) is the weighted average of the time periods until the cash flows are received,  with the weights being the present value of the cash flow as a proportion of the bond’s price:
$$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{tC_t}{(1+y)^t}$$
To make this formulation more intuitive,  consider that the term $\frac{_tC_{t}}{(1 + y)^t}$ calculates the present value of the cash flow at time _t_,  and then weights it by the time period _t_. Summing up these weighted present values for all time periods and dividing by the bond’s price gives an average time period,  which is the Macaulay Duration.

Thus,  Macaulay Duration serves as a time measure that captures the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  reflecting both the bond’s term to maturity and the pattern of its cash flows. This measure is valuable for comparing bonds with different maturities and coupon rates,  providing an insight into the bond’s interest rate risk.

Macaulay duration of a debt security is its discounted-cash-fl ow-weighted time to receipt of all its promised cash flows divided by the price of security. In this sense,  the duration measures the average time taken by the security,  on a discounted basis,  to pay back the original investment: The longer the duration,  the greater the risk. In this sense,  the Macaulay duration can be measured in units of time
- Macaulay duration can also be interpreted as the price elasticity,  which is the percentage change in price for a percentage change in yield; in this sense,  the greater the duration of a security,  the greater the risk of the security.
    
    - This gives us the result that the Macaulay duration of a zero coupon bond is simply its time left to maturity. $$D=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{i C_{i}}{(1+y)^{i}}}{P}$$
    - One of the applications of this concept is in bond portfolio immunization: If we can fund liabilities with assets in such a way that their Macaulay durations are the same,  such a portfolio is immune from interest rate fluctuations. This is because the price elasticity of assets is the same as the price elasticity of liabilities. Hence their fluctuations cancel each other out.
    - Interpretation 7.2 ==Duration is the price elasticity of interest rates; duration is also the price elasticity,  which is the percentage change in price for a percentage change in yield.== Formally,  the elasticity measure of duration is referred to as the Macaulay duration and is represented as follows:
        
        $D=-\frac{\text{the percentage change in price of a bond}}{\text{the percentage change in the yield of the bond}}$
        
    
    $D=\frac{-\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{\frac{d(1+y)}{(1+y)}}=-\frac{\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{d y}(1+y)$
    
- The negative sign is just a reminder that prices and yields move in opposite directions. We take the percentage change in price of a bond,  denoted by dP P,  and then divide that quantity by the percentage change in the yield of the bond,  denoted by dy 1 y .
    
    $D=-\frac{d P}{d y} \times \frac{1}{P}(1+y)$
    
- $\frac{d P}{d y}$﻿is just the DV01 of the bond.
- With semiannual compounding,  sometimes the following convention is also used:
    
    $D=-\frac{d P}{d y} \times \frac{1}{P}(1+\frac{y}{2})$
    
    - _Note that we are not measuring the change in interest rates but the percentage change in interest rates_
## MODIFIED DURATION

While Macaulay Duration provides insight into the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  it’s the Modified Duration that directly measures a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Modified Duration is a derivative of the yield to maturity function of the bond price and is usually stated as a percentage change in price for each percentage point change in yield.

Modified Duration is a measure that reflects a bond’s sensitivity to changes in yield or interest rates. It is an extension of the concept of Macaulay Duration and offers an estimate of the percentage price change for a bond given a change in yield.

The mathematical derivation of Modified Duration is as follows:

Firstly,  recall the Macaulay Duration (D),  which is the weighted average time until a bond’s cash flows are received:
$$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{tC_t}{(1+y)^t}$$

Modified Duration (MD) is obtained by adjusting the Macaulay Duration by the factor of (1 + _y_):
$$ MD = \frac{D}{1+y}$$
Where:
- _MD_ is the Modified Duration
- _D_ is the Macaulay Duration
- _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

This adjustment transforms the time measure of Macaulay Duration into a measure of a bond’s price volatility due to changes in yield. For small changes in yield,  the percentage price change of a bond is approximately equal to the negative of the modified duration times the yield change. This relationship can be expressed as:
$$ΔP ≈  − MD ⋅ Δy$$

Where _ΔP_ is the change in price and _Δy_ is the change in yield. This equation tells us that a 1% increase in yield will result in approximately a MD% decrease in the bond’s price.

 ==Modified duration is the percentage change in price for a change in yield.== Modified duration is denoted as
    $$MD=- \frac{\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{d y}= \frac{DV01}{P}$$
    
- _The percentage change in the bond price is the modified duration multiplied by the change in its yield._ In other words,  the higher the modified duration of a bond,  the higher is its percentage change to a change in its yield.
$$\frac{dP}{P}=-MD \times dy$$

$$dP = -MD \times P \times dy$$
    
- 7.2.2 Properties of duration and PVBP The finding that the duration of a zero coupon bond is equal to its maturity means that the zero coupon bond is the most interest-rate-elastic security for a given maturity class. It is easy to verify that duration is generally increasing in maturity and decreasing in coupons and yield to maturity, 
- The duration of coupon bonds will be less than their maturity. Clearly,  as time passes,  duration will change. __________________________
Modified duration or D is a measure of interest rate sensitivity that focuses on the percentage change in the value of an asset in response to a unit change in yields $$D_{\text {modified }}=-\frac{1}{P} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta y}=-\frac{1}{P} \frac{d B}{d y}$$
$$=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{P}\left[\frac{C}{(1+y)} \times 1+\frac{C}{(1+y)} \times 2+\ldots+\frac{C+F}{(1+y)^{\top}} \times T\right]$$
$$=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{\text{Sum of PV of CF}} \sum_{t=1}^{T}t \times P V\left(C F_{t}\right)=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{B} \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \times P V\left(C F_{t}\right)$$

- The above equation nicely illustrates that duration is linked to the average time to maturity of the cash flows ($CF_t$﻿) embedded in the bond. Specifically,  it is related to the weighted average where each time to maturity is weighted by the present value of a given cash flow relative to the bond price (which itself is the sum of the present value of all cash flows)

Modified Duration thus serves as a measure of a bond’s interest rate sensitivity. It estimates the percentage price change of a bond for a 1% change in yield. For example,  a bond with a higher Modified Duration is more sensitive to interest rate changes than a bond with a lower Modified Duration. This sensitivity is of practical importance to bond investors as it allows them to assess potential price changes due to yield fluctuations and thereby manage interest rate risk effectively.

The following table provides a comparative overview of Macaulay Duration and Modified Duration for various types of bonds:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Bond Type|Macaulay Duration|Modified Duration|
|Zero-Coupon Bond|Equal to the bond’s term to maturity|Less than the bond’s term to maturity|
|Coupon Bond|Less than the bond’s term to maturity|Less than Macaulay Duration|
|Perpetual Bond|Dependent on the bond’s coupon rate|Dependent on the bond’s coupon rate|

The primary use of Modified Duration in financial analysis is for estimating the effect of interest rate changes on a bond’s price. It allows investors and portfolio managers to assess interest rate risk and plan accordingly.

In summary,  Modified Duration is an effective measure of a bond’s interest rate risk. While Macaulay Duration provides an insight into the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  Modified Duration goes a step further and quantifies the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in yield. For bond investors,  understanding both measures is crucial for making informed investment decisions and managing interest rate risk effectively.
.

## DURATION AS A MEASURE OF BOND PRICE VOLATILITY

Duration,  both Macaulay and Modified,  is an essential tool in understanding the volatility of bond prices in response to changes in interest rates. Modified duration,  in particular,  gives an estimate of the percentage change in the price of a bond for a 1% change in interest rates,  which directly measures the bond’s price volatility.

Bonds with longer durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes and,  therefore,  are more volatile than bonds with shorter durations. This relationship between duration and volatility is crucial for investors in managing their portfolios effectively. By analyzing duration,  investors can estimate how much the price of a bond or a bond portfolio will change given an expected change in interest rates. This analysis can inform their decisions regarding which bonds to purchase or sell.

## DURATION MATCHING FOR LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

Institutional investors,  such as pension funds and insurance companies,  often have long-term liabilities. To manage these liabilities efficiently,  they employ a technique known as duration matching or immunization.

Duration matching involves aligning the duration of an institution’s assets (i.e.,  its bond investments) with the duration of its liabilities (i.e.,  its future cash outflows). This approach ensures that changes in the interest rates will have an equal effect on the institution’s assets and liabilities,  thus reducing the risk that the institution will be unable to meet its liabilities.

For example,  if a pension fund has liabilities that must be paid in 15 years,  it could invest in bonds with a duration of 15 years. By doing this,  if interest rates rise,  the increase in the present value of liabilities (which would make them more expensive to pay off) is offset by the rise in the value of the bond investments.

The benefits of duration matching include risk reduction and predictability of returns. However,  the drawbacks may include less potential for higher returns since duration matching often requires investing in bonds with lower yields. Moreover,  it requires a continual rebalancing of the portfolio as interest rates change and as time passes,  which might be costly and complex.

## THE LIMITATIONS OF BOND DURATION

While duration is a valuable tool in bond analysis and portfolio management,  it is not without limitations:

1. **Linear approximation:** Duration provides a linear approximation of the price-yield relationship and assumes that interest rate changes are small. For larger changes in interest rates,  this approximation may not hold,  and the actual price change may differ significantly from the duration estimate. Convexity adjustment can address this limitation to some extent,  but it may still not fully capture the nonlinear price-yield relationship for very large yield changes.
2. **Assumption of constant yield:** Duration calculations assume a parallel shift in the yield curve,  meaning it assumes that all interest rates move by the same amount. In reality,  changes in interest rates can be non-parallel,  meaning different maturities may experience different yield changes.
3. **Reinvestment risk:** Duration measures do not take into account the reinvestment risk,  which is the risk that future coupon payments will have to be reinvested at a lower rate if interest rates fall.
4. **Lack of credit risk consideration:** Duration does not factor in the impact of changes in credit quality on bond prices. If the issuer’s creditworthiness declines,  the bond’s price could drop irrespective of interest rate changes.

In conclusion,  while duration and convexity are powerful tools in assessing interest rate risk,  they should not be used in isolation. A comprehensive risk analysis should also include considerations of credit risk,  liquidity risk,  and reinvestment risk,  among others.

## DURATION

Modified duration or D is a measure of interest rate sensitivity that focuses on the percentage change in the value of an asset in response to a unit change in yields $$D_{\text {modified }}=-\frac{1}{P} \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta y}=-\frac{1}{P} \frac{d B}{d y}$$
$$=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{P}\left[\frac{C}{(1+y)} \times 1+\frac{C}{(1+y)} \times 2+\ldots+\frac{C+F}{(1+y)^{\top}} \times T\right]$$
$$=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{\text{Sum of PV of CF}} \sum_{t=1}^{T}t \times P V\left(C F_{t}\right)=\frac{1}{1+y} \times \frac{1}{B} \sum_{t=1}^{T} t \times P V\left(C F_{t}\right)$$

- The above equation nicely illustrates that duration is linked to the average time to maturity of the cash flows ($CF_t$﻿) embedded in the bond. Specifically,  it is related to the weighted average where each time to maturity is weighted by the present value of a given cash flow relative to the bond price (which itself is the sum of the present value of all cash flows)

- Macaulay duration of a debt security is its discounted-cash-fl ow-weighted time to receipt of all its promised cash flows divided by the price of security. In this sense,  the duration measures the average time taken by the security,  on a discounted basis,  to pay back the original investment: The longer the duration,  the greater the risk. In this sense,  the Macaulay duration can be measured in units of time
- Macaulay duration can also be interpreted as the price elasticity,  which is the percentage change in price for a percentage change in yield; in this sense,  the greater the duration of a security,  the greater the risk of the security.
    
    - This gives us the result that the Macaulay duration of a zero coupon bond is simply its time left to maturity. $$D=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{i C_{i}}{(1+y)^{i}}}{P}$$
    - One of the applications of this concept is in bond portfolio immunization: If we can fund liabilities with assets in such a way that their Macaulay durations are the same,  such a portfolio is immune from interest rate fluctuations. This is because the price elasticity of assets is the same as the price elasticity of liabilities. Hence their fluctuations cancel each other out.
    - Interpretation 7.2 ==Duration is the price elasticity of interest rates; duration is also the price elasticity,  which is the percentage change in price for a percentage change in yield.== Formally,  the elasticity measure of duration is referred to as the Macaulay duration and is represented as follows:
        
        $D=-\frac{\text{the percentage change in price of a bond}}{\text{the percentage change in the yield of the bond}}$
        
    
    $D=\frac{-\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{\frac{d(1+y)}{(1+y)}}=-\frac{\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{d y}(1+y)$
    
- The negative sign is just a reminder that prices and yields move in opposite directions. We take the percentage change in price of a bond,  denoted by dP P,  and then divide that quantity by the percentage change in the yield of the bond,  denoted by dy 1 y .
    
    $D=-\frac{d P}{d y} \times \frac{1}{P}(1+y)$
    
- $\frac{d P}{d y}$﻿is just the DV01 of the bond.
- With semiannual compounding,  sometimes the following convention is also used:
    
    $D=-\frac{d P}{d y} \times \frac{1}{P}(1+\frac{y}{2})$
    
    - _Note that we are not measuring the change in interest rates but the percentage change in interest rates_
- Another related measure is modified duration (MD). ==Modified duration is the percentage change in price for a change in yield.== Modified duration is denoted as
    
    $MD=- \frac{\left(\frac{d P}{p}\right)}{d y}= \frac{DV01}{P}$
    
- _The percentage change in the bond price is the modified duration multiplied by the change in its yield._ In other words,  the higher the modified duration of a bond,  the higher is its percentage change to a change in its yield.
    
    $\frac{dP}{P}=-MD \times dy$
    
    $dP = -MD \times P \times dy$
    
- 7.2.2 Properties of duration and PVBP The finding that the duration of a zero coupon bond is equal to its maturity means that the zero coupon bond is the most interest-rate-elastic security for a given maturity class. It is easy to verify that duration is generally increasing in maturity and decreasing in coupons and yield to maturity, 
- The duration of coupon bonds will be less than their maturity. Clearly,  as time passes,  duration will change. __________________________

## CONVEXITY

As we saw in the context of the DV01 measure,  the sensitivity of bond prices to yields is not constant but changes with the level of yields. This sensitivity is measured by convexity and captures the curvature of the bond-yield relationship. Duration is based on the first derivative and convexity is based on the second derivative of the price-yield curve. Convexity is defined as

$Convexity =\frac{1}{B} \frac{d^{2} B}{\partial y^{2}}=\frac{1}{B \times(1+y)^{2}} \sum_{t=1}^{T}\left[\frac{CF_{t}}{(1+y)^{t}}\left(t^{2}+t\right)\right]$

Bonds with greater curvature gain more in price when yields fall than they lose when yields rise. For noncallable bonds,  convexity is positive. In other words,  the slope increases and becomes less negative as yields increase.

Convexity is another essential concept in bond analysis that complements duration. It measures the curvature or the degree of the curve in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields. It provides a more accurate estimation of bond price changes when there are substantial changes in interest rates.

While duration provides a linear estimate of price changes for small yield changes,  convexity takes into account that the price-yield relationship is not linear but curved. As a result,  for larger yield changes,  an adjustment for convexity is necessary to obtain more accurate price estimates.

Mathematically,  the convexity of a bond can be calculated using the following formula:
$$ \text{Convexity} = \frac{1}{P*(1+y)^2} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t*(t+1)*C_t}{(1+y)^t} $$

Where:
- Convexity is the measure of the bond’s convexity
- _P_ is the bond’s current price
- _C_ is the cash flow (i.e.,  coupon payment or principal repayment) in period _t_
- _T_ is the bond’s term
- _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

The higher the convexity,  the more curved the price-yield relationship is. A bond with a higher convexity will have a higher price increase when interest rates fall,  and a smaller price decrease when interest rates rise,  compared to a bond with a lower convexity. This property makes higher convexity bonds more attractive to investors as they provide more potential for capital gains and less potential for capital losses.

In summary,  duration and convexity are two critical measures in bond analysis. While duration provides an estimate of a bond’s price sensitivity to small changes in yield,  convexity adjusts this estimate for larger yield changes and provides a more accurate price estimate. By understanding these measures,  investors can better manage their bond investments and their interest rate risk.

## IMMUNIZATION

- The PVBP of a portfolio is simply the par value-weighted PVBP of individual securities in the portfolio.
- Hedging fixed income portfolios against interest rate risk fluctuations is called immunization. Immunization strategies can be based on duration. The duration of a portfolio is the weighted average of the duration of the portfolio constituents. Thus,  a portfolio of two bonds A and B has a duration $D_p$﻿:

$D_P = w \times D_A + (1-w)D_B$

- The above equation can also be used to calculate the optimal weights for an immunized portfolio. Asset A could be a bond and asset B could be another bond or a bond futures. To immunize the portfolio we would want to calculate the weights w and (1 - w) that set the portfolio duration $D_P$ to zero.

# 30/360 AND 30E/360 DAY COUNT CONVENTIONS

- There are two conventions for calculating 30/360 days. Most Eurobonds and swaps use 30 E/360,  while most US corporate bonds use 30/360. The difference is in going across the end of a 31-day month:

|  | 30E/360 | 30/360 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 28-Jul+30-Jul | 2 | 2 |
| 28-Jul+31-Jul | 2 | 3 |
| 28 1 -Aug | 3 | 3 |
| 3 1 -Jul | 0 | 0 |
        
- The calculation of the two conventions is done by writing a date as yyyy mm dd (e.. g 1991 08 25 for 25aug-1991),  with the conventions:

|   |   |
    |---|---|
    |30E/360|IF ($dd_i$﻿ = 31) THEN $dd_i $﻿= 30|
    ||DAYS BETWEEN = 360 * ($yyyy_1$﻿ – $yyyy_2$﻿) + 30 *($mm_1$﻿ – $mm_2$﻿) + ($dd_1 $﻿– $dd_2$﻿)|
    |30/360|IF ($dd_1 $﻿= 31) THEN $dd_1$﻿ = 30|
    ||IF ($dd_2$﻿ = 31 AND $dd_1$﻿ = 30 or 31) THEN $dd_2$﻿ = 30|
    ||DAYS BETWEEN = 360 * ($yyyy_1$﻿ – $yyyy_2$﻿) + 30 *($mm_1$﻿ – $mm_2$﻿) + ($dd_1 $﻿– $dd_2$﻿)|

### **SECTION 2.2: COMPOUNDING AND YIELD CONVENTIONS**

- For a bond with annual coupons and principal payment,  the yield (y) is the discount rate which solves the following equation for price equal to principal (100):

$[PV(y)=\frac{\text{coup}}{1+y}+\frac{\text{coup}}{(1+y)^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{\text{coup}}{(1+y)^{n-1}}+\frac{100+\text{coup}}{(1+y)^{n}}]$

- If a bond pays coupons more than once per year,  the present value of a bond with (p) payments per year (p):

$[PV(y)=\frac{\left(\frac{\text{coupon}}{p}\right)}{\left(1+\frac{y}{p}\right)^{x}}]$

- The resulting yield is annually compounded for (p=1),  semi-annually compounded for (p=2),  quarterly compounded for (p=4),  and monthly compounded for (p=12).

- As a general procedure to convert risk from one basis to another
$$BPV_{sab} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial y_{sab}} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial y_{ab}} * \frac{dy_{ab}}{dy_{sab}} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial y_{ab}} * (1 + \frac{y_{sab}}{2})$$

- To further complicate matters,  yields for short-dated bonds (with less than one coupon period to maturity) are generally quoted on a simple interest basis.
- That is,  the yield-to-price formula is simplified to:
$$PV(y) = (100 + [\frac{coup}{p}])/ (1+ y * x)$$

- (i.e. discounting by $(1+y*x)$ rather than $(1+y/p)x$.
- This makes the quoted yield not directly comparable to the compounded yield of a bond with more than one coupon period to go,  but does make the yield somewhat more comparable with money-market instruments which are quoted on a simple interest basis.

### **SECTION 2.3: RISK AND CONVEXITY**

- Risk,  BPV,  and DV01 were introduced above as the derivative of price with respect to yield:
	 - (3.6a) Risk = - (\frac{\partial PV(y)}{\partial y}).
- The derivative of a function is just the slope of the curve,  so the risk is just the slope of the PV function.
- Figure 3.5 shows the PV as a function of yield for a hypothetical bond. The slope (i.e. the risk) is shown at two points,  when the yield is 3% and when the yield is 10%.
- Clearly the slope,  and thus the risk,  changes as the level of yields changes.
- For the bond displayed in figure 3.5 the risk (slope) changes as the yield changes.
- The second derivative of a function measures how fast the slope changes,  and for the bond in figure 3.5 the second derivative is moderately high.
- In the bond markets,  this second derivative is called convexity.
- The exact definition of convexity varies somewhat (corresponding to the various definitions of BPV and duration),  but we will use the second derivative:
	 - (3.7)$$Convexity = (\frac{\partial^2PV(y)}{\partial y^2})$$.
- To calculate convexity we can simply re-calculate the PV function with a higher and lower yield:
- We previously introduced Risk,  BPV,  and DV01 as the derivative of price with respect to yield:
	 - (3.6a)$$Risk = - ∂PV(y) / ∂y$$
	 - The derivative of a function is just the slope of the curve,  so the risk is just the slope of the PV function.
	 - Figure 3.5 shows the PV as a function of yield for a hypothetical bond. The slope (i.e. the risk) is shown at two points,  when the yield is 3% and when the yield is 10%.
	 - It is clear that the slope,  and thus the risk,  changes as the level of yields changes.
- For the bond displayed in figure 3.5 the risk (slope) changes as the yield changes.
	 - The second derivative of a function measures how fast the slope changes,  and for the bond in figure 3.5 the second derivative is moderately high.
	 - In the bond markets,  this second derivative is called convexity.
	 - The exact definition of convexity varies somewhat (corresponding to the various definitions of BPV and duration),  but we will use the second derivative:
		  - (3.7)$$Convexity = ∂^2PV(y) / ∂y2$$
- To calculate convexity we can simply re-calculate the PV function with a higher and lower yield



### **SECTION 3.6: PRICING BONDS IN TERMS OF YIELD**

- We know that bonds are typically quoted in yield terms,  and we can express the price of a bond as a function of yield.
- The formula to calculate the present value (PV) of a bond with respect to yield (y),  the number of periods till maturity (x),  the coupon payments and the number of payments per year (p) is:
$$PV(y)=\frac{\left(\frac{\text { coupon }}{p}\right)}{\left(1+\frac{y}{p}\right)^{x}}$$
- The resulting yield is annually compounded for p=1,  semi-annually compounded for p=2,  quarterly compounded for p=4,  and monthly compounded for p=12.
﻿

$A_i=\left[\frac{\text{FV}* i_c}{f}\right] \left[\sum , \frac{\text{NA}_i}{\text{NL}_i}\right]$

$P_d=\frac{\text{FV} \left(i_c \left(\left(\frac{y+2}{2}\right)^n-1\right)+y\right) \left(\frac{y+2}{2}\right)^{\text{DCS}/\text{DIC}-n}}{y}$

- P_d = price
- FV = face value
- y= annual yield
- n= remaining coupons payable to maturity
- DCS =days from last coupon to settlement
- DIC= days in coupon period containing settlement
- A_i = accrued interest
- $i_c$﻿ = coupon rate
- f = coupon frequency
- NA_i = number of accrued days for the ith quasi-coupon period within odd period
- NL_i = normal length in days of the ith quasi-coupon period within odd period

### **SECTION 5.2: YIELD CURVES**

- A yield curve plots the yields of bonds with the same credit quality but different maturities.
	 - Typically,  yield curves are upward sloping - longer maturity bonds have higher yields.
		  - This is because investors demand a higher return for locking up their money for a longer period of time (term premium).
	 - However,  yield curves can also be flat or downward sloping (inverted).
		  - An inverted yield curve is often seen as a predictor of economic recession.


### **SECTION 5.3: TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES**

- The term structure of interest rates refers to the relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities.
	 - This relationship is often depicted through a yield curve.
- The term structure can be explained by three main theories:
	 1. **Expectations Theory:** Long-term rates are an average of expected future short-term rates.
	 2. **Liquidity Preference Theory:** Investors demand a premium for longer maturities (term premium),  leading to an upward sloping yield curve.
	 3. **Market Segmentation Theory:** Different investors have preferences for different maturities,  segmenting the market and determining the shape of the yield curve.

### **EXAMPLE 5.2: TERM STRUCTURE THEORIES**

- Using the yield curve from Example 5.1,  we can illustrate these theories.
	 - **Expectations Theory:** If we believe this theory,  the upward slope means that the market expects short-term rates to increase in the future.
	 - **Liquidity Preference Theory:** The upward slope could also be interpreted as a term premium for longer maturities.
	 - **Market Segmentation Theory:** The shape of the yield curve could be determined by the supply and demand for different maturities. For example,  if there is a high demand for short-term bonds,  their yields could be lower,  leading to an upward sloping yield curve.



3. Dirty and Clean Bond Pricing
   - Bonds can be priced including accrued interest (dirty price) or excluding accrued interest (clean price).
   - Dirty Price Calculation:
     $$\text{Dirty Price} = \text{Clean Price} + \text{Accrued Interest}$$
## DAY COUNT CONVENTIONS
1. Actual/Actual (US Treasuries)
   - The actual number of days in the coupon period divided by the actual number of days in the year.
2. 30/360 (Corporate Bonds,  European Bonds)
   - Assumes 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year for every period
3. Actual/360 (Money Market Instruments)
   - Actual number of days in the coupon period divided by 360.
4. Actual/365 Fixed (UK Government Bonds)
   - Actual number of days in the coupon period divided by 365.
- Day Count Calculation:
$$\text{Day Count Fraction (DCF)} = \frac{\text{Actual Number of Days in Period}}{\text{Day Count Basis}}$$
## PRICING BONDS BETWEEN COUPON DATES

1. Calculate Accrued Interest:
   - Accrued interest is interest earned on a bond since the last coupon payment. $$\text{Accrued Interest} = \frac{\text{Coupon Rate}}{\text{Coupon Frequency}} \times \frac{\text{Number of Days Since Last Coupon}}{\text{Days in Coupon Period}}$$
2. Calculate Full Price (Dirty Price):
   - This is the price of the bond including the accrued interest.
   $$\text{Dirty Price} = \text{Clean Price} + \text{Accrued Interest}$$

  The price actually paid to buy or sell the bond is the dirty price which includes the accrued interest.
	 - To induce someone to sell the bond you must compensate them for the fact that they have held the bond for part of the coupon period,  but in selling the bond will not receive any of the next coupon.
	 - The PV or dirty price includes this component of the price (the accrued interest),  but it is more convenient to strip the accrued out when quoting prices in the market.
- To measure interest rate risk we want to know how the price changes as yields change. We can use these equations to measure this risk simply by calculating the price at a higher yield and directly measuring how much the price changes. This leads defining risk as the change in price with a change in yield: To actually measure this we can simply re-calculate the PV function with a higher and lower yield:

$\text{Risk}= -\frac{\delta PV(y)}{\delta y}= \frac{\left[PV(y-h)-PV(y+h) \right]}{2h}$


 - BPV is the change in price for a$100 notional bond,  in response to a change in yields of 100 bp.
 - In finance,  basis point value (BPV) denotes the change in the price of a bond given a basis point change in the yield of the bond.
	  - Basis point value tells us how much money the positions will gain or lose for a 0.01% per annum parallel (i.e. uniform at all durations) movement in the yield curve.
	  - It is specified for interest rate risk and quantifies the interest rate risk for small changes in interest rates. The basis point value of a bond is roughly proportional to its duration.

## CALLABLE BOND PRICING

1. Definition of Variables
   - Let $B$ represent the clean price of a callable bond.
   - Let $C$ represent the coupon payment.
   - Let $F$ represent the redemption value (face value) of the bond.
   - Let $r$ represent the discount rate for each period.
   - Let $t$ represent the time period until maturity.
   - Let $T$ represent the total number of periods until maturity.
   - Let $R$ represent the call price of the bond.
   - Let $T_c$ represent the time period at which the bond can be called.
   - Let $r_c$ represent the discount rate after the bond is callable.
2. Present Value of a Non-callable Bond
   - The clean price of the non-callable bond can be expressed as:  $$ P = \sum_{t=1}^{T_c-1} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \sum_{t=T_c}^{T} \frac{C}{(1 + r_c)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r_c)^{T}}$$
3. Present Value of Callable Bond Payoffs
   - The callable bond will be redeemed at time $T_c$ if it is optimal to do so; otherwise,  it pays coupons until maturity.
   $$B = \min\left
   
   (\sum_{t=1}^{T_c-1} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{R}{(1 + r)^{T_c}},  \quad P \right)$$

4. Complete Pricing Formula for Callable Bond
$$B = \min\left( \sum_{t=1}^{T_c-1} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{R}{(1 + r)^{T_c}},  \quad \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C}{(1 + r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1 + r)^{T}} \right)$$

  

Here's a breakdown of the formula:

- The first part inside the $\min$ function calculates the present value of the bond if it is called at the call date $T_c$. This includes the present value of coupon payments until $T_c - 1$ and the call price $R$ discounted back to the present at the yield $r$.
- The second part calculates the present value of the bond if it is held to maturity time $T$. This includes the present value of all coupon payments $C$ and the face value $F$,  both discounted at the yield $r$
- The $\min$ function is used because the bond will be called if and only if it is beneficial for the issuer,  typically when the market rate $r$ falls below the coupon rate,  making refinancing attractive. 
   - The callable bond price takes the smaller value between the price if called at $T_c$ and the price if not called until maturity.
   - By combining the above,  the pricing for a callable bond can be expressed as
   - The callable bond price takes the smaller value between the price if called at $T_c$ and the price if not called until maturity.

  Pricing a Callable Bond A callable bond gives the issuer the right to redeem the bond prior to maturity. This option impacts the price.
To derive the price,  we model the callable bond as a portfolio of:
Straight bond
Issuer short a call option on the bond
First we define relevant variables:
- $P$: Price of callable bond
- $VB$: Price of straight bond
- $VC$: Price of call option
- $K$: Strike price (redemption price)
- $r$: Annual continuously-compounded interest rate
- $T$: Years until maturity
- $\tau$: Years until first call date
Steps to Derive Price
 Write payoff of callable bond at maturity $T$ as a piecewise function:
$$

Payoff = \begin{cases}
K & \text{if called}\\
VB & \text{if not called}

\end{cases}

$$Take expectation under risk-neutral measure Discount at rate$r$
 Apply put-call parity:$VC = VB - P + PV(K)$
 Substitute into payoff function
 Simplify to get final price formula:

$

$P = VB - VC$$Therefore,  the full derivation of the callable bond price formula is:

$

$P = e^{-rT}E^\mathbb{Q}[Payoff]$$

$

$= e^{-rT}[K \times \mathbb{Q}(\text{called}) + VB \times \mathbb{Q}(\text{not called})]$$

$

$= e^{-rT}[K \times \mathbb{Q}_{called} + (P - VC + PV(K)) \times (1 - \mathbb{Q}_{called})]$$

$

$= e^{-rT}[K \times \mathbb{Q}_{called} + P - VC + PV(K) - P\mathbb{Q}(\text{called}) + VC\mathbb{Q}_{called}]$$

$$
P = VB - VC$$  
This shows the callable bond price equals the straight bond price minus the call option value. The full derivation requires modeling the probability of calling to value$VC$.

+ The price actually paid to buy or sell the bond is the dirty price which includes the accrued interest.
	 + To induce someone to sell the bond you must compensate them for the fact that they have held the bond for part of the coupon period,  but in selling the bond will not receive any of the next coupon.
	 + The PV or dirty price includes this component of the price (the accrued interest),  but it is more convenient to strip the accrued out when quoting prices in the market.
+ To measure interest rate risk we want to know how the price changes as yields change. We can use these equations to measure this risk simply by calculating the price at a higher yield and directly measuring how much the price changes. This leads defining risk as the change in price with a change in yield: To actually measure this we can simply re-calculate the PV function with a higher and lower yield:

$\text{Risk}= -\frac{\delta PV(y)}{\delta y}= \frac{\left[PV(y-h)-PV(y+h) \right]}{2h}$

	 - BPV is the change in price for a$100 notional bond,  in response to a change in yields of 100 bp.
	 - In finance,  basis point value (BPV) denotes the change in the price of a bond given a basis point change in the yield of the bond.
		  - Basis point value tells us how much money the positions will gain or lose for a 0.01% per annum parallel (i.e. uniform at all durations) movement in the yield curve.
		  - It is specified for interest rate risk and quantifies the interest rate risk for small changes in interest rates. The basis point value of a bond is roughly proportional to its duration.

**CONVENTIONAL YIELD MEASURES**

+ An investor who purchases a bond can expect to receive a dollar return from one or more of the following sources:
	 + The coupon interest payments made by the issuer
	 + Any capital gain (or capital loss—negative dollar return) when the bond matures,  is called,  or is sold
	 + Income from reinvestment of the coupon interest payments
+ This last source of dollar return is referred to as interest-on-interest. Three yield measures are commonly cited by market participants to measure the potential return from investing in a bond—current yield,  yield-to-maturity,  and yield-to-call. These yield measures are expressed as a percent return rather than as a dollar return. However,  any yield measure should consider each of the three potential sources of return just cited. Below we discuss these three yield measures and assess whether they consider the three sources of potential return.

## CURRENT YIELD

+ The current yield relates the annual coupon interest to the market price. The formula for the current yield is

$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{annual dollar coupon interest}}{\text{price}}$

	 - The current yield considers only the coupon interest and no other source of return that will affect an investor’s return. For example,  in Illustration 6,  no consideration is given to the capital gain that the investor will realize when the bond matures. No recognition is given to a capital loss that the investor will realize when a bond selling at a premium matures. In addition,  interest-on-interest from reinvesting coupon payments is ignored.

### ILLUSTRATION 6

+ The current yield for an 18-year,  6% coupon bond selling for$700.89 per$1, 000 par value is 8.56%,  as shown below:
	 + $\mathrm{\text{Current\ Yield}} = \frac{\mathrm{\text{annual\ dollar\ coupon\ interest}}}{\mathrm{\text{price}}}$﻿
	 + Annual dollar coupon interest = $1000 * 0.06 = $60
	 + $\mathrm{\text{Current\ Yield}} = \frac{\$60}{\$700.89} = 0.0856 = 8.56\%$﻿

## YIELD-TO-MATURITY

+ The yield or internal rate of return on any investment is the interest rate that will make the present value of the cash flows equal to the price (or initial investment). 6 The yield-to-maturity is computed in the same way as the yield; the cash flows are those which the investor would realize by holding the bond to maturity. For a semiannualpay bond,  doubling the interest rate or discount rate gives the yield-to-maturity.

### REINVESTMENT RISK

+ The investor will realize the yield-to-maturity stated at the time of purchase only if
	 + (1) the coupon payments can be reinvested at the yield-to-maturity and
	 + (2) if the bond is held to maturity. With respect to the first assumption,  the risk that an investor faces is that future reinvestment rates will be less than the yield-to-maturity at the time the bond is purchased.
	 + This risk is referred to as reinvestment risk.
+ There are two characteristics of a bond that determine the degree of reinvestment risk.
	 + First,  for a given yield-to-maturity and a given coupon rate,  the longer the maturity,  the more the bond’s total dollar return is dependent on the interest-on-interest to realize the yield-to-maturity at the time of purchase. That is,  the greater the reinvestment risk.
		  + `The implication is that the yield-to-maturity measure for long-term coupon bonds tells little about the potential yield that an investor may realize if the bond is held to maturity. In high-interest-rate environments,  the interest-on-interest component for long-term bonds may be as high as 80% of the bond’s potential total dollar return.
	 + The second characteristic that determines the degree of reinvestment risk is the coupon rate. For a given maturity and a given yield-to-maturity,  the higher the coupon rate,  the more dependent the bond’s total dollar return will be on the reinvestment of the coupon payments in order to produce the yield-to-maturity at the time of purchase.
		  + This means that holding maturity and yield-to-maturity constant,  premium bonds will be more dependent on interest-on-interest than bonds selling at par.  
				- For zero-coupon bonds,  none of the bond’s total dollar return is dependent on interest-on-interest; a zero-coupon bond carries no reinvestment risk if held to maturity.

### INTEREST-RATE RISK

+ If the bond is not held to maturity,  the price at which the bond may have to be sold is less than its purchase price,  resulting in a return that 1 s less than the yield-to-maturity. The risk that a bond will have to be sold at a loss because interest rates rises referred to as interest-rate risk.
+ Suppose that an investor who has a five-year investment horizon is considering the following four option-free bonds

	 ![[Untitled 7.png]]

+ An investor who selects bond Y because it offers the highest yield-to-maturity 1 s failing to recognize that the bond must be sold after five years,  and the selling price of the bond will depend on the yield required in the market for 10-year,  11% coupon bonds at that time. Hence there could be a capital gain or capital loss that will make the return higher or lower than the yieldto-maturity promised now. Moreover,  the higher coupon rate on bond Y relative to the other three bonds means that more of this bond’s return will be dependent on the reinvestment of coupon interest payments.

	 Bond W offers the second highest yield-to-maturity. On the surface,  it seems to be particularly attractive because it eliminates the problem faced by purchasing bond Y of realizing a possible capital loss when the bond must be sold before the maturity date. In addition,  the reinvestment risk seems to be less than for the other three bonds because the coupon rate is the lowest. However,  the investor would not be eliminating the reinvestment risk because after three years the investor must reinvest the proceeds received at maturity for two more years. The return that the investor will realize will depend on interest rates three years from now when the investor must roll over the proceeds received from the maturing bond.

+ Which is the best bond? The yield-to-maturity doesn’t seem to help us identify the best bond. The answer depends on the expectations of the investor. Specifically,  it depends on the interest rate at which the coupon interest payments can be reinvested until the end of the investor’s investment horizon. Also,  for bonds with a maturity longer than the investment horizon,  it depends on the investor’s expectations about interest rates at the end of the investment horizon. Consequently,  any of these bonds can be the best investment vehicle based on some reinvestment rate and some future interest rate at the end of the investment horizon

### YIELD-TO-MATURITY FOR A ZERO COUPON BOND

+ A zero-coupon bond is characterized by a single cash flow resulting from an investment. Consequently,  the following formula can be applied to compute the yield-to-maturity for a zero-coupon bond:  

$$y = (\text{future value per dollar invested})^{1/n} -1$$
  
 Where  
$y = \text{one-half the yield-to-maturity}$  
$\text{future value per dollar invested}=\frac{\text{maturity value}}{price}$﻿

 + Once again,  doubling y gives the yield-to-maturity. Remember that the number of periods used in the formula is double the number of years.
+ **Problem with the Annualizing Procedure**
	 + Multiplying a semiannual interest rate by 2 will give an underestimate of the effective annual yield. The proper way to annualize the semiannual yield is by applying the following formula:  

$$\text{effective annual yield} =\left (1+ \text{periodic interest rate} \right)^k -1$$
  
 For a semiannual bond,   

$$\text{effective annual yield} =\left (1+ \text{periodic interest rate} \right)^k -1$$
  
 Where k = number of payments per year  

 Or$$\text{effective annual yield} =\left (1+ y \right)^k -1$$
﻿
+ Although the proper way for annualizing a semiannual interest rate is given in the preceding formula,  the convention adopted in the bond market is to double the semiannual interest rate. The yield-to-maturity computed in this manner—doubling the semiannual yield—is called a bond-equivalent yield.

### YIELD-TO-CALL

+ For a callable bond,  investors also compute another yield (or internal rate of return) measure,  the yield-to-call. The cash flows for computing the yield-to-call are those which would result if the issue were called on some assumed call date. Two commonly used call dates are the first call date and the first par call date.
	 + The yield-to-call is the interest rate that will make the present value of the cash flows if the bond is held to the assumed call date equal to the price of the bond (i.e.,  the full price).
+ According to the conventional approach,  conservative investors will compute the yield-to-call and yield-to-maturity for a callable bond selling at a premium,  selecting the lower of the two as a measure of potential return. It is the smaller of the two yield measures that investors would use to evaluate the yield for a bond. Some investors calculate not just the yield to the first call date and yield to first par call date but the yield to all possible call dates.
+ Because most bonds can be called at any time after the first call date,  the approach has been to compute the yield to every coupon anniversary date following the first call date. Then all calculated yields-to-call and the yield-to-maturity are compared. The lowest of these yields is called the yield-to-worst.
+ The yield-to-call does consider all three sources of potential return from owning a bond. However,  as in the case of the yield-tomaturity,  it assumes that all cash flows can be reinvested at the computed yield— in this case,  the yield-to-call—until the assumed call date. As we noted earlier in this chapter,  this assumption may be inappropriate. Moreover,  the yield-to-call assumes that
	 + (1) the investor will hold the bond to the assumed call date and
	 + (2) the 1 ssuer will call the bond on that date.
	 + The assumptions underlying the yield-to-call are often unrealistic. They do not take into account how an investor will reinvest the proceeds if the issue is called.
+ According to the conventional approach,  conservative investors will compute the yield-to-call and yield-to-maturity for a callable bond selling at a premium,  selecting the lower of the two as a measure of potential return. It is the smaller of the two yield measures that investors would use to evaluate the yield for a bond. Some investors calculate not just the yield to the first call date and yield to first par call date but the yield to all possible call dates
+ Because most bonds can be called at any time after the first call date,  the approach has been to compute the yield to every coupon anniversary date following the first call date. Then all calculated yields-to-call and the yield-to-maturity are compared. The lowest of these yields 1 s called the yield-to-worst.

### YIELD (INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN) FOR A PORTFOLIO

The yield for a portfolio of bonds is not simply the average or weighted average of the yield-to-maturity of the individual bond issues. It is computed by determining the cash flows for the portfolio and then finding the interest rate that will make the present value of the cash flows equal to the market value of the portfolio.’ As with any yield measure,  it suffers from the same assumptions.

### YIELD MEASURE FOR FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES

+ The coupon rate for a floating-rate security changes periodically based on some reference rate (such as LIBOR).” Because the value for the reference rate in the future 1 s not known,  it is not possible to determine the cash flows. This means that a yield-to-maturity cannot be calculated. A conventional measure used to estimate the potential return for a floating-rate security 1 s the security’s discount margin. This measure estimates the average spread or margin over the reference rate that the investor can expect to earn over the life of the security. The procedure for calculating the discount margin is as follows:
	 1. Determine the cash flows assuming that the reference rate does not change over the life of the security.
	 2. Select a margin (spread).
	 3. Discount the cash flows found in step 1 by the current value of the reference rate plus the margin selected in step 2.  
	 4. Compare the present value of the cash flows as calculated in step 3 to the price.
		  1. If the present value is equal to the security’s price,  the discount margin is the margin assumed in step 2.
		  2. If the present value is not equal to the security’s price,  go back to step 2 and try a different margin.  
	 5. For a security selling at par,  the discount margin is simply the spread over the reference rate.

### TOTAL RETURN ANALYSIS

+ If conventional yield measures such as the yield-to-maturity and yield-to-call offer little insight into the potential return of a bond,  what measure of return can be used? The proper measure is one that considers all three sources of potential dollar return over the investment horizon. This requires that an investor first project the total future dollars over an investment horizon. The return is then the interest rate that will make the bond’s price (full price) grow to the projected total future dollars at the end of the investment horizon. The yield computed in this way is known as the total return,  also referred to as the horizon return. In this section we explain this measure and demonstrate how it can be applied in assessing the potential return from investing in a bond.

### CALCULATING THE TOTAL RETURN

+ The total return requires that the investor specify
	 + An investment horizon
	 + A reinvestment rate
	 + A selling price for the bond at the end of the investment horizon (which depends on the assumed yield at which the bond will sell at the end of the investment horizon)
+ More formally,  the steps for computing a total return over some investment  
	 Horizon are as follows.

	 + Step 1: Compute the total coupon payments plus the interest-on-interest based on an assumed reinvestment rate. The reinvestment rate is onehalf the annual interest rate that the investor believes can be earned on the reinvestment of coupon interest payments.  
		  The total coupon payments plus interest-on-interest can be calculated using the formula for the future value of an annuity as shown

$\text{total coupon payments} + \text{interest-on-interest} = \text{semiannual coupon} \times \left[\frac{(1+r)^h-1}{r} \right]$

		  - Where h = length of the investment horizon (in semiannual periods)
		  - R = assumed semiannual reinvestment rate
	 - Step 2: Determine the projected sale price at the end of the investment horizon. The projected sale price will depend on the projected yield on comparable bonds at the end of the investment horizon.
	 - Step 3: Add the values computed in steps 1 and 2. The sum is the total future dollars that will be received from the investment given the assumed reinvestment rate and projected required yield at the end of the investment horizon.
	 - Step 4: To obtain the semiannual total return,  use the following formula:
		  
$\text{semiannual total return} =\left (\frac{\text{future dollar value} }{\text{purchase price of bond}} \right)^ {\frac{1}{h}}-1$

	 - Step 5: Because coupon interest is assumed to be paid semiannually,  double the interest rate found in step 4. The resulting interest rate is the total return expressed on a bond-equivalent basis. Alternatively,  the total return can be expressed on an effective annual interest rate basis by using the following formula:
	 
$\text{effective annual total return} =\left (1+ \text{semiannual total return} \right)^2 -1$﻿

Objections to the total return analysis cited by some portfolio managers are that it requires them to make assumptions about reinvestment rates and future yields and forces a portfolio manager to think in terms of an investment horizon. Unfortunately,  some portfolio managers find comfort in meaningless measures such as the yield-to-maturity because it is not necessary to incorporate any expectations. As explained below,  the total return framework enables the portfolio manager to analyze the performance of a bond based on different interest-rate scenarios for reinvestment rates and future market yields. By investigating multiple scenarios,  the portfolio manager can see how sensitive the bond’s performance is in each scenario. There is no need to assume that the reinvestment rate will be constant for the entire investment horizon

### YIELD MEASURE FOR FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES

The coupon rate for a floating-rate security changes periodically based on some reference rate (such as LIBOR).” Because the value for the reference rate in the future 1 s not known,  it is not possible to determine the cash flows.

This measure estimates the average spread or margin over the reference rate that the investor can expect to earn over the life of the security.

## I. INTRODUCTION TO BOND DURATION

### DEFINITION AND PURPOSE

+ The concept of bond duration was first introduced by Frederick Macaulay in 1938,  and thus it’s often referred to as Macaulay Duration. In its essence,  bond duration measures the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates,  acting as a critical tool for gauging interest rate risk.
+ Mathematically,  bond duration is the weighted average time until a bond’s fixed cash flows are received. Each cash flow’s weight equals the present value of the cash flow divided by the bond’s current price. Consequently,  bond duration quantifies the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  which is essential to its valuation.
+ Let’s consider a real-world example to illustrate the importance of bond duration. If you,  as an investor,  hold long-duration bonds and interest rates increase,  the market price of your bonds will decrease significantly. This is due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields (interest rates). A more significant decrease will be observed for long-duration bonds than short-duration ones,  given the same increase in interest rates.
	 + Thus,  understanding bond duration can help investors mitigate interest rate risk. For instance,  if an investor anticipates an increase in interest rates,  they may choose to reduce their exposure to interest rate risk by shifting their portfolio towards bonds with shorter durations.
+ Furthermore,  duration serves as a critical metric in duration-matching or immunization strategies used in portfolio management. These strategies involve structuring a portfolio so that the duration of its assets matches the duration of its liabilities,  thereby making the portfolio’s value less sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the context of a pension fund,  for instance,  this strategy would aim to match the duration of its bond investments (assets) with the duration of its future pension obligations (liabilities).
+ In summary,  bond duration is not just a theoretical concept but a practical tool that can guide investment decisions and risk management strategies in the world of fixed-income securities. An understanding of bond duration can significantly enhance an investor’s ability to navigate the risks and opportunities in this space.

## MACAULAY DURATION AND MODIFIED DURATION

### MACAULAY DURATION

Macaulay Duration (often simply referred to as duration) provides a measure of the weighted average time until a bond’s fixed cash flows are received. It’s a time measure in years and,  as such,  it quantifies the timing of a bond’s cash flows. It’s essentially an average time period for the receipt of the bond’s cash flows,  with each cash flow time period being weighted by the present value of that cash flow as a proportion of the bond’s total present value.

Let’s delve into the mathematical formulation of Macaulay Duration for a more rigorous understanding:

Suppose a bond has _T_ periods until maturity,  and it makes a cash payment (or cash flow) of _C__t_ in each period _t_,  where _t_ ranges from 1 to _T_. The bond’s price _P_ is the present value of these cash flows,  discounted at the bond’s yield to maturity _y_:

$P = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_t}{(1+y)^t} $

The Macaulay Duration (D) is the weighted average of the time periods until the cash flows are received,  with the weights being the present value of the cash flow as a proportion of the bond’s price:

$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{tC_t}{(1+y)^t} $

To make this formulation more intuitive,  consider that the term _t__C__t_/(1 + _y_)_t_ calculates the present value of the cash flow at time _t_,  and then weights it by the time period _t_. Summing up these weighted present values for all time periods and dividing by the bond’s price gives an average time period,  which is the Macaulay Duration.

Thus,  Macaulay Duration serves as a time measure that captures the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  reflecting both the bond’s term to maturity and the pattern of its cash flows. This measure is valuable for comparing bonds with different maturities and coupon rates,  providing an insight into the bond’s interest rate risk.

## MODIFIED DURATION

While Macaulay Duration provides insight into the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  it’s the Modified Duration that directly measures a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Modified Duration is a derivative of the yield to maturity function of the bond price and is usually stated as a percentage change in price for each percentage point change in yield.

Modified Duration is a measure that reflects a bond’s sensitivity to changes in yield or interest rates. It is an extension of the concept of Macaulay Duration and offers an estimate of the percentage price change for a bond given a change in yield.

The mathematical derivation of Modified Duration is as follows:

Firstly,  recall the Macaulay Duration (D),  which is the weighted average time until a bond’s cash flows are received:

$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{tC_t}{(1+y)^t}$

Modified Duration (MD) is obtained by adjusting the Macaulay Duration by the factor of (1 + _y_):

$$MD = \frac{D}{1+y}$$

This adjustment transforms the time measure of Macaulay Duration into a measure of a bond’s price volatility due to changes in yield. For small changes in yield,  the percentage price change of a bond is approximately equal to the negative of the modified duration times the yield change. This relationship can be expressed as:

_Δ__P_ ≈  − _M__D_ ⋅ _Δ__y_

Where _Δ__P_ is the change in price and _Δ__y_ is the change in yield. This equation tells us that a 1% increase in yield will result in approximately a MD% decrease in the bond’s price.

The following table provides a comparative overview of Macaulay Duration and Modified Duration for various types of bonds:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Bond Type|Macaulay Duration|Modified Duration|
|Zero-Coupon Bond|Equal to the bond’s term to maturity|Less than the bond’s term to maturity|
|Coupon Bond|Less than the bond’s term to maturity|Less than Macaulay Duration|
|Perpetual Bond|Dependent on the bond’s coupon rate|Dependent on the bond’s coupon rate|

The primary use of Modified Duration in financial analysis is for estimating the effect of interest rate changes on a bond’s price. It allows investors and portfolio managers to assess interest rate risk and plan accordingly.

In summary,  Modified Duration is an effective measure of a bond’s interest rate risk. While Macaulay Duration provides an insight into the timing of a bond’s cash flows,  Modified Duration goes a step further and quantifies the sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in yield. For bond investors,  understanding both measures is crucial for making informed investment decisions and managing interest rate risk effectively.

## II. CALCULATING BOND DURATIONS

### MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS

### THE MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK OF BOND DURATION

The Macaulay Duration for a bond can be calculated using the following formula:

$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{tC_t}{(1+y)^t}$

Where:

+ _D_ is the Macaulay Duration
+ _P_ is the bond’s current price
+ _C_ is the cash flow (i.e.,  coupon payment or principal repayment) in period _t_

	 _t_

+ _T_ is the bond’s term
+ _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

To illustrate the calculation of Macaulay Duration,  let’s consider a simple example. Suppose we have a bond with a face value of$1000,  an annual coupon rate of 5%,  a term to maturity of 3 years,  and a yield to maturity of 4%.

Step 1: Calculate the bond’s cash flows. For each period,  the cash flow consists of the coupon payment,  and for the final period,  it also includes the principal repayment. In our example,  the cash flows are$50, $50,  and$1050 for the 1st,  2nd,  and 3rd years respectively.

Step 2: Discount each cash flow to its present value using the yield to maturity as the discount rate. In our example,  the present values of the cash flows are$50/(1+0.04)^1 =$48.08, $50/(1+0.04)^2 =$46.23,  and$1050/(1+0.04)^3 =$924.56.

Step 3: Calculate the product of the time period and the present value of the cash flow for each period. In our example,  these products are$48.08_1 =$48.08, $46.23_2 =$92.46,  and$924.56*3 =$2773.68.

Step 4: Sum up these products and divide by the bond’s price,  which is the sum of the present values of all cash flows. In our example,  the Macaulay Duration is ($48.08 +$92.46 +$2773.68)/($48.08 +$46.23 +$924.56) = 2.86 years.

Thus,  the Macaulay Duration of the bond is 2.86 years. This duration implies that,  on average,  the bond’s cash flows are received in about 2.86 years. It also indicates that the bond’s price will be more sensitive to interest rate changes than bonds with shorter durations.

## MODIFIED DURATION AND INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY

The Modified Duration for a bond can be calculated by adjusting the Macaulay Duration by the factor of (1 + _y_),  where _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity:

$$MD = \frac{D}{1+y}$$

Where:

+ _M__D_ is the Modified Duration
+ _D_ is the Macaulay Duration
+ _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

As an example,  consider a bond with a Macaulay Duration of 2.86 years and a yield to maturity of 4% as in the previous example. The Modified Duration of this bond is 2.86/(1 + 0.04) = 2.75 years. This duration implies that a 1% increase in yield would result in approximately a 2.75% decrease in the bond’s price,  all else being equal.

Modified Duration thus serves as a measure of a bond’s interest rate sensitivity. It estimates the percentage price change of a bond for a 1% change in yield. For example,  a bond with a higher Modified Duration is more sensitive to interest rate changes than a bond with a lower Modified Duration. This sensitivity is of practical importance to bond investors as it allows them to assess potential price changes due to yield fluctuations and thereby manage interest rate risk effectively.

In summary,  understanding both Macaulay Duration and Modified Duration is crucial for bond investors. While Macaulay Duration provides a measure of the average time until a bond’s cash flows are received,  Modified Duration quantifies the bond’s interest rate sensitivity. By comprehending these duration measures,  investors can make informed decisions about bond investments and manage their portfolios more effectively.

## DURATION AS A MEASURE OF BOND PRICE VOLATILITY

Duration,  both Macaulay and Modified,  is an essential tool in understanding the volatility of bond prices in response to changes in interest rates. Modified duration,  in particular,  gives an estimate of the percentage change in the price of a bond for a 1% change in interest rates,  which directly measures the bond’s price volatility.

Bonds with longer durations are more sensitive to interest rate changes and,  therefore,  are more volatile than bonds with shorter durations. This relationship between duration and volatility is crucial for investors in managing their portfolios effectively. By analyzing duration,  investors can estimate how much the price of a bond or a bond portfolio will change given an expected change in interest rates. This analysis can inform their decisions regarding which bonds to purchase or sell.

## DURATION MATCHING FOR LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

Institutional investors,  such as pension funds and insurance companies,  often have long-term liabilities. To manage these liabilities efficiently,  they employ a technique known as duration matching or immunization.

Duration matching involves aligning the duration of an institution’s assets (i.e.,  its bond investments) with the duration of its liabilities (i.e.,  its future cash outflows). This approach ensures that changes in the interest rates will have an equal effect on the institution’s assets and liabilities,  thus reducing the risk that the institution will be unable to meet its liabilities.

For example,  if a pension fund has liabilities that must be paid in 15 years,  it could invest in bonds with a duration of 15 years. By doing this,  if interest rates rise,  the increase in the present value of liabilities (which would make them more expensive to pay off) is offset by the rise in the value of the bond investments.

The benefits of duration matching include risk reduction and predictability of returns. However,  the drawbacks may include less potential for higher returns since duration matching often requires investing in bonds with lower yields. Moreover,  it requires a continual rebalancing of the portfolio as interest rates change and as time passes,  which might be costly and complex.

In conclusion,  duration serves as a critical measure of a bond’s price volatility and an essential tool for liability management. Understanding and effectively using duration can help investors make informed decisions and manage their portfolios more effectively.

## CONVEXITY

Convexity is another essential concept in bond analysis that complements duration. It measures the curvature or the degree of the curve in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields. It provides a more accurate estimation of bond price changes when there are substantial changes in interest rates.

While duration provides a linear estimate of price changes for small yield changes,  convexity takes into account that the price-yield relationship is not linear but curved. As a result,  for larger yield changes,  an adjustment for convexity is necessary to obtain more accurate price estimates.

Mathematically,  the convexity of a bond can be calculated using the following formula:

$$Convexity = \frac{1}{P*(1+y)^2} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t*(t+1)*C_t}{(1+y)^t}$$

Where:

+ _C__o__n__v__e__x__i__t__y_ is the measure of the bond’s convexity
+ _P_ is the bond’s current price
+ _C_ is the cash flow (i.e.,  coupon payment or principal repayment) in period _t_

	 _t_

+ _T_ is the bond’s term
+ _y_ is the bond’s yield to maturity

The higher the convexity,  the more curved the price-yield relationship is. A bond with a higher convexity will have a higher price increase when interest rates fall,  and a smaller price decrease when interest rates rise,  compared to a bond with a lower convexity. This property makes higher convexity bonds more attractive to investors as they provide more potential for capital gains and less potential for capital losses.

In summary,  duration and convexity are two critical measures in bond analysis. While duration provides an estimate of a bond’s price sensitivity to small changes in yield,  convexity adjusts this estimate for larger yield changes and provides a more accurate price estimate. By understanding these measures,  investors can better manage their bond investments and their interest rate risk.

## THE LIMITATIONS OF BOND DURATION

While duration is a valuable tool in bond analysis and portfolio management,  it is not without limitations:

1. **Linear approximation:** Duration provides a linear approximation of the price-yield relationship and assumes that interest rate changes are small. For larger changes in interest rates,  this approximation may not hold,  and the actual price change may differ significantly from the duration estimate. Convexity adjustment can address this limitation to some extent,  but it may still not fully capture the nonlinear price-yield relationship for very large yield changes.
2. **Assumption of constant yield:** Duration calculations assume a parallel shift in the yield curve,  meaning it assumes that all interest rates move by the same amount. In reality,  changes in interest rates can be non-parallel,  meaning different maturities may experience different yield changes.
3. **Reinvestment risk:** Duration measures do not take into account the reinvestment risk,  which is the risk that future coupon payments will have to be reinvested at a lower rate if interest rates fall.
4. **Lack of credit risk consideration:** Duration does not factor in the impact of changes in credit quality on bond prices. If the issuer’s creditworthiness declines,  the bond’s price could drop irrespective of interest rate changes.

In conclusion,  while duration and convexity are powerful tools in assessing interest rate risk,  they should not be used in isolation. A comprehensive risk analysis should also include considerations of credit risk,  liquidity risk,  and reinvestment risk,  among others.

## APPENDIX: KATEX SCRIPTS OF FORMULAS

The following are the Katex scripts for the key formulas discussed in this lecture. Students can use these scripts to reproduce the formulas independently:

$D = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t*C_t}{(1+y)^t}$

1. Modified Duration Formula:

$MD = \frac{D}{1+y}$

1. Convexity Formula:

$Convexity = \frac{1}{P*(1+y)^2} \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{t*(t+1)*C_t}{(1+y)^t}$

+ A **yield curve** graphs bond yields against their maturities
	 + Alternatively,  plot yields against durations
+ The two best known yield curves are:
	 1. The on-the-run Treasury curve
	 2. The interest rate swap curve

## **LIMITATIONS OF YIELD TO MATURITY**

+ While convenient for relative value analysis,  using a single rate to discount multiple cash flows can be problematic unless the curve is flat
	 + All cash flows are discounted at the same rate,  even if the curve slope suggests different discount rates are appropriate for different cash-flow dates.
	 + The reinvestment rate depends on the yield of the bond,  which varies across bonds

# MACAULAY DURATION

Macaulay duration is the weighted average time until a bond's cash flows are received. The weights are the present value of each cash flow divided by the bond’s price.

Let's denote:
+ $C$as the bond coupon payment
+ $F$as the bond face value
+ $i$as the time period index
+ $r$as the yield-to-maturity rate (expressed in periods equivalent to the coupon payment period)
+ $n$as the number of periods until maturity
+ $P$as the price of the bond

The formula for the Macaulay duration (D) is:$${} D = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n i\frac{C}{(1+r)^i} + n\frac{F}{(1+r)^n}}{P}$$

# MODIFIED DURATION

Modified duration adjusts the Macaulay duration to better measure the bond's price sensitivity to changes in yields.

The formula for the modified duration (D*) is:

$$

 D* = \frac{D}{1+r}

$$

The bond’s price sensitivity to changes in yields increases with the modified duration.

# CONVEXITY

Convexity measures the curvature,  or the second derivative of the price function with respect to yield changes. Greater convexity is preferred because it presents greater price increases when yields fall,  and smaller price declines when yields rise,  assuming that duration and yields are constant.

The formula for convexity (C) is:

$$

 C = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n i*(i+1) \frac{C}{(1+r)^{i+2}} + n*(n+1) \frac{F}{(1+r)^{n+2}}}{P*(1+r)^2}

$$

In general,  the longer the bond maturity,  or the lower the coupon rate,  the greater the convexity. High convexity is desirable for fixed-income investors,  regardless of whether rates rise or fall.

### BOND PRICE DERIVATION

Assumptions:

+ (C) is the coupon payment per period.
+ (F) is the face value or par value of the bond.
+ (r) is the yield to maturity (YTM) or discount rate per period.
+ (n) is the total number of coupon payments until maturity.

A bond provides two types of cash flows:

1. Coupon payments,  which are received periodically until the bond matures.
2. The face value or par value received at maturity.

Therefore,  the price (P) of a bond is the Present Value (PV) of all expected cash flows:  

Therefore,  the price (P) of a bond is the Present Value (PV) of all expected cash flows:$$P = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$$

#### DERIVATION STEPS

1. To derive the bond price formula,  calculate the present value of an annuity (coupons) plus the present value of a lump sum (face value).

1. To derive the bond price formula,  calculate the present value of an annuity (coupons) plus the present value of a lump sum (face value).$$PV_{\text{coupons}} = C \times \left(\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right)$$

1. To derive the bond price formula,  calculate the present value of an annuity (coupons) plus the present value of a lump sum (face value).
	+ This formula for$PV_{\text{coupons}}$comes from the general formula for the present value of an annuity.

	+ This formula for$PV_{\text{coupons}}$comes from the general formula for the present value of an annuity.$$PV_{\text{FV}} = \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$$

	+ This formula for$PV_{\text{coupons}}$comes from the general formula for the present value of an annuity.  
		  - This formula for$PV_{\text{FV}}$comes from the formula for the present value of a single future amount.
3. Combine these two present value calculations to get the total bond price.

	 + $$

 - P = PV_{\text{coupons}} + PV_{\text{FV}}$$$$P = C \times \left(\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}

	 + $$


### DURATION DERIVATION

Macaulay Duration $D_{\text{Mac}}$ is the weighted average time to receive the bond's cash flows,  weighted by the present value of those cash flows.

#### DERIVATION STEPS

1. The weight of each cash flow is its present value divided by the bond price.
	 + Weight$(w_i = \frac{\frac{C}{(1+r)^i}}{P})$for coupons and$\frac{\frac{F}{(1+r)^n}}{P}$for the face value.
2. Multiply each weight by the time period when the cash flow occurs.
	 + Weighted time$(wt_i = i \times w_i)$for coupons and$(n \times w_{\text{FV}})$for face value.

3. Sum the weighted times to calculate Macaulay Duration.$$D_{\text{Mac}} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}wt_i + n \times w_{\text{FV}}$$

	+ Explicitly:$$D_{\text{Mac}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}i \times \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} + n \times \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}}{P}$$

	 + Substituting P from bond price derivation:$D_{\text{Mac}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}i \times \frac{C}{(1+r)^i} + n \times \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}}{C \times \left(\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}}$$  
Duration effectively measures the bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates,  with a longer duration indicating greater sensitivity. The specific calculation steps provided here allow the derivation of duration from the bond's cash flows and current price.

Step 1. Simplify the numerator:

  The sum $\sum_{i=1}^{n}i \times \frac{C}{(1+r)^i}$ is the present value of  
  each coupon payment multiplied by the time it is received.

  And for $n \times \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$,  it's the present value of the face  
  value of the bond.

  Step 2. Simplify the denominator:

  $C \times \left(\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right)$ is the present value of a  
  series of $n$ coupon payments.

  And $\frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$ is the present value of the face value of the bond.

  The price of a non-callable coupon paying bond can be expressed as:

  $$

	P = C \times \left(\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}\right) + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}

  $$

  where:

	- P denotes the price of the bond, 
	- C is the annual coupon payment, 
	- n is the number of periods, 
	- F is the face value of the bond, 
	- r is the bond yield or interest rate.

	1 Modified Duration Dmod

  The expression for modified duration can be derived by differentiating the price function with respect to r (yield),  and expressing it in terms of Macaulay duration (Dmac):

  $$

	D_{\text{mod}} = -\frac{1}{P}\frac{dP}{dr} = -\frac{D_{\text{Mac}}}{1+r}

  $$

  The - sign in the formula refers to the inverse relationship between yield and price (i.e.,  when yield increases,  price decreases,  and vice versa).

	2 Convexity C

  Convexity can be expressed by taking the second derivative of the price function with respect to r (yield):

  $$

	C = \frac {1}{P} \times \frac {d^2P}{dr^2}

  $$

  Please note that Dmod and C capture the sensitivity of the bond's price to
  changes in the yield. Dmod and C are some of the key metrics used to manage
  a bond's interest rate risk,  along with the yield to maturity.

# MODIFIED DURATION
Modified duration adjusts the Macaulay duration to better measure the bond's price sensitivity to changes in yields.  
The formula for the modified duration (D*) is:

$$

 D* = \frac{D}{1+r}

$$

The bond’s price sensitivity to changes in yields increases with the modified duration.
# CONVEXITY

Convexity measures the curvature,  or the second derivative of the price function with respect to yield changes. Greater convexity is preferred because it presents greater price increases when yields fall,  and smaller price declines when yields rise,  assuming that duration and yields are constant.

The formula for convexity (C) is:

$$

 C = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n i*(i+1) \frac{C}{(1+r)^{i+2}} + n*(n+1) \frac{F}{(1+r)^{n+2}}}{P*(1+r)^2}

$$

In general,  the longer the bond maturity,  or the lower the coupon rate,  the greater the convexity. High convexity is desirable for fixed-income investors,  regardless of whether rates rise or fall.

To derive the equation for the price of a non-callable coupon bond in continuous time,  we'll follow a step-by-step approach. The derivation will be based on the principles of no-arbitrage,  risk-neutral valuation,  and will incorporate the use of stochastic processes. Let's begin:

1. **Define the Bond and Cash Flows:**
	+ A non-callable coupon bond pays a fixed coupon at regular intervals until maturity,  and then pays the face value.
	+ Let the bond have a maturity of$T$years,  a face value of$F$,  and an annual coupon rate of$c$.

2. **Determine the Cash Flow Structure:**
	+ The bond pays coupons continuously at a rate of$cF$per annum.
	+ The present value of these coupons needs to be calculated from the current time$t$to maturity$T$.

3. **Assumptions:**
	+ Assume a constant risk-free rate$r$for simplicity.
	+ The bond is priced in a risk-neutral world,  meaning investors are indifferent to risk.

4. **Present Value of Future Cash Flows:**
	+ The present value of a continuous cash flow can be calculated using the formula:

	  $$
      PV = \int_t^T e^{-r(s-t)} \cdot \text{Cash Flow at time } s \,  ds 
	  $$

	+ For the coupon bond,  the cash flow is$cF$(the annual coupon payment).

5. **Calculate Present Value of Coupons:**
	+ The present value of the continuous coupon payments is thus:

	  $$
      PV_{\text{coupons}} = \int_t^T e^{-r(s-t)} \cdot cF \,  ds 
	  $$

6. **Solve the Integral:**
	+ Solving the integral,  we get:

	  $$
      PV_{\text{coupons}} = cF \int_t^T e^{-r(s-t)} \,  ds 
	  $$

	  $$
		= cF \left[ \frac{-1}{r} e^{-r(s-t)} \right]_t^T
	  $$

	  $$
		= cF \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{e^{-r(T-t)}}{r} \right)
	  $$

7. **Present Value of Face Value:**
	+ The present value of the face value$F$paid at maturity is:

	  $$
      PV_{\text{face value}} = e^{-r(T-t)} \cdot F 
	  $$

8. **Price of the Bond:**
	+ The price of the bond is the sum of the present value of the coupons and the present value of the face value:

	  $$
      \text{Bond Price} = PV_{\text{coupons}} + PV_{\text{face value}} 
	  $$

	  $$
		= cF \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{e^{-r(T-t)}}{r} \right) + e^{-r(T-t)} \cdot F
	  $$

9. **Simplify the Equation:**
	+ Finally,  simplify the equation to get the general form of the pricing equation for a non-callable coupon bond in continuous time.
