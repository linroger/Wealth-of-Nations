# Off-Balance Sheet Banking and Contingent Claims Products  

“Has the attention paid to simple capital-asset ratios driven risks off balance sheet, and is off balance sheet also out of mind?” Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, in an address to the American Bankers Association, October 1985  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Cost of Funds The effective rate paid by the bank to fund its assets. Source of funds include retail deposits, large-denomination certificates of deposit (CDs), senior and junior debt, preferred stock, and common stock.  

Sunk Cost A cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Such a cost is irrelevant to a current decision because no matter wha the decision, the sunk cost is not affected.  

LIBOR London Interbank Offer Rate. This is the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans (usually overnight). It is a benchmark interest rate used by banks worldwide.  

T-bill Rate Discount rate on short-maturity debt obligation issued by the U.S. Treasury.  

Basis Point One hundredth of $1\%$ .  

Liability Management The management of the bank’s sources of funding (see Chapter 12).  

Derivative A financial contract, also called a contingent claim, whose value depends on the values of one or more of the underlying assets or indices of asset values. For example, Treasury-bill futures derive their value from movements in the T-bill rate. Bank regulators and banks themselves refer to derivatives more narrowly as contracts, such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options, whose primary purpose is not to borrow and lend but rather to transfer risks associated with fluctuations in asset and liability values.  

Initial Public Offering A public stock offering that converts a privately held firm into a publicly held corporation  

# INTRODUCTION  

Once negligible in amount, and therefore worthy of no more than passing mention in banking texts, off-balance sheet (OBS) items of banks now amount to trillions of dollars in the United States. They include contingent claims that represent a variety of exposures across markets and credit risks – standby letters of credit (L/Cs), interest rate and currency swaps, note issuance facilities (NIF), options, foreign currencies, fixed- and variable-rate loan commitments, and futures and forward contracts on everything from Treasury bills to gold. Loan commitments are among the largest components of the OBS items of banks. Also, when added together, OBS items exceed the total recorded assets of most large banks. This is a little misleading, however, since only some contingent claims impose a (contingent) liability on the bank, and this contingent liability is only a fraction of the nominal amount of its outstanding contingent claims. Nonetheless, these data highlight the enormous importance of OBS items in the current banking environment. The enormous growth in contingent claims of banks has coincided with an explosion in the growth of exchange-traded contingent claims like options and futures. Figure 10.1 depicts the global growth of exchange-traded options and futures.  

In this chapter, we focus on “OBS banking.” OBS banking refers to transactions that do not appear on the bank’s balance sheet, except possibly as footnotes. OBS items can be divided into two groups: option-like contingent claims and nonoption contingent claims. Table  10.1 shows the various items within each group. Any contingent claim involves a commitment on the part of the bank. According to Webster’s dictionary, a “commitment” is a promise to do something in the future. An option-like contingent claim is a promise by the bank to settle in the future at prespecified terms and at the option of the holder of the commitment. Thus, an option-like contingent claim imposes a contingent liability on the bank (the seller) and endows the buyer of the commitment with an option. In a competitive market for contingent claims, the bank should be paid a fee at the time the contingent claim is sold which equals the value of the option contained in that claim. Nonoption contingent claims may also involve fees for the bank, but they do not necessarily impose a contingent liability on the bank because there is a symmetry in the obligations of the bank and the customer. Thus, even though there is a future contingency that determines the settlement of the contract, it need not give the customer an option. For example, a forward or futures contract is a nonoption contingent claim.

OBS banking started growing explosively in the 1970s and 1980s partly because it was during this period that interest rates and foreign-exchange rates became increasingly volatile. This increased volatility in financial and foreign-exchange markets and created a strong demand from corporations for financial risk-management services. Banks found it profitable to provide these services. Thus, German companies that once borrowed only in D-marks but derived income in other currencies from their foreign operations were now helped by banks to control their foreign-exchange risk. Similarly, technology-intensive firms for whom unpredictable short-term revenues imposed severe constraints on research and development (R&D) budgets, approached banks that provided products designed to hedge overseas income and plan R&D over longer periods. The growth of OBS banking was a natural outgrowth of banks seeking to offer risk-management services.  

A bank’s customer faces two main types of risks. The first is business risk. It may be routine, such as that arising from unpredictable shifts in demand for the firm’s output. Or it may be strategic, such as that faced by a defense firm faced with lower demand for arms following the end of the Cold War. The second type of risk is financial. For example, this is the risk of being rationed in the credit market, and the risk of abrupt random movements in interest rates, commodity prices, or currencies. This is where banks enter. They offer loan commitments that can simultaneously guarantee credit availability and interest rate insurance. And banks can offer a variety of derivatives to hedge unpredictable price movements in volatile markets.  

While derivatives and other OBS items have been around for a long time,1 they became widely used only when risk escalated sufficiently. Initially, banks were not involved in the action. Futures and options were offered mainly by organized exchanges such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (part of the CME Group since 2007) before banks became heavily involved. These were standard contracts for hedging price risk of commodities and later financial claims. However, when corporations wanted products tailored to their specific needs, they turned to banks for those products. This demand led to a variety of custom-tailored contracts such as loan commitments, forward contracts, and swaps.  

Banks were interested in custom-designing contingent claims for their clients not only to strengthen customer relationships, but also because sales of contingent claims have proved to be a source of fee income. There are two popularly cited advantages of OBS banking. First, since OBS banking does not involve deposit funding, cash-asset reserves are not needed, and the implicit tax of reserve requirements is avoided. Second, in the past, banks were not required to maintain capital against OBS contingencies, although they have been required to do so since the adoption of the guidelines associated with the first Basel Capital Accord in 1987.2  

In the previous three chapters we discussed the spot lending activities of banks. Our focus in this chapter is on forward markets. The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In the next section we describe loan commitments. Economic rationales for the use of loan commitments are provided in the section that follows. Issues related to the valuation (pricing) of loan commitments are examined next. This is followed by a discussion of the differences between exchange-traded put options and loan commitments, and a discussion of the impact of loan commitments on the monetary policy. Then, in the next two sections we explain two other contingent claims: L/Cs and interest rate swaps. The issues of risks for banks offering contingent claims are taken up subsequently. The regulatory aspects of contingent claims are taken up next. This is followed by the conclusion of the chapter. A case study is provided to illustrate some of the issues facing a bank that sells contingent claims.  

# LOAN COMMITMENTS: A DESCRIPTION  

# Definition and Pricing Structure  

A loan commitment is a promise to lend up to a prespecified amount to a prespecified customer at prespecified terms. Such a promise is tenable for a prespecified time period (not to be confused with the maturity of the loan). The terms usually specify how the interest rate on the loan will be computed, the maturity of the loan, and the use to which borrowed funds will be put. The bank’s compensation for selling the commitment comes in a variety of forms, used in various combinations. It can take the form of a commitment fee that is expressed as a percentage of the total commitment and paid up front by the borrower when the commitment is negotiated. It can also take the form of a usage fee that is levied on the unused portion of the credit line (e.g., 25–50 basis points per year). Quite often, commitment and usage fees are employed simultaneously. Also frequently used are servicing fees on the borrowed amount to cover the bank’s transactions costs, and compensating balance requirements that are deposit balances the borrower must keep with the bank during the period of their commitment relationship. These balances are computed as fractions of the total commitment and the bank pays below-market interest rates on these balances.  

Table 10.2 gives a detailed description of an actual loan commitment contract. This contract illustrates an innovation in loan commitments, namely offering the customer a choice among rate bases. In this case, Blockbuster Entertainment can borrow at the prime rate, the LIBOR plus $0.5\%$ , or the CD rate plus $0.625\%$ . The choice increases the customer’s flexibility and therefore enhances the commitment’s value.

# Uses of Loan Commitments  

Most business loans are made under loan commitments. The latest statistics are that $77\%$ of new commercial loans in an average U.S. bank’s portfolio are made under loan commitments, with only $23\%$ being spot loans, and $46\%$ of banks make no spot loans at all.3 Loans made under commitments include construction and land-development loans, as well as loans to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Loan commitments also include backup lines of credit on commercial paper (the bank agrees to lend to the customer as an alternative to issuing paper) and NIF (in which the bank agrees to buy the short-term notes of a borrower if the latter is unable to sell them in the markets).  

# Kinds of Loan Commitments  

In addition to use, loan commitments can be classified according to the nature of the interest rate insurance provided to the customer.  

Commitments vary in the extent to which they provide interest rate insurance to the borrower. A fixed-rate loan commitment gives the customer the right to borrow at an interest rate that is known in advance and hence eliminates all interest rate and availability uncertainty. The more popular variable-rate (or fixed formula) loan commitment does not hold the borrowing rate fixed. Rather, it determines the rate according to a formula that involves some index rate. Two common formulas are: additive and multiplicative. The additive version of the variable-rate loan commitment stipulates a borrowing rate that is an index rate at the time of takedown plus a fixed add-on. The less frequently used multiplicative version stipulates a borrowing rate that is an index rate at the time of takedown multiplied by a specified constant. Commonly used index rates are the prime rate, the CD rate, the LIBOR, and the commercial paper rate. Customers may also be offered a choice of formula within a given commitment, for example, prime plus 10 basis points or 1.1 times the CD rate at the time of the borrowing.  

Relative to a fixed-rate commitment, a variable-rate commitment does not provide the customer protection against stochastic fluctuations in the index rate. However, as long as there is an element of fixity in the borrowing rate, the commitment will have some insurance value to the customer. In the prime-plus commitment, the add-on is held fixed. The customer is thus insured against its add-on being increased due to a possible increase in its credit risk during the commitment period. Likewise, in the prime-times commitment, the multiple is held fixed. In both cases, the customer’s commitment borrowing rate at the time of commitment takedown may be lower than the spot rate it would have faced in the absence of the commitment.  

Although a loan commitment obliges a bank to lend at a rate below the borrower’s spot rate, the bank usually has some latitude in determining whether or not to honor a commitment, even in the case of the most formal agreement. This latitude arises from the adoption of a “general nervous clause” or a “material adverse change” (MAC) clause, which is standard in virtually all loan commitment contracts. This clause allows the bank to dissolve the commitment if the customer’s financial condition has “materially” deteriorated between the time the commitment was issued and the time the customer can exercise it. What constitutes material deterioration can, of course, become a legal issue should the denied customer decide to challenge the bank’s assessment through litigation. This clause does, however, introduce an element of discretion into the loan commitment contract.  

# A Summary  

We can depict a loan commitment contract as in Figure 10.2  It should be clear by now that a loan commitment is a contingent claim. The contract’s contingency hinges upon the interest rate applicable to the specific borrower at the time of commitment takedown. If the spot rate is higher than the commitment rate, the customer will exercise the commitment and the bank will suffer a loss, if only an opportunity loss. If the spot rate is exceeded by the commitment rate, the customer will let the commitment expire unused and borrow instead in the spot market.4 Thus, the bank has an obligation and the customer has an option. The bank has a loss in those states of nature in which the customer will exercise the commitment, and this loss is contingent on the occurrence of those states of nature.

FIGURE 10.2 Depiction of Loan Commitment Classification.  

# RATIONALE FOR LOAN COMMITMENTS  

In this section, we offer several explanations for the growing importance of commitments.  

# Supply-Side Explanations  

The supply-side explanations for loan commitments attempt to shed light on the popularity of loan commitments by examining the incentives that banks (the suppliers of loan commitments) have to sell the contracts.  

# Regulatory Taxes  

Some believe that loan commitments have been popular because they permit banks to generate fee revenue while keeping only minimal additional capital to support the loan commitments.5 Moreover, until the commitment is actually taken down, there is no loan, which means no funding has actually taken place. Consequently, the bank needs no deposits until commitment takedown, which implies that reserve requirements6 do not affect the commitment until that time. In fact, if the bank is interested only in generating the fee income related to the loan commitment, it could sell the commitment and avoid funding the (potential) loan under the commitment altogether. This could be achieved by selling the loan to another bank if and when the customer decides to exercise the commitment. Similarly, the bank could securitize the loan.  

# Contractual Discretion and Reputation  

Another supply-side explanation for the growth in contingent claims relies upon the notion that banks face a trade-off between financial and reputational capital. Simply put, it says that since contingent claims are promises to deliver something in the future, but invariably involve “escape clauses” that introduce contractual discretion and permit the bank to not honor its promises under “extenuating” circumstances, issuing such claims gives the bank improved ability to manage its overall portfolio of financial and reputational capital.7 Consider a bank that has built up a reputation for honoring its contingent claims even in circumstances where provisions in the terms of its contract with the other party would give it the latitude not to. For example, a bank may have agreed to a $\$100$ million credit line at $10\%$ interest to a customer whose spot borrowing rate at the time of commitment takedown is $15\%$ and whose financial condition at that time is sufficiently murky to enable the bank to invoke the MAC clause and deny credit. Yet a bank with sufficient financial capital may permit the customer to exercise the commitment because this allows the bank to build up its reputational capital. Such reputational capital is of value since it enables the bank to sell future contingent claims at higher prices. Now suppose a bank that has accumulated quite a bit of such reputational capital but finds financial capital in scarce supply is faced with the same decision. Such a bank may well decide to invoke the MAC clause and not honor the commitment. This will result in some depreciation of its reputational capital, but it will conserve scarce financial capital. Thus, the decision to not honor the commitment can be seen as an optimal trade-off by the bank between its reputational and financial capital, and it is essentially an act of liquefying its reputational capital; note that, unlike the bank’s financial capital, its reputational capital cannot (with good reason) be directly traded. In a later section, we discuss a Security Pacific interest rate swap deal where contractual discretion is employed to write down reputational capital.  

You should note that the ability to introduce discretion into a contract is predicated on the contract involving the promise of future delivery, as a contingent claim does. Moreover, discretion in the loan commitment contract is beneficial because it permits the bank to trade off liquid against illiquid assets.  

# Demand Forecasting  

By participating in the loan commitment market, the bank can obtain valuable information about future loan demand. The reason is that customers will purchase commitments for amounts that are related to their expected future borrowing needs. This permits the bank to plan its funding and other activities accordingly. The question we turn to next is why customers would demand loan commitments.  

# Scope Efficiencies in the Sale of Loan Commitments for Deposit-Financed Banks  

Banks are financed to a large extent with demand deposits, so they have access to a large amount of cash. While some of this is loaned out, banks need to keep substantial liquidity on hand to meet deposit withdrawals, which can occur at a moment’s notice. Once this liquidity is on hand, there are scope economies from being able to use this liquidity to allow borrowers to borrow under loan commitments. That is, cash assets on the bank’s balance sheet serve two purposes: backing up loan commitments and also having liquidity on hand to meet deposit withdrawals.8  

# Demand-Side Explanations  

Demand-side explanations focus on the benefits of loan commitments to the purchaser. Many benefits have been identified, five of which are discussed below.  

# Risk-Sharing Considerations9  

As discussed in Chapter 4  banks sometimes mismatch their balance sheets in order to profit from the term premiums in the term structure of interest rates. That is but one way for banks to increase expected profits by taking on interest rate risk. Loan commitments provide another. When a bank sells a fixed-rate loan commitment, it accepts the interest rate risk that the customer would otherwise bear if it were to borrow in the spot market for credit. The customer should, of course, be willing to compensate the bank for taking this risk, and this compensation should be reflected in the price paid for the loan commitment.  

Borrowers who are more risk averse than the bank should be willing to pay the bank for taking interest rate risk on their behalf. In other words, the risk premium demanded by the bank for bearing interest rate risk will be lower than that demanded by the customer for bearing the same risk if the latter is more risk averse than the former. Such a disparity in risk preferences makes trade possible between the bank and the customer, involving the bank selling the borrower a loan commitment that reduces uncertainty regarding the customer’s future borrowing cost. With a variable-rate loan commitment, the bank still bears some interest rate risk but less than with a fixed-rate commitment. In essence, with a fixed-rate commitment the bank bears both the risk of changes in the index rate as well as of changes in the borrower’s credit risk premium, whereas with a variable-rate commitment the bank bears only the latter risk. In either case, the risk-averse borrower is transferring (some) interest rate risk to the bank, and to the extent that the bank is willing to participate at a price that is acceptable to the borrower, we have an explanation for why loan commitments are demanded by the bank’s customers.10  

# Moral Hazard  

One drawback of the previous explanation is that many loan commitment customers are large, publicly owned firms with numerous shareholders. From the portfolio theory we know that even risk-averse shareholders should be indifferent to firm-specific (idiosyncratic) risk because they can diversify it away. Moreover, it is not clear why shareholders of nonbank firms should collectively demand a higher premium for bearing systematic risk than the bank’s shareholders do.11 So we would like to know if there will be a demand for loan commitments even when the bank’s customers are not motivated by the desire to purchase insurance against interest rate risk.  

One possibility is that loan commitments are effective in deterring moral hazard. The source of the moral hazard may be an inventive on the borrower’s part to undersupply productive effort (relative to the case in which the borrower selffinances) or switch projects (in an undetected manner) to the bank’s detriment. The intuition is as follows. We know from our discussions in Chapter 8 that the loan interest rate is distortionary in the sense that the higher this rate, the lower is the net return accruing to the borrower, and hence the greater is the borrower’s incentive to reduce effort and/or switch to a riskier project. The consequences can be costly – the borrower may either need to post collateral or in extreme circumstances the bank may ration credit. A loan commitment provides a means for the bank to circumvent the distortionary effect of the loan interest rate without relying on more costly alternatives. This can be achieved by lowering the interest rate on the loan to a level sufficient to eliminate (or significantly diminish) moral hazard. This will generally mean that the bank will suffer an expected loss on the loan made under the commitment. This loss can be recouped through the commitment fee paid by the borrower at the time the commitment is made. The key is that the customer views the commitment fee as a sunk cost after it is paid, and hence the commitment fee does not affect either the level of effort or choice of project. In this way, the loan commitment helps to overcome moral hazard. The following example illustrates the point.  

# Example 10.1  

Suppose the management of Knight Apparel Company knows at $t=0$ that it will have available at $t=1$ an opportunity to invest $\$100$ in a risky project that will pay off at $t=2$ . Knight Apparel knows that it will be able to invest in one of two mutually exclusive projects, S or ${\sf R},$ each requiring a $\$100$ investment. If Knight Apparel invests in S at $t=1$ , the project will pay off $\$150$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1 at $t=2$ . If Knight Apparel invests in R at $t=1$ , the project will pay off $\$158$ with probability 0.7 and zero with probability 0.3 at $t=2$ . Knight Apparel’s project choice is not observable to the bank from which it seeks to borrow the $\$100$ .  

The riskless, single-period interest rate at $t=0$ is $10\%$ . It is not known at $t=0$ what the riskless, single-period interest rate at $t=1$ will be, but it is common knowledge that this rate will be $5\%$ with probability 0.5 or $15\%$ with probability 0.5. Assume universal risk neutrality and that Knight Apparel has no assets other than the project on which you (as the lender) can have any claim. Figure 10.3 depicts these data.  

Suppose you are Knight Apparel’s banker and you know that Knight has two choices: (i) It can wait until $t=1$ and then borrow in the spot market or (ii) it can purchase a loan commitment that will permit it to borrow at predetermined rates at $t=1$ . What advice would you give Knight Apparel? Assume a competitive loan market in which banks earn zero expected profits.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in six steps. First, we consider alternative (i) and show that it is a Nash equilibrium for Knight Apparel to choose S at $t=1$ if the spot riskless rate then is $5\%$ . Second, we continue with alternative (i) and show that this Nash equilibrium fails to exist if the spot riskless rate at $t=1$ is $15\%$ . The reason is that the high interest rate diverts “too much” of Knight Apparel’s cash flow into repaying the bank loan, so that the borrower prefers to gamble on the riskier investment R which, despite its lower success probability, gives Knight Apparel a higher net payoff in the successful state. The bank must therefore price the loan under the assumption that R will be chosen. But then the interest rate is so high that Knight Apparel declines the loan. Third, we point out that passing up the investment opportunity in the high-interest-rate state is socially wasteful because S has a positive total NPV even when the riskless rate is $15\%$ . Fourth, we consider alternative (ii), and design a loan commitment contract that induces Knight Apparel to invest in S regardless of the spot riskless rate. Fifth, we solve for the commitment fee so that the bank can earn (at least) zero expected profit on the loan and the loan commitment taken together. Finally, in Step 6 we calculate the net benefit of the loan commitment to Knight Apparel and show that it is positive.

FIGURE 10.3 Investment Opportunities for Knight Apparel.  

# Step 1  

Consider alternative (i). Suppose the interest rate at $t=1$ is $5\%$ and you assume that Knight Apparel will choose S. Then the interest rate, ${\boldsymbol{{j}}_{s}},$ that you should charge the borrower in order to just break even on the loan is obtained as a solution to the following equation:  

$$
0.9\times(1+i_{s})=1.05
$$  

where 0.9 is the probability that you will be repaid by Knight Apparel. Solving Equation  10.1) gives $j_{\mathrm{s}}=16.67\%$ . If Knight Apparel chooses $S,$ its expected payoff at $t=2$ is  

$$
0.9\times(150-116.67)=\S30\mathrm{approximately}.
$$  

On the other hand, if Knight Apparel chooses ${\sf R},$ , its expected payoff at $t=2$ is  

$$
0.7\times(158-116.67)=\S28.93.
$$  

Thus, Knight Apparel will prefer S to ${\sf R},$ and it is a Nash equilibrium for you to offer a $\$100$ loan at $16.67\%$ .12  

# Step 2  

Now suppose the interest rate at $t=1$ is $15\%$ . If you assume that Knight Apparel will choose $S,$ then you should charge an interest rate, $i_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime},$ that solves the following equation  

$$
0.9\times(1+i_{s}^{\prime})=1.15
$$  

Solving Equation (10.2) yields $i_{\mathrm{{S}}}^{\prime}=27.78\%$ . If Knight Apparel does indeed choose S, its expected payoff at $t=2$ will be  

$$
0.9\times(150-127.78)=\S20\mathrm{approximat}
$$  

On the other hand, if Knight Apparel chooses $\mathsf{R},$ its expected payoff at $t=2$ will be  

$$
0.7\times(158-127.78)=\S21.15.
$$  

Clearly, Knight Apparel will prefer R to ${\sf S},$ and it is not a Nash equilibrium for you to offer the loan at $27.78\%$ . But suppose you assume that Knight Apparel will choose R. Then, the interest rate, ${j_{\mathrm{R}}^{\prime}},$ that you should charge solves  

$$
0.7(1+i_{R}^{\prime})=1.15,
$$  

which yields $i_{\mathrm{R}}^{\prime}=64.29\%$ . However, at this interest rate Knight Apparel will not borrow since its repayment obligation would exceed the maximum cash flow of the project.  

Step 3  

What this implies is that if Knight Apparel can only borrow in the spot market, it will invest only if the risklesss rate at $t=1$ is $5\%$ . If the rate is $15\%$ , Knight Apparel will pass up its investment opportunity. This is a distortion in the following sense. Even when the riskless interest rate is $15\%$ , project S has a positive total NPV, even though its NPV to Knight Apparel’s shareholders is not positive. If Knight Apparel could somehow convince a bank that it would choose S if given a loan, the bank would be willing to extend the loan at terms that would enable the bank to break even and leave Knight Apparel with a positive NPV. However, credible communication from Knight Apparel to the bank may not always be possible (we have assumed that it is not), and if it is not, the bank must anticipate that Knight Apparel will act in its own best interest. The consequence is a bank loan that Knight is unwilling to accept, and a social waste represented by the foregone positive NPV of project S.  

# Step 4  

We will now show that a loan commitment, negotiated at $t=0,$ can avoid this moral-hazard-induced loss. Suppose that under arrangement (ii), you offer to lend Knight Apparel $\$100$ (if Knight Apparel wishes to take the loan) at $t=1$ at an interest rate of $16.67\%$ , regardless of the spot riskless rate at that time. This is a fixed-rate loan commitment. As our analysis so far has indicated, Knight Apparel will opt for S under these terms, so that your bank will break even on the loan if the riskless rate at $t=1$ is $5\%$ . Of course, if the riskless rate is $15\%$ , you will lose money on the risky loan since you should be charging an interest rate of $27.78\%$ in that case.13 To recoup this loss, you should charge Knight Apparel a commitment fee at $t=0$ . What should this commitment fee be?  

# Step 5  

To answer this question, note that your bank’s loss, in terms of the amount that should be repaid in the successful state minus the amount that is actually repaid in the successful state, is  

$$
\$127.78-\$1123,4567=
$$  

The bank suffers this loss at $t=2$ only if Knight Apparel’s project succeeds (the bank also suffers a loss if Knight Apparel’s project fails, but in that state the bank recovers nothing in either case), and the probability of success is 0.9. Hence, the bank’s expected loss is  

$$
0.9\times\$11.11=\S9.999
$$  

Since the probability of the $15\%$ interest rate is 0.5 and we must discount from $t=2$ back to $t=1$ (at $15\%$ ) and from $t=1$ back to $t=0$ (at the $10\%$ riskless rate prevailing at $t=0$ ), we have the following present value at $t=0$ of the bank’s expected loss at $t=2$  

$$
\frac{0.5\times\S9.99}{1.15\times1.10}=\S3.95
$$  

Thus, the commitment fee that the bank should charge Knight Apparel is $\$3.95$ , given a zero expected profit on the loan and the loan commitment. It is important to note that Knight Apparel pays the commitment fee at $t=0$ , so that when it confronts its project choice at $t=1$ it treats this fee as a sunk cost and its project choice is not affected by it.  

# Step 6  

We can compute the overall benefit from the loan commitment by comparing Knight Apparel’s NPV under arrangements (i) and (ii). Under (i), since borrowing only takes place when the spot riskless rate at $t=1$ is $5\%$ , Knight Apparel’s NPV is  

$$
\frac{0.5\times\S30.00}{1.05\times1.10}=\S12.99
$$  

where you will recall that $\$30$ is Knight Apparel’s net expected payoff at $t=2$ when it chooses S and is obliged to repay the bank $\$123,4567$ (an interest rate of $16.67\%$ ). Under (ii), the expected NPV is  

$$
{\begin{array}{r c c c c}{{\frac{0.5\times{\mathfrak{H}}30.00}{1.05\times1.10}}}&{+}&{{\frac{0.5\times{\mathfrak{H}}30.00}{1.05\times1.10}}}&{-}&{{\mathfrak{H}}3.95}\\ {({\mathrm{risk}}|\mathbf{ess}\ \mathrm{rate\at}}&&{{\mathrm{(risk|essrate\at\}}}&&{{\mathrm{(commitment\fee)}}}\\ {t=1\ {\mathrm{is5percent}})}&&{t=1\ {\mathrm{is5^{\circ}/o_{0}}}}&{{\mathrm{(commitment\fee)}}}\\ {={\mathfrak{H}}20.90}&&&{}\end{array}}
$$  

Thus, Knight Apparel experiences a net gain of $\$7.91$ (which is $\$20.90–\$12.99)$ by purchasing the loan commitment. Note that this improvement is the net of the commitment fee.  

In this example, the loan commitment was useful in overcoming the moral hazard created by the possibility of undetected asset substitution by the borrower. A similar argument works for “effort aversion” moral hazard, and it suggests that loan commitments add value for borrowers; this observation has empirical support in that firms that purchase bank loan commitments experience abnormally positive stock price reactions upon announcing these purchases.14 The conclusion is that borrowers may demand loan commitments because they are able to borrow on better terms under commitments than they could in the spot market. Banks are able to provide better terms because loan commitments avoid some of the moral hazard problems that plague spot loans.  

# Liquidity Guarantee for Other Creditors  

When a firm purchases a loan commitment, suppliers of inputs to the firm know that the firm will have access to liquidity equal to the amount of the commitment. This may reassure suppliers that the firm will have the funds necessary to service its debt obligations to them. Consequently, these suppliers may be willing to provide inputs to the firm on better terms than in the absence of the loan commitment. The result would be an overall lowering of the firm’s cost of debt, which would benefit the firm’s shareholders. This intuition can be seen in the following example.  

# Example 10.2  

Suppose Northwestern Business Machines (NBM) has the opportunity to invest $\$100$ at $t=1$ in a project that will yield a random payoff at $t=2$ . At $t=0$ the firm is uncertain about the probability distribution of the random payoff of the project; this distribution depends on a state of nature, call it $\theta,$ that will be revealed privately (i.e., it is not known to the creditors) to the management of NBM at $t=1$ prior to making its decision of whether to invest in the project. At $t=0$ , all that NBM knows is that there is a 0.5 probability that $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ (the $\mathrm{{}^{\prime\prime}g o o d^{\prime\prime}}$ state), in which case the project will pay off $\$200$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1. If the bad state occurs, the project will pay off $\$130$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1.  

At $t=0$ , NBM needs to buy $\$20$ of raw materials and other inputs if it is to proceed with the project at $t=1$ . The suppliers have agreed to provide trade credit so that the $\$20$ plus the agreed upon interest can be paid at $t=2$ .  

The riskless interest rate that will prevail from $t=1$ to $t=2$ is $5\%$ and this is known to all at $t=0$ . Assume that the time that will elapse from $t=0$ to $t=1$ is so short that discounting can be ignored. Also assume that NBM’s chief executive officer (CEO) will sustain a nonpecuniary cost (say the cost of personal effort) in initiating the project, and the pecuniary present-value equivalent of this cost is 1 dollar. All of the data for this problem are shown in Figure 10.4  

![](images/43d0abb39e4b13bbc36913355655e5055e479bb5a49a759a82053f5e1919094d.jpg)  
FIGURE 10.4 Investment Opportunities for Northwestern Business Machines.  

Compute the terms of trade credit as well as the NPV to NBM (net of the CEO’s personal cost) if it: (i) borrows the $\$100$ in the spot credit market after learning $\theta,$ and (ii) purchases a loan commitment at $t=0$ (prior to knowing $\theta_{.}^{\cdot}$ that would entitle it to borrow the $\$100$ at $t=1$ .  

Assume that the bank as well as trade creditors provide credit at competitive terms, and that everybody is risk neutral.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in five steps. First, we consider the spot credit alternative. We show that if suppliers price their trade credit to NBM at $t=0$ assuming that NBM will undertake the project at $t=1$ regardless of $\theta_{,}$ then the project is undertaken only if $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ . Second, we argue that this suggests that the only Nash equilibrium is for trade creditors to believe that NBM will undertake the project at $t=1$ if $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ and not otherwise. We verify in the second step that this is indeed a Nash equilibrium. Third, we consider the loan commitment alternative. We show that there exists a fixed-rate loan commitment that induces NBM to invest at $t=1$ regardless of $\theta$ Fourth, we verify that this commitment is part of a Nash equilibrium by checking that NBM will indeed prefer to purchase a loan commitment at $t=0$ as opposed to borrowing in the spot market at $t=1$ . Finally, in Step 5 we show that the loan commitment makes NBM better off ex ante because it lowers NBM’s overall cost of credit. It achieves this by eliminating an underinvestment problem that results in trade credit being available to NBM at a lower cost than with spot borrowing.  

# Step 1  

Let us first consider the spot credit alternative. Since the project has a success probability of 0.9 (regardless of $\theta$ and the riskless rate is $5\%$ , we know from Example 10.1 that the competitive loan interest rate is $16.67\%$ . Thus, the repayment obligation of the $\$100$ spot loan will be $\$123,456$ . If the trade creditors assume that NBM will invest in the project regardless of $\theta_{\cdot}$ then the interest rate on trade credit should also be $16.67\%,$ , that is, the firm’s repayment obligation should be $\$20\times1.1667=923.33$ . The total repayment obligation is then $\$123,40$ . But then if $\theta=\mathrm{B}_{\cdot}$ , its NPV is  

$$
\frac{0.9(0)}{1.05}-\$1=-\$1
$$  

where we have subtracted the decision maker’s personal cost of $\$1$ in computing the NPV. Note that the zero in the numerator of the first term in the left-hand side of the above equation reflects limited liability (without which the zero would be replaced by 130 $-140=-\$10$ . Thus, the firm will not undertake the project if it observes $\theta=\mathtt{B}$ . If $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ is observed at $t=1$ , then the firm’s NPV is  

$$
\frac{0.9(\S250-\S140)}{1.05}-1=\S50.43
$$  

so that the project will be undertaken.  

# Step 2  

This means that it cannot be a Nash equilibrium for the trade creditors or the bank to believe that NBM will undertake the project regardless of $\theta$ Suppose they assume that the project will be undertaken only if $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ . Then, since the probability of the project being undertaken is only 0.5, the interest rate $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{t}},$ charged for trade credit (with spot borrowing of the $\$100$ investment) must satisfy  

$$
0.5\times0.9\times(1+i_{t})=1.05,
$$  

which yields $i_{t}=133.33\%$ . NBM’s repayment obligation to the trade creditors is therefore $\$20\times2.3333=\S46.67$ . Its total repayment obligation now becomes $\$123,456,7$ . If $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ occurs, NBM’s NPV is  

$$
\frac{0.9(\S200-\S163.34)}{1.05}-1=\S30.42,
$$  

so that the project will be undertaken in that state. However, the project will not be undertaken if $\theta=\mathtt{B}$ . Hence, the beliefs of the trade creditors about NBM’s future behavior are consistent (rationalized by NBM’s behavior), and it is a Nash equilibrium for them to offer trade credit at an interest rate of $133.33\%$ . Note that the NPV to NBM from the spot borrowing alternative, computed at $t=0$ (prior to the realization of $\theta$ is $0.5\times30.42=\S15.21$ , since the firm knows that it will invest only if $\theta=\mathrm{{G}}$ .  

# Step 3  

Now consider the loan commitment alternative. Suppose NBM can obtain a loan commitment at $t=0$ to borrow $\$100$ at $5\%$ (the current riskless rate) at $t=1$ . Thus, its repayment obligation to the bank, if it borrows under the commitment, will be $\$105$ . Since the repayment obligation that permits the bank to just break even is $\$123,456,7$ , the bank’s loss is $\$123,456$ , and so the commitment fee (using the logic employed in Example 10.1) should be ${\frac{0.9\times11.67}{1.05}}=\$10.00.$ Will the firm now invest in the project if $\theta=\mathtt{B}$ at $t=1?$ To answer this, calculate NBM’s NPV a s 0.9(\$130 – \$105− \$23.33) – 1= \$0.43, so that the firm will undertake the investment.  

Note that we have assumed here that trade creditors believe that NBM will undertake the project regardless of $\theta,$ if it has purchased this loan commitment at $t=0$ . As our analysis indicates, this assumption is warranted.  

Step 4   
To verify that we have a Nash equilibrium with the loan commitment, we also need to check that NBM will prefer to purchase the loan commitment at $t=0$ as opposed to borrowing in the spot credit market.  

The NPV for NBM, assessed at $t=0,$ , is  

$$
\frac{0.5[0.9\times(\mathfrak{H}200-\mathfrak{H}105-\mathfrak{H}23.33)]}{1.05}+\frac{0.5[0.9\times(\mathfrak{H}130-\mathfrak{H}105-\mathfrak{H}23.33)]}{1.05}-10-1=\mathfrak{H}20.43.
$$  

Since this exceeds NBM’s NPV with spot borrowing $(\$15.21)$ , we have a Nash equilibrium with NBM purchasing a loan commitment at $t=0$ to borrow $\$100$ at $5\%$ , and suppliers extending trade credit at $16.67\%$ .  

n this case, the loan commitment reduces the firm’s overall cost of credit. Recall from Chapter 7 that collateral solved an underinvestment problem. Here the loan commitment serves a similar purpose.15  

# Step 5  

The underinvestment problem arises because the project has a positive NPV to NBM (and a positive total NPV) in state $\theta=\mathrm{B}$ only if the project’s cost is just the $\$100$ investment. In this case, the total NPV of the project is  

$$
\frac{0.9\times\S130}{1.05}-\S100-\S1=\S10.43,
$$  

so that the loan commitment helps to avoid a real underinvestment problem. This conclusion is appropriate if we view the $\$20$ worth of raw materials as a purchase that NBM would make even if the project were not available, that is, the raw materials do not add to the cost of the project. But if we interpret that $\$20$ as adding to the cost of the project (i.e., these raw materials would not be purchased if the project were unavailable), then the total NPV of the project is  

$$
\frac{0.9\times\S130}{1.05}-\S100-\S20-\S1=-\S9.57.
$$  

n this case the project is socially inefficient in the $\theta=\mathrm{B}$ state, so that the loan commitment (which still results in the project being undertaken when $\theta=\mathtt{B}$ ) does not resolve an underinvestment problem in the usual sense.16 Indeed, it ends up inducing an overinvestment17 by NBM that makes it better off ex ante. In this case, the role played by the loan commitment18 is quite different from that played by collateral in our discussions in Chapter 7.  

Borrowers often use loan commitments as an assurance to other creditors. For example, commercial paper borrowers routinely purchase dedicated bank loan commitments explicitly to back up commercial paper issues.  

# Protection Against Future Credit Rationing  

A borrower’s future access to credit is threatened by three possibilities: (1) deterioration in its own credit rating, (2) deterioration in the general market availability of credit, and (3) changes in bank-specific factors that diminish the bank’s ability to provide credit. A loan commitment may protect the buyer against the first two possibilities. Of course, the MAC clause in the loan commitment contract limits the usefulness of the commitment as insurance against rationing, but the empirical evidence suggests that loan commitments are nevertheless considered valuable.19  

Surveys of borrowers indicate that the most frequently mentioned reasons given for commitments are “general convenience and minimizing loan arrangement costs,” and “protection against general credit crunches.” The next most frequently mentioned reasons were to “ensure credit access against a creditworthiness deterioration” and “to lock in a fixed markup over a reference interest rate.” 20  

# Reducing Market Incompleteness  

When the capital market is incomplete (recall our discussion in Chapter 1), investors and firms lack all of the risk-sharing opportunities they desire. Thus, if the market is incomplete and the loan commitment produces a payoff stream for the borrower that cannot be replicated by linear combinations of existing securities (as, e.g., in Example 10.1), then the availability of a loan commitment reduces market incompleteness. Since investors now have access to expanded risk-sharing opportunities because they can invest in firms that purchase loan commitments (as well as those that do not), these investors may be made better off by the availability of loan commitments. In other words, there may be a demand from investors for payoff patterns that can only be produced by firms that purchase loan commitments.  

# WHO IS ABLE TO BORROW UNDER BANK LOAN COMMITMENTS?  

Not all firms have access to loan commitments, even though loan commitments represent a valuable source of liquidity for all firms. It appears that loan commitments are available primarily to firms that maintain high cash flow. In contrast, firms with low operating cash flow cannot count upon loan commitments as a source of liquidity, so they tend to rely more on their own cash reserves in managing their liquidity.21 A reason for this is that banks use financial covenants with loan commitments, and firms must maintain high cash flow in order to remain compliant with these covenants.  

In addition to the issue of who is able to borrow under commitments, there is also the question of whether a borrower who purchases a loan commitment is actually able to borrow under the commitment. Because of the MAC clause associated with commitments, banks can refuse to honor their commitments when honoring is financially too expensive, as explained earlier. During the financial crisis of 2007–2009, when liquidity was scarce, it turns out that many banks did not honor their commitments. Overall, however, credit lines still helped mitigate the negative effect of the financial crisis on corporate spending.22  

# PRICING OF LOAN COMMITMENTS  

# The Model  

The Analogy Between Loan Commitments and Options  

We develop an approach for pricing loan commitments, based on the observation that their payoff structure resembles that of a common stock put option.23 As discussed in Chapter 1  a put option is the right to sell a security (the deliverable) at a fixed price during some fixed time interval, or at some fixed future date. The major components of this contract are the:  

1. identity of the deliverable,   
2. option price,   
3. strike price, and   
4. exercise date or period.  

For example, $\$500$ might be paid for the right to put (sell) 100 shares of General Motors common stock at $\$50$ per share (or $\$5000$ ) at any time over the next six months. The option price is $\$500$ , the strike price is $\$50$ per share, the deliverable is 100 shares of General Motors common stock, and the exercise dates are all dates extending over the next six months. The “writer” of the option accepts the $\$500$ option price in exchange for the responsibility to purchase 100 shares of GM stock for $\$5000$ at the discretion of the option buyer at any time during the next six months. (Some options are exercisable only at the end of the term, rather than at any time during the term.)  

Now consider the bank loan commitment. The loan commitment buyer pays a commitment fee (option price) for the right to put (sell) a security to the bank at a prespecified price over some pre-established time interval. The security is the commitment owner’s IOU (debt) and the strike price is the face (par) value of the loan, that is, the dollar amount of the borrowing. The time interval is the life of the commitment. Hence, in selling loan commitments, banks are writing put options where the underlying deliverable is the debt instrument of the commitment buyer. The commitment buyer will take down the commitment (exercise the put option) if the value of its debt instrument on the exercise date is less than the committed loan amount (the strike price). The difference between the loan amount and the debt instrument value at the time of commitment exercise represents the customer’s gain from exercising the commitment, and the present value of this gain at the time of commitment purchase should be the commitment fee or price the customer is willing to pay.  

# The Model  

Suppose we wish to value a loan commitment issued at $t=0$ that would allow the purchaser to borrow $\$9$ (the face value of the loan or strike price of the put option) at $t=1$ at some predetermined interest rate $i_{\mathrm{c}}.$ The maturity of the loan will be one period, that is, it will mature at $t=2$ , and the loan (if taken) will be free of default risk. Assume that the current one-period riskfree rate is $i_{0}.$ Assume that the one-period yield on the borrower’s debt at $t=1$ will either be $i_{1}^{+}>i_{0}$ or $i_{1}^{-}<i_{0}$ .  

The probability of $i_{1}^{+}$ is $p$ and the probability of $i_{1}^{-}$ is $1{-}p.$ Assume $i_{\mathrm{1}}^{+}>i_{\mathrm{c}}>i_{\mathrm{1}}^{-}$ . Everybody is risk neutral. What is the value of this fixed-rate commitment?  

# Solution  

At $t=1$ , suppose the spot yield on the borrower’s debt is $i_{1}^{-}$ . Then it is clear that the borrower has no incentive to take down the loan commitment since cheaper credit is available in the spot market. But if the spot yield is ${i}_{1}^{+}$ , then the borrower will take down the commitment since the commitment rate is ${i_{\mathrm{c}}<i_{\mathrm{l}}^{+}}$ The value of the borrower’s debt at $t=1$ in this state is:  

$$
\frac{F[1+i_{\mathrm{c}}]}{[1+i_{1}^{+}]}
$$  

where $F[1+i_{\mathrm{c}}]$ is the borrower’s future repayment obligation at $t=2$ , which is discounted back to $t=1$ at the spot yield $i_{1}^{+}$ . Note that the borrower is receiving $\$5$ from the bank when it takes down the loan, and in exchange the bank is receiving a debt security worth the amount given by (10.3)  That is, the borrower is selling the bank a debt security worth $F[1+i_{\mathrm{c}}]/[1+i_{\mathrm{l}}^{+}]$ for $\$1$ when it exercises its loan commitment put option. The gain to the borrower from exercising the put option is:  

$$
F{-}\frac{F[1+i_{\mathrm{c}}]}{[1+i_{\mathrm{l}}^{+}]}
$$  

The value of the loan commitment to the borrower at $t=0$ is then:  

$$
\frac{p\Big\{F-\frac{F[1+i_{\mathrm{c}}]}{[1+i_{\mathrm{l}}^{+}]}\Big\}}{[1+i_{0}]}
$$  

where the expression in Equation (10.4) is multiplied with the probability of the yield $i_{1}^{+}$ and is discounted back to $t=0$ at the riskless rate $i_{0}$ (since everybody is risk neutral).  

We have so far discussed the valuation of fixed-rate loan commitments. Variable-rate commitments can be valued similarly. The add-on to the index rate in the variable-rate commitment would be held fixed. However, this add-on is a premium charged by the bank for the customer’s default risk in excess of that reflected in the index rate. Thus, the customer will exercise the commitment whenever the fixed add-on is smaller than the add-on the customer would be charged in the spot market. Once again, we have a put option purchased by the commitment buyer. The difference is that with a fixed-rate commitment the customer is purchasing protection against an increase in its total borrowing cost (which includes an increase in the index rate as well as in the add-on reflecting borrower-specific risk), whereas with a variable-rate commitment the customer is purchasing protection only against an increase in the add-on due to a decline in its own credit rating.  

# Empirical Predictions of Valuation Model  

The valuation model developed above suggests that borrowers purchase loan commitments to lock in borrowing rates. Hence, more commitments should be exercised when borrowers experience an increase in their cost of spot-market borrowing.  

There is abundant anecdotal evidence to support this prediction. For example, in 1990, Travelers Corporation, a (then independent) Hartford-based insurance company, drew down a substantial portion of its $\$1.075$ billion credit line after the  

major rating agencies downgraded its credit rating (and thereby increased its cost of borrowing in the spot credit market). It was reported that the company sought to ensure liquidity and assure its access to short-term funding after boosting loanloss reserves by $\$650$ million.18  

Another testable prediction of the valuation model is that the cost of loan commitments should increase as the volatility (future uncertainty) of the customer’s spot borrowing rate increases. This prediction follows immediately from the wellknown property of put options that they increase in value as uncertainty in the future value of the underlying asset increases.  

# THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LOAN COMMITMENTS AND PUT OPTIONS  

While there is a striking similarity between a common stock put option and a bank loan commitment, there are also important differences. Four key differences are as follows:  

1. An exchange-traded put option is a binding contract – the option seller is legally liable for the contractual payment if the option is exercised. By contrast, due to the MAC clause, a bank loan commitment is a discretionary contract.   
2. An exchange-traded option is a transferable contract, whereas a loan commitment is not. That is, if firm A buys a loan commitment from a bank, it cannot sell this commitment to firm B – loan commitments are not transferable. The commitment owner may of course exercise the commitment and lend the proceeds to firm B, but this is yet a different transaction.   
3. Loan commitment pricing differs from that of exchange-traded options. For example, a loan commitment may include a usage fee that is an increasing function of the unused portion of the line. This is inconsistent with the option pricing formulation. One way to understand usage fees is in the context of the earlier explanation that banks may offer loan commitments because they provide information about future loan demand. Deviations of actual takedowns from expected takedowns under commitments represent prediction errors that may be costly to the lender. For example, if the lender incurs a cost of preparation (funding) to make the expected loan and therefore finds it costly to invest the planned funds in something other than the loan, then the lender’s cost increases with the error in takedown prediction. Assessing a fee on the unused portion of the commitment is a way to induce the customer to provide the lender more accurate information about future loan demand.   
4. A put option is either exercised in full, or not at all. Loan commitments typically do not exhibit such takedown behavior. Loan takedowns, $F^{*}$ , are usually only some fraction of $F$ the face value of the commitment. There are two possible explanations for this partial takedown phenomenon: a. The customer lacks the “need” for all of the funds that can be borrowed under the commitment. b. The customer has a long-term relationship with the bank and seeks to foster good relations by not fully exploiting windfalls.  

Consider (a) first. Its reasonableness depends on the customer’s access to nonnegative NPV investment opportunities. If the customer’s financial leverage is unrestricted and it has unlimited investment opportunities that yield nonnegative NPVs, then we can expect its demand for funds to be highly elastic to its borrowing rate, and the commitment is likely to be exercised in full or not at all, as implied by the option valuation model. However, positive-NPV investment opportunities are typically limited. Moreover, their ability/willingness to borrow under the commitment may be constrained by capital structure considerations, including restrictions imposed by covenants in outstanding debt contracts. In this case, loan demand will be imperfectly elastic to interest rates, and partial takedowns would then be possible. This is illustrated in Figure 10.5  

When the customer’s spot borrowing rate is $i^{*}$ and its commitment rate is $i_{\mathrm{c}}.$ its loan demand is $F^{*}$ , which is less than the credit line $F$ The bank’s loan supply function under the commitment is a vertical line, indicating that the bank is willing to lend any amount up to $F$ at $i_{\mathrm{c}}$ under the commitment. With a spot borrowing rate of $i$ the loan supply function may look like that indicated in the graph. This function says that the bank is willing to lend any amount up to some number (possibly) exceeding $F$ at a rate of $i^{*}$ and that the amount the bank is willing to lend may not increase for relatively small increases in the interest rate beyond $i^{*}$ ; for sufficiently higher rates, the bank may be willing to lend more.  

Now consider (b). A customer’s takedown behavior may be seen as influencing the future pricing or availability of bank services. This link presupposes some cost to the borrower of changing banks or incomplete exchange of information among banks. For example, information reusability will give the incumbent bank an advantage over competing banks with respect to information about the customer. This could enable the incumbent to offer credit at better terms than competitors could, thereby making it costly for the customer to switch to another bank. Now, since the customer’s exercise of the commitment imposes a loss on the bank, it is reasonable to expect the bank to adjust its loan commitment pricing based on observed takedowns. For example, if the customer develops a reputation with the bank for taking down no more than $50\%$ of its line of credit, the bank will begin to price the loan commitment taking that into account. This will yield a lower commitment price than if the customer took down $100\%$ of the previous commitment. Alternatively, the bank will raise the commitment price if it expected the customer to take down $30\%$ of the previous commitment and it actually took down $50\%$ . Of course, one could argue that the customer should explicitly reduce the size of the commitment if it does not plan to use all of it. However, the customer may still request a larger commitment than it needs under normal circumstances because of the possibility that an unexpectedly large credit need may arise in the future. But to the extent that the bank perceives that the probability of that happening is low, the price of the commitment will be lowered by the customer’s previous partial takedowns. This phenomenon is similar to an automobile owner choosing not to file some auto collision claims with his insurance company due to the (adverse) learning the insurance company engages in when a claim is filed. In Table 10.3 we summarize the similarities and differences between loan commitments and put options.

# LOAN COMMITMENTS AND MONETARY POLICY  

Regulators conduct monetary policy by altering the quantity of credit or money supply and its price (interest rates). Loan commitments are a source of slippage in the Fed’s ability to conduct monetary policy.24 The reason is that once a commitment is sold, the amount of lending is determined by the customer’s demand for funds at the prespecified interest rate. Now suppose the Fed wishes to implement a contractionary monetary policy. Using open market operations, the Fed would sell securities and drive up interest rates. While the higher interest rates reduce the demand for spot credit, they make borrowing under prearranged loan commitments more attractive and thereby increase takedowns.25 Total bank lending may thus actually expand in the short-run in response to a contractionary monetary policy. This short-run perversity is likely to be reversed eventually as banks adjust by reducing the volume of their loan commitments in subsequent periods. Nevertheless, the growth of loan commitments can increase money market turbulence and frustrate monetary policy efforts.  

# OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS: LETTERS OF CREDIT  

Loan commitments are not the only contingent claims that have registered striking growth in recent years. In this section, we discuss two others that have grown impressively, commercial and standby L/Cs.  

# Commercial Letters of Credit and Bankers Acceptances  

Commercial L/Cs are used to facilitate trade, most commonly international, and are one of the oldest of banking contracts. In a typical transaction involving an L/C, the exporter has limited knowledge of the importer’s ability to pay and limited ability to enforce contracts across national boundaries. The exporter therefore asks the importer to arrange for its bank to issue an $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{C}$ guaranteeing payment to the exporter upon presentation of the appropriate shipping documents. The exporter obtains the bill of lading and other shipping documents when goods are loaded on the ship for export. The L/C is a promise by the importer’s bank to pay the exporter, given the necessary shipping documents. Thus, as the third party to the transaction, the bank substitutes its own creditworthiness for that of the importer and thereby reduces the default risk confronting the exporter.  

When the exporter presents the necessary documents to the paying bank, it receives either a sight draft (immediate payment) or a time draft promising payment at some future date. In the latter case, the resulting instrument becomes a bankers acceptance, which is marketable and usually quite liquid. Thus, a bankers acceptance can be viewed as an outcome of a commercial L/C. Any draft “accepted” by a bank in the performance of its obligation under a commercial L/C is a bankers acceptance.26  

In other words, a commercial letter of credit is essentially a performance guarantee. It can be defined as a promise to endorse or “accept” a time draft conditional on prespecified terms being satisfied. The act of accepting the time draft implies that, from the exporter’s viewpoint, the bank’s promise to repay replaces that of the debtor, and this creates a negotiable security. Consequently, the bank bears the risk that the debtor (importer) may default. Figure 10.6 depicts the steps leading to the creation of Banker’s Acceptances. For simplicity, we have included only the importer’s bank. Sometimes the exporter’s bank is also involved as an intermediary between the exporter and the importer’s bank, and time drafts may be accepted by both banks, giving rise to “two-name paper.”  

If the importer’s (or buyer’s) bank accepts a time draft and thereby creates a bankers acceptance, it has two choices. It can either hold the acceptance or it can sell it in the secondary market. If it decides to hold the acceptance, it ends up funding the credit (it has essentially extended a loan to the importer), so that the act of acceptance is automatic. However, if the acceptance is sold in the secondary market, the holder of the acceptance will provide funding, but the bank guarantees payment.  

# Standby Letters of Credit  

A standby letter of credit also guarantees the performance of an “account party,” usually in a commercial or financial transaction, but it does not necessarily involve a funding transaction. A standby L/C issued by the “second party’s” (the buyer or debtor or the party that owes some sort of performance to the “first party”) bank obligates that bank to compensate the first party (the seller or the creditor or the party that is owed) in the event of a performance failure. The second party would then be liable to its bank for the disbursements the bank made under the L/C. From this perspective, standby and commercial L/Cs are similar. However, with a commercial L/C the issuing bank usually advances payment and is repaid by its customer, whereas with a standby L/C the bank makes payment only if its customer fails to fulfill a contractual obligation. Consequently, the bankers acceptances associated with commercial L/Cs have no counterpart among standby L/Cs.

FIGURE 10.6 The Letter of Credit, Banker’s Acceptance Nexus.  

Standby L/Cs are often used in international trade to facilitate transactions in which the seller has insufficient knowledge of the buyer’s creditworthiness. Of course, the seller must still rely on the buyer’s bank to “make good” on its promise, which is why there is often a second bank – typically the seller’s – that augments the issuing bank’s guarantee with its own. Such L/Cs are known as confirmed letters of credit.  

Standby L/Cs are also used to guarantee performance in contracts involving greater variety and complexity than the simple international trade contract described above. Through standby L/Cs, banks now operate in areas that were once the exclusive domain of bonding, title, and insurance companies. For example, suppose a builder promises to deliver a completed building by a prespecified date or face a predetermined penalty. The buyer could ask the builder to obtain a standby L/C to guarantee the contract. Thus, if the builder fails to keep its promise, the buyer can collect the penalty amount from the bank that issued the L/C. The builder would then be responsible to pay its bank the penalty amount disbursed earlier by the bank. In banking, standby L/Cs are used as credit enhancements for securitizations and backups for commercial paper when the market gets skittish, that is, they replace loan commitments, thereby avoiding the risk of the MAC clause.  

# The Option-Like Feature of Standby Letters of Credit  

Standby L/Cs can also be viewed as put options, like loan commitments. In the case of a loan commitment, the customer purchases an option to sell to the bank a security (the customer’s indebtedness) that may be of less value at the time of exercise than the exercise or strike price (the amount loaned to the customer). In the case of a standby L/C, the bank agrees to purchase from the creditor a claim (the debtor’s indebtedness) at par, contingent on the failure of the primary debtor to “perform,” that is, to honor the claim. That is, the “first party” (the creditor) has the option to “put” the primary debtor’s debt claim to the bank when nonperformance by the debtor renders the value of its debt claim less than par. In exchange for writing the option, the bank collects a fee. The option feature of a standby L/C implies that a bank that issues this instrument is conveying to the buyer a contingent claim and imposing on itself a contingent liability. The latter becomes an actual liability if the primary debtor fails to perform under the stipulations of a contract.  

One important difference between loan commitments and standby L/Cs as put options is in the random processes influencing the market values of the underlying claims in the two cases and in the consequent trigger mechanisms giving rise to exercise. In the case of a loan commitment, an increase in the customer’s spot borrowing rate, above the commitment. In the case of standby L/Cs, nonperformance by the debtor depresses the value of the claim below the strike price (the guaranteed value of the claim), prompting exercise of the option. Another important difference lies in enforceability. Unlike the loan commitment, the standby L/C does not have a MAC clause and is therefore more rigidly binding.  

# OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS: SWAPS  

# What Are Swaps?  

A swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange their exposure to a specific risk. The trade often involves an intermediary acting as either principal or broker.27 Thus, for example, a swap is a tool for managing various types of risk. Basically an interest rate swap involves exchanging interest payments on notional securities with different prospects such as duration or the method by which interest payments are determined. For example, suppose a firm has a floating-rate liability and a fixed-rate asset. Such a firm will suffer losses if interest rates rise sharply. Now suppose another firm has a fixed-rate liability and a floating-rate asset. This firm will suffer losses if interest rates fall sharply. These two firms could arrange a swap to exchange their interest payments and thereby reduce their exposures to interest rate risk.  

Interest rate swaps were first used in the Eurobond market during 1981. Large international banks, which lend mostly on a floating-rate basis, were the first to use swaps in which they exchanged the fixed-rate interest obligations on their liabilities for lower-cost floating-rate interest payments on equivalent notional amounts of claims. The swap market migrated to the United States in 1982 when the first domestic swap took place between Sallie Mae (Student Loan Marketing Association) and the ITT Financial Corporation. Since then this market has experienced explosive growth, and is now worth trillions of dollars of notional claims.  

A typical swap involves the exchange of a fixed for a floating rate over an agreed amount (notional amount) for a specific period; the floating rate is typically indexed to the LIBOR, the prime, or the T-bill rate.  

# How a Swap Works?  

Suppose we have two firms. Firm A is a bank with $\$150$ million of loans that promise a floating interest rate of prime plus 25 basis points, financed with $\$150$ million of 10-year bonds promising fixed $10\%$ interest rate. Firm B is an S&L with $\$150$ million of fixed-rate mortgages financed with short-term MMFs (money market funds) and CDs with interest rates indexed to the T-bill rate. Each institution is exposed to interest rate risk that it wishes to hedge.  

We could now arrange a $\$150$ million, 10-year interest rate swap between the bank and the S&L. The swap may be structured as follows. The S&L agrees to pay the bank a fixed rate of $10\%$ per year on $\$150$ million, for 10 years. In return, the bank agrees to make the S&L a floating-rate payment at 2.5 basis points above prime, on a $\$150$ million principal. In this way the bank and the S&L have effectively exchanged their liabilities. Each has now hedged its interest rate exposure since the fixed-rate liability more closely matches the S&L’s fixed-rate assets, whereas the floating-rate liability more closely matches the bank’s floating-rate assets. Figure 10.7 depicts this arrangement.  

Early on, swap transactions normally involved an intermediary functioning as a broker – typically a commercial bank or an investment banker.  

More recently, intermediaries have performed more like asset transformers, effectively providing guarantees to both parties to a swap transaction. For example, if the bank in the above transaction defaults, the intermediary would collect the fixed $10\%$ from the S&L and make payments to it at 25 basis points above prime. Thus, it would assume the role of the bank until it can find an appropriate firm to replace the departed bank. And to the extent that it may not have the bank’s balance sheet, the swap broker would expose itself to interest rate risk. For example, if interest rates were to rise sharply, the intermediary would lose.28

FIGURE 10.7 An Example of an Interest Rate Swap.  

Traditionally the most common type of swap was the one described in our example, namely that involving a dollar fixed-rate loan swapped for a dollar floating-rate loan. Such a swap is called a “plain vanilla” swap. Recently, however, different types of swaps have proliferated. One is a floating-to-floating swap where parties agree to swap floating rates based on different index rates. For example, a bank whose assets are floating-rate loans at prime plus 20 basis points and whose liabilities are floating-rate CDs at LIBOR minus 40 basis points may wish to swap the interest payments on its liabilities with those of an institution that has the interest rate on its liabilities indexed to the prime rate. Such swaps are known as basis swaps.  

Another popular swap involves currencies. For example, a bank may have foreign loans financed by domestic deposits, so that the interest payments on its loans may be denominated in Japanese yen, while the interest payments on its deposits may be denominated in dollars. Such a bank might wish to swap its yen-denominated payments for dollar-denominated payments (perhaps with a Japanese bank that has dollar-denominated loans financed by yen-denominated deposits raised in Japan).  

There are two common types of currency swaps: traditional fixed/fixed currency swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps. A fixed/fixed currency swap involves fixed interest rates in each currency. Principal may or may not be exchanged. If principal is exchanged, this kind of swap transforms a fixed coupon bond denominated in one currency into a fixed coupon bond in another currency. With a cross-currency interest rate swap one exchanges a fixed payments stream for a floating payment stream, as well as payments in different currencies. These contracts are occasionally combined in a single transaction, and sometimes the currency and interest rate components are separated. There are other variations as well. For example, there are swaps in which the two parties exchange yields on assets of different maturities (or currency denominations), rather than interest payments on liabilities. The point is that a swap can be tailor-made to suit the needs of the swapping parties, so that the potential variety of swaps is almost limitless. Some of these are discussed in the next subsection.  

# Swaps and Swap-Related Innovations  

(a) Interest Rate Swap Variations: Some variations on the basic interest rate swaps are listed below.  

 Amortizing Swap: This is a swap in which the notional principal amount diminishes over the life of the swap in a specified manner. This may be done so that payments match the expected cash flows of a financing project or the prepayment schedule of a mortgage.   
 Indexed Amortization Swap: This is an amortizing swap in which the amortization of the notional principal depends on the stochastic value of some index like say the 3-month LIBOR. Forward Swap: This is a swap that does not begin until a designated future date. The fixed rate in the swap is linked to spot market rates, and the swap must be executed on the prespecified date.  

 Step Up/Down: This is a swap in which the fixed-rate payments level varies, either increasing or decreasing over some portion of the swap term. For example, the fixed rate in the swap might be set below the market for the first 2 years, with an above-market rate for the remainder of the term.  

# (b) Swaps Involving Asset Payoffs Other Than Interest Rates  

Commodity Swaps: In a commodity swap, the contracting parties agree to exchange payments based on the value of a particular physical commodity, for example, gold, oil, or silver. One party pays a fixed price for the commodity and receives the spot price of the commodity at some future date. This relatively new contract that may appeal to commodity fund managers is generally short (2–3 years), but maturities up to 7 years are available.   
 Indexed Returns Swaps: In this swap, one of the payments is linked to the total return of a market portfolio, like the S&P 500. This return can be exchanged for a payment stream based on either a fixed rate, such as the current T-bill rate (for a specific maturity) plus 30 basis points, or some floating rate (e.g., the LIBOR). An interesting type of indexed return swap is a foreign indexed swap, which is designed to capture the relative performances of security types (e.g., U.S. equities vs. Japanese equities). For example, suppose an investor owns a 5-year U.S. floating-rate note yielding LIBOR plus 50 basis points. This investor wants to invest in Japanese government bonds, but cannot trade the securities directly and wants to manage the foreign-exchange risk. He can enter into a swap whereby he receives the dollar equivalent of the monthly returns on the Japanese bond and pays LIBOR, giving him a total return equal to the Japanese bond return plus 50 basis points. Mortgage Swaps: This is a swap that replicates all or a portion of the return characteristics of mortgage securities. In the most basic structure, a mortgage yield is exchanged for a floating-rate return, and the notional balance on which the payments are based is amortized according to either a specified schedule or the actual prepayment experience of the underlying pool of mortgages. The most recent innovation in this class is an indexed amortization swap in which a fixed-rate payment is exchanged for a floating-rate payment, but the notional balance amortizes according to a schedule that depends on the movements in the yield of a prespecified security. For example, if the yield on the security falls by somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points, then the balance will amortize by $7\%$ over the next period.  

# (c) Derivative Securities Based on Swaps  

Swaptions: With a swaption, one of the contracting parties has the option to allow an existing swap to be terminated or extended. These contracts are also called cancelable, callable, or putable swaps, and they can either be American or European in their options characteristics. Thus, a swaption is basically an option on a swap. Suppose two parties, A and B, enter into a contract in which A sells a call swaption to B. Then, at the exercise date, B can choose whether or not to exercise the option. If B exercise his option, he enters into a swap to receive, say, a fixedrate payment in exchange for a floating-rate payment. These payment terms are all prespecified, as in a regular swap. The only difference is that one of the two parties has the legal right to decide whether or not to execute the swap at a future date. Caps: A cap is a swap contract in which the interest payments themselves have option characteristics. That is, the exercise (strike) price is set at particular interest rate levels. For example, suppose party A goes to a swap broker and buys a cap based on the 3-month LIBOR from a “cap writer” (party B), who represents the other party to the contract. Party A pays a premium (the price of the options) to the swap broker who subtracts his fee and passes along the remainder to party B. Now, party B is obliged to periodically (on each reset date) pay party A an amount equal to:  

$$
\mathrm{notionalprincipal}\times\mathrm{max}\{0,3\mathrm{-monthspotLIBOR-strikerate}\},
$$  

where max $(x,y)$ means the greater of $x$ and $y$ Suppose the strike rate is $10\%$ . Then if the 3-month spot LIBOR is $12\%$ , party B must pay party A an amount equal to $2\%$ of the notional principal, whereas if the 3-month spot LIBOR is $9\%$ , party B pays nothing on the reset date. Thus, a cap is simply a sequence of consecutive expiration options. These options can be viewed as call options on the specified interest rate or put options on the underlying security. When rates rise, the security’s price falls and the option becomes more valuable. As with a standard common stock option, the value of a cap (and hence the initial option premium) increases as the interest rate rises.  

The cap market has developed numerous derivatives and customizations. Some of these are:  

Floors: Here party B pays party A an amount equal to notional principal $\times\operatorname*{max}\{$ {0, strike rate – spot market rate on a specific security} on the date of exercise (reset date) of the periodic option.  Collars: Here party B pays A an amount equal to notional principal $\times[\{0\}$ , (spot rate – cap strike rate)} – max{0,(floor strike rate – spot rate)}]. That is, A is buying a cap from B and simultaneously selling a floor to B.  

Suppose the cap strike rate is $15\%$ and the floor strike rate is $10\%$ . Then if the spot rate on the chosen security is $17\%$ , the spot rate minus the cap strike rate is $2\%$ , so party A receives $2\%$ of the notional principal. If the spot rate is $9\%$ , then the floor strike rate minus the spot rate is $1\%$ , and party A receives $1\%$ of the notional principal. If the spot rate falls between the cap and floor strike rates (say at $12\%$ ), then party A receives nothing.  

# Advantages and Disadvantages of a Swap as a Hedging Instrument  

Since a swap is an instrument to hedge interest rate risk, it is natural to ask how it compares with other ways of hedging interest rate risk. We now compare swaps with two alternatives: interest rate futures and debt refinancing.  

# Swap Versus Interest Rate Futures  

# What is a Futures Contract?  

An interest rate futures contract is an exchange-based contract (as opposed to over-the-counter) to buy or sell a particular financial asset (such as a T-bill) for a specific price at a prespecified date in the future.  

Before we can compare swap with a futures contract, you should be aware of how a futures contract can be used to hedge. Consider an S&L with long-term fixed-rate mortgages as assets and short-term CDs as liabilities. Suppose this S&L were to short (sell) a CD futures contract, that is, it could promise to deliver (sell) at a fixed price. Then, if interest rates rise in the future, the market value of the CD falls and thus the S&L receives a cash inflow equal to the (positive) difference between the fixed delivery price and the market value of the CD.29 On the other hand, if interest rates fall and the market value of the CD rises as a result, the S&L will experience a loss. Thus, the gain to the S&L if rates rise is offset by the loss if rates fall. In this way, the S&L’s interest rate exposure is hedged.  

# Advantage of a Swap Over a Futures Contract  

Interest rate futures are standardized contracts with specific delivery dates and specific types of instruments.30 Thus if you wish to hedge the interest rate risk on a financial claim that is not one of the deliverable instruments on which futures contracts are written, you must choose a futures contract on a deliverable that most closely resembles the claim you wish to hedge. Since the resemblance will be imperfect, you will bear cross-hedging risk. Moreover, even if the resemblance were perfect, you would bear basis risk (the risk that the relation between the spot and futures prices will change randomly). The major advantage of a swap contract over a futures contract is that a swap can be tailored to suit the customer’s need because it is not a standardized contract. Thus, better interest rate hedging is often possible with a swap than with a futures contract. Note, however, that swaps are increasingly becoming more standardized and hence similar to futures contracts, but with longer hedging periods.  

# Disadvantages of a Swap  

(i) Imperfect standardization means that it is not always easy to find a counterparty to the desired swap transaction. That is, futures contracts are more liquid than swaps contracts. (ii) Related to (i), the highly customer-specific nature of swaps means that search costs may be significant in some transactions. These costs will be passed on to the swapping parties by the swap broker, in the form of a higher fee. Thus, customers face higher transactions costs with swaps than with futures. (iii) There is a greater risk of nonperformance (default) with a swaps contract than with a futures contract. This is because the exchange guarantees execution with a futures contract, whereas with a swap one party could be left in the cold if the other party reneges and there is no (backup) guarantee by the swap broker. If there is a backup guarantee by the swap broker, then the swap broker plays the role of a clearinghouse. But even in this case, there is the possibility of nonperformance by the swap broker. Following the 2007–2009 financial crisis, there have been various legislative initiatives aimed at reducing counterparty risk by enforcing standardization and requiring clearing and settlement via Central Counter Parties (CCPs).  

# Swaps Versus Refinancing  

# How do you Hedge Risk by Refinancing?  

One simple way for a firm to adjust its interest rate exposure is to directly refinance. That is, suppose a firm has fixed-rate liabilities and desires floating-rate liabilities. It could simply repurchase its fixed-rate liabilities, financing the repurchase by issuing floating-rate liabilities. Why is this simple approach not always preferred to swaps and futures?  

# Advantages of a Swap Over Debt Refinancing  

(i) Swaps avoid many of the transactions costs encountered with debt refinancing, such as legal fees, advertising, and regulatory restrictions. This is because a swap is not considered new borrowing or a public offering. Rather, it is only regarded as an exchange of interest payments on existing liabilities. (ii) Swaps also avoid many disclosure requirements of new financing because they are not considered new borrowing. This may be of importance to firms that wish to protect the confidentiality of strategic information. (iii) Many firms with low credit ratings pay a higher differential on fixed-rate debt, relative to floating-rate debt, than higher quality firms do. Such low-quality firms may wish to borrow in the floatingrate market and then swap these floating-rate liabilities for fixed-rate liabilities, perhaps avoiding some of the credit risk premium they would need to pay on newly issued debt. Thus, an important reason for the emergence of interest rate swaps (given the availability of direct debt refinancing) may well be that the search costs and credit evaluation costs encountered in nonintermediated (public debt market) transactions can be effectively lowered by financial intermediaries (swap brokers) who specialize in mitigating such informational frictions.  

# OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS: CREDIT DERIVATIVES  

An important development in the contingent-claims markets that banks are involved in is credit derivatives, a market that barely existed until 1997, but is now trillions of dollars in magnitude. The basic idea behind a credit derivative is simple. A lender essentially purchases from a third party a put option on the borrower’s debt, which entitles the lender to “put” the debt, if its value is impaired due to, say, default, to the third party. This way the lender purchases insurance against credit risk. Banks have been active players on both sides of this market, both as purchasers of credit risk insurance and as sellers of this insurance.  

Figure 10.8 shows the explosive growth of the credit derivatives market from 1996 through 2010.31 Moreover, with the spread of securitization to the credit-derivatives market, there is pooling and tranching of diverse credit risks. This enables idiosyncratic shocks to individual credit risks to be diversified away and risks to be spread out over many market participants. In principle, this could offer benefits. However, the 2007–2009 financial crisis has exposed the downside of this development in terms of elevating some types of risks; see Chapter 14 on the financial crisis.  

The development of the credit derivatives market has been facilitated by the growing standardization of credit-derivatives contracts, and the creation of indices that offer hedges against pools of U.S. as well as non-U.S. corporate credits, such as European and Japanese corporate credits. While initial credit derivatives were simple credit default swaps involving single companies, much of the recent growth has been via pooling together of numerous credits and then tranching as in other forms of securitization (see the next chapter). Securitization has also invited significant institutional participation in this market. It is estimated that a large percentage of the trading volume in credit derivatives is accounted for by hedge funds (discussed earlier in the book).

# RISKS FOR BANKS IN CONTINGENT CLAIMS  

# An Overview of Risks  

With the enormous growth in the contingent claims products offered by banks, there has been growing concern that their balance sheets grossly underestimate their risks. The reasons for concern are twofold. First, because contingent claims have not required reserves or capital to support them, it has been quite tempting for banks to sell these claims in large volume, so that the OBS risk for any individual bank can become substantial. If the bank is lucky, it earns its fee revenues from sales of these claims, without suffering the adverse consequences of risk. But if things go sour, the bank could experience capital impairment, which in turn could provide further incentives for it to take risk because of the (put option) nature of deposit insurance. Of course, under the BIS capital guidelines, banks are now required to hold capital against OBS claims, so that their attractiveness to banks may decline somewhat. Second, contingent claims often create interlocking relationships across banks that could strengthen the contingent effect of bank failures.  

We can now address the risks in individual contingent claims.  

# Risks in Loan Commitments  

Regulators regard loan commitments as the second-riskiest contingent claim, just behind standby L/Cs, which are discussed below. A bank faces three types of risks in loan commitments: (i) the risk that it may have to lend at a lower-than-spotmarket margin or even a negative margin due to fixity in the commitment rate, (ii) the risk that it may be forced to lend to higher-risk customers than its spot market, given the pool, that is, borrowers it would not have loaned to in the spot market, given the conditions at the time of commitment takedown, and (iii) the risk that it may have to fund commitment when its own liquidity is low and costly to replenish. Each of these risks is discussed below.  

1. The Risk of Lending at Low Margins: One risk in loan commitments is that the bank may be compelled to grant loans at interest rates that either reduce profits relative to spot lending opportunities, or result in direct losses. This risk is lower per dollar of commitment with variable-rate commitments, but is present nonetheless. For example, the commitment may permit the customer to borrow at prime plus $1\%$ . The bank cannot be assured, however, that the customer’s creditworthiness will not deteriorate between the time the commitment is issued and the time that it is exercised. A customer who is “prime plus one” when the prime is $10\%$ is likely to be riskier than “prime plus one” when the prime climbs to $20\%$ . The creditworthiness of a borrower can be expected to vary inversely with market interest rates since higher interest rates will usually absorb a greater fraction of the borrowing firm’s cash flows. Thus, even under a variable-rate commitment the bank is exposed to the risk of earning a lower interest rate on commitment loans than it would if the same funds were invested in spot loans with the same credit risk.  

The prime-times contract addresses this linkage between the prime and the customer’s add-on. This contract imposes opportunity costs of the type described above only when the customer’s appropriate add-on rises by more than the percent indicated in the commitment. Although the prime-times contract imposes some risk on the bank, the bank’s exposure per dollar under this contract is less than for the prime-plus contract. This is because customer add-ons for spot borrowing tend to increase exponentially (as in 2, 4, 8, 16. . .) with increase in the prime rate, rather than proportionally (as in 2, 4, 8. . .) as in the prime-times commitment contract.  

Even if the customer’s creditworthiness does not vary with market interest rates, the bank faces a risk with loan commitments due to sluggishness in the prime rate.32 This sluggishness means that the bank’s funding cost is only imperfectly correlated with the prime, so that as the bank’s funding cost changes with movements in market interest rates, the bank will need to adjust the add-on (or multiple) to the prime that it charges the borrower. In a variable-rate commitment this add-on (multiple) is held fixed, so that as interest rates rise, the add-on (multiple) the bank should charge to break even grows larger and larger than the commitment add-on (multiple). At sufficiently high prime rates, the bank’s spread between the commitment rate and its cost of funds may well invert and become negative. Of course, the reverse is true when rates are falling, but there is an asymmetry due to the option nature of the commitment since the customer will simply let the commitment expire unexercised. This is a risk that the bank does not face with spot lending because it can always adjust the add-on to the prime to reflect the prime’s sluggishness in responding to market interest rate movements.  

2. The Risk of Being Forced to Lend to Excessively Risky Customers: Loan commitments also may expose banks indirectly to increased credit risk. The relationship between interest rate and credit risks is manifested in two ways. First, as interest rates increase and become more volatile, the economic value of the cash flows generated by the customer’s investments may become smaller and more uncertain. That is, when inflation increases, the percentage spread between nominal and real interest rates is likely to widen more than the percentage spread between nominal and real cash flows. Thus, under both fixed- and variable-rate commitments, high and volatile interest rates can expose the bank to increased credit risk. Second, high and volatile interest rates can increase credit risk through an asset substitution effect (recall the credit rationing discussion in Chapter 8) that is more likely with variable-rate commitments. The customer can be expected to adapt to a higher borrowing rate by choosing investment projects with higher expected payoffs, and these usually would have been rationed in the spot market. Note that this risk is different from that discussed under (i) in that the risk there is that the bank’s profit margin on “acceptable” borrowers – those it would not have rationed in the spot market – may become too low, and the risk here is that the bank may have to lend to “unacceptable” borrowers. This risk is obviously absent in spot lending.  

Of course, the MAC clause is supposed to enable the bank to extricate itself from a commitment to a borrower whose financial condition has deteriorated significantly. The safety provided by this clause may be limited, however, due to the bank’s reputation-driven reluctance to invoke the MAC.33  

3. The Risk of Funding Commitments in Low-Liquidity Periods: There are two reasons why a bank may find itself liquidity constrained. One is that there may be a marketwide decline in liquidity. The other is that there may be bank-specific problems that cause familiar sources of liquidity to become substantially more expensive or even dry up. In either case, commitments become costlier to fund, a risk that is not encountered with spot lending.  

# Risks in Letters of Credit  

Commercial L/Cs are used for routine trade transactions and carry with them credit risk, whereas standby L/Cs are mainly financial guarantees under which, in exchange for fees, banks guarantee a variety of financial obligations of borrowers to specified third parties. These pledges include credit enhancement facilities to municipal borrowers, commercial paper issuers, and those involved in securitizations. Banks consider these guarantees risky because they are irrevocable and are activated by borrower financial distress.  

There are three basic types of risks faced by banks in L/Cs: (i) credit risk, (ii) documentation risk, and (iii) political risk. We discuss each in turn.  

# Credit Risk  

Commercial and standby L/Cs differ in that the bank pays on performance with commercial L/Cs and on nonperformance with standby L/Cs. This difference is not that significant for the bank’s risk exposure, however, since it is not the ability of the debtor to perform the stipulated task that determines the bank’s risk. Rather, the bank’s risk in both cases turns on the debtor’s reimbursement of the bank. Thus, one risk the bank faces with either a commercial or a standby L/C is routine credit risk. Bankers have recognized the similarity between the risks faced in normal lending and in issuing L/Cs. Although L/Cs are originated in a number of “nontraditional” divisions within the bank, such as municipal or corporate finance divisions, bankers say they apply the same credit screening procedures to standby L/Cs that they apply to their loans.  

It is often claimed that standby L/Cs are more risky than commercial L/Cs. One reason for this claim is that standby L/Cs pay on nonperformance, whereas commercial L/Cs pay on performance. As noted above, this distinction is not that significant for assessing the bank’s risk exposure across the two L/Cs. Another reason why standbys are considered riskier than commercial L/Cs is that the latter routinely generate collateral in the form of goods in storage or transit (“. . . commercial L/Cs are self-liquidating”), whereas standbys may be unsecured. However, collateral does not always accompany commercial L/Cs, and standby L/Cs are not always unsecured. Furthermore, financial distress often accompanies a decline in the value of the customer’s collateral, so that collateral may offer the bank only limited protection in the case of $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{Cs}$ .  

It is true, nonetheless, that regulators and banks consider standby L/Cs as the riskiest of all the contingent claims offered by banks. One reason may be that standby L/Cs are used to cover almost any contingency, whereas commercial L/Cs are used for routine trade transactions. Thus, standby L/Cs may be riskier simply because they cover a variety of contingencies.  

# Documentation Risk  

Documentation presents another source of risk in commercial L/Cs. Although this risk is routinely accepted by banks, a Federal Reserve survey found that in approximately $35\%$ of the cases examined, documentation failed to conform to the requirements of the L/C. Improper documentation can invalidate a contract and prompt the buyer to refuse to accept delivery. In this case, the bank will be forced to find a buyer on its own, or to take possession of the goods.  

# Political Risk  

U.S. exporters are sometimes unfamiliar with the foreign bank issuing an $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{C}$ . They may also be concerned about the political climate in the importer’s country. The exporter may, in these cases, obtain a confirmation from a U.S. bank that is then obliged to make payment if the drawee is unable to do so. The confirming (American) bank faces two risks. One is that the issuing (foreign) bank will default, and the other is the political risk of exchange controls.  

# Risks in Interest Rate Swaps  

Although swaps aggregate to trillions of dollars, this figure is the sum of the principal amounts involved in the deals. In fact, only the interest rate streams are at risk since each issuer retains its obligation for its own principal. Moreover, as swap brokers, the liabilities of banks are quite limited. There are two types of risks in swaps: (i) counterparty risk and (ii) legal risks. We discuss each now.  

# Counterparty Risk  

The biggest risk for the bank is that one of the swap partners will be unable to make its interest payments. The bank then has to either assume the interest payments for the defaulting party or replace the defaulting party; this is essentially an exposure to interest rate risk. As an overall assessment, however, swaps appear to be the least risky of the three major contingent claims that we have discussed.  

# Legal Risks  

There may be significant hidden legal risks in swaps that have only recently begun to surface. For example, there have been cases in which a failed bank launched court proceedings against a solvent counterparty bank over a swap, claiming that the counterparty should have honored the swap contract even after the failed bank declared bankruptcy. This was done despite the fact that the terms of the contract allowed for “limited two-way payments,” under which if one party defaulted, the other was not liable for any payments under the contracts. (These are in contrast to “full two-way payment” contracts, under which both parties are obligated to make full payments under the swap contract even if one party defaults on other obligations. Solvent counterparty banks often make good on their liabilities (despite no contractual obligation to do so) because of reputational concerns and nervousness about whether their lack of contractual obligations would hold up in court if they refused to perform. This event vividly illustrates the manner in which a bank can use the contractual discretion in a contingent claim to (optimally) write down its reputational capital in order to conserve financial capital. It also shows that this trade-off is bank specific, since different banks have different reputations and different levels of financial capital.  

# REGULATORY ISSUES  

The Basel Accord (Basel 1) reached under the auspices of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in 1987, stipulated a new set of capital guidelines under which loan commitments with maturities under 1 year were not subject to capital requirements, whereas longer-maturity commitments had a $4\%$ capital requirement (which is half the capital requirement against most loans). Moreover, a commitment that the bank can unconditionally cancel without cause and for which it conducts an annual credit review (to decide whether it should be continued) was regarded as having a maturity under 1 year. Standby $\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{Cs}$ or other types of bank guarantees are also subject to capital requirements. The capital requirement against standby L/Cs is $8\%$ .  

Under the “standardized approach” of Basel III, off-balance-sheet-items will be converted into “credit exposure equivalents” through the use of “credit conversion factors” (CCFs).34 Commitments with an original maturity of up to one year will receive a CCF of $20\%$ , which means the capital to be allocated to it by the bank would be $20\%$ of the capital that would need to be allocated to the loan under the commitment. Commitments with maturities exceeding one year will receive a CCF of $50\%$ . Any commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank without prior notice, or that effectively provide automatic cancellation due to a deterioration in a borrower’s creditworthiness, will receive $0\%$ CCF. Standby L/Cs and acceptance will receive a CCF of $100\%$ , as will sale and repurchase agreements (repos).  

OBS items continue to be free of cash-asset reserve requirements. Thus, a bank need not hold cash-asset reserves against a loan commitment until the customer exercises it, at which stage the amount taken down is a loan. If the bank funds this loan with deposits, then it must hold reserves against these deposits. But if the bank chooses to sell the loan or securitize it (see Chapter 11), it can avoid the reserve requirement.  

The accounting treatment of contingent claims is another issue. Although many contingent claims impose contingent liabilities on banks, these liabilities do not appear on the balance sheet, except as footnotes. On the other hand, the fee collected by the bank is recognized on the income statement, albeit on the basis of an amortization schedule that requires recognition over the life of the contingency. Since the cash generated by the fee income augments the book value of the bank’s assets, whereas the (offsetting) contingent liability does not increase the book value of the bank’s liabilities, the sale of contingent claims permits a bank to artificially inflate the book value of its net worth. Moreover, since the fees collected and the contingent liabilities imposed can be expected to be larger during periods of greater interest rate volatility, the inflation of book net worth will be greater when interest rates are more volatile. This would not be the case if the liability diminishes at the pace the income is recognized, but this seems unlikely.  

# CONCLUSION  

In this chapter, we have reviewed the theory of commercial bank contingent claims and have commented upon their magnitude and growth. Loan commitments and L/Cs are an outgrowth of commercial bank lending in much the same way that agricultural futures markets are an outgrowth of grain trade. By the late nineteenth century, commercial banks had adopted the practice of informally assuring renewal of the short-term notes of their customers. It was a short step from such agreements to more formalized commitments. The emergence of loan commitments of the types observed today can be traced back to the early 1920s. That period marked a shift in attitude within the banking community from the “real bills” doctrine,35 focusing on short-term self-liquidating commercial loans, to the “shiftability” theory of funds management. The latter finds liquidity in a wider variety of bank claims, providing the basis for an increased willingness by bankers to precommit loans. Forward lending quickly developed into an integral part of commercial banking.  

The emergence of liability management in the 1960s along with the tight credit conditions of 1966 and 1969 increased loan commitment activity. Tight credit conditions induced borrowers to seek more loan commitment and the advent of liability management provided banks with new means of raising the funds required to meet this demand. The late 1960s and 1970s were characterized by interest rates that were both higher and more volatile. Increasing inflation led to greater loan demand and periodic credit crunches increased the demand for credit lines. Banks became less willing to offer fixed-rate commitments in the face of highly unpredictable interest rates and thus, many began to “float” the prime (the prime rate changed 40 times in 1980 as opposed to 23 times in the 13 years from August 1955 to December 1968) and offer variable-rate commitments that provided little or no protection against changes in the prime. Moreover, the increased interest rate volatility was accompanied by elevated volatility in the capital market and the foreign-exchange market. This made risk management critical for the customers of banks, and banks provided this service through a host of new derivatives and other contingent claims.  

We have also discussed how recent changes in regulation have led to the imposition of capital requirements on contingent claims. These regulatory changes mean that the supply-side incentives for commercial bank contingent claims have been weakened somewhat. Despite this, we expect contingent claims to continue to grow in importance in the future.  

# CASE STUDY: YOUNGSTOWN BANK  

# Introduction  

John Standard has been the CEO of Youngstown Bank since the summer of 1998. Before taking this position, he had been a vice president of operations for Interbank, a large regional bank. One of the primary reasons that he was hired by Youngstown Bank was his experience with a large operating department. At the time, Youngstown Bank had been going through some difficulties related to inefficient operating procedures, and Mr. Standard had acquired a reputation at Interbank for strong motivational and organizational skills. His management of Youngstown has been almost flawless, and the institutional culture of the bank takes great pride in the fact that the bank is a very “tight ship.”  

Youngstown Bank has been in business in Youngstown, Arizona, since 1910. When John Standard was brought in as CEO in 1998, the stock price was at $4\%$ , down from a high of 10. The previous CEO was the son of the founder, and he had resisted the replacement of legacy systems with more modern information processing infrastructure, allowing the operating departments to languish in mediocrity. Prior to Mr. Standard’s arrival, people barely even knew what the bank’s policies were on loans! The only kinds of products Youngstown Bank offered were simple fixed-rate loans. John Standard changed all that. He put together a set of standard procedures for loans and loan commitments, and attempted to tailor the bank’s policies to the risk and liquidity needs of its customers. And the stock price responded; by the end of 1999, Youngstown Bank’s stock price had doubled to $\$9$ , and continued to rise through 2000.  

But starting in 2001, the bank’s stock price has been languishing. Even though the bank’s basic structure has not changed and profitability is good, the stock price has simply not moved upward over time, although the stock prices of some competing banks have moved up significantly. The major shareholders in the bank aren’t too upset yet, but there have been a few grumblings. Standard realizes that there could be major trouble down the line unless he can find a way to get the share price up. He decides to call in his chief financial officer (CFO), Bryan Shelton, to discuss the stock price situation.  

# The Initial Meeting  

Standard: Come on in, Bryan, and have a seat. Let’s get right down to business here. I’m worried about our stock price performance lately.You’ve been withYoungstown Bank for three years now – what was the stock price when you got here? Shelton: It was right around 37, I think.  

Standard: Well, it is just over 40 now. We closed at $40\%$ yesterday. That’s only 3 dollars in 3 years! What is going on? I don’t understand it. Why is our stock price so low? Take a look at how our market-to-book ratio compares with that of our competitors. It is in the dirt! (See Exhibit A). Why?  

Shelton: That’s a good question. Considering how precisely we control everything, and considering that our profits and cash flows are still looking good, I don’t know of any reason why the stock should be down. I’m tempted to just say that the market is failing to recognize our value. Maybe they’ll come around when we post good numbers again next quarter.  

Standard: Well, you might be right, but I’m uncomfortable. Maybe the market is reacting to something that we don’t know about. I think we should look into this some more, and try to get to the bottom of it.  

[The meeting ends on that note, and Mr. Shelton says that he will look into the matter carefully and report back. He agrees that they should meet a week later to discuss the issue again.]  

# The Second Meeting  

Shelton: Well, I’ve looked into this some more, and frankly I’m still puzzled. Take a look at these numbers. Our current balance sheet looks good, and compares very favorably with the way it looked during 2000, the heyday of our stock price rise (see Exhibit B). Our key rations look just fine, too, compared to 2000 (see Exhibit C). Moreover, we also seem to be doing well relative to industry averages (see Exhibit D).  

Standard: This all looks great, just like I thought it would. Look at this one. (He points at Exhibit D.) Our return on assets is great. So what do you think?  

Shelton: Well, one of the people I had helping me to put these numbers together for you suggested that we might want to think about our loan commitments, which don’t appear on our balance sheet. Maybe those are dragging our stock price down. Standard: That doesn’t make sense. Our policies on loan commitments haven’t changed, have they? What kind of data do you have on those?  

Shelton: Well, take a look at these. (He pulls out Exhibits E and $F.$ ) These show the history of interest rates and the fees that we charge for loan commitments. I checked on the kinds of borrowers who’ve been buying these commitments, and the quality of the borrowers seems to be in line with our history. To tell you the truth, I’m still struggling with what all this stuff means. I don’t see that anything has changed anywhere. But our stock price. . .  

Standard: Well, all I can tell you is keep working on it. See if you can find anything here that will help explain why our stock price is low. Is there something that we’ve overlooked? Is the bank in some danger that we’ve failed to realize?  

[Again, the meeting ends and they agree to meet in a week. This time, Standard has some specific questions to which he wants answers. Shelton plans to go over everything carefully, looking for some explanation for the poor performance of the stock price, an explanation that takes into account all the facts about the bank’s situation.]

# The Assignment  

Mr. Standard gives Mr. Shelton these specific questions:  

1. Is the lack of upward movement in the stock price evidence of market irrationality or overreaction, or is something else going on? 2. What should the bank do? What strategies should the bank pursue? What, if any, are the major dangers faced by the bank?  

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. What is an OBS contingent claim, and what are the major types of contingent claims observed today?   
2. Define a loan commitment and briefly discuss the different types of loan commitments.   
3. Provide discussion of the supply-and-demand-side motivations for loan commitments.   
4. It has been claimed that a bank loan commitment has an isomorphic correspondence with a common stock put option. How valid is this claim?   
5. Discuss a commercial L/C, a standby L/C, and a bankers acceptance.   
6. What is an interest rate swap and how does it work?   
7. What is the role of a swap broker in an interest rate swap transaction?   
8. Discuss three variations of the “plain vanilla” swap.   
9. What are swaptions, caps, collars, and floors?   
10. What are the advantages and disadvantages of an interest rate swap relative to a futures contract as a hedging instrument?   
11. What is the advantage of a swap over direct financing for hedging interest rate risk?   
12. Discuss the risks faced by commercial banks in loan commitments, L/Cs, and interest rate swaps.   
13. Suppose a borrower knows at $t=0$ that it will have available at $t=1$ an opportunity to invest $\$175$ in a risky project that will pay off at $t=2$ . The borrower knows that it will be able to invest in one of two mutually exclusive projects, S or R, each requiring a $\$175$ investment. If the borrower invests in S at $t=1$ , the project will yield a gross payoff of $\$310$ with probability 0.8 and zero with probability 0.2 at $t=2$ . If the borrower invests in R at $t=1$ , the project will yield a gross payoff of $\$330$ with probability 0.6 and zero with probability 0.4 at $t=2$ . The borrower’s project choice is not observable to the bank.  

The riskless, single-period interest rate at $t=0$ is $12\%$ . It is not known at $t=0$ what the riskless, single-period interest rate at $t=1$ will be, but it is common knowledge that this rate will be 8 percent (with probability 0.6) or $15\%$ (with probability 0.4). Assume universal risk neutrality and that the borrower has no assets other than the project on which you (as the lender) can have any claim.  

Suppose you are this borrower’s banker and both you and the borrower recognize that this borrower has two choices: (i) it can either do nothing at $t=0$ and simply plan to borrow in the spot market at the interest rate prevailing for it at $t=1$ , or (ii) it can negotiate at $t=0$ with you (or some other bank) for a loan commitment that will permit it to borrow at predetermined terms at $t=1$ . What advice should you give this borrower? Assume a competitive loan market in which each bank is constrained to earn zero expected profit.  

14. The following is an excerpt from a conversation. Critique it.  

Appleton: That’s simple, Mike. The BIS stipulations are minimum levels, whereas the Treasury proposal gives banks choices above the BIS minima. What bothers me about the BIS guidelines, though, is that they also require banks to hold capital against off-balance sheet items. When these items get on the balance sheet, there is another capital requirement against them, so aren’t we in a sense double counting?  

Butterworth: Not really, because there is not simultaneity involved. I think that with a trillion dollars in outstanding loan commitments alone, the issue of the contingent liability exposure of American banks is something that we just have to come to grips with. The way that RAP (Regulatory Accounting Principles) and GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) have dealt with these contingent liabilities has been deplorable. I strongly believe depository institutions should be made to recognize these liabilities on their balance sheets, not merely in footnotes.  

Appleton: Beth, I think you are getting a bit carried away. Nobody has any idea how these contingent liabilities should be valued, so how do you quantify your exposure?  

Butterworth: Speak for yourself, Alex. There are valuation models available, although I will admit they are far from perfect. But even noisy information is better than none.  

15. Critique the following excerpt from a conversation.  

Moderator: Hold it there people. Remember, I cannot be here forever. I thought we were discussing banking reform and deposit insurance. Does all this talk about off-balance sheet activities have anything to do with deposit insurance?  

Butterworth: That is a good question, Mike. I honestly do not know, but my guess is that contingent liabilities represent a hidden liability for the deposit insurance fund. The more contingent liabilities the bank has, the more risk there is in the banking system.  

Appleton: As both of you know, I believe that off-balance sheet activities are the future of banking, so Beth’s views on this trouble me. Perhaps she has some evidence to support her claim? Butterworth: No, Alex I do not. But I will research the matter.
