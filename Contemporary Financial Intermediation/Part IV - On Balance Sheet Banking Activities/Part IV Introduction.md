FHLB Federal Home Loan Bank. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, headed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was formerly the primary regulatory agency for savings and loan associations. The district home loan banks are now providers of financial services, including liquidity, to smaller commercial banks and thrifts.  

FHLMC This stands for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Also known as “Freddie Mac,” its basic function is to facilitate the provision of liquidity to lenders by purchasing existing mortgages from their portfolios. It finances these purchases by borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks, issuing GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed bonds, selling mortgage participation certificates on which it guarantees interest and principal, and selling guaranteed mortgage certificates.  

FNMA This stands for the Federal National Mortgage Association. It is a privately owned (stockholder-owned), government-sponsored enterprise. Also known as “Fannie Mae,” its basic function is to provide a secondary market in trading and securitizing home mortgages. It is the largest purchaser of residential mortgages in the United States. Its activities are similar to those of Freddie Mac, except that it faces no statutory limitations on the organizations with which it can conduct business.  

GNMA This stands for the Government National Mortgage Association. This is a wholly owned, corporate instrumentality of the U.S. government, operating within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Also referred to as “Ginnie Mae,” its role is to enhance liquidity in the market for mortgages. Ginnie Mae does this in a variety of ways. For example, many mortgages carry a fixed interest rate so that when market interest rates rise, existing mortgages sell at a discount (i.e., at less than face value). Ginnie Mae issues a commitment to the mortgage seller (e.g., the originating financial institution) to purchase the mortgage at a fixed price. After acquiring the loan, Ginnie Mae sells it to “Fannie Mae” at the prevailing market price. Ginnie Mae absorbs any discount from the price paid to the seller. Another function of Ginnie Mae is to guarantee securities backed by government-insured or guaranteed mortgages. That is, Ginnie Mae provides guarantees for securitized claims against portfolios of government-insured mortgages.

Optimal Stopping Rule A statistical decision rule that tells the decision-maker when to stop a sequential sampling process and make a decision. For example, a bank may have $\$1$ million to lend and knows that the longer it waits, the more loan applicants it can screen before deciding who to lend the money to. However, waiting is costly because of the time value of money. An optimal stopping rule in this case would specify conditions under which the bank would find it most profitable to stop screening further loan applications. Another example is determining when a bank should stop acquiring additional information about a borrower, and make a decision.  

Discriminant Analysis A statistical technique used to identify the factors most useful in predicting an event. An example would be the factors useful in predicting bankruptcy.  

The Glass–Steagall Act An act passed by Congress in 1933 to separate commercial and investment banking in the United States. It prohibits commercial banks from engaging in securities underwriting and other investment banking activities as well as the activities of insurance companies.
