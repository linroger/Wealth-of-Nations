# Spot Lending and Credit Risk  

“Neither a borrower nor a lender be; for loan oft loses itself and a friend, and borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.”  

William Shakespeare  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Loan The extension of credit via a typically untraded and illiquid debt contract.  

Security A financial claim, debt, or equity, which may be traded or untraded.  

COD Cash on delivery as a method of payment for goods received.  

Commercial Paper Unsecured debt, offered as a short-maturity (less than 270 days) security by corporations.  

T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds Debt securities of varying maturities issued by the U.S. government through the U.S. Treasury Department; hence, “T” for Treasury.  

FHLB Federal Home Loan Bank. The Federal Home Loan Bank System, headed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, was formerly the primary regulatory agency for savings and loan associations. The district home loan banks are now providers of financial services, including liquidity, to smaller commercial banks and thrifts.  

FHLMC This stands for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Also known as “Freddie Mac,” its basic function is to facilitate the provision of liquidity to lenders by purchasing existing mortgages from their portfolios. It finances these purchases by borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Banks, issuing GNMA-guaranteed mortgage-backed bonds, selling mortgage participation certificates on which it guarantees interest and principal, and selling guaranteed mortgage certificates.  

FNMA This stands for the Federal National Mortgage Association. It is a privately owned (stockholder-owned), government-sponsored enterprise. Also known as “Fannie Mae,” its basic function is to provide a secondary market in trading and securitizing home mortgages. It is the largest purchaser of residential mortgages in the United States. Its activities are similar to those of Freddie Mac, except that it faces no statutory limitations on the organizations with which it can conduct business.  

GNMA This stands for the Government National Mortgage Association. This is a wholly owned, corporate instrumentality of the U.S. government, operating within the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Also referred to as “Ginnie Mae,” its role is to enhance liquidity in the market for mortgages. Ginnie Mae does this in a variety of ways. For example, many mortgages carry a fixed interest rate so that when market interest rates rise, existing mortgages sell at a discount (i.e., at less than face value). Ginnie Mae issues a commitment to the mortgage seller (e.g., the originating financial institution) to purchase the mortgage at a fixed price. After acquiring the loan, Ginnie Mae sells it to “Fannie Mae” at the prevailing market price. Ginnie Mae absorbs any discount from the price paid to the seller. Another function of Ginnie Mae is to guarantee securities backed by government-insured or guaranteed mortgages. That is, Ginnie Mae provides guarantees for securitized claims against portfolios of government-insured mortgages.  

S&P Stock Index Standard & Poor’s composite index of 500 large-company stocks.  

centive Compatibility A condition that requires the alignment of incentives between the agent and the principal. See Chapter 1  

C&I Loans Commercial and Industrial loans. These are loans extended to nonfinancial firms.  

Nash Equilibrium A steady state attained when none of the contracting parties has an incentive to change its actions unilaterally. See Chapter 1 Collateral An asset used to secure a loan. Failure to repay the loan completely and in time results in a transfer of the collateral to the lender. Absolute Priority Rule A rule that prioritizes creditors’ claims to a borrower’s assets according to their seniorities.  

GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  

reference/benchmark borrowing rate posted by the bank for its better customers.  

LIBOR London Interbank Offer Rate. This is the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans in the United Kingdom.  

CD Rate The interest rate offered by banks on certificates of deposit  

Optimal Stopping Rule A statistical decision rule that tells the decision-maker when to stop a sequential sampling process and make a decision. For example, a bank may have $\$1$ million to lend and knows that the longer it waits, the more loan applicants it can screen before deciding who to lend the money to. However, waiting is costly because of the time value of money. An optimal stopping rule in this case would specify conditions under which the bank would find it most profitable to stop screening further loan applications. Another example is determining when a bank should stop acquiring additional information about a borrower, and make a decision.  

Discriminant Analysis A statistical technique used to identify the factors most useful in predicting an event. An example would be the factors useful in predicting bankruptcy.  

The Glass–Steagall Act An act passed by Congress in 1933 to separate commercial and investment banking in the United States. It prohibits commercial banks from engaging in securities underwriting and other investment banking activities as well as the activities of insurance companies.  

# INTRODUCTION  

For many commercial bankers, lending is the heart of the business. Loans dominate asset holdings and account for a large share of revenues and costs. Lending takes place in both spot and forward credit markets. We begin here with a discussion of spot lending.  

The purpose of this chapter is to explore the asset side of the bank’s balance sheet. We begin in the next section with a brief review of the most prominent assets on a bank’s balance sheet. The following section explains what we mean by lending, and the difference between loans and securities. We also discuss how these assets are purchased. The structure of loan agreements is discussed in a subsequent section. This is followed by a section that discusses the major informational problems in loan contracts and the importance of (perceived) loan performance for the determination of a bank’s stock price. The next section examines credit analysis. Our emphasis is on the economic underpinnings of the various traditional factors considered in credit analysis. In particular, we relate these economic underpinnings to the informational problems pervasive in loan contracting. In the section that follows, we turn to sources of credit information. We consider both internal sources within the bank and external sources such as financial information agencies. In the next section, we take up analysis of borrower’s financial statements. We follow it up with a section on the examination of loan covenants. Our focus is on the why of each covenant. A case study follows the concluding section.  

# DESCRIPTION OF BANK ASSETS  

# Trends in the Composition of Bank Assets  

There are three basic types of assets on a bank’s balance sheet: loans, marketable securities, and cash. (See Figure 7.1).   
Before we discuss each of these in detail, we will briefly review recent trends in the composition of bank-asset portfolios.

FIGURE 7.1 Spot Lending.  

In Figure 7.2  we show the time-series behavior of the composition of commercial bank assets. While loans have risen slightly as a fraction of total assets in the late 1970s and 1980s, they declined slightly thereafter. Security holdings declined slightly in the late 1970s and have been relatively steady since. Cash and reserves declined quite a bit until the 2007–2009 financial crisis, but then grew substantially. A clearer picture of what has been going on emerges from Figure 7.3  which shows the time-series behavior of commercial bank loans, mortgages, and consumer loans. It is apparent that C&I loans have declined in relative importance as banks have increased their mortgage holdings.1 See also Table 2.7 in Chapter 2 about the changing composition of bank assets during 2012–17.  

There are two main reasons for this trend. The first has to do with the changing nature of commercial lending. A bank has an advantage over the capital market in providing credit to a firm as long as banks have cheaper access to loanable funds than investors, and/or banks can resolve private information and moral hazard problems more effectively. Over the years, much of the deposit-related rents available to banks have eroded, thereby extinguishing virtually all of the funding advantage possessed by banks. Moreover, with the boom in financial innovation in the last two decades, a variety of new securities have been used by firms to raise funds directly from the capital market. These securities, as well as the securitization of bank-originated loans (see Chapter 11), have been designed to cope with the very problems of private information and moral hazard that banks have specialized in solving.2 Thus, the relative advantage of banks over the capital market in providing credit to firms has diminished. With the capital market becoming a more viable source of competition in the commercial lending arena, the profitability of lending to large corporations has declined significantly for banks; hence, the relative decline in C&I lending. Nonetheless, commercial lending continues to be an important source of finance for companies and individuals, and when bank lending declines due to exogenous shocks to bank capital, small firms that rely largely on bank financing, are especially affected by this.

FIGURE 7.5 Small Business Loans 2001–2011 (Source: June Call Report Data, and Cole, 2012).  

As a consequence of the financial crisis, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) closed more than 100 banks during 2009, something that had not happened since 1992. Moreover, during 2009–2011, a total of 397 banks failed. The consequences for bank lending to small businesses were severe. It has been documented that during 2008–2011, smallbusiness lending in the United States declined by $\$116$ billion, or almost $18\%$ from $\$659$ billion to only $\$543$ billion3 (see Figures 7.4 and 7.5).  

# Types of Bank Loans  

We will first discuss business loans, often referred to as C&I loans, which fall into four main categories.  

1. Transaction Loans: A transaction loan is negotiated for a specific purchase and is tailored to the particular needs of the purchaser. The demand for these loans from a particular borrower is typically episodic and hence each loan is negotiated separately. The loan is usually secured by the asset being financed with the loan (e.g., equity in another company), and repayment is expected to come from the use of this asset.   
2. Working Capital Loans: These loans are used by firms to finance routine day-to-day transactions. Thus, they are general purpose, short-term borrowings and are often used either to purchase current assets (like inventories) or to repay debts incurred in purchasing current assets. These loans are also usually secured by collateral such as accounts receivables or inventories.   
3. Term Loans: These are longer maturity loans used to buy fixed assets requiring large outlays of capital. Maturities typically run from 3 to 10 years. Repayment is normally amortized because it comes out of the cash flows generated by the asset financed with the loan. Borrowings are almost always drawn down under revolving lines of credit or similar commitments.   
4. Combinations: Working capital loans often include provisions that permit the conversion of short-term borrowings into  

term loans at the borrower’s request.  

We will now briefly review consumer loans.  

1. Consumer Loans (excluding mortgage loans): The most important types of consumer loans are direct loans and bank credit card receivables. A direct consumer loan is typically financing for the purchase of durable goods such as cars, boats, or appliances, and is secured with the asset being purchased. Bank credit card borrowings are a form of shortterm, unsecured general purpose credit. Credit cards became widely used in the mid-1960s. Credit card lending has proved to be very profitable for banks.4 The profitability of bank credit cards stems from three sources: (i) the discount at which the bank purchases sales slips from merchants (this discount typically ranges from $2\%$ to $6\%$ ), (ii) the interest rate charged to a card user who chooses not to remain current in payments (most cards extend an interest-free grace period based on a monthly billing cycle), and (iii) the annual membership fees charged to credit card users.5   
2. Mortgage Loans: These are a specialized form of consumer and commercial lending. The purpose of a mortgage loan is to finance the acquisition or improvement of real estate. These loans are almost always secured by the real estate they finance. The three principal types of mortgage loans are: residential mortgage loans, construction loans, and commercial mortgage loans.  

Until the advent of securitization, mortgage loans were illiquid assets because of the uniqueness of each property, the severity of private information problems, and the uncertain maturity of the loan due to the possibility of prepayment by the borrower. However, securitization took care of many of these impediments to the marketability of mortgages and facilitated the liquification of these instruments. This was especially true in the market for residential mortgages where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led the way under government auspices.  

Securitization is a technology for transforming illiquid loans into traded liquid securities by separating the origination of the instrument from its funding. Typically, a financial institution such as a bank “originates” the loan, that is, it screens the applicant, designs the loan contract, and determines the pricing parameters. However, instead of using deposits to fund the loan as in the traditional case, the bank sells the loan to a special trust that assembles a portfolio of loans and funds the portfolio in the capital market, often with the advice and assistance of an investment banker. The services provided by the investment banker include the sale of claims against the loan portfolio to investors and then the maintenance of a secondary market in the securitized claims. The enormous growth in securitization in the past two to three decades is evidence of its benefits in the mortgage market. These benefits stemmed from the liquidity created by the standardization, diversification, possible subsidies provided by the government via Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and new contract design that accompanied securitization. Securitization is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 11  

Earlier, fixed-rate mortgages – in which the borrower’s interest rate is fixed over the life of the mortgage – dominated the market. However, since the legalization of adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) in the 1980s there has been an explosion in the variety of mortgage designs. The terms of mortgages are as varied as the needs of borrowers and the imagination of lenders.  

# Marketable Securities Held by Banks  

1. Bankers Acceptances: These instruments arise mostly in connection with international trade. A banker’s acceptance is a bank-guaranteed indebtedness of the bank’s customer to a third party. This instrument usually arises as a time draft written by a firm in order to pay for some goods either in local currency or in foreign exchange. The draft is then “accepted” by the bank, that is, the bank guarantees its face value at maturity. The acceptance is then either held by the bank or sold in the secondary market and may be held by another bank. The originating bank typically charges a fee for the guarantee (acceptance) that is independent of the interest paid on the borrowing. Maturity is usually less than 6 months.  

A banker’s acceptance facilitates trade between parties that operate in different legal systems with wide geographical and cultural separation. If the exporter does not know the importer well enough, it will not ship goods, even on a COD basis. However, it is likely that the importer’s bank is better known and hence its willingness to guarantee payment – which serves the purpose of substituting its own credit risk for that of the importer – facilitates trade. The bank issuing the guarantee also can be expected to know more about the importer, usually a customer of the bank. Its informational advantage vis-á-vis the exporter allows the bank to earn a fee on the acceptance. Thus, bankers’ acceptances are closely tied to the bank’s role in providing a more efficient resolution of informational problems. For more on this, see Chapter 10   
2. Commercial Paper: This is unsecured debt issued on the strength of the issuer’s name. It is sold on a discounted basis like Treasury bills,6 with maturities ranging from 3 to 270 days and interest rates typically lower than prime and comparable to those on CDs and bankers acceptances. Only the best-known firms issue commercial paper because it is sold directly to investors, without an intermediary to resolve informational problems.   
3. U.S. Government Securities: These are important instruments for commercial banks because of their default-free nature and the highly liquid markets in which they are traded. As we saw in Chapter 3  private information content undermines liquidity, so U.S. government securities – which embody virtually no private information – provide banks with liquidity. Income from all U.S. government securities is subject to federal income taxes as well as capital gains tax, but is exempt from state and local income taxes. Marketable U.S. government securities are of three types: bills, notes, and bonds. Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term U.S. government securities (with original maturities of 91 days, 182 days, and 1 year) that, like commercial paper, are sold on a discounted basis. Treasury notes are similar to T-bills except that they have maturities not less than 1 year and not more than 7 years. Treasury bonds are issued with original maturities that often exceed 10 years, and can be as long as 30 years.   
4. U.S. Government Agency Securities: These are certificates of indebtedness issued by agencies of the U.S. government, such as the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA or Ginnie Mae). They are not direct obligations of the U.S. government, and they typically trade at a small premium over Treasury debt. Income on these securities, like direct U.S. government obligations, is exempt from state and local taxes, but not from federal taxes.   
5. State and Local Securities and Municipal Bonds: These debt instruments usually have a higher after-tax yield than Treasury and agency securities of comparable duration because of higher default risk and weaker liquidity. Their interest payments are exempt from federal income taxes as well as from home-state and local taxes. State and local government bonds can be divided into three broad categories: housing authority bonds, general obligation bonds, and revenue bonds. Housing authority bonds are issued by local housing agencies to build and administer housing. They are guaranteed by the federal government and are therefore virtually riskless. A bond is called a general obligation bond if the full faith and credit of the issuer stands behind the debt. In contrast, the interest and principal of a revenue bond is supported solely by the cash flow of a designated public project or undertaking. The revenues supporting these bonds may come from: (i) specifically dedicated taxes such as those on cigarettes, gasoline, and beer, (ii) tolls for roads, bridges, and airports, (iii) rent payments on buildings, office spaces, and the like. Typically, the bond payments are linked to the revenues produced by the project the bonds were used to finance.   
6. Other Assets: These include vault cash and deposits at the Federal Reserve, equity in subsidiaries, physical capital like  

buildings, computers, and loans originated by other banks that may have been acquired by the bank as part of a loan sale or through securitization. For short periods of time, the bank may also possess a variety of other assets acquired as collateral from delinquent borrowers.  

# WHAT IS LENDING?  

# A Definition  

What is a bank loan? Simply put, it is the purchase of an asset (the borrower’s indebtedness) that is typically an illiquid and highly customized financial claim against the borrower’s future cash flows. In effect, the bank is obtaining from the borrower the legal right to a prespecified portion of the borrower’s future cash flows over a prespecified period of time, and paying the borrower the present value of these cash flows. The bank’s claim represents the borrower’s repayment obligation and the loan amount represents the present value of these future obligations, assuming no extraordinary profit for the bank.  

# Methods of Acquiring Loans  

There are two principal methods by which banks acquire loans: through spot market purchases and through forward market purchases. In the spot market, the bank can either originate the loan and then fund it by keeping the loan on its own books, or it can purchase the loan from another intermediary that originated it. A spot loan is created when the bank extends credit to a loan applicant immediately upon approval of the application. In the forward market, the bank issues a promise to the applicant that it will lend in the future on prespecified terms. Such a promise is known as a loan commitment. The bank commits to lend to the borrower up to a certain amount in the future on terms that are prespecified and at the option of the borrower. In this case, the bank is committing to purchase a financial claim from a particular borrower at some time in the future.  

We discuss these two methods of asset acquisition in separate chapters. Spot market purchases and forward lending are covered in separate subsequent chapters. This division is merely for expositional convenience. In practice, the volume of spot and forward lending are inextricably linked. The extent of spot lending by the bank depends on how many of its outstanding loan commitments sold in previous periods are exercised or taken down in the current period. In general, a higher volume of takedowns of outstanding loan commitments implies a lower volume of spot lending in the current period, although the total volume of lending in the current period may rise (relative to that in the previous period) because of an unexpectedly high take-down on previously made commitments. This follows from the size constraints on banks associated with financial and human capital limitations.  

# The Decomposition of the Lending Function  

# The Decomposition  

The subtlety of lending transactions is often blurred in the bundling together of distinct services relating to credit transactions. The normal commercial bank loan is logically decomposable into origination (the broker), funding (the lender), servicing (the collector), and risk-processing services (the guarantor). And lending can be thought of largely as credit risk management that includes these four activities as well as the bank’s credit culture. See Figure 7.6  

Origination involves the activity of initiating a loan to a borrower. It is often described as the initial solicitation of the borrower and the screening of the loan application by the bank. Origination includes credit analysis and the design of the loan contract, both of which we discuss at length later in this chapter. Funding is the actual extension of the loan after an affirmative decision is reached in the credit-analysis process. Servicing involves collecting loan repayments and keeping records. Risk processing involves postlending monitoring to control default risk, as well as activities designed to control the bank’s interest rate risk arising from a loan duration that differs from the duration of the bank’s liabilities. The credit culture involves the bank’s organizational design, reporting arrangements, communication practices, and incentive schemes for credit officers. We will discuss credit culture later in the book. Much of our focus in this chapter and the next will be on origination (in particular, loan contract design and credit analysis) and risk processing (in particular, the control of default risk).  

# Industry Specialization  

In the thrift industry (savings and loan associations, mutual savings banks, and the like), different institutions provide distinct credit services, which is clear evidence of institution specialization. For example, the mortgage banker originates loans and the mortgage processor services the loans. The loan is typically funded by the public (the net saver or surplus spending unit) in the form of newly purchased savings and loan deposits or mortgage-backed securities. The bulk of the credit and interest rate risk is sustained by savings and loan stockholders, the U.S. government (FDIC, NCUA, GNMA), specialized private insurers (e.g., Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation), or some combination of the three (FNMA, FHLMC). In commercial banking, it is common for the bank to hold originated loans. Consequently, the origination, servicing, and risk absorption is evidenced by an earning asset on the bank’s balance sheet. The bank depositor holding a risk-free asset is funding the bank loans. The government, through the FDIC and the bank stockholders, shares the risks (uninsured depositors may sustain some exposure as well). Should the bank sell a loan, say to a closed-end mutual fund (as in the case of a savings and loan association selling mortgages to FHLMC or an investment bank for packaging into a mortgage-backed security), then the security holder would do the funding and the location of the risk would depend on the specific terms (recourse or nonrecourse) of the sale. Irrespective of the terms of the sale, however, the bank need show no earning asset on its balance sheet and virtually all the same services would have been performed and the same exposures sustained without any accounting evidence thereof. This statement requires some qualification in that if a loan is sold with recourse, the accountant will probably insist on booking the asset, but if a loan is sold without recourse and a letter of credit is issued insuring against default (the above are equivalent), the balance sheet will show no loan and the letter of credit will probably appear in a footnote to the balance sheet, but not in its body.  

![](images/63e96f7884b6ff83592563d7961e23e36b52f02d59892342c2711b1c4ea01832.jpg)  
FIGURE 7.6 Decomposition of the Lending Function.  

In fact, banking reserve and deposit insurance premiums provide banks with an incentive to sell, rather than hold, earning assets. In this way, the bank can avoid these costs.  

The traditional subsidy inherent in deposits (owing to underpriced deposit insurance, Regulation Q, and entry restrictions) encouraged banks to hold earning assets whereas deposit insurance premiums, reserve, and capital requirements, along with less explicit regulatory costs, were a partial offset to the deposit subsidy. However, the deposit subsidy is rapidly disappearing, whereas many of the regulatory costs remain. Thus, we can predict that banks will de-emphasize the holding of the loans they originate, service, and guarantee. The recent emphasis on “fee income” is a reflection of this phenomenon.  

# LOANS VERSUS SECURITIES  

In the previous discussions, we have talked about loans and securities as two distinct claims. The way we have defined loans, there is little difference between loans and debt securities, except that the latter are usually more liquid. That is, securities are traded in secondary markets, whereas loans usually are not. Loans are essentially private debt placements with banks. You will recall from our discussions in Chapter 4 that liquidity and marketability are interrelated. From an economic viewpoint, the distinction between loans and securities is in their relative liquidity 7  

Viewed in this light, recent developments in the loan market can be seen as narrowing the distinction between loans and securities. We refer to loan sales and securitization. A loan sale, which is a fairly old practice, is simply the selling of a loan by the originating bank to an alternative funding agent, usually another bank. This can either be an outright sale of the loan, where the loan may have been originated by a single bank or as part of a loan syndication. With an outright sale, the originating bank disengages itself from the loan, that is, it makes the initial loan and then turns around and sells it to another bank, thereby removing the loan from its own balance sheet. A fee is earned for the originating service, so that the transaction leaves its mark on the originator’s income statement. With an outright loan sale, the bank acts as a pure broker, although in practice almost every loan sale involves the originating bank retaining a part of the loan, so the bank is not a pure broker. Some loans are also made under syndication arrangements in which case there is joint origination of the loans by several banks. These loans may then be sold to others. Again, the “lead banks” in the syndicate earn fees.  

Thus, loan sales enhance loan liquidity, especially if the originator maintains a secondary market. This blurs the distinction between loans and securities. A more recent practice for improving loan liquidity is securitization, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 11  Both loan sales and securitization trivialize the distinctions between loans and securities.  

# STRUCTURE OF LOAN AGREEMENTS  

# Trends in Loan Agreements  

Commercial bank lending was once a fairly simple business. Most business loans were short-term, self-liquidating working capital credits, and terms were often left to informal agreements between a bank and its customers. Business lending began getting more complex in the 1930s when banks started making loans with maturities of more than a year, so-called term loans. Relations between banks and business borrowers have been growing more complex – and more formal – ever since. Part of the push for more formality and variety in the design of agreements comes from the need for banks and borrowers to protect themselves from movements in interest rates over the credit cycle. Increases in market interest rates boost the costs to banks of funding outstanding loans and also reduce the attractiveness of existing credits. Reductions in market interest rates, on the other hand, often trigger prepayments.  

Floating interest rates have been one of the most important innovations in bank lending since the advent of the term loan. Provisions for adjusting loan rates periodically give banks some protection against interest rate risk. By combining the advantages of term and short-term loans, floating rates have allowed banks to compete for a share of the business credit market – even in the face of increased competition from the commercial paper market and other nonbank credit suppliers. At the same time, floating rates have effected changes in the other terms and conditions of commercial lending. An unintended consequence has been the loss of some borrowers who switched from banks to the capital market to obtain longerterm debt with greater fixity in the borrowing rate.  

# Details of Loan Agreements  

A loan agreement specifies the obligations of borrower and lender, makes certain warranties, and usually places certain controls and restrictions on the borrower. It states the amount to be borrowed, or the principal. The agreement also states the maturity: short-term (less than 1 year), intermediate-term (1–5 years), and long-term (greater than 5 years). The pricing formula is also stated. The interest rate may be a fixed or a floating rate. If the interest rate is floating, it may be “primeplus” (e.g., the prime rate plus $1\%$ ) or “times-prime” (e.g., the prime rate times 1.05). Pricing might also be at a “transaction rate,” that is, the bank agrees ex ante to a fixed mark-up over a current money rate (e.g., T-bill, the negotiable CD rate, or the commercial paper rate). The agreement also states the closing fees to be paid when the loan gets funded. In a competitive situation this fee may be $0.25\substack{-0.375\%}$ , and higher in other situations. Also, a penalty or default rate of interest may be stipulated for late or early payments.  

Although loan agreements usually are tailored to meet the requirements of specific situations, most contain certain standard provisions, which may be divided into three general categories: conditions precedent, warranties (also called representations), and covenants and events of default.  

The “conditions precedent” section includes requirements that the borrower must satisfy before the bank is legally obliged to fund the loan. These conditions may include specific business transactions that must be completed or events that must have occurred. Other standard items are the opinions of counsel, certificate of no defaults, the note, and resolutions of the borrower’s board of directors authorizing the transaction.  

The “warranties” section of the loan agreement contains information and assumptions about the borrower’s legal status and creditworthiness. By executing the loan agreement, the borrower attests to the accuracy and truth of the information provided as of the date of execution. Misrepresentation constitutes an event of default. Principal warranties include the following:  

A warranty that all financial statements submitted to the lender are genuine and fairly represent the financial position the borrower (i.e., that no material adverse change has occurred). The borrower has a valid title to all assets. The borrower has complied with all federal, state, and municipal laws and is not involved in litigation. The borrower has filed all necessary tax returns and has paid all taxes due. No need for third-party consent. No violation of existing agreements.  Collateral offered is owned by the borrower and is free of liens.  

Covenants are a negotiated part of loan agreements. Warranties verify certain statements by the borrower at the date of execution of the loan agreement. Covenants carry forward the warranties and establish the borrower’s ongoing obligation to maintain a certain status for the loan’s duration. Covenants set minimum standards for a borrower’s future conduct and performance and thereby accelerate the loan in the event of untoward developments. Violation of a covenant creates an event of default and gives the bank the right to “accelerate” the required repayment. We will have more to say about covenants in a later section of this chapter.  

# INFORMATIONAL PROBLEMS IN LOAN CONTRACTS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LOAN PERFORMANCE  

# Informational Problems  

If there were no informational problems in loans, there might not be any profits for banks in lending. At one extreme, the costless availability of information obviates the need for banks and other financial intermediaries. At the other, costly customer-specific information provides an opportunity for banks to profitably process information and facilitate lending. In general, the less transparent is the credit information about a given borrower, the greater is the bank’s ability to utilize its “uniqueness” and the higher is its profit potential. Thus, the paucity of good credit information in the public domain is a thing for banks to desire.8 Since we have already discussed the informational problems addressed by banks (Chapters 2 and 3), we will merely review these here. The first problem is that the borrower is privately informed about its own credit risk. Unless the bank can elicit at least part of this information, market failure could result (recall the discussion of Akerlof in Chapter 1). We will see shortly that credit analysis helps the bank reduce its informational disadvantage vis- $\grave{\mathbf{a}}$ -vis the borrower.  

The other problem in lending is moral hazard. When the borrower takes a loan from the bank, it becomes an agent of the bank and is in a similar relationship with the bank as the shareholders of a firm are with bondholders. This agency problem is manifested in the borrower’s desire to take on additional risk to the bank’s detriment, as we saw in Chapter 1 Loan contracts are therefore designed to control the borrower’s risk-taking propensity. To the extent that some preference for risk remains, the loan contract should also enable the bank to monitor the borrower and prevent actions that increase the risk of default. We will see how collateral, loan covenants, and other features of loan contracts can be structured to meet this important objective.

# The Importance of Loan Performance  

The bank’s loan portfolio affects the financial health and viability of the bank. When bank stock prices decline, quite often most of the decline in bank stock prices is attributable to information releases about asset quality problems at banks.  

Loan losses can not only mean plunging stock prices, but can also spell trouble for top management at banks. It is well known that poorer corporate performance often precipitates a higher probability of CEO turnover.9  

# Loan Portfolio Diversification as a Risk Management Tool  

The performance of a bank’s loan portfolio often determines its financial performance. Although diversification is often a key to managing credit losses, many banks are constrained in their diversification efforts. For example, smaller banks often feel disadvantaged in their ability to diversify their credit risk by virtue of loan size limitations and geographic insularity. Moreover, these banks prefer limiting themselves to local markets because those are the markets they are most familiar with. This specialization-induced desire to stick to what is familiar leads to credit concentrations in banks, and this is typically reflected in the incidence of financial stress in periods of recession.  

Despite regulatory attempts to encourage banks to diversify – by imposing limits on the maximum amount the bank can lend to a single borrower – the effects of lack of loan portfolio diversification can be clearly seen in the performance of banks in many regions. Banks in the United States have often displayed high performance correlation with banks that are similarly geographically situated. For example, when real-estate values plunged in the 1980s in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, financial performance indicators for the banks in those states plunged as well.  

It does appear, however, that the benefits of diversification have begun to more strongly influence banks’ portfolio choices in the 1990s and post-2000, which coincides with the growing popularity of loan syndication, loan sales, and securitization as diversification vehicles for banks. For example, although most United States community banks conduct much of their business in their own regions, there is evidence that these banks are able to withstand local economic downturns.10 Moreover, in contrast to their relatively poor performance in the 1980s, small banks significantly improved their performance in the 1990s.11 Credit losses have been relatively low since. However, pressure on lending margins (in conjunction with the low interest rate environment) has suppressed profitability. Given their dependence on interest income, community banks returns have on average been lower than those of noncommunity banks. Failure rates during the 2007–2009 financial crisis were up, but community banks, especially that had remained disciplined with a diversified local lending focus, fared relatively well. Those that shifted towards C&D (construction and development) loans were most exposed,12 performed reasonably well over the 2007–2009 period, and overall had relatively low credit losses.  

The experience of community banks during the study period appears to indicate that maintaining a stable balance between growth and earnings has been the surest path to long-term viability.  

In addition, small banks have also improved their profitability and survival rates. The FDIC reported that about 1250 new community banks were established between 1992 and 2003, of which about 100 merged and about 1100 remained independent, with only four having failed. The resilience and plurality of the local U.S. banking markets may, in part, explain the better performance of the U.S. financial sector compared to that in Europe following the 2007–2009 financial crisis. The dependence of Europe on large, homogeneous, and overleveraged financial institutions (see Chapter 2) caused substantial pain.13  

We now define terms that are routinely used in discussions of credit risk.  

Interest Rate Spread: The difference between loan and deposit interest rates.  

Provision for Loan Losses: A fraction of the loan principal earmarked by the bank as a buffer to absorb (expected) loan losses, and kept as part of the bank’s capital.  

Net Interest Spread After Provision: Interest rate spread after adjustment for taxes and subtraction of provision of loan losses.  

Noninterest Income: Bank’s income from activities other than lending, such as fees on cash management services, fees on contingent claims like loan commitments, letters of credit, and so on.  

ROA: Bank’s return on assets.  

ROE: Bank’s return on equity.  

Nonperforming Loans/Reserves: Ratio of loans considered likely to default to the provision for loan losses.  

Net Chargeoffs/Average Loans: Ratio of chargeoff of delinquent loans to the average loans extended by the ba  

Typically, interest rates are set such that interest rate spreads are higher for riskier loans. Banks also make higher provision for loan losses when the loans are riskier, and net chargeoffs/average loans also tend to be higher for such loans. Diversification can reduce the impact of losses in a particular loan class on the bank’s overall net chargeoffs. Whether noninterest income, ROA, and ROE are higher or lower for riskier loans depends on the degree of competition in that particular market and cannot be unambiguously stated a priori.  

Despite the obvious gains from diversification, why are all banks not highly diversified? There are at least four reasons. First, there is the issue of limitations on the opportunity to diversify. Many banks feel “landlocked,” constrained by geography to lend in limited markets. Second, lending opportunities typically arrive sequentially and unpredictably, so that forgoing a loan because of diversification concerns may be costly because a loan that offers better diversification potential may fail to materialize later. Third, banks are often constrained by regulations that mandate serving specific communities. For example, the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) requires a bank to lend to low-income borrowers in the community. This may interfere with diversification. Finally, cross-sectional reusability of information induces banks to specialize. For example, a bank that develops a special expertise in lending to auto parts manufacturers has a relative advantage in lending to this group, and it may wish to capitalize on this advantage by making such loans the focus of its loan portfolio. At best, therefore, banks tend to diversify within specialized areas of lending.  

# CREDIT ANALYSIS: THE FACTORS  

Credit analysis examines factors that may lead to default in the repayment of a loan. The principal objective of credit analysis is to determine the ability and willingness of the borrower to repay the loan. The analysis looks at the borrower’s past record (reputation) as well as its economic prospects. In most banks, this information is collected, analyzed, and stored by the credit department.  

In analyzing a loan request, there are two important points to keep in mind. First, from an economic standpoint, assuming that the bank is the sole lender, it is the bank, not the borrower, that owns the asset financed with the loan. When the borrower takes a loan secured by the asset the loan is financing, it is merely purchasing a call option (as we saw in Chapter 1) from the bank. This option entitles the borrower to repurchase the asset from the bank should the value of the asset exceed the borrower’s loan repayment obligation (the exercise price of the call option). The bank’s loan granting decision and all of the actions it takes during the time the loan is outstanding should reflect this basic reality. Second, getting the borrower to repay the loan in today’s legal environment is not always easy. Bankruptcy laws contain many provisions that protect borrowers, and these often make collection of debts potentially time-consuming and costly. Hence, one of the goals of credit analysis should be to uncover the likelihood of default as accurately as cost limitations will permit.  

# Traditional Factors Considered in Credit Analysis  

Bank credit analysts have traditionally referred to the five Cs of credit analysis: capacity, character, capital, collateral, and conditions. Since “rules of thumb” are usually the distillate of accumulated experience, they should bear a relationship to theoretical prescriptions. We therefore, interpret each of these factors in terms of the underlying economics of bank lending. The discussion that follows is summarized in Figure 7.8  

1. Capacity: This refers to the borrower’s legal and financial capacity to borrow. The first consideration in assessing a loan request is whether the person requesting the loan is legally capable of borrowing. For example, in the case of partnerships, it is important to know whether all the signing partners have the legal authority to borrow on behalf of the partnership. In the case of corporations, the bank should check the corporate charter and bylaws to determine who has the authority to borrow on the corporation’s behalf.  

Apart from legal considerations, capacity refers to the borrower’s financial capability. Future cash flows are generally used to service the debt and therefore need to be carefully estimated. Evaluating borrowers’ future cash flows available to service the debt is a major part of any credit analysis. Sometimes, the bank may have to demand that the borrower subordinate the claims of others to ensure that the borrower has sufficient capacity to repay the bank. An example is a small firm that has borrowed significant amounts from its major shareholders.14  

2. Character: The concept of character embraces the borrower’s ability to repay debts and the desire to settle all obligations within the terms of the contract. Judging character requires a careful examination of the borrower’s past record in debt repayment and related behaviors. Including character in credit analysis makes sense because the better a borrower’s credit reputation, the less incentive it has to default.15 The reason is simple. Suppose a borrower knows that a single default will lead to denial of credit for a long time. The gain from defaulting is the amount the borrower does not repay the bank, but the gain from repayment is the net present value (NPV) of all the investment projects that might be financed with future bank loans; defaulting on this bank loan leads to a loss of that NPV. Clearly, this NPV increases as the interest rates on future loans decline. Further, the longer the borrower keeps repaying its loans, the better its credit reputation gets and the lower its future loan interest rates.16 Hence, when the borrower acquires a good credit reputation, it perceives a lower sequence of interest rates on its future loans than if it did not have that reputation. Consequently, the benefit of repaying the loan (or equivalently, the cost of defaulting) is greater for a borrower with a better reputation. To put it a little differently, the benefit of maintaining or building a reputation is greater the better the reputation is to start with. Hence, borrowers with better reputations (repayment records) tend to be better credit risks.

FIGURE 7.8 Pictorial Depiction of Factors Considered in Credit Analysis.  

3. Capital: How much equity capital (as a fraction of total assets) the borrower has invested in the firm is an important factor in the assessment of that firm’s credit risk. There are two effects at work here. First, a higher amount of capital lessens the moral hazard problem. Second, the higher the capital, the better is the signal sent by the firm’s owners about the confidence they have in the firm’s future prospects. This helps to resolve the private information problem. This is illlustrated in Example 7.1.  

# Example 7.1  

Suppose you are a bank lending officer at the Midtown National Bank considering a loan request from Miller Manufacturing company for $\$1.05$ million. The firm currently has $\$1$ million in equity and its existing debt repayment obligation is $\$2$ million. Assume that this equity is in the form of retained earnings invested in a noninterest-bearing account. The firm can invest the $\$1.05$ million it will borrow from your bank in one of two projects (the bank cannot directly control which project the firm will invest in): A or B. Project A will yield a payoff of $\$2$ million with probability 0.8 and $\$1$ million with probability 0.2 at the end of the period. Project B will yield a payoff of $\$7$ million with probability 0.2 and a payoff of zero with probability 0.8 at the end of the period. The firm’s existing assets will yield a payoff of $\$3$ million with probability 0.8 and a payoff of zero with probability 0.2 at the end of the period. The payoff on either project A or project B is statistically independent of the payoff on the firm’s existing assets. These payoff distributions are common knowledge. For simplicity, there is no discounting and the bank loan you will make is subordinated to the firm’s previous debt. Examine how Miller Manufacturing’s behavior and the terms of lending change depending on whether or not it has the $\$1$ million equity mentioned earlier.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in four steps. First, we will assume that Miller Manufacturing has $\$1$ million in equity. Then we will analyze the firm’s expected profit from choosing project A, assuming that the bank prices the loan believing that project A will be chosen. Second, continuing to assume that Miller has $\$1$ million in equity, we will analyze the borrower’s expected profit from choosing project B assuming that the bank prices the loan believing that project A will be chosen. These two steps are needed to determine the appropriate Nash equilibrium in this problem, that is, a situation in which the bank prices the loan believing that Miller will choose project $\boldsymbol{{j}}$ (where $\boldsymbol{{j}}$ is either A or B) and Miller indeed chooses project $\boldsymbol{{\dot{I}}}$ With $\$1$ million in equity, the Nash equilibrium involves the bank believing that project A will be chosen. Note the key role of the informational assumption that the bank cannot observe the borrower’s choice of project. The third step is to assume that Miller has no equity capital and repeat Step 1. Finally, we repeat Step 2 with the assumption that Miller has no equity capital.  

Step 1  

Suppose first that the firm has the $\$1$ million in equity mentioned earlier. Let us say that you, as the lending officer, assume that Miller will choose project A. Then, the sum of the cash flows from the project and Miller’s existing assets has the following probability distribution (Table 7.1 .  

Since the repayment obligation on the senior debt is $\$2$ million, the cash flow available to service the bank loan has the following probability distribution.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">TABLE 7.1 Probability Distribution of Total Cash Flows from Project A, Miller's Existing Assets and Equity</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cash Flow From Project A and Existing Assets (Millions of $)</td><td>Total Cash Flow With Retained Earnings Added in (Millions of $)</td><td>Probability</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>0.64</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0.04</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"></td></tr></table></body></html>  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">TABLE 7.2 Probability Distribution of Cash Flow Available to Service Bank Loan</td></tr><tr><td>Cash Flow Available (Millions of $)</td><td>Probability</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.64</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.16</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>0.04</td></tr></table></body></html>  

You want to price this loan competitively because Miller has also been talking to your cross-town rival. At the same time, you do not want to lose money on this deal. From Table 7.2 you figure out that if the available cash flow is either $\$4$ million or $\$3$ million, Miller can fully repay the bank loan, whereas if the available cash flow is $\$1$ million, then that is all your bank can collect. Thus, if you set the repayment obligation on your bank loan at $\$9$ million, your expected collection will be  

$$
(0.64+0.16)P+(0.16)1+(0.04)0=0.8P+0.16.
$$  

Since we have set the discount rate at zero, this expected payoff must equal the initial loan for your bank to just break even (the farthest you can go in competing for this borrower). That is,  

$$
1.05=0.8P+0.16,
$$  

which means $P=\$123$ million, implying a loan interest rate of approximately $5.95\%$ . The probability distribution of cash flows to Miller’s shareholders is given in Table 7.3  

Thus, the expected value of equity if Miller invests in project A is $0.64(2.8875)+0.16(1.8875)=\S2.15$ million.  

# Step 2  

Now suppose that Miller were to consider investing in project B after receiving a loan priced by you under the assumption that project A would be chosen. This is the standard moral hazard problem in bank lending which we discussed earlier, since project B is riskier for you as the lender. Then, proceeding in the same way that we did for project $\mathsf{A},$ we see that the probability distribution of the cash flows accruing to the firm’s shareholders is as follows: $\$7.8875$ million with probability 0.16, $\$4.8875$ million with probability 0.04, $\$0.8875$ million with probability 0.64, and zero with probability 0.16. Thus, the expected value of equity if the firm invests in project B is $0.16(7.8875)+0.04(4.8875)+0.64(0.8875)+0.16(0)=\S2.0255$ million.  

This means that Miller’s shareholders prefer to invest in project A (assuming you price your loan as if project A will be selected) and you are safe in your assumption that project A will be chosen. It is, therefore, unnecessary to check what would happen if the bank were to assume that Miller will choose B. This is because there are two possibilities. Either Miller will choose $\mathsf{A},$ so that it is not a Nash equilibrium for the bank to assume B will be chosen, or there is a Nash equilibrium in which Miller chooses B. But this Nash equilibrium is dominated by the one in which Miller chooses A in the sense that Miller is better off in the latter and the bank is indifferent. Thus, if your bank is to be competitive, you had better price the loan assuming that A will be chosen, since the loan price is lower in that case.  

# Step 3  

Now we will see what would happen if Miller had no equity capital. In this case, if Miller selects project A, it has the following distribution for its total cash flow (Table 7.4 .  

Since the repayment obligation on senior debt is $\$2$ million, you calculate that to service the bank loan Miller will have $\$3$ million with probability 0.64, $\$2$ million with probability 0.16, and nothing with probability 0.2. Following the same logic as in the case with $\$1$ million in retained earnings, you now calculate that to permit the bank to just break even you must ask for a repayment obligation of $\$123125$ million (you are assuming that Miller will invest in project A). With this, the net cash flow accruing to Miller’s shareholders is $\$1.6875$ million with probability 0.64, $\$0.6875$ million with probability 0.16, and zero with probability 0.2. The expected value of equity is $\$1.19$ million.

# Step 4  

After receiving such a loan, if Miller were to decide to opt for project B instead, we can follow the same steps as before to compute the expected value of equity as $\$12175$ million. Thus, Miller will choose the riskier project B, and your assumption that it will select project A is incorrect. Indeed, if you were to (correctly) assume that project B will be chosen and price the loan accordingly, Miller’s incentive to choose project B would be unaltered. This means that if Miller does not have sufficient equity capital, it may opt for riskier investments than it would if it had equity capital. Since you will anticipate this as a banker, you price the loan accordingly (that is, charge an appropriately higher interest rate on the loan). It is straightforward to verify that in this example Miller is better off retaining earnings in order to convince the lender that it will choose the safer project.  

Capital helps to resolve moral hazard by imposing a greater loss on the borrower for poor project outcomes. This is because capital acts as the “first line of defense” against project losses and provides a cushion of protection for the lender. Without equity capital, the borrower knows that it has a valuable call option – if the project does poorly, the lender sustains the loss (the worst the borrower can do is to get nothing), whereas if the project does well, the lender gets only its contractual payment and the borrower earns a profit. With capital, the borrower’s cost of pursuing risk is increased and the value of its call option is reduced. With sufficient equity capital, the lender can align the borrower’s interest perfectly with its own. Interestingly, this means that the borrower is better off.17  

The other function of capital is as an information communicator. The entrepreneur’s own contribution of equity can signal the profitability of her project. The standard argument relies on the entrepreneur being risk averse and is thus a little more complicated than an alternative line of reasoning that is developed in the example in the box below.18  

# Example 7.2  

Suppose we have a firm that needs $\$150$ to invest in a project that will yield a random payoff one period hence. The firm knows the probability distribution of the project’s cash flow, but no one else does. All that others know is that the project can be type C or type D. If it is type ${\sf C},$ then it will yield a cash flow of $\$300$ with probability 0.8 and zero with probability of 0.2. If it is type D, the project will yield a cash flow of $\$600$ with probability 0.5 and zero with probability 0.5. For simplicity, suppose that interest and principal payments on debt are tax deductible and that the firm can raise equity capital (it currently has negligible equity capital on its books) from those who know the firm’s cash flow distribution (e.g., these may be managers who own stock). The firm currently has owners, but the book value of their equity is, for all practical purposes, zero. However, debt must be acquired in the form of a loan from a bank, which cannot tell whether the borrower has a type C or a type D project. The corporate tax rate applicable to the borrower is $30\%$ . As a banker, how should you deal with such a borrower, assuming that the borrower is locked into either project C or project D and cannot choose its project?  

# Solution  

The key to resolving this informational asymmetry is to use capital as a signal. As a banker, the key is for you to recognize that the riskier borrower has a greater aversion to putting up equity capital because he has a greater likelihood of losing it. So, as a banker, you can offer the borrower two choices: (i) borrow the entire $\$150$ and repay $P_{\mathrm{D}},$ or (ii) put up $\$5$ in equity, borrow $\$150-E$ and repay $P_{\mathrm{c}}$  

We solve this problem in three steps. First, we assume that the type-D borrower opts for choice (i), the type-C borrower opts for choice (ii), and the bank earns zero expected profit on each borrower. We then solve for $P_{\mathrm{{D}}}$ We also solve for $P_{\mathrm{c}},$ but it appears as a function of $E$ Step 2 involves solving for $E$ We do this by searching for the smallest value of $E$ that ensures that the type-D borrower does not prefer its own contract (borrowing without putting up any equity) to that of the type-C borrower (putting up E in equity). Finally, the third step is to check that, with the value of $E$ obtained from the previous step, the type-C borrower prefers his choice to that of the type-D borrower. Steps 2 and 3 therefore confirm the assumptions made in Step 1 about the project choices of borrowers.  

Step 1  

Now, if borrowers self-select so that only the type-D borrower takes (i) and only the type-C borrower takes (ii), then we can proceed as follows. Given that the bank must earn zero expected profit on each contract, and the repayment probability of the type-D borrower is 0.5, $P_{\mathrm{{D}}}$ must equal the expected value of the bank’s repayment by the high-risk borrower, that is,  

$$
P_{\mathrm{D}}\times0.5=150
$$  

or $P_{\mathrm{D}}=\$300$ , an interest rate of $100\%$ . Next, if only the low-risk borrower takes (ii), $P_{\mathrm C}$ must satisfy  

$$
0.8\times P_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{C}}=150-E
$$  

Step 2  

We now solve for $E$ Note that $E$ must ensure that the type-D borrower does not prefer the type-C borrower’s contract to his own. Although there are many values of $E$ for which this is true, there is only one value of $E$ for which this is true and the value of the debt tax shield for the type-C borrower is maximized. This is the value of $E$ that is the smallest value such that the type-D borrower does not strictly prefer the type-C borrower’s contract. That is, the NPV to the type-D borrower from misrepresenting [and choosing (ii)] is exactly equal to his NPV from telling the truth [and choosing (i)]. The type-D borrower’s NPV from choosing (i) is  

$$
(600-300)\times0.5\times0.7=\S105
$$  

where 0.7 is one minus the tax rate. The type-D borrower’s NPV from choosing (ii) is  

$$
\left(600-{\frac{150-\mathsf{E}}{0.8}}\right)\times0.5\times0.7-E.
$$  

Equating the above NPV to $\$105$ yields $E=\$70$ . Thus, the repayment obligation for the type-C borrower is ${\frac{150-70}{0.8}}=\$100,$ , or an interest rate of $25\%$ .  

Step 3  

You can check that the type-C borrower will strictly prefer his contract to that of the type-D borrower. His NPV from (i) is  

$$
(300-300)\times0.8\times0.7=0,
$$  

and his NPV from (ii) is  

$$
(300-100)\times0.8\times0.7-70=\S42.
$$  

Thus, the bank can offer two choices:  

1. Borrow the entire $\$150$ and repay $\$300$ .   
2. Put up $\$70$ in equity, borrow $\$80$ , and repay $\$100$ .  

The key here is that the bank prices each loan based on the assumption that the borrower taking a particular loan has a particular project. If the borrower does in fact have that project, then the bank earns zero expected profit. The idea is for the bank to design the loan in such a way that  ncentive compatibility is assured. In other words, no borrower has an incentive to deviate from the loan contract “intended” for it by the bank. Incentive compatibility should obtain in a Nash equilibrium; the bank’s assumptions about the association between the borrower’s project and its loan contract choice must be correct in equilibrium.  

n this example, capital serves as a signal of project quality. The borrower with the less risky type-C project signals its lower risk by funding two-thirds of the required investment with equity capital. For this, it is rewarded with a lower interest rate. Despite the obvious attractiveness of this lower interest rate, the high-risk borrower is unwilling to put up the equity necessary to be granted that rate. The intuition is as follows. Due to the tax deductibility of loan interest payments, the borrower desires as large a loan as possible, regardless of its project characteristics. The borrower also dislikes paying interest, regardless of its project characteristics. However, a higher interest rate is less onerous when the borrower has a risky project because the likelihood of actually repaying the loan with interest is lower. To such a borrower then, the inducement of a lower interest rate in exchange for a higher capital requirement is less attractive than it is to a borrower with the safer project. It is the fact that the borrower’s preferences over different capital requirement–interest rate combinations depend on its project characteristics that permit the bank to craft a selfselection mechanism that elicits the desired information.  

It follows then that, all else remaining the same, the bank should charge an interest rate that is inversely related to the borrower’s equity to total assets ratio. Less capitalized borrowers are more risky, not just because of the direct effect of capital in serving as a “first line of defense,” but also because of its indirect effect in reducing the borrower’s appetite for risk. In our examples, we imposed a zero-profit condition on the bank as a reflection of perfect competition in banking markets. This is an extreme representation of competition. In reality, banks earn profits, especially on borrowers about whom they possess credit information that is not publicly available. To the extent that banks charge higher interest rates to borrowers with lower equity positions, they may also be able to earn greater profit margins on these borrowers.19 This can make the prospect of lending to highly leveraged (low equity) borrowers enticing for the bank, despite the higher risk involved. Indeed, such an incentive arises from the basic function of credit information production performed by banks (Chapter 3).  

Banks can add highly leveraged loans to their portfolios by lending to companies that use the funds for leveraged buyouts (LBOs), acquisitions, and recapitalizations. As our earlier discussions indicate, the yields on these highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) are higher than on other commercial loans. Since these higher yields compensate the bank for higher risks, higher expected profits for the bank are not necessarily implied. However, in many cases these borrowers also have few alternative sources of credit, so that banks can extract higher risk-adjusted profits from these borrowers. In addition, banks usually receive fees that vary from $1\%$ to $2\%$ of the principal amount committed.20 HLT loans, however, are significantly more risky than average, and involve the moral hazards discussed earlier in this section.21 This may be one reason why there has been a recent growth in the popularity of reverse leveraged buyouts, whereby firms reduce their debt/equity ratios by issuing equity to retire debt acquired during LBOs. This would reduce moral hazard and benefit the firm.  

4. Collateral: Most commercial and consumer lending is secured with collateral. Once a loan is secured by a specific asset that serves as collateral, the lender has first claim to that asset in the event of default. There are two types of collateral: “inside” and “outside.” Inside collateral consists of assets owned by the firm to which the loan is extended. Examples are accounts receivables, equipment, machinery, real estate, and inventory. Even if the bank extends an unsecured loan, it would have a claim, but not necessarily first claim, against these assets. As a general creditor, however, the value of the bank’s claim would be ill-defined since, in the event of bankruptcy, the bank might be one among many unsecured creditors at the mercy of the bankruptcy court. On the other hand, if one of these assets is pledged as (inside) collateral, the bank would become the primary claimant to that asset.  

Outside collateral consists of assets that the bank would never have a claim to unless they were specifically designated as collateral. A good example would be personal assets of the owner of the borrowing corporation or limited partnership.  

Using collateral is not costless, however. Since the borrower may undertake actions that undermine the value of the collateral to the bank, ongoing monitoring of the collateral is required. Such monitoring costs are absorbed, at least in part, by the bank. Moreover, when collateral is transferred to the bank upon default, there are liquidation costs. These include the legal costs of ownership transfer as well as the bank’s costs of initially carrying and then selling off the collateral.22 From the borrower’s standpoint, use of collateral makes subsequent borrowing more expensive since fewer assets are available to general creditors on that borrowing. Despite these costs, why is collateral so widely used?  

There are at least three reasons for the popularity of secured lending. We discuss each now.  

a. Risk Reduction: An obvious reason to secure a loan is that it provides the lender greater protection against loss in the event of default. The bankruptcy code in the United States includes what is known as an “automatic stay,” which freezes collection actions by creditors during bankruptcy proceedings. The idea is to provide the debtor with breathing room to put its house in order. The stay takes effect immediately upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition. However, the stay can be modified in favor of a creditor if there is “cause,” including insufficient protection of the secured creditor’s interest in that component of the debtor’s property that serves as collateral. For example, suppose a bank has loaned $\$10$ million to a firm that has just filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Suppose that specific assets of the firm, currently worth $\$4$ million, have been encumbered as inside collateral. Now, if these assets were to depreciate in value at the rate of $\$3000$ per month, for instance, the bankruptcy court might require the firm to set aside that amount each month to adequately protect the bank’s claim. Thus, securing a loan reduces the creditor’s risk in the event of bankruptcy.  

b. Signaling Instrument: Collateral can also convey valuable information to the bank. Although possible with inside collateral, the intuition comes through most clearly if one thinks of securing property as outside collateral. The logic is similar to that used in explaining the signaling role of equity capital. Within a class of borrowers that look equally risky to the bank even after all credit analysis is done, a borrower’s willingness to offer collateral will be inversely related to its default risk on the loan.23 The way the bank can induce a borrower to reveal its otherwise hidden risk is as follows. Suppose there are two indistinguishable borrowers, A and B. However, the bank suspects one may be riskier than the other, although it does not know which. The bank offers each borrower a choice of one contract from a pair consisting of a secured loan with an associated interest rate and an unsecured loan with a higher interest rate. Now suppose A is less risky than B. Then, A will prefer the secured loan for two reasons. First, its lower risk means that the likelihood of repaying interest is higher; hence, a lower interest rate is more appealing. Second, its lower risk means that the chance of defaulting and losing collateral to the bank is lower; hence, offering collateral is less onerous. By symmetric logic, we can see that B will prefer the unsecured loan. Getting A and B to sort themselves out like this requires, of course, that the two loan contracts offered are incentive compatible. The example in the box below shows how this can be done.  

# Example 7.3  

Suppose that A’s assets will be worth $\$100$ for sure at the end of the period. The value of B’s end-of-period assets will be $\$200$ with probability 0.5 and zero with probability 0.5. The project (A or B) requires an investment of $\$30$ up front and the entire amount is borrowed from the bank. The bank is unable to distinguish between A and B. Assume that the single-period riskless interest rate is $10\%$ and everybody is risk neutral. Assume that collateral worth $\$1$ to the borrower is worth only 90 cents to the bank. The difference of 10 cents on the dollar can be viewed as the bank’s cost of taking possession of the collateral. These repossession costs have two sources. First, assets acquired from a delinquent borrower are often worth less piecemeal to the bank than they are to the borrowers as components of a productive whole. Thus, the mere act of liquidating collateral by removing it from the other assets of the firm is costly. Second, transferring control of assets from the borrower to the bank involves legal and other administrative costs. These costs are an important reason why so many bankers see the value of collateral largely in terms of its incentive effects. The problem is to determine how the bank can design a pair of loan contracts such that each borrower will be induced to truthfully reveal its privately known risk.  

# Solution  

Following the intuition discussed earlier, we will need to offer borrowers two contracts: a secured loan and an unsecured loan. These contracts should be designed so that A, the safe borrower, chooses the secured loan and B, the risky borrower, chooses the unsecured loan. We solve this problem in three steps. In the first step, we solve for the interest rate on the secured loan for the bank to break even. Second, we solve for the interest rate on the unsecured loan. In the third step, we solve for the amount of collateral on the secured loan that will deter the risky borrower from preferring the secured to the unsecured loan.  

Step 1  

Since A will surely repay the loan, the interest rate on the secured loan, $r_{\mathrm{u}},$ that allows the bank to just break even is the single period riskless rate of $10\%$ .  

Step 2  

On the other hand, the interest rate on the unsecured loan, $r_{\mathrm{u}},$ should be set to satisfy the following zero profit condition for the bank  

$$
[0.5\times(1+r_{\mathrm{u}})\times30]/\left[1.10\right]=30
$$  

The left-hand side of Equation  7.1) is the discounted present value of the bank’s payoff. The promised repayment is $\$30(1+r_{\mathrm{u}})$ , but there is only a 0.5 probability that the bank will be repaid. Since the bank is risk neutral, it discounts at the riskless interest rate of $10\%$ . For the bank to exactly break even, the discounted present value of its expected payoff should exactly equal the initial loan. Note that our approach is consistent with the notion that the bank owns the project and it has sold the borrower a call option on the collateral at a fixed exercise price of $30\times(1+r_{\mathrm{u}})$ . When the project value exceeds this exercise price, the borrower exercises the option to repurchase the project; this happens in the successful state. If the project fails, the borrower lets its option expire unexercised and the bank retains a worthless project. Solving Equation  7.1) gives $1~+~r_{\mathrm{u}}=2.2$ . Hence, the repayment obligation on the unsecured loan is $2.2\times30=\mathfrak{H}66$ .  

# Step 3  

Now we solve for the amount of collateral that will deter B from mimicking A and opting for the secured loan. The amount of collateral, $C,$ that makes B indifferent between the secured and unsecured loans is the solution to the following equation  

$$
0.5\times(200-66)=0.5\times(200-33)-0.5\times C.
$$  

n Equation (7.2)  the left-hand side is the expected value of the borrower’s cash flow, net of repaying the bank, if it takes the unsecured loan. The right-hand side is the expected value of its net cash inflow if it chooses the secured loan. Note that the interest rate on the secured loan is $10\%$ (since the bank assumes this loan will be taken by the safe borrower), so that the repayment obligation is $1.10\times30=\$33$ . There is a 0.5 probability that the borrower will default and lose its collateral to the bank.  

Solving Equation (7.2) yields $C=\$33$ . Thus, if the bank demands a collateral whose value to the borrower is at least as great as $\$33$ , only A will choose the secured loan with an interest rate of $10\%$ . (Note that A’s net expected cash flow with the secured loan is $\$100-\$33=4567,$ , whereas with the unsecured loan it is $\$100-\$66=\$534)$ . B will choose the unsecured loan with an interest rate of $120\%$ . The bank can thus sort its borrowers according to risk. The outcome is a Nash equilibrium; the bank’s beliefs about which borrower chooses which loan is confirmed by their behaviors.  

You must have noticed that the bank’s collateral repossession cost had no bearing on the outcome. The reason is that the secured loan to A is riskless, so that A would never surrender collateral to the bank. Since the Nash equilibrium separates perfectly – each borrower revealing its type in equilibrium – and involves B choosing the unsecured loan, the bank never actually takes possession of collateral in this example. In reality, of course, few loans are riskless. With default risk in lending to A, then the bank’s repossession cost would have entered the outcome since it would have affected the interest rate on the secured loan.  

c. Moral Hazard: Using collateral can help resolve a variety of moral hazard problems. The three we will discuss here are: asset substitution, underinvestment, and inadequate effort supply.  

Asset Substitution: Because of the option nature of the bank loan, the borrower has an incentive to choose a riskier project after obtaining the loan. In a manner similar to capital, collateral can deter such risk-taking. For present purposes, think of security offered as outside collateral. Consider the following example.  

# Example 7.4  

Suppose Brown Bakery needs a $\$100$ loan to finance a project that will pay off next period. Brown can choose between two projects: S (safe) and R (risky). The bank knows this but is unable to directly control the borrower’s choice of project. S will yield a payoff of $\$300$ with probability 0.9 and nothing with probability 0.1, and R will yield a payoff of $\$400$ with probability 0.6 and nothing with probability 0.4. Everybody is risk neutral and the riskless rate is $10\%$ . How should the bank design its loan contract so that Brown will choose the safer project? Assume once again that collateral worth $\$1$ to Brown is worth 90 cents to the bank.  

# Solution  

The idea is for the bank to make it in Brown’s best interest to choose S. This is achieved by demanding that Brown put up sufficient collateral. Since collateral is surrendered to the bank upon default, it makes project failure costly to the borrower. Consequently, the borrower will wish to minimize the likelihood of failure by choosing S. The key assumption here is that the bank cannot directly control Brown’s project choice. We proceed in four steps. First, we will assume that the bank offers Brown an unsecured loan, assuming that S will be chosen. We will show that this cannot be a Nash equilibrium because Brown will choose R. Second, we will let the bank assume that R will be chosen and compute the interest rate on the unsecured loan. It turns out this is a Nash equilibrium in that Brown chooses R when faced with such an unsecured loan. Third, we ask whether another Nash equilibrium is possible, say with a secured loan. We solve for the level of collateral that ensures that Brown does not (strictly) prefer R to S. We do this by equating Brown Bakery’s expected profits from R and S, given a secured loan contract will indeed be acceptable to Brown Bakery and the bank. Finally, we verify that it is a Nash equilibrium for Brown to choose S.  

# Step 1  

First suppose the bank offers Brown an unsecured loan at an interest rate $r_{\mathrm{u}}$ If the bank assumes that Brown will choose $S,$ then the interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{S}},$ at which the bank just breaks even, is given by  

$$
[0.9\times(1+r_{\mathrm{u}}^{S})\times100]/\left[1.10\right]=100.
$$  

Solving Equation  7.3) yields $r_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{S}}=22.22\%$ . Can this be a Nash equilibrium in the sense that Brown does indeed choose S? To answer this question, let us compute Brown’s net expected payoffs under R and S. If Brown chooses S, its net expected payoff is  

$$
0.9[300-(1.22\times100)]=\$160.20.
$$  

f it chooses R, its net expected payoff is  

$$
0.6(400-122)=\$166.8.
$$  

Hence, offering Brown an unsecured loan with an interest rate of $22\%$ cannot be a Nash equilibrium since Brown will choose R instead of S, and the bank will make an expected loss on the loan since it assumed S would be chosen.  

Step 2 Now suppose the bank assumes that R will be chosen. Then the interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{R}},$ at which the bank just breaks even, is given by  

$$
[0.6\times(1+r_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{S}})\times100]/\left[1.1\right]=100.
$$  

Solving Equation  7.4) yields $r_{\mathrm{u}}^{\mathrm{R}}=83.33\%$ . Now, confronted with this interest rate, if Brown chooses ${\sf S},$ its net expected payoff is  

$$
0.9(300-183.33)=\S105.
$$  

f it chooses $\mathsf{R},$ its net expected payoff is  

$$
0.6(400-183.33)=\$130.
$$  

So, Brown chooses R and this is a Nash equilibrium since the bank’s belief is consistent with the borrower’s behavior.  

# Step 3  

But can we do better with another Nash equilibrium? Whenever we ask this question, it is natural to wonder who we are doing better for. Since the bank is assumed to earn zero expected profits in all scenarios, why should the bank care? The answer lies in competition. Recall that the zero expected profit condition is an analytical convenience. In practice we would expect the bank to earn at least a small profit. Remember too that this profit is in excess of the normal return on equity capital. Now, if the bank can design a contract that increases the borrower’s expected profit without reducing the bank’s, it can lure away this borrower from its competitors and build its “book” of business. Hence, competing banks should strive to give the borrower the best possible deal.  

Suppose now that the bank offers Brown a secured loan instead. What you want to do as a banker is to figure out how much collateral to ask for in order to ensure that R will not be chosen. The level of collateral that leaves Brown indifferent between S and R satisfies the following equation.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{0.9[300-(1+r_{s})\times100]-0.1C}\\ &{=0.6[400-(1+r_{s})\times100]-0.4C,}\end{array}
$$  

where $r_{\mathrm{s}}$ is the interest rate on the secured loan. We should first determine $r_{\mathrm{s}}$ If the bank is successful in inducing Brown to choose $S,$ then it should set $r_{\mathrm{s}}$ as follows to satisfy its zero profit condition  

$$
[0.9\times(1+r_{\mathrm{{s}}})\times100+0.1\times0.9\times C]/\left[1.1\right]=100.
$$  

n Equation  7.6), note that we have used the fact that a dollar of collateral is worth only 90 cents to the bank. Solving Equation  7.6) yields  

$$
1+r_{\mathrm{s}}=\left(110-0.09\mathsf{C}\right)/90.
$$  

Substituting Equation  7.7) in Equation (7.5) and solving for $C$ yields $C=\$20,202$ . To avoid rounding off problems, suppose we take $C=\$20.21$ . Then substituting this in Equation  7.7) gives us $1+r_{s}=(110-1.8189)/90=1.2020$ or say $r_{\mathrm{s}}=20.21\%$ to make sure that rounding off does not leave the bank with negative expected profit.  

# Step 4  

Now Brown’s net expected payoff from choosing S is [from Equation (7.5)] $\$159.79$ and from choosing R it is [again from Equation  7.5)] approximately $\$159.79$ . Hence, this is a Nash equilibrium in which Brown chooses S. Note that this equilibrium gives Brown a higher expected payoff than the previous Nash equilibrium $(\$130)$ .24 Thus, if this borrower comes to you and says that your cross-town rival has offered an unsecured loan at $83.33\%$ interest, you could effectively counter by offering a secured loan that requires $\$20.21$ of outside collateral and an interest rate of say $21\%$ . With these terms, Brown Bakery will accept your loan and you will earn a profit.25  

In this example, outside collateral was used since we assumed limited liability, that is, it would not be lost upon bankruptcy if it were not pledged. For somewhat different reasons, inside collateral can also deter asset substitution. By securing specific assets within the firm, creditors can ensure that these assets will not be replaced by those that increase the risk exposure of creditors. Since this reduction in asset substitution possibilities will be reflected in a better price for the firm’s debt, the advantage of issuing secured debt accrues to the firm’s shareholders.26  

Underinvestment: One manifestation of the divergence of interests between the borrower and the lender is in the borrower being unwilling to invest additional funds in a project even though doing so increases the total NPV of this project.27 The intuition is simple. Suppose you own some real estate that was financed mainly with a bank loan; this real estate is currently worth $\$1.5$ million. You could spend an additional million dollars that would enhance the real estate’s value by $\$1.1$ million. However, suppose that the present value of your repayment obligation to the bank is $\$2$ million. Then, although investing $\$1$ million yields an NPV of $\$100,000$ for the project as a whole, it is not a good idea for you, the owner/ borrower. This is because you increase the present value of the cash flows accruing to you by $\$123,456$ million – $\$2$ million $=\$600,000$ , but it costs you $\$1$ million, that is, the investment has a negative NPV of $\$400,000$ to you (the borrower), but a positive NPV of $\$100,000$ to the borrower and lender considered jointly. The net effect is that the investment is passed up and firm value is sacrificed. This investment inefficiency arises from actions that are privately optimal for the borrowing firm’s shareholders ex post. However, they pay a price for this ex ante since the lender anticipates such behavior and adjusts the terms of credit accordingly. How can we eliminate this form of moral hazard so that the borrower benefits ex ante through better credit terms?  

One answer is to let the borrower precommit not to “underinvest” ex post  If the lender believes the borrower, the problem will have apparently been solved. However, such precommitment is time inconsistent. The lender knows that the borrower has every reason to break this promise when the opportunity presents itself. So it would be foolish for the lender to believe such a promise. Of course, loan covenants can be employed, with the lender monitoring compliance. However, as a practical matter, it is difficult to see how loan covenants could force a borrower to invest when it is disinclined to do so. This is because the lender typically does not “see” these investment opportunities unless the borrower decides to exploit them. Covenants are effective in prohibiting actions, but rarely succeed in forcing unobservable initiatives.  

Secured debt can resolve this underinvestment problem.28 The idea is as follows. Suppose that the firm needs additional financing to purchase an asset, and it can purchase this asset for less than its market value. Thus, the purchase is a positive NPV investment. Also suppose that the firm currently has risky unsecured debt outstanding and would not, without further incentive, purchase this asset because it would enhance the present value accruing to the firm’s shareholders by less than the purchase price of the asset.  

To solve this problem, suppose the firm issues new debt secured by the asset in question. Then, due to the “absolute priority” rule, the secured creditors have first claim to the asset in the event of bankruptcy, and the borrowing firm has essentially diverted (at least part of) the cash flows attributable to this asset to the new secured creditors and away from the old unsecured creditors. Since the new (secured) creditors pay a fair market value for the debt issued by the firm, the gains associated with diverting payoffs of the newly purchased asset away from the old (unsecured) creditors accrue to the borrowing firm’s shareholders and increase their incentive to undertake the investment. The example in the box below illustrates how this works.  

# Example 7.5  

Consider a firm, Johnson Supplies, that can invest $\$100$ at the start of the period $(t=0)$ in a project that will pay off at the end of the period $(t=1$ ) $\$400$ if successful (state $S_{1}$ and zero if unsuccessful (state $S_{2}$ . State $\mathsf{S}_{1}$ occurs with probability 0.7. The initial $\$100$ financing comes from unsecured debt issued at $t=0$ . Before the end of the period, but after the initial financing is raised, the firm will have an opportunity to purchase an asset (call it A) for $\$100$ . This asset will surely be worth $\$120$ at $t=1$ . Assume that Johnson cannot be forced to purchase this asset. Compute Johnson’s optimal financing strategy. Assume that everybody is risk neutral and that the riskless interest rate is $10\%$ .  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in six steps. First, we assume that only unsecured debt can be offered and that the date-0 unsecured creditors will assume that Johnson will purchase A when available. We then compute the interest rate on the $\$100$ of (new) unsecured debt raised (after the initial financing) to purchase A. Second, we check if this can be a Nash equilibrium. We find that it is not, in that Johnson will not purchase A when burdened with the original unsecured debt. Third, we check if it is a Nash equilibrium for Johnson not to purchase A. That is, if the original creditors price their debt assuming that Johnson will not purchase $\mathsf{A},$ will Johnson indeed not purchase A (since Johnson does not purchase $\mathsf{A},$ we need not worry about the old creditors)? We find that this is a Nash equilibrium. Fourth, we introduce secured debt and compute the interest rates on the old unsecured and the new secured debt when all creditors assume that Johnson will purchase A when available. Fifth, we check if this is a Nash equilibrium. We find that it is a Nash equilibrium in that Johnson does purchase A and also wishes to issue secured debt to purchase A. Finally, in step 6, we conclude by indicating that the NPV to Johnson’s shareholders is higher in the secured-debt Nash equilibrium than in the unsecured-debt Nash equilibrium when Johnson does not purchase A.  

Step 1  

First suppose that issuing secured debt is impossible. Thus, the $\$100$ financing required to purchase A in the future will have to be raised with either equity or unsecured debt. Since the basic argument follows in either case, let us assume that unsecured debt will be employed. As a start, suppose the unsecured creditors at $t=0$ (call them $\mathrm{C_{old}}\mathrm{,}$ assume that Johnson will purchase A when available. Use $C_{\mathsf{n e w}}$ to label the (new) unsecured creditors who provide the $\$100$ to buy A. Thus, at $t=1$ , the value of the firm will be $\$520$ (in state $S_{1}$ with probability 0.7 and $\$120$ (in state $S_{2}\mathrm{\dot{.}}$ with probability 0.3. Assuming that all unsecured creditors have equal priority, $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ will be repaid in full in state $\mathsf{S}_{1}$ and will receive $\$60$ in state $S_{2}$ The payoffs to $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ are identical. Hence, the loan interest rates on the credits provided by $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ will also be identical. Let $r_{\mathrm{a}}$ represent this interest rate. Then, if creditors provide fairly priced debt (that is, each creditor earns zero expected profit), $r_{\mathrm{a}}$ is obtained as a solution to the following equation  

$$
100=[(1+r_{\mathrm{a}})\times100\times0.7+60\times0.3]/[1.1].
$$  

The left-hand side of Equation (7.8) is the amount of debt financing. The right-hand side is the expected payoff to either $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ or $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{new}\prime}$ discounted at the riskless rate of $10\%$ . Solving Equation  7.8) yields $r_{\mathrm{a}}=31.43\%$ . Thus, at $t=1$ Johnson is obliged to repay $\$131.43$ to $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ and the same amount to $C_{\mathsf{n e w}}$  

Step 2  

The first question is: Can this be a Nash equilibrium? To answer this, we must find out whether $\mathrm{C_{old}}^{\prime}\mathrm{s}$ assumption that Johnson will purchase A is indeed correct. Now, if Johnson purchases $\mathsf{A},$ , the NPV accruing to its shareholders is  

$$
{\frac{0.7\times(520-262.86)}{1.1}}=\S163.63.
$$  

Note that Johnson’s shareholders receive a positive payoff only in state $\mathsf{S}_{1},$ and this payoff is $\$520(\$400+\$5120)$ minus two times $\$131.43$ , where $\$131.43$ is what Johnson owes each group of unsecured creditors. If, on the other hand, Johnson does not purchase $\mathsf{A},$ then the NPV accruing to its shareholders is  

$$
\frac{0.7\times(400-161.43)}{1.1}=\S170.91.
$$  

Thus, Johnson will forgo the opportunity to purchase A even though its total NPV $(\$120-\$100/1.1=\S18.18)$ to Johnson is positive. This means that it cannot be a Nash equilibrium for $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ to assume that Johnson will purchase A.  

Step 3 So now suppose $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ assumes that Johnson will not purchase A. Then, the loan interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{b}},$ is a solution to  

$$
[0.7\times(1+r_{\mathrm{b}})\times100]/[1.1]=100
$$  

Solving Equation (7.9) yields $r_{\mathrm{b}}=57.143\%$ . It is simple to verify that, faced with this loan interest rate, Johnson will indeed choose not to purchase A. Thus, this is a Nash equilibrium, under the assumption that secured debt is impossible. The NPV accruing to Johnson’s shareholders in this Nash equilibrium is given by  

$$
\frac{0.7\times(400-157.143)}{1.1}=\S154.5.
$$  

Step 4  

magine now that Johnson is free to finance A with secured debt. If Johnson chooses to do this, then the (secured) claim of $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ will be riskless since the minimum firm value (that prevails in state $S_{2}\mathrm{\backslash}$ is $\$120$ (the value of A at $t=1$ ), and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ have first claim to this asset. Since the riskless rate is $10\%,$ , Johnson’s repayment obligation on riskless debt will be $\$120,$ and this can be covered from the value of this firm in state $S_{2}$ Now suppose $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ assumes that Johnson will purchase A when available. The loan interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{c}\prime}$ that $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ charges will then be a solution to  

$$
[0.7\times{(1+r_{\mathrm{{c}}})}\times100+0.3\times10]/\left[{1.1}\right]=100,
$$  

where we recognize that $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ will be paid only $\$10$ in state $S_{2}$ since $\mathrm{C_{old}}^{\prime}\mathrm{s}$ claim is subordinated to that of $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ Solving Equation 7.10) gives us $r_{\mathrm{c}}=52.86\%$ . Johnson’s total repayment obligation, therefore, is $\$152.86+\$110=\S262.86$ .  

s this a Nash equilibrium? Again, we consider Johnson’s incentive to purchase A. If it purchases $\mathsf{A},$ the NPV accruing to its shareholders is  

$$
{\frac{0.7\times(520-262.86)}{1.1}}=\S163.63.
$$  

and if it does not purchase A, the NPV accruing to shareholders is  

$$
{\frac{0.7\times(400-152.86)}{1.1}}=\S157.3.
$$  

Hence, Johnson will indeed purchase A (when $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ prices the loan assuming A will be purchased) and the conjecture of $\mathrm{C_{old}}$ about the firm’s incentive to purchase A is supported by its behavior. To complete our verification that this is a Nash equilibrium, we must also make sure that Johnson will indeed wish to issue secured debt to purchase A. To check this, let us hold the fixed price of the loan given by $\mathrm{C_{old}},$ so that the firm must repay $\$152.86$ . If Johnson issues unsecured debt to purchase A, then $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{new}}$ will ask for a loan interest rate of $31.43\%$ [since they solve Equation  7.8) to determine this loan interest rate], so that the NPV accruing to Johnson’s shareholders is  

$$
\frac{0.7\times\left[520-(152.86+131.43)\right]}{1.1}=\S150.
$$  

Step 6   
Thus, Johnson will indeed choose to finance A with secured debt. Moreover, the NPV to Johnson’s shareholders in this Nash equilibrium $\$163.63)$ exceeds that in the previous Nash equilibrium when it could only finance the purchase of A with unsecured debt $(\$154.5)$ . Hence, it will not be in the interest of Johnson Supplies to precommit to never issue secured debt in the future through restrictive covenants written into its loan contract with $\mathrm{C_{old}}$  

Apart from illustrating how secured debt can resolve the underinvestment problem, this example brings up an interesting point related to the design of covenants in loan contracts. It is sometimes believed that creditors wish to protect themselves against future expropriation by including loan covenants that prohibit the firm from issuing future debt that has a higher seniority claim against any subset of the firm’s assets. When all is said and done, however, in a competitive market it is the borrower who decides what covenants to accept, since the lender can presumably adjust the price of the loan (to at least break even) depending on the covenants that the borrower is willing to accept. What our example shows is that it may be optimal for the borrower to leave itself the flexibility to avail of secured borrowing in the future in which the newly purchased assets are used as collateral, so that new creditors have the most senior claim to the assets.29 This not only makes the borrower better off, but it even lowers the interest rate on the initial debt $\mathrm{\DeltaC_{old}}$ in our example). In our example, the interest rate on the loan provided by $\mathrm{\bfC}_{\mathrm{old}}$ is $57.143\%$ when the issuance of debt of higher seniority in the future with respect to any asset is prohibited, and it is $52.86\%$ when such issuance is permitted. The reason for this, of course, is that the ability to issue secured debt in the future resolves the underinvestment problem of debt.  

Inadequate Effort Supply: Another moral hazard is that the borrower may expend insufficient effort in managing the firm when its assets are highly leveraged. Collateral can help to resolve this moral hazard problem, too. The following example uses outside collateral to illustrate the point.  

# Example 7.6  

Consider an entrepreneur, Mr. David Barnes, who borrows $\$100$ at $t=0$ (the start of the period) and invests the loan in a project that will pay off at $t=1$ an amount $\$300$ in the successful state (state $S_{1}$ and nothing in the unsuccessful state (state $S_{2}$ for his start-up firm, Barnes Manufacturing. The probability of $\mathsf{S}_{1}$ is $p(\mathrm{e}),$ where $e$ is Mr. Barnes’ effort in managing the project. Mr. Barnes can choose one of two effort levels: high $(h)$ or low $(I)$ . Mr. Barnes sustains a personal cost of $\$40$ to expend $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{h}}$ and nothing if $I$ is chosen. Assume $p(h)=0.8$ and $p(I)=0.6$ . Mr. Barnes has collateral available, but collateral worth $\$1$ to him is worth 90 cents to the bank. Assume that the bank cannot observe ${\cal{M}}\mathrm{\Delta}r$ . Barnes’ choice of effort. The riskless interest rate is $10\%$ . Compute the optimal loan contract.  

# Solution  

We want to show in this example that Mr. Barnes will work harder if the bank has loaned him $\$100$ with a secured debt contract. We will proceed in four steps. First, we will assume that the bank is restricted to offering an unsecured loan. We show that it is not a Nash equilibrium for Mr. Barnes to choose $e=h$ . Second, continuing with the unsecured debt assumption, we show that it is a Nash equilibrium for Mr. Barnes to choose $e=I,$ and for the bank to price its loan accordingly. Third, we introduce collateral and solve for the amount that makes Mr. Barnes indifferent between l and h. We find that with this level of collateral it is indeed a Nash equilibrium for Mr. Barnes to choose $\boldsymbol{\mathrm{h}}$ . Finally, in the fourth step, we check that Mr. Barnes himself is better off with secured debt, which serves as a precommitment that he will work harder.  

# Step 1  

Suppose first that the bank restricts itself to offering an unsecured loan. If the bank assumes that Mr. Barnes will choose $e=h_{\ast}$ , then the interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}},$ it should charge on this unsecured loan to just break even satisfies  

$$
[0.8\times(1+r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}})\times100/[1+0.10]=100,
$$  

which yields $r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}}=37.5\%$ . To check if this is a Nash equilibrium, we need to ask whether $M\mathrm{{r}}.$ Barnes, faced with this loan contract, will indeed choose $e=h$ Mr. Barnes’ expected payoff with $\mathbf{e}=h$ is  

$$
0.8\times(300-137.5)-40=90,
$$  

whereas his expected payoff with $e=I$ is $0.6\times(300-137.5)=97.5.$ Thus, this is not a Nash equilibrium since Mr. Barnes prefers $\mathrm{{e}}={\cal I}.$  

Step 2  

t is, however, a Nash equilibrium for the bank to assume that Mr. Barnes will choose $e=I,$ and price the unsecured loan accordingly. The loan interest rate, $r_{\mathrm{|}}^{\mathrm{u}}$ must satisfy  

$$
[0.6\times(1+r_{\mathrm{{i}}}^{\mathrm{u}})\times100/[1.10]=100,
$$  

which yields $r_{\mathrm{|}}^{\mathrm{u}}=83.33\%$ . ${\cal M}{\sf r}$ . Barnes’ expected payoff with $e=h$ is $0.8\times(300-183.33)-40=53.34$ . His expected payoff with $e=|$ is $0.6\times(300-183.33)=70.00$ . Thus, it is a Nash equilibrium for the bank to price its unsecured loan assuming that Mr. Barnes will choose $e=1$ .  

Step 3  

Now let us see if we can do better by using collateral. Let $C$ be the collateral that leaves ${\cal M}{\sf r}$ . Barnes indifferent between choosing l and h. Then $r_{\mathrm{|}}^{\mathrm{u}}$ and $C$ must be related by the following equation  

$$
[0.8\times(1+r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}})\times100+0.2\times0.9\mathsf{C}=110,
$$  

The left-hand side of Equation  7.13) recognizes that the bank is repaid in full if the project is successful (this has probability 0.8) and only collects the collateral if the project fails (with probability 0.2). The value of the collateral to the bank is 0.9C. Solving Equation  7.13) gives  

$$
1+r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{s}}=1.375-0.00225C.
$$  

Now, the amount of collateral needed to leave Mr. Barnes indifferent between $I$ and $h$ is given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{0.8\times[300-100\times(1.375-0.00225\mathrm{C})]-0.2C-40}\\ &{=0.6\times[300-100\times(1.375-0.00225\mathrm{C})]-0.4C}\end{array}
$$  

Note that in Equation (7.15) we have substituted for $r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}}$ using Equation (7.14). Solving Equation (7.15) yields $C=\$30.61$ . Using this value of $C$ in Equation  7.14) gives $r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}}=30.613\%$ . To have Mr. Barnes strictly prefer $h,$ suppose we choose $C=\$30.62$ . Mr. Barnes’ payoff if he chooses $e=h$ is now the left-hand side of Equation  7.15) with $C=\$30.62$ and $r_{\mathrm{h}}^{\mathrm{u}}=30.613\%$ . It is $\$89,386$ . If Mr. Barnes chooses $e=I,$ his expected payoff is the right-hand side of Equation  7.15) and is given by $\$89,384$ . Hence, Mr. Barnes prefers to choose $h,$ and it is a Nash equilibrium for the bank to offer this secured loan on the assumption that Mr. Barnes will choose $e=h$  

Step 4   
Note that Mr. Barnes’ expected payoff in the Nash equilibrium with unsecured debt is $\$70$ , whereas in the Nash equilibrium with secured debt it is $\$89,384$ (if Mr. Barnes chooses $e=I)$ or $\$89,386$ (if Mr. Barnes chooses $\mathbf{e}=h.$ . Thus, Mr. Barnes is better off by taking a secured loan, even though the use of collateral is dissipative.  

We have discussed the various roles of collateral. The type and amount of collateral used will depend on which of these problems is dominant.30 As mentioned earlier, using collateral can be costly, however, because of repossession costs. Additional costs are created because the quality of collateral must be appraised prior to making the loan and then monitored regularly during the life of the loan. The reason for the appraisal and monitoring is that variations in the quality of a particular type of collateral across different borrowers may be quite large. For example, when collateral consists of accounts receivable, it will be of much higher quality if it is pledged by a borrower that has receivables due from well-capitalized companies with triple A ratings than if it is pledged by a borrower with receivables due from weak credit risks. Another example is contract receivables,31 whose risk increases with volatility in business cycles. The point is that all collateral is not the same, and the deployment of collateral has various costs associated with it. These costs must be traded off against the potential benefits of collateral in deciding how to use collateral in lending. We turn now to the last of the “five $\mathrm{Cs}^{\prime\prime}$ of credit.  

5. Conditions: By this we mean the economic conditions that affect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Debts are repaid from four sources: income, sale of assets, sale of stock, and borrowing from another source. All of these should be assessed in determining the desirability, price, and other terms of the loan. The borrower’s ability to generate income depends on: the selling prices of its goods, costs of inputs, competition, quality of goods and services, advertising effectiveness, and quality of management. Analysis of the borrower’s financial statements as well as its management should inform the bank about the borrower’s ability to create income.  

# SOURCES OF CREDIT INFORMATION  

The information used in underwriting credit is inherently costly and of uneven quality. The banker’s critical skill in credit lies in assembling the most germane information at the lowest possible cost without violating legal requirements or social norms. This means identifying novel sources of information and using standard sources in clever ways. Following is a brief description of some of the standard sources of bank credit information, but we should emphasize that standard uses of standard sources is unlikely to produce anything better than average results. The clever use of credit information is a cultivated art form that distinguishes the successful lender from the pack.  

Standard credit sources can be classified as: internal and external. By internal sources we mean those within the bank, and by external sources we mean all other.  

# Internal Sources  

1. Interview with Applicant: The loan interview normally establishes the uses to which the borrowed funds will be put for the loan request and the conformity of the application with the bank’s loan policies. For example, the bank’s policy guidelines usually stipulate a minimum equity input by the borrower, so that a violation of this guideline can be discussed with the borrower, leading perhaps to a smaller loan request. The loan interview is also used to judge intangibles related to the borrower’s future repayment behavior. Moreover, it also provides the loan officer with an opportunity to advise the applicant about any additional financial information that might be needed for evaluating the application. 2. Bank’s Own Records: A bank normally maintains records of its depositors and borrowers. This source of information allows the bank to assess the borrower’s past behavior.32 For example, bank records will show the payment performance on previous loans, the balances carried in checking and savings accounts, and overdrawing patterns, if any. Even for applicants who have never been customers of the bank, the central file may contain some information if these applicants were solicited as potential customers.  

# External Sources  

1. Borrower’s Financial Statements; These are required of most borrowers. Audited statements are common requirements in commercial lending. Even in consumer lending, where loans are usually small, an applicant is normally asked to list what he/she owns, income and expenses, and outstanding debts.   
2. Credit Information Brokers: Information agencies or credit bureaus systematically collect financial information on potential borrowers and make it generally available at a price (recall Chapter 3). The most widely known is Dun & Bradstreet (D&B), which collects information on over 3 million businesses in the United States and Canada. D&B’s Business Information Report provides information on the type of business, nature of ownership, composite credit rating, promptness with which the firm makes payment, sales, net worth, number of employees, general condition of the firm including information about its physical facilities, customer base, balance sheet information, the usual size of the firm’s deposit balances, its payments record under loan agreements, and biographical information on principals. More detailed information can be found in D&B’s Key Account Report. In Dun’s Review, D&B also publishes information about financial ratios for a large number of industries.  

Comparative financial information can also be found in the Annual Statement Studies published by Robert Morris Associates, a professional association of professional lenders. There are numerous other surveyors of credit information, specializing in consumer, business, and even governmental borrowers.  

3. Other Banks: Banks sometimes check with other banks that have had relationships with the loan applicant. They may also check with the firm’s suppliers,33 to learn how the firm pays its bills, and with the firm’s customers to determine the quality of its products and the dependability of its service.  

# ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

In evaluating the borrower’s ability to service a loan, the bank will focus on the firm’s internal sources for future generation of funds. These are: (i) net income, (ii) depreciation34  (iii) reduction of accounts receivables, and (iv) reduction of inventories. To assess the potential of these cash flows, the bank examines the borrower’s financial statements. However, financial statements are noisy. It is often necessary to work with audited statements that are months too old, along with unaudited interim statements that raise questions of authenticity. Even audited statements have their problems owing to the idiosyncracies of GAAP and the occasional lapses and professional compromises of auditors. These problems aside, financial statements value assets using nonmarket criteria such as book values, and income is distorted accordingly. Thus, financial statements should be interpreted with caution. An illustration is provided by the bursting of the stock market bubble in 2000 that was credited by some to a bond analyst raising questions about the credit worthiness of Amazon.com’s debt based on accounting information not accurately reflecting cash flows for credit risk assessment purposes and concluding that Amazon’s credit risk was higher than it seemed.35  

# Evaluation of the Balance Sheet  

# Assets  

1. Accounts Receivables: Accounts receivables are among the shortest maturity assets on the borrower’s balance sheet and are typically seen as the major source of cash flows to service short-term loans. Standard analyses focus on the sizes, sources, and aging of accounts, as well as the extent to which the accounts receivables are actively managed and diversified. As with any other risky asset portfolio, diversification lowers risk. The bank may also wish to investigate the financial attributes of those who owe money to the borrower since these speak to the quality of the borrower’s receivables. Credit bureaus are especially useful in evaluating the quality of the borrower’s receivables. Also, the current status or aging of receivables is a powerful indicator of their quality. For example, if a large fraction of receivables are 90 days or older and the convention is to pay in 30 days or less, the implications are transparent.  

Not all borrowers need to be screened equally carefully. Relatively low-risk borrowers who may be close to qualifying for unsecured loans often fall under a “bulk” or “blanket-assignment” lending plan. For such borrowers, the bank may require only monthly borrowing-base certificates and aging or inventory listing, without maintaining active dayto-day control over collections. In the next risk category may be customers who keep good records and have a welldiversified accounts receivables portfolio. For such borrowers, the bank may impose additional reporting requirements, including detailed assignment, collection, and aging schedules. In the highest risk category are borrowers with weak balance sheets and inadequate working capital. Here the bank requires all standard reports plus copies of shipping documents, delivery receipts, and assigned invoices against which the bank will lend. It is common for the bank to require such borrowers to remit collections directly to the bank in the form of checks “in kind.” This is a way for the bank to exercise additional control. The bank might even mail invoices directly to the accounts in the borrower’s accounts receivables portfolio, asking for payments to be made directly to the bank.36  

2. Contract Receivables: A borrower may be a contractor who has been engaged to perform some task in the future. Official recognition of this may appear in chattel paper that shows the monetary obligations of the party for whom this task is being performed. These monetary obligations are called contract receivables. Chattel paper often serves as collateral for a working capital loan. Contract receivables are riskier than accounts receivables since payment is conditional on the borrower’s future performance. There is consequently a double moral hazard, one that the borrower may not successfully complete the contracted task and the other that the third party may not pay the borrower even if the task is successfully completed.37 Thus, greater monitoring efforts are warranted for contracts receivables.  

3. Inventory: The age, liquidity, price stability, obsolescence, shrinkage, the adequacy of insurance coverage, the stage of processing, and the firm’s method of inventory accounting are all issues in evaluating inventories.  

As with any other form of collateral, the bank should be concerned about incentive effects as well as liquidation value. However, valuing partially processed inventories is difficult and a credit-analysis art form. Both raw materials and finished goods inventories are easier to value and have greater liquidity than partially processed goods. In many cases, raw material inventories have the broadest market and the lowest price volatility. As with other collateral, monitoring is crucial in that inventory stocks are constantly in flux, with potentially damaging consequences for the secured lender.  

4. Fixed Assets: Normally, banks do not consider the sale of a fixed asset as a source of funds for loan repayment. However, surplus fixed assets can be occasional and strategic sources of cash flows. Whereas the main importance of fixed assets lies in their ability to produce cash flows and not in their resale value, business restructurings often generate surplus fixed assets whose expeditious sale can be value creating.  

5. Intangible Assets: These include trademarks, patents, copyrights, and goodwill. These assets are normally accorded little value by a bank because of their illiquidity and measurement errors. There are, of course, exceptions, but by and large bankers apply large discounts to such assets.  

6. Amounts Due: Banks often take a dim view of a firm’s management if the firm’s assets include amounts due from officers and employees. Amounts due create the suspicion of internal fraud and nepotism.  

# Liabilities and Net Worth  

1. Accounts Payable: The borrower’s accounts payable should speak volumes to its bank. If the borrower does not pay its trade creditors timely, why should the bank expect to be treated differently? The bank should ascertain whether payables are in the form of notes since this may indicate that the firm has been denied trade credit. The bank should be similarly alarmed if the borrower has been asked by its suppliers for cash-on-delivery (COD) terms. In case the borrower owes money to its own shareholders or officers, the bank should demand explanation and may ask that such liabilities be subordinated to any bank loan. The bank should also review the amounts accrued for taxes and other expenses.  

2. Long-Term Liabilities: These consist of term loans, debentures, notes, mortgage loans, and other liabilities with maturities exceeding 1 year. The bank should be concerned with the nature and maturity of these obligations and the provisions that have been made for meeting the required payments. Their covenants may also be important for the bank considering a loan request. In particular, it is important to know whether the outstanding debt is secured and if so, which assets have already been pledged as collateral.  

3. Net Worth: The importance of equity capital to credit analysis is transparent, given our earlier discussions. However, accounting net worth is a particularly treacherous account because it is fraught with measurement errors. This item is the residual of assets and liabilities, with each asset and liability independently evaluated with error. Hence, the net worth compounds all of the errors embedded in the underlying accounts. If all assets and liabilities could be evaluated at market, the net worth should be the economic value of equity claims. However, with accounting distortions and other measurement errors, accounting net worth can be a hard-to-interpret residual.  

4. Contingent Liabilities: These are important because of their potential to become actual liabilities. If they do, they could seriously impair the debt-servicing capability of the borrower. Assessing the relevant probabilities and exposures may call for considerable information and sophistication. Moreover, such liabilities do not always appear in the body of the borrower’s balance sheet. Even when footnote disclosures reveal the borrower’s exposure (maximum liability), the present value of the liability depends also on the unspecified contingencies and probabilities.  

# The Income Statement  

Income statement analysis complements balance sheet analysis. Bankers tend to emphasize the balance sheet in evaluating short-term loans, but devote greater attention to the income statement for longer-maturity loans. Recall that the balance sheet measures stocks, whereas the income statement measures flows. Hence, by looking at past and present income statements, the bank should be able to learn something about the degree of stability in the borrower’s cash flows. Of course, in determining cash flow trends, the bank should be careful to note possible changes in the borrower’s accounting practices can obfuscate.  

The bank will often use both the balance sheet and the income statement in its ratio analysis. Key financial ratios convey information about the firm’s liquidity, stability, profitability, and cash flow prospects.  

![](images/c9045307e3fe87ca875b28927a5a0ea01085802fe3b5e42453798d6850315142.jpg)  
FIGURE 7.9 United States – Measures of Corporate Financial Performance for Investment Grade Corporate Borrowers (Ratio), 1994–2005 (Source Citigroup.) Note: Pretax interest coverage is net income from continuing operations before taxes divided by reported gross interest expense. Data are fo industrial credits within the Citigroup BIG Credit Index.  

Basically, there are four types of ratios: liquidity, activity (or turnover), profitability, and financial leverage.  

1. Two measures of liquidity are commonly used: current ratio $\c=$ current assets/current liabilities, quick ratio (or acid test current assets − inventories ratio) $\c=$ current liabilities  

a. By “current” we mean a duration of less than 1 year.  

2. Activity ratios include the following: a. Inventory turnover ratio $\c=$ sales/inventory. b. Average collection period (in days) $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ receivables/sales per day. c. Total assets turnover $\c=$ sales/total assets. d. Fixed asset turnover $\c=$ sales/net fixed assets.  

3. There are also numerous profitability ratios. These include:  

a. Profit margin on sales $\c=$ net profit after taxes/sales.   
b. Return on total assets $\c=$ net profit after taxes/total assets.   
c. Return on net worth $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ net profit after taxes/net worth.  

4. The leverage ratio is defined as total debt/total assets.  

Perhaps the two most important leverage ratios used by lenders are: pretax interest coverage and total debt to EBITDA.38 Pretax interest coverage is defined as net income from continuing operations before taxes divided by reported gross interest expense. EBITDA is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Figure 7.9 shows the behavior of these ratios through time for investmentgrade U.S. corporate borrowers. It shows that the credit risk of these borrowers has been declining since 2002.  

It is worth emphasizing that these ratios are usually expressed in terms of accounting values. Since bankers evaluate these ratios against peers, it is useful to remember that different firms may use different accounting methods. We provide a case at the end of this chapter that calls for ratio analysis as part of the credit evaluation process.  

# LOAN COVENANTS  

Covenants are special clauses designed to protect the bank and prohibit the borrower from taking actions that could adversely affect the likelihood of repayment. By agreeing to loan covenants that limit its actions, the borrower precommits to eschewing strategies that might expropriate wealth from the lender. The effect is to reduce the moral hazard faced by the lender and improve the terms of the loan agreement for the borrower. That is, loan covenants reduce the agency costs of debt and thereby benefit the borrower ex ante, and also the lender. Indeed, covenants make possible loans that would not otherwise be made at all. There is, of course, a limit to how restrictive a set of covenants the borrower will wish to accept. Restrictive covenants can make the loan reasonably safe for the lender but may deprive the borrower of valuable investment options and strategies.39  

Loan covenants normally depend on the financial condition of the borrower, its investment opportunities, the track record of its management, and the lending philosophy of the bank. Covenants are commonly classified into four kinds: affirmative covenants, restrictive clauses, negative covenants, and default provisions.  

# Affirmative Covenants  

These are obligations imposed on the borrower. A commonly used covenant in this group is a requirement that the bank be periodically furnished with financial statements. The purpose, of course, is to permit the bank to keep track of the borrower’s financial condition and enable preventive steps to be taken if trouble is indicated.  

Another example is a requirement that the borrower maintain a minimum level of working capital. Banks will occasionally require the borrower to maintain a management acceptable to the bank. If management should change due to resignation, death, or other causes, the bank must approve the replacement.  

# Restrictive Clauses  

These are designed to impose limits on the borrower’s actions. A commonly used restrictive clause is one that limits the amount of dividends the borrower can pay its shareholders. The economic rationale for this covenant is transparent. A major concern for any creditor is the borrower’s inclination to divert liquidity and net worth to shareholders rather than keep it within the firm to protect creditors.  

It is also common for the bank to restrict salaries, bonuses, and advances to employees of the firm, as well as to limit specific types of investments such as purchases of fixed assets. The economic rationale for restrictions on investments is to protect creditors against asset substitutions that may reduce the value of the firm’s debt. By purchasing a fixed asset, for example, the bank may be replacing cash on its balance sheet with an asset that will produce risky cash flows; this may increase the risk exposure of creditors.  

# Negative Covenants  

While restrictive covenants limit certain actions, negative covenants prohibit them outright, absent the bank’s consent. A common negative covenant is the negative pledge clause, usually found in unsecured loans. It prohibits the borrower from pledging any of its assets as security to other lenders. While the negative pledge clause is more common in unsecured loans, it is also encountered in secured loans. The banker may want to include this clause even though the bank’s claim is protected with collateral because if the borrower defaults, the value of the collateral may be substantially diminished. In this case, the bankruptcy law stipulates that for that portion of the bank’s claim in excess of the value of the collateral, the bank has the same status as a general (unsecured) creditor. So the fewer the assets of the firm that are pledged for other loans, the greater is the share available to the bank in the event of bankruptcy.  

There may also be prohibitions regarding mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. The reason for this is that these developments can alter the firm’s risk profile, possibly to the creditor’s detriment. It is also common for the bank to prohibit borrowers from making loans to others or guaranteeing the debts or other performances of others. Again, the economic rationale is clear. If the borrower were to do these things, it would assume additional credit risk on its account. By prohibiting such actions, the bank protects its own claim.  

# Default Provisions  

These are intended to make the entire loan immediately due and payable under certain conditions. Ordinarily, even though the bank has covenants that are intended to govern the borrower’s behavior, violation need not automatically empower the bank to call the loan as long as scheduled payments are being made. However, some covenants will include an acceleration clause that specifies events of default. Effectively, violation of a covenant leading to any of the events of default automatically places the loan in default and full payment becomes due immediately. This permits the bank to take more timely actions than would be possible if it had to wait until a payment was missed. Acceleration clauses are often triggered by the following:  

Failure to make timely payments.   
Inaccuracy in representations and warranties.   
Violation of covenants.   
Bankruptcy, liquidation and/or appointment of a receiver.   
Entry of a judgment in excess of a specified amount.   
Impairment of collateral, invalidity of a guarantee and/or security agreement.   
Failure to pay other indebtedness when due or to perform under related agreements  Cross default.   
 Cross acceleration.   
Change of management or ownership.   
Expropriation of assets.  

Any of the above may be considered an event of default, in which case the loan is accelerated and will lead to either renegotiation or default. In some cases, the loan agreement provides the borrower a period of time, referred to as a cure or grace period, to correct its default. If cured, the bank is then required to continue the loan. In the case where the default is not cured, the bank may terminate the lending relationship. The bank may also set off the borrower’s deposits against its obligation to repay the loan and exercise its right to foreclose on collateral and even force the borrower into receivership. The cross-default provision gives the bank the right to declare an event of default when the borrower is in default on another obligation. Though banks rarely exercise the right to accelerate loan repayment, having this right substantially strengthens a lender’s position.  

# Other Parameters of the Loan Agreement  

Loan agreements have many provisions other than amount and price that must be negotiated between the bank and the borrower. Some of the more important parameters of the loan agreement are:  

 A take-down schedule: a time table for withdrawing funds from the bank.   
 An installment schedule: a time table for repaying the interest, other charges, and principal.   
 A compensating balance requirement: an obligation by the borrower to maintain deposits at the lending bank. (This requirement is usually stated in terms of the average deposit balance but may include minima as well.)   
 A prepayment provision: a possible penalty for repaying a loan earlier than required. The loan agreement also may contain provisions especially tailored to a specific situation. For example:   
 The borrower agrees to sell, within the next 12 months, at public auction, or by any other commercially reasonable means, a commercial property owned by the borrower located at the corner of Oak and Spring Streets in Center City.   
The borrower agrees, within 180 days, to divest himself of his interest in a partnership known as Branson Truck Lines, and to apply any and all proceeds from the sale thereof to this loan. The borrower agrees to obtain, as soon as possible, and to assign to the bank, $\$100,000$ of term life insurance.  

It is worth keeping in mind that covenants, no matter how elaborate, can never anticipate all contingencies and prevent all disasters. For example, a borrower could have adequate liquidity as measured by its stock of working capital, and yet its actual liquidity position may be very poor because its accounts receivables portfolio is concentrated in a few high-creditrisk accounts. No loan covenants can replace vigilant and ongoing monitoring by the bank.  

# CONCLUSION  

In this chapter we have examined the bank’s spot-lending decision. We have seen that a loan typically is an illiquid debt contract, without an active secondary market. The distinction between bank loans and traded bonds is significant on two grounds. First, trading tends to narrow informational gaps between borrowers and lenders, so that bank loans usually have less known about them than corporate bonds. Second, banks perform valuable screening services that overcome private information problems and postlending monitoring that resolves moral hazard problems. Thus, we should expect banks to lend to borrowers about whom less is known a priori and to those who have a rich set of investment opportunities so that moral hazard is a concern. This suggests a way to think about which borrowers approach banks and which go to the capital market (recall Chapter 3).  

We have also discussed the design of loan contracts by banks in light of the informational problems they face. We have devoted considerable attention to the role of collateral and capital in overcoming these informational problems in traditional credit analysis.  

Banks use a variety of internal and external information sources in order to perform the credit analysis needed to effectively screen borrowers. We have discussed these sources to highlight the potential impact of information availability on the bank’s credit decision and its loan contract design. We hope that our discussions in this chapter have convinced you that the bank’s lending decision is a complex one and expertise in credit analysis, loan contract design, and postlending monitoring is a valuable resource. Hence, the uniqueness of a bank (recall Chapters 2 and 3). However, even the best experts cannot always effectively overcome informational problems in loan contracting. Sometimes these problems are insurmountable, and sometimes new information arrives that makes a previously negotiated loan contract inefficient. How banks deal with such situations is the subject of the next chapter.  

# CASE STUDY: INDIANA BUILDING SUPPLIES, INC.  

The date is January 15, 2001. Alex Brown, vice president of the First National Bank of Bloomington (FNBB), was approached by Peter Willis, one of his loan officers who recently completed his training program at the bank after graduating with an MBA from a leading business school. Peter has been concerned about the financial ratios of one of FNBB’s borrowers, Indiana Building Supplies, Inc. (IBS). The bank has installed a new software package to assist in its credit analysis, and this package monitors existing borrowers, alerting the bank to possible problems. This software package has indicated deterioration in some key financial ratios of IBS and has Peter worried about the likelihood that IBS will be able to repay the $\$473,000$ it owes to FNBB by the due date of December 26, 2006.  

Peter told Alex that he had run a special computer analysis on IBS about a month back and had noticed that some of the key financial ratios of the firm were trending downward. Peter based his assessment of IBS’s ratios on the data provided in Tables 7.5 and 7.6  Not only were these ratios below the averages for the building supplies industry, but they were also at variance with the stipulations in the loan covenants negotiated between IBS and FNBB. Table 7.7 shows industry averages as well as loan covenant stipulations for key financial ratios for IBS. After his financial analysis, Peter contacted Bob Clemens, president of IBS, by phone and followed up with a letter providing details justifying his concerns. Clemens replied with a brief letter in which he conceded that some of the financial ratios had dipped below the levels specified in the loan covenants, but that there was no cause for alarm since the financial health of IBS was generally sound. Clemens pointed to the remarkable improvement in the firm’s profit margin in 2005 relative to 2003 and 2004, and the fact that his return on net worth in 2005 was significantly above the industry average. When Peter called Clemens after receiving his reply, he explained to him that he was still concerned about the violations of ratio requirements in the covenants and wanted Clemens to send him data on the prices that IBS was charging customers for its finished goods. He also asked for (unaudited) quarterly financial statements on IBS.

Clemens seemed somewhat irritated by this request and reminded Peter that IBS had banked with FNBB for a long time and that Peter’s predecessor had never been so picky with IBS even when it experienced substantially lower profit margins in 2003 and 2004. Nevertheless, he sent Peter the information he requested. When Peter analyzed this information, he found that IBS was charging higher prices than many of its competitors, especially those outside Indiana. Moreover, its quick ratio, current ratio, and its inventory turnover ratio all exhibited greater variations from quarter to quarter than the industry averages for these ratios.  

IBS is a company that sells lumber products and a wide range of other building supplies in central and southern Indiana as well as in parts of Ohio and Missouri. The company’s seasonal working capital needs as well as small capital equipment purchases have been financed primarily by loans from FNBB. IBS caters to basically two kinds of customers: local customers in southern and central Indiana and those elsewhere. Demand from the Indiana customers is somewhat erratic, but because of their strong desire to purchase from local suppliers and IBS’s long-standing reputation, their demand is less sensitive to price increases than the demand of the other customers. In the past, whenever costs of raw materials have escalated, Clemens has personally visited many of his local customers and explained to them that he needed to increase his prices to keep pace with rising costs. These efforts have been successful in convincing the Indiana customers not to switch to other suppliers. Clemens has been far less successful in passing along such price increases to other customers. They usually seem to be able to locate alternative sources of supply when IBS increases its prices.

Notes: These figures are based on year-end figures taken from balance sheets and income statements of representative firms in the industry. These figures have been roughly constant for the past 5 years.  

Recently, David Klinghoffer, the chief financial officer (CFO) of IBS, has been urging Clemens to confine attention to IBS’s “loyal” Indiana customers, and thereby reduce the marketing costs involved in reaching out-of-state customers. In the past, Clemens was reluctant to embrace this strategy because of the erratic nature of demand from Indiana customers. When IBS was price competitive, it could always count on a predictable level of demand from its Ohio and Missouri customers. Increased competition and higher costs, however, seriously damaged IBS’s profit margins in 2003 and 2004 and persuaded Clemens to raise prices in 2005 to improve profitability. Klinghoffer, who had also been advocating higher prices, pointed out to Clemens with great delight that their strategy had been a smashing success and the firm had been more profitable in 2005 than it had ever been since 2000. Thus, both Klinghoffer and Clemens were dismayed by what they viewed as “senseless pestering” by Peter Willis.  

The matter has now come before Alex Brown. Peter has pointed out to Alex that FNBB has an “acceleration clause” in its loan contract that empowers it to force IBS to repay its entire loan to FNBB immediately because of the violations of covenants. Alex was hesitant to do that and decided to call Clemens. When Alex advised him of the seriousness of the situation and the possibility that the bank would insist on immediate repayment of the entire loan unless some corrective action was taken, Clemens said it was likely that IBS would need an additional 1-year loan of about $\$200,000$ (preferably at a $10\%$ interest rate) to cover the amount payable on a note that was due to another creditor in a few weeks. He also requested FNBB to advise him regarding specific steps that the bank wanted IBS to take.  

After hanging up the phone with Clemens, Alex asked Peter to bring him a detailed financial analysis of IBS, along with the specific reasons why Peter was so concerned. He also asked Peter to evaluate whether IBS’s request for additional credit should be approved and to recommend specific steps IBS should be asked to take if the existing loan is not accelerated and new credit is granted. Alex wants Peter to pay particular attention to the fact that the “bottom line” does seem to indicate that IBS has done well in 2005, which makes Peter’s worry somewhat anomalous.  

# Questions  

Imagine that you are Peter Willis. Prepare a comprehensive ratio analysis for IBS. Should the bank call back the entire loan now? Why or why not? Should FNBB be worried or is Peter just overreacting? Is it possible for IBS to generate enough cash by year-end 2006 to make full repayment to FNBB? How valid are comparisons of IBS’s financial ratios to the industry average?  

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. What are the different types of assets on a bank’s balance sheet?   
2. What is a “bank loan”? What are the different ways in which a bank can acquire loans?   
3. Discuss the similarities and differences between loans and securities.   
4. What are the major informational problems in loan contracts?   
5. What is the purpose of credit analysis? Compare and contrast capital budgeting within a nonfinancial firm with credit analysis within a bank.   
6. What are “the $5\mathrm{Cs}$ of credit”? What do we mean by a borrower’s “character” and why is it important?   
7. Can you explain intuitively why capital can resolve asset substitution moral hazard?   
8. Discuss intuitively how capital can help the bank to resolve “adverse selection” problems. It would be useful to start out by explaining first what we mean by “adverse selection,” and why it is a problem for the bank. Can you relate this role of capital in a bank loan contract to a venture capitalist’s insistence on a minimum equity capital input by an entrepreneur seeking venture capital?   
9. Please address the following questions: a. What is a reverse LBO? b. What are the main reasons why customers of banks become higher-quality credits after reverse LBOs? c. Why are we observing such a large increase in reverse LBOs now?  

10. What is the extent of secured lending among C&I loans? What are the two main types of collateral?  

11. What are the costs of collateral? Why is “outside” collateral so popular despite these costs?  

12. What is “underinvestment moral hazard”? Explain the intuition underlying the claim that collateral can attenuate this moral hazard. What are the implications of this for the design of bank loan covenants?  

13. What is a “contract receivable”? Why is it usually more risky than an “accounts receivable”?  

14. What are the main sources of credit information for banks in conducting credit analysis?  

15. What is the role of ratio analysis in credit assessment? What are its limitations?  

16. Overheard was the following conversation between two friends:  

Tom: I find it offensive that a bank would tell me what to do and what not to do when it makes me a loan. After all, I own the asset I’ll buy with the loan because I have an equity stake in it. The bank is only lending me the money.   
Jack: That’s nonsense, Tom! When you buy an asset with a bank loan, it’s the bank that owns the asset, and don’t you forget it. What do you think? Explain your answer.  

17. What are “affirmative covenants,” “restrictive clauses,” “negative covenants,” and “default provisions”? Discuss the role of each in the design of credit contracts.  

18. What are “expert systems” and what are banks attempting to achieve with them as part of credit analysis?  

19. Consider a firm that has a bank loan outstanding that requires the firm to repay $\$900$ one period hence. The firm has $\$300$ in retained earnings that can either be paid out as a dividend to the firm’s shareholders or invested in a project that will yield a single cash flow one period hence. The firm has a choice of investing in a safe project S, or a risky project R. The safe project will yield $\$1000$ for sure one period hence, whereas the risky project will yield $\$2000$ with probability 0.4 and nothing with probability 0.6. Assume that everybody is risk neutral and that the discount rate is zero. Which project has the higher total NPV for the firm? Which project will the firm choose, assuming that decisions are made to maximize shareholder wealth?  

20. You are a bank loan officer. ABC Corporation has requested a $\$2.1$ million loan. The corporation has $\$2$ million in retained earnings and an existing debt obligation that calls for a repayment of $\$4$ million one period hence. The firm has existing assets that will be worth $\$6$ million with probability 0.7 and nothing with probability 0.3 one period hence. These are the future values of the assets in place if the firm does not make any investment at present. The firm also has the choice of investing in one of two mutually exclusive projects (A or B). Project A will yield $\$4$ million with probability 0.7 and $\$2$ million with probability 0.3 one period hence. Its cash flows are uncorrelated with (and in addition to) those from the assets in place. Project B will yield $\$13$ million with probability 0.2 and nothing with probability 0.8. Its cash flows are also uncorrelated with those from the assets in place. Assume that everybody is risk neutral and that there is no discounting. Moreover, ABC’s existing debt has seniority over any new bank loan. Compute ABC’s project choice and your pricing of the bank loan in two cases: (i) ABC has $\$2$ million in retained earnings that will be kept within the firm for one period, (ii) ABC has already announced that the retained earnings will be paid out as dividends right now and hence unavailable to augment ABC’s cash flows one period hence. Assume that your bank’s cost of funds is zero and the bank is competitive (prices the loan to earn zero expected profit).  

21. Consider a firm that needs $\$350$ to invest in a project that will yield a single cash flow one period hence. The firm knows the probability distribution of this cash flow, but no one else does. As a banker you only know that the firm is either low risk (L) or high risk (H). If it is L, then it will yield $\$500$ with probability 0.8 and nothing with probability 0.2 one period hence. If it is $\mathrm{H}$ , it will yield $\$1500$ with probability 0.6 and nothing with probability 0.4 one period hence. The firm itself knows whether it is $\mathrm{~H~}$ or L. Assume that both the principal and interest repayments on any debt are tax deductible. The corporate tax rate applicable to this firm is 0.2. There is no equity capital on the firm’s books at present, but it would raise equity if needed. The firm is locked into being either $\mathrm{~L~}$ or $\mathrm{~H~}$ , but as a banker you cannot tell which type it is. Assume everybody is risk neutral and that the discount rate (and the bank’s cost of funds) is zero. Also, your bank is competitive (prices loans to earn zero expected profit). Construct a scheme consisting of two different loan contracts (one requiring the borrower to finance the project partly with equity capital and the other requiring no equity) such that the firm will truthfully reveal its private information by its choice of loan contract.  

22. Consider a firm that can invest $\$250$ right now, at $t=0$ , in a project that will yield a single cash flow one period hence, at $t=1$ . This $\$250$ investment will be raised by issuing unsecured debt at $t=0$ . The project will yield $\$500$ with probability 0.8 and nothing with probability 0.2 at $t=1$ . Immediately after the initial investment but before the end of the period (say at $t=1/2$ ), the firm can purchase another asset, call it A, for $\$250$ also. If purchased, A will yield a sure payoff of $\$300$ at $t=1$ . Those who lend the firm money at $t=0$ cannot observe at $t=1/2$ whether the firm had this investment opportunity. Everybody is risk neutral and the riskless rate is $12\%$ . If you are the banker the firm has approached for a $\$250$ loan at $t=0$ , compute the price of your loan in two cases: (i) the firm can finance the acquisition of asset A with unsecured debt or not at all, and (ii) the firm can finance the acquisition of asset A with debt secured by the asset in question. Assume that in case (i), your bank (the initial lender) will have the same seniority as the new (unsecured) creditors who supply funds to purchase A. Your bank is competitive in loan pricing.  

23. Given below is an excerpt from a conversation. Critique it.  

a. Butterworth: I’ll let that pass because I want to address your question, Mike. You know over $70\%$ of business loans are secured, and collateral has some really beneficial incentive effects from the bank’s standpoint. Moreover, it permits the bank to engage in creative loan-contract design that helps to resolve some thorny informational problems. It also leads to improved bank monitoring of borrowers, which is a key function associated with both secured and unsecured lending. To make a really long story short, I think that business lending is a key component of banks’ activities. If regulation discourages this, then I think we’ll have seriously weakened the financial intermediation process.   
b. Moderator: If the role of banks in business lending were to diminish, what sort of losses to society do you foresee, Beth?   
c. Butterworth: That’s my favorite topic, Mike, so we could be here all night if I get going. But just briefly, I think that in the process of originating these loans, designing loan contracts, structuring covenants, including the crafting of collateral requirements, monitoring, and the restructuring of loans for borrowers in financial distress, banks have developed considerable expertise. It would be a shame if the financial system evolved in such a way that these skills would need to be relearned by others.  

24. What is the “lending function” and how can it be decomposed? What is the usefulness of the decomposition?
