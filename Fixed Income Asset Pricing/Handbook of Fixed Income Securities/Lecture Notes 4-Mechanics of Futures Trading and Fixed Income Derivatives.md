# # Lecture Notes 4-Mechanics of Futures Trading and Fixed Income Derivatives

## 1. Introduction to Futures Trading and Fixed Income Derivatives

- Fixed income derivatives,  including futures and options,  are essential tools for hedging,  speculation,  and managing interest rate risk.
- This lecture focuses on the mechanics of futures trading,  the types of orders used,  the role of clearing corporations,  [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products#6.1.3 Margin requirements|margin requirements]],  and the structure of the over-the-counter (OTC) market for fixed income derivatives.
- We will also explore exchange-traded futures options,  including options on Treasury bond futures and Eurodollar futures,  and their applications in managing financial risks.

## 2. Mechanics of Futures Trading

### 2.1 Types of Orders in Futures Trading

- When a trader wants to buy or sell a futures contract,  they must specify the price and conditions under which the order is to be executed. These conditions are communicated to a futures broker.
- There are several types of orders,  each with unique characteristics,  advantages,  and risks:

#### 2.1.1 Market Orders
- A **market order** is executed at the best available price as soon as it reaches the trading pit.
  - *Advantages*: Immediate execution.
  - *Risks*: Adverse price movements may occur between the time the order is placed and executed.

#### 2.1.2 Limit Orders
- A **limit order** specifies a price limit for the transaction.
  - A **buy limit order** allows the purchase of a futures contract only at the designated price or lower.
  - A **sell limit order** allows the sale of a futures contract only at the designated price or higher.
  - *Advantages*: Provides price control.
  - *Risks*: The order may not be executed if the market does not reach the specified price.

#### 2.1.3 Stop Orders
- A **stop order** becomes a market order once the market reaches a designated price.
  - A **buy stop order** is triggered when the market rises to or above the designated price.
  - A **sell stop order** is triggered when the market falls to or below the designated price.
  - *Advantages*: Useful for preserving profits or minimizing losses.
  - *Risks*: Abrupt price changes may lead to premature execution,  and the execution price is uncertain.

#### 2.1.4 Stop-Limit Orders
- A **stop-limit order** is a hybrid of a stop order and a limit order.
  - Once the stop price is reached,  the order becomes a limit order rather than a market order.
  - *Advantages*: Limits the execution price after the stop is triggered.
  - *Risks*: The order may not be executed if the limit price is not reached.

#### 2.1.5 Market-if-Touched Orders
- A **market-if-touched order** becomes a market order if a designated price is reached.
  - A **buy market-if-touched order** is triggered when the market falls to a given price.
  - A **sell market-if-touched order** is triggered when the market rises to a given price.
  - *Purpose*: Designed to enter a position at an acceptable price.

#### 2.1.6 Other Specialized Orders
- **Opening Orders**: Executed only during the opening range of the trading day.
- **Closing Orders**: Executed only during the closing range of the trading day.
- **Discretionary Orders**: Gives the broker discretion to achieve a better price within a specified range.
- **Not Held Orders**: Grants the broker full discretion over whether to fill the order.
- **Fill-or-Kill Orders**: Must be executed immediately or canceled.
- **One-Cancels-Other Orders**: A pair of orders where the execution of one cancels the other.

### 2.2 Taking and Liquidating a Position

- A trader can take a position in the futures market by:
  - **Buying a futures contract**: This creates a **long position**.
  - **Selling a futures contract**: This creates a **short position**.
- Positions can be liquidated in two ways:
  1. **Offsetting the position**: Taking an opposite position in the same contract (e.g.,  selling a long position or buying a short position).
  1. **Waiting until the delivery date**: Accepting or delivering the underlying instrument at the agreed-upon price.

- For contracts that do not involve physical delivery (e.g.,  Eurodollar futures),  settlement is in cash at the settlement price on the delivery date.

### 2.3 The Role of the Clearing Corporation

- The clearing corporation acts as an intermediary between buyers and sellers in the futures market.
  - It becomes the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer.
  - This eliminates counterparty risk and allows traders to liquidate positions without involving the original counterparty.
- However,  traders remain exposed to the risk of default by their futures broker. It is crucial to ensure that the broker has adequate capital to mitigate this risk.

### 2.4 Margin Requirements

- **Initial Margin**: A minimum deposit required to open a position,  specified by the exchange.
  - This serves as a good faith deposit and can be in the form of Treasury bills.
- **Maintenance Margin**: The minimum equity level required to maintain a position.
  - If the equity falls below this level due to adverse price movements,  additional margin (variation margin) must be deposited.
- **Variation Margin**: The amount required to restore equity to the initial margin level.
  - Must be deposited in cash.
- [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products#6.1.3 Margin requirements|margin requirements]] vary based on:
  - The type of position (e.g.,  outright long/short vs. spread).
  - The purpose of the trade (e.g.,  speculative vs. hedging).
  - The perceived risk of the contract.

## 3. Exchange-Traded Futures Options

### 3.1 Overview of Futures Options

- Futures options are similar to traditional options but differ in that the underlying instrument is a futures contract rather than a spot security.
- Types of futures options:
  - **Call Options**: Grant the right to buy the underlying futures contract at a specific price.
  - **Put Options**: Grant the right to sell the underlying futures contract at a specific price.
- When exercised:
  - A call option results in a long futures position for the buyer and a short futures position for the seller.
  - A put option results in a short futures position for the buyer and a long futures position for the seller.
- The resulting futures positions are subject to daily marking to market.

### 3.2 Options on Treasury Bond Futures

- Options on Treasury bond futures are based on the price of a fictitious 20-year,  6% Treasury bond.
- The nominal size of the contract is $100,  000.
- Premiums are quoted in points and 64ths of a point.
  - Example: A premium of 1-10 implies a price of $1.15625% of face value,    or $1,  156.25.
- Flexible Treasury futures options allow customization of strike prices,  expiration dates,  and exercise types (American or European).

### 3.3 Options on Eurodollar Futures

- These options are based on the quoted Eurodollar futures price (100 minus the annualized yield).
- Contract size: $1 million.
- Premiums are quoted in basis points.
  - Example: A premium of 20 (0.20) implies a price of $500.
- Applications:
  - **Hedging floating-rate liabilities**: Institutions can buy puts to cap interest rate expenses.
  - **Hedging floating-rate assets**: Investors can buy calls to offset lower interest income when rates fall.

## 4. OTC Fixed Income Derivatives

### 4.1 Structure of the OTC Market

- The OTC market lacks a central marketplace; transactions occur directly between buyers and sellers.
- Market participants include:
  - **Market-Makers**: Large investment and commercial banks that provide liquidity.
  - **Brokers**: Facilitate transactions by connecting buyers and sellers.
- Key differences from exchange-traded markets:
  - No clearinghouse,  so counterparty credit risk is significant.
  - Greater flexibility in contract terms,  sizes,  and expiration dates.

### 4.2 Advantages and Disadvantages of OTC Markets

- **Advantages**:
  - Customization of contracts to meet specific needs.
  - Ability to trade a wide range of instruments,  including options on LIBOR,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 â€“ Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  and mortgage securities.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Lack of transparency and price visibility.
  - Counterparty credit risk.

## 5. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Futures trading involves various types of orders,  each with unique risks and benefits.
- The clearing corporation plays a critical role in mitigating counterparty risk in exchange-traded markets.
- [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products#6.1.3 Margin requirements|margin requirements]] ensure that traders maintain sufficient equity to cover potential losses.
- Futures options provide flexibility for hedging and speculation,  with applications in managing interest rate risk.
- The OTC market offers customization but comes with significant counterparty risk and reduced transparency.

By understanding these mechanics and instruments,  traders and institutions can effectively manage risk and optimize their financial strategies.

# Lecture Notes: OTC Derivatives,  Caps,  Floors,  and Futures Pricing

## 1. Introduction to OTC Derivatives and Interest Rate Risk Management

- Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are financial instruments traded directly between two parties,  without the involvement of an exchange.
- These instruments,  including [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs),  caps,  and floors,  are widely used for managing interest rate risk.
- Unlike exchange-traded derivatives,  OTC derivatives are customizable but come with counterparty risk and liquidity constraints.
- This lecture will cover:
  - The mechanics and applications of caps and floors on LIBOR.
  - The structure and pricing of [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs).
  - The pricing of futures contracts and their portfolio applications.

## 2. Mechanics of OTC Derivatives

### 2.1 Counterparty Risk in OTC Markets

- Counterparty risk is a significant concern in OTC markets,  as there is no central clearinghouse to guarantee transactions.
- Institutions mitigate counterparty risk in several ways:
  - **Creditworthiness Requirements**: Some institutions only transact with major entities that have sound credit ratings.
  - **Collateral Posting**: Counterparties may be required to post collateral immediately after the transaction,  similar to initial margin in futures markets.
  - **Variation Margin**: Institutions reserve the right to call for additional collateral if the market moves against the counterparty.
- While these measures do not eliminate counterparty risk entirely,  they are sufficient for a large number of institutions to participate in the OTC market.

### 2.2 Liquidity Constraints in OTC Markets

- Liquidity in OTC markets can be constrained due to the non-assignable nature of most transactions.
  - For example,  an option seller cannot transfer the contingent liability to a third party without the buyer's permission.
  - To offset a short option position,  the seller may need to buy a similar option from a third party,  which introduces risks if the offsetting option is not identical or if the counterparty's credit is questionable.
- Non-standardization of contracts contributes to these liquidity issues but also provides flexibility in structuring agreements.

## 3. Caps and Floors on LIBOR

### 3.1 Overview of Caps and Floors

- Caps and floors are OTC options designed to manage interest rate risk on the short end of the yield curve.
  - A **cap** on [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is essentially a series of put options on LIBOR-based debt.
  - A **floor** on [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is essentially a series of call options on LIBOR-based debt.
- The buyer of a cap or floor pays an upfront premium and holds most of the rights in the contract,  while the seller receives the premium and is obligated to perform under the contract terms.

### 3.2 Mechanics of Caps

- A cap consists of multiple reset dates,  typically aligned with the interest accrual periods of the underlying LIBOR-based debt.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Example**: A five-year,  $100 million cap on three-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] struck at 2%.
>   - The contract specifies 20 reset dates (one every three months).
>   - On each reset date,  the three-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate is compared to the 2% strike rate:
> 	- If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] â‰¤ 2%,  no payment is made.
> 	- If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] > 2%,  the cap seller pays the buyer the monetary value of the excess LIBOR.
>
> - **Payoff Calculation**:
>   - For a 90-day interest accrual period,  the value of each basis point is:
> $$0.0001 \times 100,   000,   000 \times \frac{90}{360} = 2,   500 \,    \text{USD}$$
>   - If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 2.50%,  the payoff is:
> $$\text{Payoff} = (2.50\% - 2.00\%) \times 100 \,    \text{basis points} \times 2,   500 = 125,   000 \,    \text{USD}$$
>   - If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 4.00%,  the payoff is:
> $$\text{Payoff} = (4.00\% - 2.00\%) \times 100 \,    \text{basis points} \times 2,   500 = 500,   000 \,    \text{USD}$$
>
> - Payments are typically made at the end of the interest accrual period.
>

### 3.3 Mechanics of Floors

- Floors operate similarly to caps but provide protection against falling interest rates.

> [!NOTE]
> - **Example**: A $25 million,  seven-year floor on six-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] struck at 3%.
>   - The contract specifies 14 reset dates (one every six months).
>   - On each reset date,  the six-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate is compared to the 3% strike rate:
> 	- If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] â‰¥ 3%,  no payment is made.
> 	- If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] < 3%,  the floor seller pays the buyer the monetary value of the shortfall.
>
> - **Payoff Calculation**:
>   - For a 180-day interest accrual period,  the value of each basis point is:
> $$0.0001 \times 25,   000,   000 \times \frac{180}{360} = 1,   250 \,    \text{USD}$$
>   - If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 2.50%,  the payoff is:
> $$\text{Payoff} = (3.00\% - 2.50\%) \times 100 \,    \text{basis points} \times 1,   250 = 62,   500 \,    \text{USD}$$
>

### 3.4 Market Participants

- **Market-Makers**: Large investment and commercial banks dominate the cap and floor market,  providing liquidity and pricing.
- **End-Users**:
  - Buyers of caps: Institutions exposed to rising short-term rates (e.g.,  banks funding short and lending long).
  - Buyers of floors: Institutions exposed to falling rates (e.g.,  borrowers with floating-rate debt that has a built-in floor).
- **Sellers**:
  - Some sell caps or floors outright for premium income.
  - Others use caps and floors to hedge or smooth cash flows on other fixed-income instruments.

## 4. [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs)

### 4.1 Overview of FRAs

- FRAs are OTC derivatives that function as forward-starting loans without the exchange of principal.
- The cash exchanged at settlement depends only on the difference between the agreed-upon [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] rate and the reference rate (e.g.,  LIBOR).

### 4.2 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] Market Structure

- The [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] market is highly liquid for threeand six-month LIBOR,  with contracts available for settlement starting one month forward and extending up to six months forward.
- Contracts are denoted by the start and end of the interest period they cover (e.g.,  a 1Ã—4 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] covers the period from one month to four months forward).

### 4.3 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] Settlement

- No money changes hands until the settlement date.
- On the settlement date,  the cash flow is calculated as the present value of the interest differential:
 $\text{Cash Flow} = \text{Notional Amount} \times \frac{\text{(Reference Rate - [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] Rate)} \times \text{Days}}{360} \times \frac{1}{(1 + \text{Reference Rate} \times \frac{\text{Days}}{360})}$$

### 4.4 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] vs. Futures

- Unlike futures,  FRAs are not marked to market daily,  and the profit/loss is a convex function of the underlying rate due to present valuing.
- Buyers of FRAs benefit from rising rates,  while sellers benefit from falling rates.

## 5. Pricing Futures Contracts

### 5.1 Arbitrage and the Law of One Price

- Futures prices are determined by arbitrage,  ensuring that no risk-free profit opportunities exist.
- The law of one price states that identical cash flows must have the same price,  regardless of how they are created.

### 5.2 Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

> [!NOTE]
> - **Example**: A 20-year,  $100 par value bond with a 12% coupon is selling at par. The three-month interest rate is 8% per year.
>   - If the futures price is 107:
> 	- Sell the futures contract at 107.
> 	- Borrow $100 for three months at 8%.
> 	- Buy the bond for $100.
> 	- At settlement,  deliver the bond and repay the loan:
> 	  - Receive $107 from the futures contract.
> 	  - Pay $102 (loan principal + interest).
> 	  - Profit = $107 - $102 = $5.

- Arbitrage forces the futures price to converge to its fair value.

### 5.3 Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If the futures price is 92:
>   - Buy the futures contract at 92.
>   - Short the bond for $100.
>   - Invest $100 for three months at 8%.
>   - At settlement,  buy the bond to cover the short position:
> 	- Pay $95 (bond price + accrued interest).
> 	- Receive $102 (investment principal + interest).
> 	- Profit = $102 - $95 = $7.
>

- Again,  arbitrage eliminates the profit opportunity.

### 5.4 Equilibrium Futures Price

- The equilibrium futures price eliminates arbitrage opportunities:
 $\text{Futures Price} = \text{Spot Price} \times (1 + \text{Risk-Free Rate} \times \text{Time to Maturity})$$

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

- OTC derivatives like caps,  floors,  and FRAs provide flexibility in managing interest rate risk but come with counterparty risk and liquidity constraints.
- Caps and floors are essential tools for institutions exposed to interest rate volatility.
- FRAs are forward-starting loans that allow participants to hedge or speculate on future interest rates.
- Futures prices are determined by arbitrage,  ensuring that they reflect fair value based on the law of one price.

By understanding these instruments and their pricing mechanisms,  market participants can effectively manage risk and exploit arbitrage opportunities.

# Lecture Notes: Controlling Interest-Rate Risk with Futures and Options

## 1. Introduction to Interest-Rate Risk Management

- Interest-rate risk is a critical concern for portfolio managers,  as changes in interest rates can significantly impact the value of fixed-income securities.
- Derivative instruments,  such as futures and options,  provide powerful tools for managing this risk.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The theoretical pricing of futures contracts.
  - The concept of carry and its role in futures pricing.
  - Applications of futures contracts in portfolio management,  including duration control,  hedging,  [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]],  and portable alpha strategies.

## 2. Theoretical Futures Pricing and the Concept of Carry

### 2.1 Deriving the Theoretical Futures Price
- The theoretical futures price is derived using arbitrage arguments,  assuming no transaction costs and no interim cash flows.
- Key variables:
	  - $P$: Cash market price of the bond.
	  - $c$: Current yield,  calculated as the coupon rate divided by the cash market price.
	  - $r$: Financing rate (borrowing/lending rate).
	  - $t$: Time to the futures delivery date (in years).
	  - $F$: Futures price.

#### 2.1.1 Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

- **Steps**:
  1. Sell the futures contract at $F$.
  1. Purchase the bond for $P$.
  1. Borrow $P$ at the financing rate $r$ until the settlement date.

- **Outcome at Settlement**:
  - **Proceeds**:
	- From the futures contract: $F$.
	- Accrued interest on the bond: $ctP$.
	- Total proceeds: $$F + ctP$$
  - **Outlay**:
	- Repayment of the loan principal: $P$.
	- Interest on the loan: $rtP$.
	- Total outlay: $P + rtP$.
- **Profit**:
 $$\text{Profit} = F + ctP - (P + rtP)$$

- **Equilibrium Condition**:
  - To eliminate arbitrage opportunities,  profit must equal zero:
   $$0 = F + ctP - (P + rtP)$$
  - Solving for $F$:
   $$F = P + Pt(r - c) = P[1 + t(r - c)]$$

#### 2.1.2 Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

- **Steps**:
  1. Buy the futures contract at $F$.
  1. Sell (short) the bond for $P$.
  1. Invest $P$ at the financing rate $r$ until the settlement date.

- **Outcome at Settlement**:
  - **Proceeds**:
	- From the loan principal: $P$.
	- Interest earned: $rtP$.
	- Total proceeds: $P + rtP$.
  - **Outlay**:
	- From the futures contract: $F$.
	- Accrued interest on the bond: $ctP$.
	- Total outlay: $F + ctP$.
- **Profit**:
 $$\text{Profit} = P + rtP - (F + ctP)$$

- **Equilibrium Condition**:
  - To eliminate arbitrage opportunities,  profit must equal zero:
   $$0 = P + rtP - (F + ctP)$$
  - Solving for $F$ yields the same equation:
   $$F = P[1 + t(r - c)]$$

> [!NOTE]
> ### 2.2 Example: Calculating the Theoretical Futures Price
>
> - **Given**:
>   - $r = 0.08$ (financing rate).
>   - $c = 0.12$ (current yield).
>   - $P = 100$ (cash market price).
>   - $t = 0.25$ (time to delivery in years).
> - **Calculation**:
> $F = P[1 + t(r - c)]$
> $F = 100[1 + 0.25(0.08 - 0.12)]$
> $F = 100[1 - 0.01]$
> $F = 99$

- **Interpretation**:
  - The theoretical futures price is $99$,  which is at a discount to the cash market price due to negative carry ($r < c$).

### 2.3 The Concept of Carry

- **Definition**:
  - Carry is the net financing cost,  calculated as the difference between the financing rate ($r$) and the current yield ($c$).
  - $\text{Carry} = r - c$
- **Implications**:
  - **Positive Carry ($c > r$)**:
	- The futures price will sell at a discount to the cash price ($F < P$).
  - **Negative Carry ($c < r$)**:
	- The futures price will sell at a premium to the cash price ($F > P$).
  - **Zero Carry ($c = r$)**:
	- The futures price will equal the cash price ($F = P$).
- **Real-World Factors**:
  - The shape of the yield curve influences carry:
	- **Upward-Sloping Yield Curve**: Short-term financing rates are lower than current yields,  resulting in positive carry.
	- **Inverted Yield Curve**: Short-term financing rates are higher than current yields,  resulting in negative carry.

## 3. Applications of Futures in Portfolio Management

### 3.1 Interest-Rate Risk Control

- **Objective**:
  - Adjust the portfolio's duration to manage exposure to interest rate changes.
  - Increase duration if rates are expected to fall; decrease duration if rates are expected to rise.
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Buying Futures**: Increases portfolio duration,  as futures prices rise when rates fall.
  - **Selling Futures**: Decreases portfolio duration,  as futures prices fall when rates rise.
- **Advantages**:
  - Futures provide a quick and cost-effective way to adjust duration compared to cash market instruments.

### 3.2 Hedging

- **Definition**:
  - Hedging involves taking a futures position to offset potential losses in the cash market.
- **Types of Hedges**:
  - **Short Hedge**:
	- Protects against a decline in the cash price of a fixed-income security.
	- Example: A pension fund manager sells futures to lock in a selling price for bonds that must be liquidated in the future.
  - **Long Hedge**:
	- Protects against an increase in the cash price of a fixed-income security.
	- Example: A manager buys futures to lock in a purchase price for bonds expected to be bought in the future.
- **Basis Risk**:
  - The difference between the cash price and the futures price is called the basis.
  - Basis risk arises when the cash and futures prices do not move perfectly together.
- **Cross-Hedging**:
  - Occurs when the bond to be hedged is not identical to the bond underlying the futures contract.
  - Cross-hedging introduces additional basis risk.

### 3.3 [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]

- **Objective**:
  - Adjust the composition of a portfolio between asset classes (e.g.,  stocks and bonds).
- **Mechanism**:
  - Use interest-rate futures and stock index futures to efficiently shift allocations without transacting in the cash market.

### 3.4 Creating Synthetic Securities for Yield Enhancement

- **Concept**:
  - Combine futures contracts with cash market instruments to create synthetic securities.
- **Example**:
  - An investor holding a 20-year Treasury bond sells Treasury futures for delivery in three months.
  - The combined position is equivalent to a three-month riskless security (e.g.,  a Treasury bill).
  - If the synthetic security's yield exceeds the yield on a cash market Treasury bill,  the investor can enhance portfolio returns.

### 3.5 Portable Alpha Strategies

- **Definition**:
  - Portable alpha strategies separate market returns (beta) from returns generated by selection skill (alpha).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use derivatives (e.g.,  futures and swaps) to maintain market exposure while pursuing alpha-generating strategies.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexibility to add returns without increasing risk.
  - Applicable across asset classes,  including equities and fixed income.

## 4. Key Takeaways

- The theoretical futures price is determined by the net financing cost (carry),  which reflects the relationship between the financing rate and the current yield.
- Futures contracts are versatile tools for managing interest-rate risk,  enabling portfolio managers to adjust duration,  hedge positions,  and alter [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]s efficiently.
- Synthetic securities and portable alpha strategies demonstrate the innovative applications of futures in enhancing portfolio returns and achieving investment objectives.
- Basis risk and cross-hedging are important considerations when using futures for hedging purposes,  as they can impact the effectiveness of the hedge.

By mastering these concepts and strategies,  portfolio managers can effectively navigate interest-rate risk and optimize portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Controlling Interest-Rate Risk with Futures and Hedging Strategies

## 1. Introduction to Interest-Rate Risk Management with Futures

- Interest-rate risk is a critical concern for portfolio managers,  as changes in interest rates can significantly impact the value of fixed-income securities.
- Futures contracts on interest-rate instruments provide a cost-effective and flexible way to manage this risk.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The advantages of using interest-rate futures over cash-market instruments.
  - The principles of controlling interest-rate risk using futures.
  - The mechanics of determining the number of futures contracts required to achieve a target dollar duration.
  - Hedging strategies using interest-rate futures,  including short and long hedges.

## 2. Advantages of Using Interest-Rate Futures

### 2.1 Lower Transaction Costs
- Trading futures contracts incurs significantly lower transaction costs compared to trading long-term Treasury securities in the cash market.
- This cost efficiency makes futures an attractive tool for frequent adjustments to portfolio duration or hedging strategies.

### 2.2 Lower Margin Requirements
- Futures contracts require only an initial margin deposit,  which is a fraction of the contract's notional value.
- This allows portfolio managers to achieve greater leverage compared to directly trading Treasury securities.

### 2.3 Ease of Short Selling
- Selling short in the futures market is more straightforward than in the cash market for Treasury securities.
- Futures contracts eliminate the need to borrow securities,  making short positions more accessible and cost-effective.

### 2.4 Extending Portfolio Duration
- Futures can be used to construct portfolios with longer durations than those available in the cash market.
  - *Example*: A pension fund manager may need a portfolio duration of 15 to meet specific investment objectives. If bonds with such a long duration are unavailable,  the manager can buy interest-rate futures to increase the portfolio's duration to the target level.

## 3. General Principles of Interest-Rate Risk Control

### 3.1 Combining Dollar Exposures
- The key principle in controlling interest-rate risk with futures is to combine the dollar exposure of the current portfolio with the dollar exposure of a futures position to achieve the target dollar exposure.
- The total dollar exposure is given by:
 $\text{Portfolio's Dollar Duration} = \text{Current Dollar Duration} + \text{Dollar Duration of Futures Position}$$

### 3.2 Measures of Interest-Rate Sensitivity
- Two commonly used measures for approximating the sensitivity of a bond or portfolio to changes in interest rates are:
  - **Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)**: The dollar price change resulting from a 1 basis point change in yield.
  - **Duration**: The approximate percentage price change for a 100 basis point change in rates.
	- *Effective Duration*: Used for bonds with embedded options,  as it accounts for changes in cash flows due to interest rate movements.
	- *Effective Dollar Duration*: The dollar price change for a given change in interest rates,  calculated using the portfolio's valuation model.

### 3.3 Importance of a Valuation Model
- A reliable valuation model is essential for:
  - Estimating the new values of bonds in the portfolio when interest rates change.
  - Valuing the derivative contracts used to control interest-rate exposure.

## 4. Determining the Target Dollar Duration

### 4.1 Calculating Target Dollar Duration
- The target dollar duration for a portfolio is determined based on the desired sensitivity to interest rate changes.
- For a 50 basis point change in interest rates,  the target dollar duration is calculated as:
 $\text{Target Dollar Duration} = \frac{\text{Target Duration} \times \text{Portfolio Value}}{200}$$
- *Example*: A manager of a $500 million portfolio seeks a target duration of 6.
  - $$\text{Target Dollar Duration} = \frac{6 \times 500,   000,   000}{200} = 15,   000,   000$$

### 4.2 Comparing Target and Current Dollar Duration
- The current dollar duration is calculated similarly:
 $\text{Current Dollar Duration} = \frac{\text{Current Duration} \times \text{Portfolio Value}}{200}$$
- *Example*: If the current duration is 4 for the $500 million portfolio:
  - $$\text{Current Dollar Duration} = \frac{4 \times 500,   000,   000}{200} = 10,   000,   000$$

### 4.3 Adjusting Dollar Duration with Futures
- The difference between the target and current dollar durations determines the dollar exposure required from the futures position:
 $\text{Dollar Exposure from Futures} = \text{Target Dollar Duration} - \text{Current Dollar Duration}$$
- If the difference is positive,  futures contracts must be purchased to increase dollar exposure. If negative,  futures contracts must be sold to decrease dollar exposure.

## 5. Determining the Number of Futures Contracts

### 5.1 Dollar Duration of a Futures Contract
- The dollar duration of a futures contract is the sensitivity of its value to changes in interest rates.
- It is calculated as:
 $\text{Dollar Duration of Futures Contract} = \text{Dollar Duration of CTD Issue} \times \text{Conversion Factor for CTD Issue}$$
  - **CTD Issue**: The cheapest-to-deliver bond for the futures contract.
  - **Conversion Factor**: Adjusts for differences in coupon rates and maturities among deliverable bonds.

### 5.2 Calculating the Number of Futures Contracts
- The number of futures contracts required to achieve the target dollar duration is given by:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{\text{Target Dollar Duration} - \text{Current Dollar Duration}}{\text{Dollar Duration per Futures Contract}}$$
- A positive result indicates that futures contracts must be purchased,  while a negative result indicates that futures contracts must be sold.

### 5.3 Example: Determining the Number of Contracts
- *Given*:
  - Target Dollar Duration = $15,   000,   000$
  - Current Dollar Duration = $10,   000,   000$
  - Dollar Duration per Futures Contract = $2,   100$
- *Calculation*:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{15,  000,  000 - 10,  000,  000}{2,  100} = 2,  381$$
- The manager must purchase 2,  381 futures contracts to achieve the target dollar duration.

## 6. Hedging with Interest-Rate Futures

### 6.1 Short Hedge
- A short hedge is used to protect against a decline in the cash price of a bond.
- Futures contracts are sold to lock in a selling price.
- *Example*: A pension fund manager expects to liquidate bonds in 40 days to make a $5 million payment. Selling futures contracts protects against rising interest rates,  which would lower bond prices.

### 6.2 Long Hedge
- A long hedge is used to protect against an increase in the cash price of a bond.
- Futures contracts are purchased to lock in a buying price.
- *Example*: A manager expects substantial cash contributions and anticipates falling interest rates. Buying futures contracts protects against rising bond prices.

### 6.3 Cross-Hedging
- Cross-hedging occurs when the bond or portfolio to be hedged is not identical to the bond underlying the futures contract.
- This introduces basis risk,  as the cash and futures prices may not move perfectly together.

## 7. Monitoring and Evaluating the Hedge

### 7.1 Steps in the Hedging Process
1. **Determine the Appropriate Hedging Instrument**:
   - Choose a futures contract with a high correlation to the interest rate risk being hedged.
   - Consider liquidity and delivery month.
1. **Determine the Target for the Hedge**:
   - Establish the target rate or price to be locked in by the hedge.
1. **Determine the Position to Be Taken**:
   - Calculate the number of futures contracts required to achieve the target dollar duration.
1. **Monitor and Evaluate the Hedge**:
   - Adjust the futures position as needed to maintain the target dollar duration over time.

### 7.2 Risk and Expected Return in a Hedge
- The effectiveness of a hedge depends on the correlation between cash and futures prices.
- The manager's objective is to "lock in" a rate or price,  but the actual outcome may vary due to basis risk and delivery options.

## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Interest-rate futures provide a cost-effective and flexible tool for managing interest-rate risk.
- The key to controlling interest-rate risk is to align the portfolio's dollar duration with the target dollar duration using futures contracts.
- The number of futures contracts required is determined by the difference between the target and current dollar durations,  divided by the dollar duration per futures contract.
- Hedging strategies,  including short and long hedges,  allow managers to protect against adverse interest rate movements.
- Monitoring and adjusting the hedge over time ensures that the portfolio remains aligned with its investment objectives.

By mastering these principles and techniques,  portfolio managers can effectively manage interest-rate risk and optimize portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Hedging with Treasury Bond Futures and Basis Risk

## 1. Introduction to Hedging with Treasury Bond Futures

- Treasury bond futures are widely used by portfolio managers to hedge interest rate risk and lock in effective sale or purchase prices for fixed-income securities.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The mechanics of hedging with Treasury bond futures.
  - The calculation of effective sale prices.
  - The role of basis risk in hedging.
  - The determination of the number of futures contracts required for a hedge.
  - A detailed example of cross-hedging a non-deliverable bond using Treasury bond futures.

## 2. Mechanics of Hedging with Treasury Bond Futures

### 2.1 Effective Sale Price of Treasury Bonds

- The effective sale price of a Treasury bond is determined by combining the actual sale price of the bond with the gain or loss on the futures position.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = \text{Actual Sale Price of Treasury Bond} + \text{Gain or Loss on Futures Position}$$

- **Example**:
  - Actual sale price of Treasury bond: \$140,  000,  000.
  - Gain on futures position: \$4,  979,  000.
  - Effective sale price:
	$$\text{Effective Sale Price} = 140,   000,   000 + 4,   979,   000 = 144,   979,   000$$

- The effective sale price reflects the target price dictated by the futures rate when the hedge is set.

### 2.2 Convergence at Delivery Date

- If a hedge is held until the delivery date of the futures contract,  the spot price of the bond and the futures price converge.
- This ensures that the effective sale price is locked in at the futures rate set when the hedge was established.

### 2.3 Short-Term Hedges

- For hedges lifted prior to the delivery date,  the effective rate or price is more likely to approximate the current spot rate rather than the futures rate.
- The shorter the hedge duration,  the less likely convergence will occur,  and the effective rate will reflect the one-day forward rate,  which is nearly equal to the spot rate.

## 3. Basis and Basis Risk in Hedging

### 3.1 Definition of Basis

- The **basis** is the difference between the spot price of a security and its futures price.
- **Price Basis**:
 $\text{Price Basis} = \text{Spot Price} - \text{Futures Delivery Price}$$
- **Rate Basis**:
 $\text{Rate Basis} = \text{Spot Rate} - \text{Futures Rate}$$

### 3.2 Target Basis and Basis Risk

- The **target basis** is the expected basis on the day the hedge is lifted.
- **Hedge to Delivery Date**:
  - The target basis is zero due to convergence.
  - The target rate equals the futures rate.
- **Hedge Lifted Before Delivery**:
  - The target basis is the current basis,  which introduces uncertainty.
  - The target rate equals the futures rate plus the target rate basis.
- **Basis Risk**:
  - Basis risk refers to the uncertainty surrounding the target basis on the day the hedge is lifted.
  - It arises from unpredictable changes in the relationship between cash and futures prices.

## 4. Determining the Number of Futures Contracts

### 4.1 Hedge Ratio

- The hedge ratio determines the number of futures contracts required to offset the risk of the position being hedged.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{\text{Current Dollar Duration Without Futures}}{\text{Dollar Duration per Futures Contract}}$$

### 4.2 Cross-Hedging

- Cross-hedging occurs when the security to be hedged is not deliverable on the futures contract used in the hedge.
- The number of futures contracts for a cross-hedge is determined by the relative dollar durations of the bond to be hedged and the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) issue.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{\text{Current Dollar Duration Without Futures}}{\text{Dollar Duration of CTD Issue}} \times \text{Conversion Factor for CTD Issue}$$

## 5. Example: Cross-Hedging a Non-Deliverable Bond

### 5.1 Problem Setup

- **Bond to be Hedged**:
  - \$10 million par value of a 6.25% FNMA bond maturing on 5/15/2029.
  - Current price: 88.39.
  - Current yield: 7.20%.
- **Futures Contract**:
  - September 1999 Treasury bond futures.
  - Futures price: 113.
  - CTD issue: 11.25% Treasury bond maturing on 2/15/2015.
  - CTD price: 146.19.
  - CTD yield: 6.50%.
  - Conversion factor for CTD issue: 1.283.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Yield spread between FNMA bond and CTD issue remains constant at 70 basis points.
  - Anticipated sale date: Last business day of September 1999.

### 5.2 Target Levels

- **Target Yield for CTD Issue**:
  - Futures price Ã— Conversion factor = Target price for CTD issue.
  - $$\text{Target Price for CTD Issue} = 113 \times 1.283 = 144.979$$
  - Yield corresponding to target price: 6.56%.
- **Target Yield for FNMA Bond**:
  - $$\text{Target Yield for FNMA Bond} = 6.56\% + 0.70\% = 7.26\%$$
  - Price corresponding to target yield: 87.76.

### 5.3 Dollar Durations

- **Dollar Duration of FNMA Bond**:
  - Dollar duration per \$100 par value: \$5.453.
  - Total dollar duration:
	$$\text{Dollar Duration of FNMA Bond} = \frac{\$10,   000,   000}{100} \times 5.453 = 545,   300$$

- **Dollar Duration of CTD Issue**:
  - Dollar duration per \$100 par value: \$6.255.
  - Dollar duration per futures contract:
	$$\text{Dollar Duration per Futures Contract} = \frac{\$100,   000}{100} \times 6.255 = 6,   255$$

### 5.4 Number of Futures Contracts

- **Formula**:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{\text{Dollar Duration of FNMA Bond}}{\text{Dollar Duration of CTD Issue}} \times \text{Conversion Factor for CTD Issue}$$

- **Calculation**:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{545,  300}{6,  255} \times 1.283 = 112$$

- **Result**:
  - To hedge the FNMA bond position,  112 Treasury bond futures contracts must be shorted.

### 5.5 Scenario Analysis

- Exhibit 63-2 provides a scenario analysis of the hedge outcome based on different sale prices for the FNMA bond at the delivery date of the futures contract.

#### Key Observations
1. The effective sale price for the FNMA bond remains close to the target price of \$8,  776,  000 across various scenarios.
1. Gains or losses on the futures position offset changes in the actual sale price of the FNMA bond,  stabilizing the effective sale price.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Treasury bond futures are effective tools for hedging interest rate risk and locking in target sale or purchase prices.
- The effective sale price of a bond is determined by combining the actual sale price with the gain or loss on the futures position.
- Basis risk arises from uncertainty about the target basis on the day the hedge is lifted and is a key consideration in hedging strategies.
- The number of futures contracts required for a hedge depends on the relative dollar durations of the bond to be hedged and the CTD issue.
- Cross-hedging introduces additional complexity but can be effectively managed by carefully calculating the hedge ratio and monitoring basis risk.

By understanding these principles and applying them rigorously,  portfolio managers can effectively manage interest rate risk and achieve their investment objectives.

# Lecture Notes: Hedging with Futures and Options in Fixed Income Markets

## 1. Introduction to Hedging with Futures and Options

- Hedging is a critical risk management strategy in fixed income markets,  allowing portfolio managers to mitigate the impact of adverse interest rate movements on bond portfolios.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - Hedging with Treasury bond futures,  including the mechanics,  basis risk,  and the calculation of effective sale prices.
  - Advanced refinements in hedging strategies,  such as adjusting for changing yield spreads and incorporating yield beta.
  - Hedging with options,  including protective put-buying,  covered call-writing,  and collar strategies.
  - A detailed comparison of futures and options hedging strategies,  including their respective advantages and limitations.

## 2. Hedging with Treasury Bond Futures

### 2.1 Mechanics of Hedging with Futures

#### 2.1.1 Effective Sale Price
- The **effective sale price** of a bond is determined by combining the actual sale price with the gain or loss on the futures position.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = \text{Actual Sale Price of Bond} + \text{Gain or Loss on Futures Position}$$
- Example:
  - Actual sale price of FNMA bond: \$8,  000,  000.
  - Gain on futures position: \$800,  150.
  - Effective sale price:
	$$\text{Effective Sale Price} = 8,   000,   000 + 800,   150 = 8,   800,   150$$

#### 2.1.2 Convergence at Delivery Date
- By the delivery date of the futures contract,  the futures price converges with the price of the cheapest-to-deliver (CTD) issue divided by its conversion factor.
- This ensures that the effective sale price is locked in at the futures rate set at the inception of the hedge.

#### 2.1.3 Value of Futures Position
- The value of the futures position is calculated as:
 $\text{Value of Futures Position} = \left(\frac{\text{Futures Price}}{100}\right) \times 100,  000 \times \text{Number of Futures Contracts}$$
- Example:
  - Final futures price: 105.85581.
  - Number of futures contracts: 112.
  - Value of futures position:
	$$\text{Value of Futures Position} = \left(\frac{105.85581}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times 112 = 11,   855,   850$$

#### 2.1.4 Gain or Loss on Futures Position
- The gain or loss on the futures position is calculated as:
 $\text{Gain or Loss} = \left(\frac{\text{Initial Futures Price} - \text{Final Futures Price}}{100}\right) \times 100,  000 \times \text{Number of Futures Contracts}$$
- Example:
  - Initial futures price: 113.
  - Final futures price: 105.85581.
  - Number of futures contracts: 112.
  - Gain:
	$$\text{Gain} = \left(\frac{113 - 105.85581}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times 112 = 800,   150$$

### 2.2 Basis and Basis Risk

#### 2.2.1 Definition of Basis
- The **basis** is the difference between the spot price of a bond and its futures price.
- **Price Basis**:
 $\text{Price Basis} = \text{Spot Price} - \text{Futures Delivery Price}$$
- **Rate Basis**:
 $\text{Rate Basis} = \text{Spot Rate} - \text{Futures Rate}$$

#### 2.2.2 Basis Risk
- **Basis risk** arises from uncertainty about the target basis on the day the hedge is lifted.
- If the hedge is lifted before the delivery date,  the target basis is the current basis,  introducing uncertainty into the effective sale price.

### 2.3 Refining the Hedge for Changing Yield Spreads

#### 2.3.1 Yield Beta
- Yield beta ($b$) measures the relative yield change between the bond to be hedged and the CTD issue.
- **Regression Equation**:
 $\text{Yield on Bond to Be Hedged} = a + b \times \text{Yield on CTD Issue} + \text{Error}$$
- Example:
  - If $b = 1.05$,  the yield on the FNMA bond is expected to move 5% more than the yield on the CTD issue.

#### 2.3.2 Adjusting the Number of Futures Contracts
- The number of futures contracts is adjusted to account for yield beta:
 $\text{Number of Futures Contracts} = \frac{\text{Current Dollar Duration Without Futures}}{\text{Dollar Duration of CTD Issue}} \times \text{Conversion Factor for CTD Issue} \times \text{Yield Beta}$$
- Example:
  - Original number of contracts: 112.
  - Yield beta: 1.05.
  - Adjusted number of contracts:
	$$\text{Adjusted Number of Contracts} = 112 \times 1.05 = 118$$

## 3. Hedging with Options

### 3.1 Protective Put-Buying Strategy

#### 3.1.1 Overview
- A **protective put-buying strategy** involves purchasing put options to hedge against rising interest rates.
- This strategy combines a long position in a bond with a long position in a put option,  providing downside protection while retaining upside potential.

#### 3.1.2 Mechanics
- If interest rates rise,  the value of the put option increases,  offsetting losses on the bond.
- If interest rates fall,  the bond appreciates,  but the cost of the put option reduces the net gain.

#### 3.1.3 Example
- A manager holds \$10 million par value of a 6.25% FNMA bond and wants to establish a minimum price of 84.453.
- The equivalent strike price for a Treasury bond futures put option is calculated using:
  - The price-yield relationship for the FNMA bond.
  - The yield spread between the FNMA bond and the CTD issue.
  - The conversion factor for the CTD issue.

### 3.2 Covered Call-Writing Strategy

#### 3.2.1 Overview
- A **covered call-writing strategy** involves selling call options against a bond portfolio to generate premium income.
- This strategy reduces downside risk but limits upside potential.

#### 3.2.2 Mechanics
- If interest rates rise,  the premium received cushions the loss on the bond portfolio.
- If interest rates fall,  the call option becomes a liability,  capping the portfolio's gains.

### 3.3 Collar Strategy

#### 3.3.1 Overview
- A **collar strategy** combines a protective put-buying strategy with a covered call-writing strategy.
- This involves purchasing a put option and selling a call option,  both out-of-the-money,  to create a range of protection.

#### 3.3.2 Mechanics
- The collar limits downside risk while capping upside potential.
- Within the range defined by the strike prices,  the portfolio's value varies with interest rates.

## 4. Comparing Futures and Options Hedging Strategies

### 4.1 Futures Hedging
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - Locks in a target price or rate.
  - Low transaction costs.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No flexibility to benefit from favorable rate movements.
  - Subject to basis risk.

### 4.2 Options Hedging
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides flexibility to benefit from favorable rate movements.
  - Limits downside risk.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Higher cost due to option premiums.
  - Requires careful selection of strike prices and contracts.

## 5. Steps in Options Hedging

### 5.1 Determine the Best Hedging Vehicle
- Consider factors such as option price,  liquidity,  and correlation with the bond to be hedged.

### 5.2 Find the Appropriate Strike Price
- Convert the strike price of the option into an equivalent strike price for the bond being hedged.

### 5.3 Determine the Number of Contracts
- Calculate the hedge ratio to determine the number of options to buy or sell.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Hedging with futures and options provides portfolio managers with powerful tools to manage interest rate risk.
- Futures hedging is straightforward and cost-effective but lacks flexibility and is subject to basis risk.
- Options hedging offers flexibility and downside protection but is more complex and costly.
- The choice of hedging strategy depends on the manager's market outlook and risk tolerance.
- Refinements such as adjusting for yield beta and monitoring yield spreads enhance the effectiveness of hedging strategies.

By mastering these techniques,  portfolio managers can effectively mitigate interest rate risk and optimize portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Hedging with Futures Options â€“ Protective Put and Covered Call Strategies

## 1. Introduction to Hedging with Futures Options

- Futures options provide a flexible and effective way to hedge interest rate risk in fixed-income portfolios.
- Two common strategies are:
  - **Protective Put-Buying Strategy**: Protects against rising interest rates while allowing for upside potential if rates fall.
  - **Covered Call-Writing Strategy**: Generates premium income while limiting upside potential in exchange for partial downside protection.
- This lecture will cover:
  - The mechanics of calculating the number of options contracts required for a hedge.
  - Scenario analysis for protective put and covered call strategies.
  - A comparison of the two strategies and their implications for portfolio management.

## 2. Protective Put-Buying Strategy

### 2.1 Mechanics of Protective Put Hedging

#### 2.1.1 Calculating the Number of Options Contracts
- The hedge ratio for options is determined using the following formula:
 $\text{Number of Options Contracts} = \frac{\text{Current Dollar Duration Without Options}}{\text{Dollar Duration of the CTD Issue}} \times \text{Conversion Factor for CTD Issue}$$
- **Inputs**:
  - Current dollar duration without options: $$\$512,   320$$
  - Dollar duration of the CTD issue: $$\$6.021$$
  - Conversion factor for the CTD issue: $$1.283$$
- **Calculation**:
 $\text{Number of Options Contracts} = \frac{\$512,  320}{\$6.021} \times 1.283 = 109 \,  \text{put options}$$
- **Interpretation**:
  - To hedge the FNMA bond position,  109 put options on Treasury bond futures must be purchased.

#### 2.1.2 Cost of the Hedge
- Suppose the price of the put option with a strike price of 110 is $$\$500$$ per contract.
- Total cost of the hedge:
 $\text{Cost of Hedge} = 109 \times \$500 = \$54,  500$$
- This cost is equivalent to $$0.545$$ per $$\$100$$ par value hedged.

### 2.2 Outcome of the Hedge

#### 2.2.1 Value of the Put Option Position
- The value of the put option position at expiration depends on whether the futures price is below the strike price of 110:
  - If the futures price is **greater than or equal to 110**,  the options expire worthless,  and the value of the put option position is zero.
  - If the futures price is **below 110**,  the options expire in the money,  and the value of the put option position is calculated as:
	$$\text{Value of Put Option Position} = \left(\frac{110}{100} - \frac{\text{Futures Price}}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times \text{Number of Put Options}$$

#### 2.2.2 Example Calculation
- **Scenario**:
  - Actual sale price of FNMA bond: $$\$8,   000,   000$$
  - Futures price: $$105.85581$$
  - Number of put options: $$109$$
- **Value of Put Option Position**:
 $\text{Value of Put Option Position} = \left(\frac{110}{100} - \frac{105.85581}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times 109 = \$45,  717$$
- **Effective Sale Price**:
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = \text{Actual Sale Price} + \text{Value of Put Option Position} - \text{Cost of Hedge}$$
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = 8,  000,  000 + 45,  717 - 54,  500 = 8,  397,  217$$

#### 2.2.3 Minimum Effective Sale Price
- The minimum effective sale price can be calculated before initiating the hedge:
 $\text{Minimum Effective Sale Price} = \text{Price of FNMA Bonds Equivalent to Futures Strike Price} - \text{Cost of Hedge}$$
  - Price of FNMA bonds equivalent to futures strike price: $$84.453$$
  - Cost of hedge: $$0.545$$ per $$\$100$$ par value.
 $\text{Minimum Effective Sale Price} = 84.453 - 0.545 = 83.908$$
- **Interpretation**:
  - The effective sale price will never fall below $$83.908$$,  providing downside protection.

#### 2.2.4 Scenario Analysis
- Exhibit 63-8 provides a detailed scenario analysis for the protective put hedge,  showing the effective sale price under various futures price scenarios.

## 3. Covered Call-Writing Strategy

### 3.1 Mechanics of Covered Call Writing

#### 3.1.1 Selling Call Options
- In a covered call-writing strategy,  the portfolio manager sells out-of-the-money call options against an existing bond portfolio.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Futures price at hedge initiation: $$113$$
  - Strike price of call options: $$117$$
  - Price of call options: $$\$500$$ per contract
  - Number of call options sold: $$109$$
- **Proceeds from Sale of Call Options**:
 $\text{Proceeds} = 109 \times \$500 = \$54,  500$$

#### 3.1.2 Liability of Call Option Position
- The liability from the call option position depends on whether the futures price exceeds the strike price of 117:
  - If the futures price is **less than or equal to 117**,  the liability is zero.
  - If the futures price is **greater than 117**,  the liability is calculated as:
	$$\text{Liability} = \left(\frac{\text{Futures Price}}{100} - \frac{117}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times \text{Number of Call Options}$$

#### 3.1.3 Example Calculation
- **Scenario**:
  - Actual sale price of FNMA bond: $$\$9,   500,   000$$
  - Futures price: $$119.31255$$
  - Number of call options: $$109$$
- **Liability**:
 $\text{Liability} = \left(\frac{119.31255}{100} - \frac{117}{100}\right) \times 100,   000 \times 109 = \$252,  068$$
- **Effective Sale Price**:
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = \text{Actual Sale Price} + \text{Proceeds from Sale of Call Options} - \text{Liability}$$
 $\text{Effective Sale Price} = 9,  500,  000 + 54,  500 - 252,  068 = 9,  302,  432$$

### 3.2 Maximum Effective Sale Price
- The maximum effective sale price can be calculated before initiating the hedge:
 $\text{Maximum Effective Sale Price} = \text{Price of Hedged Bond Corresponding to Strike Price} + \text{Premium Received}$$
  - Price of hedged bond corresponding to strike price: $$92.858$$
  - Premium received: $$0.545$$ per $$\$100$$ par value.
 $\text{Maximum Effective Sale Price} = 92.858 + 0.545 = 93.403$$
- **Interpretation**:
  - The effective sale price will never exceed $$93.403$$,  limiting upside potential.

#### 3.2.1 Scenario Analysis
- Exhibit 63-9 provides a detailed scenario analysis for the covered call-writing strategy,  showing the effective sale price under various futures price scenarios.

## 4. Comparison of Protective Put and Covered Call Strategies

### 4.1 Protective Put Strategy
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides full downside protection if rates rise.
  - Allows for unlimited upside potential if rates fall.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires an upfront cost (option premium).
  - Minimum effective sale price is reduced by the cost of the hedge.

### 4.2 Covered Call Strategy
- **Advantages**:
  - Generates premium income,  providing partial downside protection.
  - No upfront cost; instead,  the strategy generates cash inflow.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limits upside potential if rates fall.
  - Maximum effective sale price is capped by the strike price of the call options.

## 5. Summary and Key Takeaways

- **Protective Put Strategy**:
  - Best suited for investors seeking downside protection while retaining upside potential.
  - The cost of the hedge reduces the minimum effective sale price.
- **Covered Call Strategy**:
  - Best suited for investors expecting stable interest rates and seeking to generate additional income.
  - Limits upside potential in exchange for premium income.
- **Scenario Analysis**:
  - Both strategies provide predictable outcomes under various interest rate scenarios,  allowing investors to align their hedging approach with their market outlook and risk tolerance.

By understanding the mechanics and implications of these strategies,  portfolio managers can effectively manage interest rate risk and optimize portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Hedging Strategies and Interest Rate Swaps

## 1. Introduction to Hedging Strategies and Interest Rate Swaps

- Hedging strategies are essential tools for managing interest rate risk in fixed-income portfolios. These strategies allow portfolio managers to mitigate the impact of adverse interest rate movements on bond portfolios.
- Interest rate swaps,  a type of derivative,  are widely used by financial institutions to synthetically manage interest rate exposure,  especially when direct restructuring of assets and liabilities is not feasible.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - Comparing alternative hedging strategies,  including futures,  protective puts,  and covered calls.
  - The mechanics and features of interest rate swaps.
  - The interpretation of swap positions as packages of forward contracts or cash market instruments.

## 2. Comparing Hedging Strategies: Futures,  Protective Puts,  and Covered Calls

### 2.1 Overview of Hedging Strategies

- **Hedging with Futures**:
  - Futures contracts are used to lock in a target price or rate for a bond portfolio.
  - This strategy substitutes basis risk for price risk,  as the futures price may not perfectly track the cash price of the bond being hedged.
- **Protective Put-Buying Strategy**:
  - Involves purchasing put options to hedge against rising interest rates.
  - Provides downside protection while retaining upside potential.
- **Covered Call-Writing Strategy**:
  - Involves selling call options against a bond portfolio to generate premium income.
  - Limits upside potential in exchange for partial downside protection.

### 2.2 Exhibit 63-10: Comparison of Alternative Strategies

#### Key Observations from Exhibit 63-10

- **Effective Sale Price with Futures Hedge**:
  - Provides a relatively stable effective sale price across a range of actual sale prices.
  - Example: For an actual sale price of $8,   000,   000,    the effective sale price is $8,  800,  150.
- **Effective Sale Price with Protective Puts**:
  - Offers downside protection but results in a lower effective sale price compared to futures hedging.
  - Example: For an actual sale price of $8,   000,   000,    the effective sale price is $8,  397,  217.
- **Effective Sale Price with Covered Calls**:
  - Generates premium income but caps the upside potential.
  - Example: For an actual sale price of $8,   000,   000,    the effective sale price is $8,  054,  500.

#### Implications
- No single strategy is superior across all scenarios. Each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages,  depending on the manager's market outlook and risk tolerance.
- Managers must choose among [[Lecture 1- Probability Distributions of Returns|probability distribution]]s of outcomes rather than specific outcomes.

### 2.3 Key Takeaways on Hedging Strategies

- **Futures Hedging**:
  - Best suited for locking in a target price or rate.
  - Subject to basis risk and delivery options embedded in futures contracts.
- **Protective Put Strategy**:
  - Provides full downside protection but requires an upfront cost (option premium).
  - Retains upside potential.
- **Covered Call Strategy**:
  - Generates premium income but limits upside potential.
  - Entails more downside risk than protective puts.
- **Collar Strategy**:
  - Combines protective puts and covered calls to create a range of protection.
  - Eliminates part of the portfolio's downside risk by giving up part of its upside potential.

## 3. Interest Rate Swaps: Mechanics and Features

### 3.1 Definition and Purpose

- An **interest rate swap** is an agreement between two parties (counterparties) to exchange periodic interest payments based on a notional principal amount.
- The notional principal amount is not exchanged; it serves as the basis for calculating the interest payments.
- Swaps are used to:
  - Manage interest rate risk.
  - Align the duration of assets and liabilities.
  - Hedge against changes in interest rates.

### 3.2 Features of a Generic Swap

- **Fixed-Rate Payer and Floating-Rate Payer**:
  - One party agrees to pay a fixed interest rate (fixed-rate payer) and receive a floating interest rate.
  - The other party agrees to pay a floating interest rate (floating-rate payer) and receive a fixed interest rate.
- **Notional Principal Amount**:
  - The dollar amount used to calculate interest payments.
  - Example: For a $50 million notional amount,    the fixed-rate payer pays $1.25 million every six months (5% Ã— $50 million Ã· 2).
- **Floating Rate**:
  - Commonly based on benchmarks such as LIBOR,  Treasury bills,  or the federal funds rate.
  - Resets periodically (e.g.,  daily,  monthly,  or semiannually).
- **Settlement**:
  - Payments are exchanged at designated intervals (e.g.,  semiannually).
  - Only the net difference between the fixed and floating payments is exchanged.

### 3.3 Example: Fixed-Rate Payer and Floating-Rate Payer

- **Assumptions**:
  - Notional amount: $50 million.
  - Fixed rate: 5%.
  - Floating rate: Six-month LIBOR.
  - Settlement frequency: Semiannual.
- **Cash Flows**:
  - Fixed-rate payer pays $1.25 million every six months.
  - Floating-rate payer pays [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 million Ã· 2.
  - Example: If [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 3%,  the floating-rate payer pays $750,  000.

### 3.4 Swap Market Structure

- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Market**:
  - Swaps are typically traded OTC between counterparties.
  - The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act introduced Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs) to centralize clearing for standardized swaps.
- **Customization**:
  - Swaps can be tailored to meet specific needs,  including unusual terms or indices.

## 4. Interpreting a Swap Position

### 4.1 Swap as a Package of Forward Contracts

- An interest rate swap can be viewed as a package of [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs).
- **Advantages**:
  - Longer maturities: Swaps can extend beyond the maturities of typical forward contracts.
  - Transactional efficiency: A single swap contract replaces multiple forward contracts.

### 4.2 Swap as a Package of Cash Market Instruments

- A swap can also be interpreted as a combination of cash market instruments.
- **Example**:
  - Buy a $50 million floating-rate bond (pays [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] every six months).
  - Finance the purchase by borrowing $50 million at a fixed rate (5% annual interest).
  - **Net Cash Flow**:
	- Inflows: [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 million Ã· 2.
	- Outflows: $1.25 million.
	- Net position: [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 million Ã· 2 - $1.25 million.
  - This is equivalent to the cash flows of a fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver.

### 4.3 Exhibit 64-1: Cash Flow Analysis

#### Cash Flow for a Five-Year Floating-Rate Bond Financed by Fixed-Rate Borrowing

| Six-Month Period | Floating-Rate Bond | Borrowing Cost | Net Cash Flow |

| 0 | -$50 million      | +$50 million | $0 |

| 1 | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 | -$1.25 million | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 - $1.25 million |

| 2 | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 | -$1.25 million | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 - $1.25 million |

| â€¦ | â€¦ | â€¦ | â€¦ |

| 10 | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 + $50 million | -$51.25 million | [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Ã— $50 Ã· 2 - $1.25 million |

#### Key Insight
- The net cash flows replicate the position of a fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver in a swap.

## 5. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 5.1 Hedging Strategies

- Futures,  protective puts,  and covered calls each offer unique advantages and disadvantages.
- The choice of strategy depends on the manager's market outlook and risk tolerance.
- Futures hedging locks in a target price or rate but introduces basis risk.
- Protective puts provide downside protection but require an upfront cost.
- Covered calls generate premium income but limit upside potential.

### 5.2 Interest Rate Swaps

- Swaps are versatile tools for managing interest rate risk and aligning the duration of assets and liabilities.
- They can be interpreted as packages of forward contracts or cash market instruments.
- The notional principal amount is used to calculate interest payments but is not exchanged.
- Swaps are typically traded OTC,  with standardized contracts cleared through SEFs.

### 5.3 Practical Applications

- Hedging with swaps allows institutions to synthetically manage interest rate exposure without restructuring their asset and liability mix.
- Swaps provide flexibility in terms of maturity,  structure,  and indices,  making them suitable for a wide range of financial strategies.

By mastering these concepts,  portfolio managers can effectively manage interest rate risk and optimize portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Interest Rate Swaps and Applications in Asset/Liability Management

## 1. Introduction to Interest Rate Swaps

- Interest rate swaps are financial derivatives that allow counterparties to exchange cash flows based on a notional principal amount.
- These instruments are widely used in asset/liability management to manage interest rate risk,  synthetically convert liabilities or assets,  and fine-tune the duration of portfolios.
- This lecture will cover:
  - The mechanics of interest rate swaps.
  - The interpretation of swap positions as combinations of cash market instruments.
  - Applications of swaps in converting floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and vice versa.
  - Innovations in swap markets,  including basis swaps and other advanced instruments.

## 2. Mechanics of Interest Rate Swaps

### 2.1 Key Terminology

- **Trade Date**: The date on which the counterparties commit to the swap.
- **Effective Date**: The date the swap begins accruing interest.
- **Maturity Date**: The date the swap stops accruing interest.
- **Settlement Date**: The date on which cash flows are exchanged.

### 2.2 Structure of a Generic Swap

- **Fixed-Rate Payer**:
  - Pays a fixed interest rate.
  - Receives a floating interest rate (e.g.,  LIBOR).
  - This position is equivalent to being **short the bond market** because it benefits from rising interest rates.
- **Floating-Rate Payer**:
  - Pays a floating interest rate (e.g.,  LIBOR).
  - Receives a fixed interest rate.
  - This position is equivalent to being **long the bond market** because it benefits from falling interest rates.

### 2.3 Cash Flow Mechanics

- **Fixed-Rate Payer Example**:
  - Notional principal: $50 million.
  - Fixed rate: 5%.
  - Floating rate: 6-month LIBOR.
  - Semiannual payments:
	- Fixed payment: $$\frac{5\%}{2} \times 50,   000,   000 = 1,   250,   000$$
	- Floating payment: $$\text{LIBOR} \times \frac{50,   000,   000}{2}$$
	- Net payment: Difference between fixed and floating payments.

## 3. Interpretation of Swap Positions

### 3.1 Fixed-Rate Payer

- A fixed-rate payer's position can be interpreted as:
  - **Long a floating-rate bond**: Receives floating-rate cash flows.
  - **Short a fixed-rate bond**: Pays fixed-rate cash flows.
- This position benefits from rising interest rates because the fixed-rate liability is locked in at a lower rate.

### 3.2 Floating-Rate Payer

- A floating-rate payer's position can be interpreted as:
  - **Long a fixed-rate bond**: Receives fixed-rate cash flows.
  - **Short a floating-rate bond**: Pays floating-rate cash flows.
- This position benefits from falling interest rates because the floating-rate liability adjusts downward.

## 4. Applications of Interest Rate Swaps

### 4.1 Converting Floating-Rate Debt to Fixed-Rate Debt

- **Objective**: Lock in a fixed liability cost to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Enter into a fixed-rate payer/floating-rate receiver swap.
  - The floating-rate liability is offset by the floating-rate inflow from the swap.
  - The net funding cost becomes the fixed rate of the swap.
- **Example**:
  - Floating-rate liability: 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + 10 bps (3.10%).
  - Swap terms: Pay fixed at 3.40%,  receive floating at 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] (3.00%).
  - Net funding cost:
	$$\text{Net Funding Cost} = \text{Floating Liability Cost} + \text{Fixed Rate of Swap} - \text{Floating Rate of Swap}$$
	$$\text{Net Funding Cost} = 3.10\% + 3.40\% - 3.00\% = 3.50\%$$
- **Exhibit 64-2**: Funding costs remain constant at 3.50% across various interest rate scenarios,  demonstrating the effectiveness of the swap.

### 4.2 Converting Fixed-Rate Debt to Floating-Rate Debt

- **Objective**: Align liability costs with floating-rate assets to better match durations.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Enter into a floating-rate payer/fixed-rate receiver swap.
  - The fixed-rate liability is offset by the fixed-rate inflow from the swap.
  - The net funding cost becomes the floating rate of the swap.
- **Example**:
  - Fixed-rate liability: 3.85%.
  - Swap terms: Pay floating at 3-month LIBOR,  receive fixed at 3.70%.
  - Net funding cost:
	$$\text{Net Funding Cost} = \text{Fixed Liability Cost} - \text{Fixed Rate of Swap} + \text{Floating Rate of Swap}$$
	$$\text{Net Funding Cost} = 3.85\% - 3.70\% + \text{LIBOR}$$
	$$\text{Net Funding Cost} = \text{LIBOR} + 0.15\%$$
- **Exhibit 64-3**: Funding costs vary with [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] but maintain a consistent spread of 15 bps over LIBOR.

### 4.3 Basis Swaps

- **Objective**: Manage basis risk when asset returns and liability costs are based on different benchmarks.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Enter into a floating-to-floating basis swap.
  - Example: Receive prime - 150 bps (reset semiannually),  pay 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] (reset monthly).
- **Exhibit 64-5**: Basis swaps lock in a consistent spread over funding costs,  mitigating the impact of imperfect correlation between benchmarks.

## 5. Swap Pricing and Market Quotes

### 5.1 Quoting Conventions

- Dealers quote swaps by setting the floating rate equal to the index (e.g.,  LIBOR) and quoting the fixed rate.
- **Example**:
  - Fixed-rate payer: Pay 3.85%,  receive LIBOR.
  - Floating-rate payer: Pay LIBOR,  receive 3.75%.
  - Bid/offer spread: 10 bps.

### 5.2 Swap Spread

- The fixed rate is quoted as a spread over the Treasury yield curve.
- **Example**:
  - 10-year Treasury yield: 3.35%.
  - Fixed-rate payer: Pay 3.85% (50 bps over Treasury).
  - Floating-rate payer: Receive 3.75% (40 bps over Treasury).
- Swap spreads are influenced by:
  - Supply and demand dynamics.
  - Credit risk considerations.
  - Market conditions (e.g.,  post-2008 financial crisis).

## 6. Dollar Duration of a Swap

### 6.1 Definition

- The dollar duration of a swap measures the sensitivity of its value to changes in interest rates.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Dollar Duration of Swap} = \text{Dollar Duration of Fixed-Rate Bond} - \text{Dollar Duration of Floating-Rate Bond}$$

### 6.2 Key Insights

- The dollar duration of the fixed-rate bond dominates because the floating-rate bond's duration is small (less than the time to the next reset date).
- As the reset date approaches,  the floating-rate bond's duration decreases further,  reducing the overall sensitivity of the swap.

## 7. Innovations in Swap Markets

### 7.1 Basis Swaps

- Address basis risk by aligning cash flows indexed to different benchmarks.
- Example: Swap prime-based liabilities for LIBOR-based liabilities.

### 7.2 Yield-Curve Swaps

- Allow counterparties to exchange cash flows based on different points on the yield curve.
- Example: Pay 2-year Treasury yield,  receive 10-year Treasury yield.

### 7.3 Asset Swaps

- Combine a bond purchase with a swap to convert fixed-rate bond cash flows into floating-rate cash flows or vice versa.

### 7.4 Swaptions

- Options on swaps that provide the right,  but not the obligation,  to enter into a swap at a future date.
- Example: A callable liability can be created by combining a fixed-rate liability with a payer swaption.

## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Interest rate swaps are versatile tools for managing interest rate risk and aligning asset/liability durations.
- Fixed-rate payers are effectively short the bond market,  while floating-rate payers are long the bond market.
- Swaps can synthetically convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt and vice versa,  providing flexibility in managing funding costs.
- Basis swaps and other innovations address specific risks,  such as basis risk and yield curve mismatches.
- Swap pricing is influenced by Treasury yields,  credit risk,  and market conditions,  with bid/offer spreads reflecting dealer costs and market dynamics.

By mastering these concepts,  financial institutions can effectively use swaps to optimize their balance sheets and manage interest rate exposure.

# Lecture Notes: Advanced Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions

## 1. Introduction to Advanced Interest Rate Swaps and Swaptions

- Interest rate swaps and swaptions are critical tools in modern financial markets,  offering flexibility in managing interest rate risk and customizing cash flows.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - Advanced swap structures,  including yield-curve swaps,  amortizing and accreting swaps,  forward swaps,  and equity swaps.
  - The mechanics and applications of swaptions.
  - The valuation of swaps and swaptions using traditional and lattice-based approaches.
  - Practical applications in asset/liability management and hedging strategies.

## 2. Advanced Swap Structures

### 2.1 Yield-Curve Swaps

- **Definition**: A yield-curve swap is a floating-for-floating rate swap where payments are based on interest rates at two different points on the yield curve.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Party A agrees to receive the six-month Treasury bill rate and pay Party B the 10-year Treasury yield minus 200 basis points.
  - Both rates reset every six months.
- **Example**:
  - At a reset date:
	- Six-month T-bill rate = 2.5%.
	- 10-year Treasury yield = 4%.
	- Party A receives 2.5% and pays 2% (4% - 200 bps).
  - If the yield curve flattens:
	- Six-month T-bill rate = 3%.
	- 10-year Treasury yield = 3.5%.
	- Party A receives 3% and pays 1.5% (3.5% - 200 bps).
- **Applications**:
  - Used to hedge or speculate on changes in the shape of the yield curve.
  - Common in managing duration mismatches in portfolios.

### 2.2 Amortizing and Accreting Swaps

#### 2.2.1 Amortizing Swaps
- **Definition**: A swap where the notional principal decreases over time,  aligning with the amortization of an underlying asset (e.g.,  mortgage loans).
- **Purpose**:
  - Matches the declining principal balance of amortizing assets,  such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).
  - Reduces the risk of being overhedged or underhedged due to changes in asset prepayment rates.
- **Mechanics**:
  - The notional amount decreases according to a predefined schedule.
  - Swap cash flows adjust based on the reduced notional amount.
- **Example**:
  - Initial notional = $100 million.
  - Year 1: Notional = $80 million.
  - Year 2: Notional = $60 million.
- **Challenges**:
  - Prepayment risk can lead to mismatches if the actual amortization differs from the predefined schedule.
  - Balance-guaranteed swaps address this by tying the notional amount to the actual outstanding balance of a reference asset pool.

#### 2.2.2 Accreting Swaps
- **Definition**: A swap where the notional principal increases over time,  often used to hedge liabilities that grow incrementally.
- **Applications**:
  - Common in the construction industry to hedge floating-rate drawdown facilities.
  - Aligns with increasing liability schedules.

### 2.3 Forward Swaps

- **Definition**: A forward swap is a swap agreement with a delayed start date.
- **Purpose**:
  - Hedge future funding requirements or anticipated debt issuance.
  - Lock in current interest rates for future periods.
- **Example**:
  - A firm has $200 million of fixed-rate debt maturing in three years.
  - To lock in funding costs for the subsequent five years,  the firm enters into a forward swap to pay fixed and receive floating starting three years from now.
  - If rates rise,  the firm issues floating-rate debt and converts it to fixed-rate liability using the swap.

### 2.4 Equity Swaps

- **Definition**: An equity swap involves exchanging cash flows based on the total return of a stock market index and an interest rate (fixed or floating).
- **Mechanics**:
  - One party receives the total return on an equity index (e.g.,  S&P 500,  DAX) and pays an interest rate (e.g.,  LIBOR).
  - Payments can be denominated in different currencies.
- **Example**:
  - A money manager enters a two-year quarterly reset equity swap:
	- Receives the German DAX index return in euros.
	- Pays [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] in euros.
- **Applications**:
  - Used to gain synthetic exposure to equity markets without directly holding the underlying assets.
  - Facilitates cross-border investments and currency diversification.

## 3. Swaptions: Mechanics and Applications

### 3.1 Definition and Types

- **Definition**: A swaption is an option to enter into a swap at a future date.
- **Types**:
  - **Payer Swaption**: The right to pay fixed and receive floating.
  - **Receiver Swaption**: The right to receive fixed and pay floating.
  - **Cancellation Swaption**: The right to cancel an existing swap.

### 3.2 Exercise Styles

- **European Swaption**: Exercisable only on a specific date.
- **American Swaption**: Exercisable at any time up to and including the expiration date.
- **Example**:
  - A seven-year swaption allows the holder to pay fixed at 4% at any time before maturity.
  - If exercised after one year,  the holder pays 4% and receives [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] for the remaining six years.

### 3.3 Applications

#### 3.3.1 Liability Management
- **Hedging Uncertain Funding Requirements**:
  - Lock in current rates without committing to future borrowing.
  - Example: A firm purchases a payer swaption to hedge against rising rates for anticipated debt issuance.
- **Issuing Callable Debt**:
  - Corporations issue callable bonds and strip off the embedded call option by writing a swaption,  reducing the all-in cost of debt.

#### 3.3.2 Asset Management
- **Hedging Prepayable Assets**:
  - Investors holding prepayable assets (e.g.,  MBS) can use swaptions to hedge against prepayment risk.
  - Example: Purchase a receiver swaption to offset the impact of declining interest rates on prepayment-sensitive assets.

#### 3.3.3 Arbitrage Opportunities
- Exploit pricing inefficiencies between the swaption and callable bond markets.
- Example: Issue callable debt and write a swaption to strip off the embedded call option.

### 3.4 Comparison with Caps and Floors

- **Caps**:
  - Provide protection against rising rates by capping the maximum interest rate.
  - More expensive than swaptions because they consist of a strip of options.
- **Swaptions**:
  - Offer flexibility to enter into a swap at a future date.
  - Less expensive than caps but expose the holder to rate movements after exercise.

## 4. Valuation of Swaps and Swaptions

### 4.1 Traditional Valuation Approach

- **Method**:
  - Discount future cash flows using implied forward rates derived from Eurodollar futures.
  - Compute the swap fixed rate (SFR) as the rate that equates the present value of fixed and floating cash flows.
- **Limitations**:
  - Cannot handle cash flows that depend on future interest rate movements.

### 4.2 Lattice-Based Valuation Approach

- **Overview**:
  - Incorporates interest rate volatility to model future rate movements.
  - Constructs an interest-rate lattice to represent possible rate paths.
- **Steps**:
  1. Build the interest-rate lattice using a one-factor model (e.g.,  Kalotay-Williams-Fabozzi model).
  1. Compute swap cash flows at each node on the lattice.
  1. Discount cash flows backward through the lattice to determine present value.
- **Advantages**:
  - Handles exotic instruments with option-like features.
  - Incorporates no-arbitrage conditions and interest rate volatility.

### 4.3 Example: Swaption Valuation

- **Inputs**:
  - Notional principal: $100 million.
  - Strike rate: 5%.
  - Time to expiration: 2 years.
  - Volatility: 20%.
- **Process**:
  - Construct a binomial interest-rate lattice.
  - Calculate swap cash flows at each node.
  - Discount cash flows to determine the swaption's present value.
- **Impact of Volatility**:
  - Higher volatility increases the value of the swaption due to greater potential rate movements.

## 5. Termination of Interest Rate Swaps

### 5.1 Reverse Swap

- **Definition**: Entering into an offsetting swap to neutralize the original swap's cash flows.
- **Example**:
  - Original swap: Pay fixed at 5.4%,  receive LIBOR.
  - Reverse swap: Receive fixed at 6.4%,  pay LIBOR.
  - Profit: 1% of the notional amount annually for the remaining term.

### 5.2 Swap Sale

- **Definition**: Selling the swap in the secondary market for a profit or loss.
- **Valuation**:
  - Termination value = Present value of the annuity (difference between old and new fixed rates) discounted at the current swap rate.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Advanced swap structures,  such as yield-curve swaps,  amortizing swaps,  and forward swaps,  provide tailored solutions for managing interest rate risk.
- Swaptions offer flexibility in hedging and liability management,  bridging the gap between swaps and caps/floors.
- The lattice-based valuation approach incorporates interest rate volatility,  enabling the pricing of complex instruments.
- Termination strategies,  including reverse swaps and swap sales,  allow firms to manage or exit swap positions efficiently.

By mastering these advanced concepts,  financial professionals can effectively navigate the complexities of interest rate derivatives and optimize their risk management strategies.

# Lecture Notes: Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Start Swaps Using a Binomial Lattice

## 1. Introduction to Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Start Swaps

- Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that allow counterparties to exchange fixed and floating interest rate payments based on a notional principal amount.
- Forward start swaps are a variation of interest rate swaps that begin at a specified future date and are used to hedge or lock in interest rates for future periods.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The valuation of a five-year plain vanilla interest rate swap using a binomial interest rate lattice.
  - The valuation of a forward start swap using the same lattice framework.
  - The mechanics of calculating cash flows,  cumulative swap valuation,  and probabilities in the lattice.

## 2. Valuation of a Five-Year Plain Vanilla Interest Rate Swap

### 2.1 Overview of the Swap

- **Swap Details**:
  - Notional Principal (NP): $100
  - Swap Fixed Rate (SFR): 3%
  - Tenor: 5 years
  - Settlement Frequency: Semiannual
  - Interest Rate Model: One-factor binomial lattice with 10 semiannual time steps.
- **Key Assumptions**:
  - Semiannual cash flows with a fraction of the year equal to 0.5.
  - Cash flows are determined at the start of each period but paid in arrears at the end of the period.

### 2.2 Cash Flow Calculation

- **Fixed-Rate Payment**:
 $\text{Fixed-Rate Payment} = \text{SFR} \times \text{NP} \times \left(\frac{\text{Days in Period}}{360}\right)$$
 $\text{Fixed-Rate Payment} = 3\% \times 100 \times 0.5 = 1.5$$

- **Floating-Rate Payment**:
 $\text{Floating-Rate Payment} = \text{Floating Rate} \times \text{NP} \times \left(\frac{\text{Days in Period}}{360}\right)$$

- **Net Cash Flow**:
 $\text{Net Cash Flow} = (\text{Floating Rate} - \text{SFR}) \times \text{NP} \times \left(\frac{\text{Days in Period}}{360}\right)$$

- **Example**:
  - At $t=4.5$ years,  the short rate is 9.1446%.
  - Net Cash Flow:
	$$\text{Net Cash Flow} = (9.1446\% - 3.0\%) \times 100 \times 0.5 = 3.0723$$

### 2.3 Cumulative Swap Valuation Lattice

- **Purpose**:
  - The cumulative swap valuation lattice calculates the present value of all future cash flows at each node,  discounted using the rates in the binomial lattice.
- **Discounting Cash Flows**:
 $\text{Present Value} = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{1 + \text{Short Rate}/2}$$

- **Example**:
  - At $t=4.5$ years,  the cash flow at $t=5$ years is $3.0723$.
  - Discounted Value:
	$$\text{PV} = \frac{3.0723}{1 + 9.1446\%/2} = 2.9380$$

- **Backward Induction**:
  - At each node,  the cumulative value is the sum of:
	1. The discounted values of the two possible future nodes (weighted equally).
	1. The cash flow at the current node.

- **Example**:
  - At $t=4$,  the cumulative value is:
	$$\text{Cumulative Value} = \frac{0.5 \times 2.9380 + 0.5 \times 2.3750 + 2.3104}{1 + 7.6208\%/2} = 4.7846$$

### 2.4 Swap Valuation at $t=0$

- **Final Value**:
  - The present value of the swap at $t=0$ is the cumulative value at the root of the lattice.
  - For the given swap:
	$$\text{Swap Value} = 1.5892$$

- **Interpretation**:
  - The negative value indicates that the fixed-rate payer is at a disadvantage because the present value of fixed payments exceeds the present value of floating payments.
  - This occurs because interest rates have declined since the swap was initiated.

## 3. Valuation of a Forward Start Swap

### 3.1 Overview of the Forward Start Swap

- **Swap Details**:
  - Notional Principal (NP): $100
  - Forward Swap Fixed Rate (SFR): 3.250%
  - Start Date: 3 years from today
  - Maturity Date: 5 years from today
  - Settlement Frequency: Semiannual
- **Key Assumptions**:
  - The forward start swap begins at $t=3$ years,  so cash flows are calculated for the period $t=3$ to $t=5$.
  - The valuation process uses the same binomial lattice as the plain vanilla swap.

### 3.2 Cumulative Swap Valuation Lattice

- **Steps**:
  1. Calculate the cash flows at each node for the period $t=3$ to $t=5$.
  1. Construct the cumulative valuation lattice for the forward start swap,  starting at $t=5$ and working backward to $t=3$.

- **Example**:
  - At $t=4.5$,  the short rate is 9.1446%.
  - Net Cash Flow:
	$$\text{Net Cash Flow} = (9.1446\% - 3.250\%) \times 100 \times 0.5 = 2.9473$$
  - Discounted Value:
	$$\text{PV} = \frac{2.9473}{1 + 9.1446\%/2} = 2.8160$$

### 3.3 Probability of Reaching Each Node

- **Formula**:
 $\text{Number of Paths} = \frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}$$
  - $n$: Total number of time steps.
  - $j$: Number of down movements.
- **Example**:
  - At $t=3$,  the total number of paths is $2^6 = 64$.
  - For the second node from the top:
	$$\text{Number of Paths} = \frac{6!}{1!(5!)} = 6$$
  - Probability:
	$$\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of Paths}}{\text{Total Paths}} = \frac{6}{64} = 0.09375$$

### 3.4 Forward Start Swap Valuation at $t=3$

- **Weighted Value**:
  - The value of the forward start swap is the probability-weighted sum of the cumulative values at $t=3$.
  - Example:
	- Node 1: Cumulative Value = $2.8160$,  Probability = $0.09375$.
	- Node 2: Cumulative Value = $2.3750$,  Probability = $0.1875$.
	- Total Value:
	 $\text{Forward Start Swap Value} = \sum (\text{Cumulative Value} \times \text{Probability}) = 1.87089$$

- **Interpretation**:
  - The positive value indicates that the floating-rate payments are expected to exceed the fixed-rate payments.

| **Total**| **14.3356** | **64** | **100.00%** | **1.87089** |

#### 2.2.2 Interpretation of Results

- The total probability-weighted value of the FSS at year 3 is **1.87089**.
- This value represents the present value of the expected cash flows for the fixed-rate payer.
- The value for the floating-rate payer is the negative of this amount: **-1.87089**.

#### 2.2.3 Swap Fixed Rate (SFR) for Zero Value

- The SFR that would produce a zero value for the FSS is **4.233%**.
- This is computed iteratively,  similar to the process for valuing a plain vanilla swap.

## 3. Valuation of Swaptions

### 3.1 Overview of Swaptions

- A **swaption** is an option contract on an interest rate swap.
- **Key Features**:
  - The swaption specifies the tenor of the swap and the swap fixed rate (strike rate).
  - The owner has the right,  but not the obligation,  to enter into the swap.
  - Swaptions can be **European-style** (exercisable only at expiration) or **American-style** (exercisable at any time up to expiration).

#### 3.1.1 Types of Swaptions
- **Payer Swaption**: The right to pay fixed and receive floating.
- **Receiver Swaption**: The right to receive fixed and pay floating.

### 3.2 Example: Valuation of a Pay-Fixed Swaption

#### 3.2.1 Swaption Details

- **Strike Rate**: 3.650%
- **Option Expiration**: 2 years
- **Swap Tenor**: 3 years
- **Notional Principal**: $100

#### 3.2.2 Cash Flow Lattice for Plain Vanilla Swap

- The cash flow lattice is constructed for a plain vanilla swap with a strike rate of 3.650%.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Cash Flow}*{i,  j} = (\text{Floating Rate}*{i,  j-1} - \text{SFR}) \times \text{NP} \times 0.5$$
- **Example**:
  - At $t=5$,  the floating rate at $t=4.5$ is 9.1446%.
  - Cash Flow:
	$$\text{Cash Flow}_{1,   5} = (9.1446\% - 3.650\%) \times 100 \times 0.5 = 2.7473$$

#### 3.2.3 Cumulative Swap Valuation Lattice

- The cumulative swap valuation lattice is constructed using backward induction.
- **Example**:
  - At $t=2.5$,  the top value is computed as:
	$$0.5 \times (5.058457 + 3.537322) / (1 + 4.4031\% / 2) = 4.205307$$

#### 3.2.4 Swaption Valuation at Expiration

- At expiration ($t=3$),  the swaption value is the maximum of zero or the cumulative swap valuation.
- **Example**:
  - At the bottom node ($t=3$),  the cumulative valuation is 0.7711.
  - Swaption Value:
	$$\text{Value} = \max(0,    0.7711) = 0.7711$$

#### 3.2.5 Final Swaption Value

- Using backward induction,  the value of the (3,  2) pay-fixed swaption is **1.170195** per $100 of notional principal.

## 4. Valuation of Basis Swaps

### 4.1 Overview of Basis Swaps

- A **basis swap** involves the exchange of floating-rate payments based on different benchmarks.
- **Example**:

- **Example**:
  - At the highest node ($t=1$),   [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 1.01%,  Treasury bill rate = 0.29%.

#### 4.2.3 Cash Flow Calculation

- **Formula**:
 $\text{CF}*{i,  j} = (\text{T-Bill}*{i,  j-1} + \text{Spread} - \text{LIBOR}_{i,  j-1}) \times 0.25 \times \text{NP}$$
- **Example**:
  - At the highest node ($t=1$):
	$$\text{CF}_{i,   j} = (0.29\% + 0.376\% - 1.01\%) \times 0.25 \times 100 = -0.085$$

#### 4.2.4 Cumulative Value Lattice

- The cumulative value lattice is constructed using backward induction.

# Lecture Notes: Advanced Valuation of Swaps,  Swaptions,  and Interest-Rate Options

## 1. Introduction to Swaps,  Swaptions,  and Interest-Rate Options

- Swaps,  swaptions,  and interest-rate options are critical tools in fixed-income markets,  enabling investors to manage interest-rate risk,  hedge liabilities,  and speculate on rate movements.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The valuation of swaps and swaptions using the lattice approach.
  - The sensitivity of swaption values to key factors such as volatility and strike rate.
  - The basics of interest-rate options,  including their pricing,  risk/return profiles,  and hedging strategies.
- We will also explore the foundational concepts of option pricing,  including intrinsic value,  time value,  and the impact of volatility.

## 2. Factors Affecting Swaption Valuation

### 2.1 Overview of Swaption Valuation

- Swaptions are option contracts that provide the right,  but not the obligation,  to enter into a swap agreement in the future.
- The value of a swaption is influenced by:
  - **Market Inputs**: Term structure of interest rates and interest-rate volatility.
  - **Contract Specifications**: Tenor,  strike rate,  and expiration date.
- The lattice approach is a flexible framework for valuing swaptions,  as it can handle variations in exotic swaps and changing market conditions.

### 2.2 Sensitivity to Interest-Rate Volatility

- **Key Insight**: Holding all else constant,  an increase in interest-rate volatility increases the value of a swaption.
- **Mechanism**:
  - Higher volatility increases the probability of the underlying swap moving in-the-money,  thereby increasing the swaption's time value.
- **Example**:
  - Exhibit 65-14 illustrates the effect of volatility on pay-fixed swaptions with a strike rate of 3.5%.
  - As volatility increases,  the value of the swaption rises,  regardless of the expiration date.

### 2.3 Sensitivity to Strike Rate

- **Pay-Fixed Swaptions**:
  - As the strike rate increases,  the value of the pay-fixed swaption decreases.
  - This occurs because higher strike rates reduce the likelihood of the fixed-rate payments being advantageous relative to the floating-rate payments.
- **Receive-Fixed Swaptions**:
  - As the strike rate increases,  the value of the receive-fixed swaption increases.
  - This is because higher strike rates make the fixed-rate payments more attractive relative to the floating-rate payments.
- **Example**:
  - Exhibit 65-15 shows the joint effect of strike rate and volatility on the value of a (2,  3) pay-fixed swaption.
  - Exhibit 65-16 demonstrates the opposite relationship for a (2,  3) receive-fixed swaption.

### 2.4 Combined Effects of Volatility and Strike Rate

- **Surface Plots**:
  - Exhibit 65-15 (Pay-Fixed Swaption): Value increases with volatility and decreases with strike rate.
  - Exhibit 65-16 (Receive-Fixed Swaption): Value increases with both volatility and strike rate.
- **Key Takeaway**:
  - Volatility has a positive impact on both pay-fixed and receive-fixed swaptions.
  - Strike rate has opposite effects on the two types of swaptions.

## 3. Basics of Interest-Rate Options

### 3.1 Definition and Types

- An **option** is the right,  but not the obligation,  to buy or sell a security at a fixed price (strike price) before or at expiration.
- **Types**:
  - **Call Option**: The right to buy the underlying security.
  - **Put Option**: The right to sell the underlying security.
- **Exercise Styles**:
  - **American Options**: Exercisable at any time up to expiration.
  - **European Options**: Exercisable only at expiration.

### 3.2 Profit/Loss Profiles

- **Call Option**:
  - Profit increases as the price of the underlying security rises above the strike price.
  - Break-even price = Strike price + Premium paid.
  - Example: Exhibit 66-1 shows the profit/loss graph for a call struck at par with a 1-point premium.
- **Put Option**:
  - Profit increases as the price of the underlying security falls below the strike price.
  - Break-even price = Strike price - Premium paid.
  - Example: Exhibit 66-2 shows the profit/loss graph for a put struck at par with a 1-point premium.

### 3.3 Put-Call Parity

- **Definition**: Put-call parity is a fundamental relationship in options pricing that links the prices of calls,  puts,  and the underlying security.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Long Security} = \text{Long Call} + \text{Short Put}$$
- **Implications**:
  - A call can be created from a put by buying the underlying security.
  - A put can be created from a call by selling the underlying security.
- **Exhibits**:
  - Exhibit 66-3: Long Security = Long Call + Short Put.
  - Exhibit 66-4: Long Call = Long Security + Long Put.
  - Exhibit 66-5: Long Put = Short Security + Long Call.

## 4. Valuing an Option

### 4.1 Determinants of Option Value

- **Key Factors**:
  - **Price of the Underlying**: Higher prices increase call values and decrease put values.
  - **Strike Price**: Higher strike prices decrease call values and increase put values.
  - **Time to Expiration**: Longer time increases the option's time value.
  - **Volatility**: Higher volatility increases the option's time value.
  - **Carry**: Positive carry decreases call values and increases put values.
- **Exhibit 66-10** summarizes the effects of these factors on call and put values.

### 4.2 Intrinsic Value and Time Value

- **Intrinsic Value**:
  - The value of the option if exercised immediately.
  - For calls: $$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \max(0,    \text{Underlying Price} - \text{Strike Price})$$
  - For puts: $$\text{Intrinsic Value} = \max(0,    \text{Strike Price} - \text{Underlying Price})$$
- **Time Value**:
  - The additional value due to the time remaining until expiration.
  - Time value decreases as expiration approaches (Exhibit 66-6).

### 4.3 Impact of Volatility

- **Definition**: Volatility measures the variability of the underlying security's price.
- **Effect on Option Value**:
  - Higher volatility increases the probability of the option expiring in-the-money.
  - At-the-money options are most sensitive to changes in volatility.
- **Exhibit 66-8**: Call option value increases with volatility for at-the-money,  in-the-money,  and out-of-the-money options.

### 4.4 Impact of Carry

- **Definition**: Carry is the difference between the coupon payments on a security and the cost of financing its purchase.
- **Effect on Option Value**:
  - Positive carry decreases call values and increases put values.
  - Negative carry (e.g.,  inverted yield curve) has the opposite effect.
- **Exhibit 66-9**: Compares the cost of at-the-money calls and puts across different financing rates.

## 5. Delta,  Gamma,  and Theta: Hedging an Option Position

### 5.1 Delta

- **Definition**: Delta measures the sensitivity of an option's value to changes in the price of the underlying security.
- **Formula**:
 $\Delta = \frac{\Delta \text{Option Value}}{\Delta \text{Underlying Price}}$$
- **Key Insights**:
  - At-the-money calls have a delta of approximately 0.5.
  - Deeply in-the-money calls have a delta close to 1.
  - Deeply out-of-the-money calls have a delta close to 0.
- **Delta Hedging**:
  - A delta-neutral position is created by offsetting the delta of the option with an opposing position in the underlying security.

### 5.2 Gamma

- **Definition**: Gamma measures the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying price.
- **Key Insights**:
  - High gamma indicates greater sensitivity of delta to price changes.
  - Gamma is highest for at-the-money options near expiration.

### 5.3 Theta

- **Definition**: Theta measures the rate of change of an option's value with respect to time.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Theta is negative for long options positions,  as time decay reduces the option's value.
  - Time decay accelerates as expiration approaches.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 6.1 Swaps and Swaptions

- Swaptions are valued using the lattice approach,  which accounts for interest-rate volatility and strike rate.
- Volatility increases swaption values,  while the strike rate has opposite effects on pay-fixed and receive-fixed swaptions.

### 6.2 Interest-Rate Options

- Option value is determined by intrinsic value,  time value,  volatility,  and carry.
- Put-call parity links the prices of calls,  puts,  and the underlying security.
- Delta,  gamma,  and theta are essential metrics for managing option positions.

By mastering these concepts,  financial professionals can effectively use swaps,  swaptions,  and options to manage risk and optimize portfolio performance.

complex than calculating empirical volatility. Implied volatility is derived by solving the option pricing model (e.g.,  Black-Scholes or binomial models) for the volatility input that equates the theoretical price of the option to its observed market price. This process requires iterative numerical methods,  as the relationship between volatility and option price is nonlinear.

## 1. Introduction to Volatility in Fixed Income Markets

- Volatility is a critical input in the valuation of options and the design of option strategies. It measures the uncertainty or risk associated with changes in the price or yield of a security.
- In fixed income markets,  volatility is expressed in terms of either price or yield,  and it can be measured on an absolute or percentage basis.
- There are two primary types of volatility:
  - **Empirical Volatility**: Historical volatility based on observed market data.
  - **Implied Volatility**: Forward-looking volatility derived from the market prices of options.

## 2. Empirical Volatility

### 2.1 Definition and Calculation

- Empirical volatility is the historical measure of how much a security's price or yield has fluctuated over a specific time period.
- It is calculated as the standard deviation of a time series of daily price or yield changes,  annualized to reflect yearly volatility.

#### 2.1.1 Absolute Volatility
- Absolute volatility is the annualized standard deviation of daily price or yield changes,  assuming a normal distribution.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Absolute Volatility} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\Delta P_i - \bar{\Delta P})^2}{n-1}} \times \sqrt{252}$$
  - Where:
	- $$\Delta P_i$$: Daily price change.
	- $$\bar{\Delta P}$$: Average daily price change.
	- $$n$$: Number of observations.
	- $$252$$: Number of trading days in a year.

#### 2.1.2 Percentage Volatility
- Percentage volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the daily logarithmic changes in price or yield,  assuming a lognormal distribution.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Percentage Volatility} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\ln(P_i / P_{i-1}) - \bar{\ln(P_i / P_{i-1})})^2}{n-1}} \times \sqrt{252}$$
  - Where:
	- $$P_i$$: Price on day $$i$$.
	- $$P_{i-1}$$: Price on the previous day.

### 2.2 Time Periods for Empirical Volatility

- Empirical volatility can be calculated over different time periods,  such as 10 days,  30 days,  or 360 days.
- **Shorter Time Periods**:
  - Reflect current market conditions more accurately.
  - Are more sensitive to recent deviations,  making them less stable.
- **Longer Time Periods**:
  - Provide a smoother measure of volatility.
  - Introduce a lag,  making them less responsive to recent market changes.

#### 2.2.1 Matching Volatility to Option Contracts
- The time period used to calculate empirical volatility should align with the length of the option contract.
- This ensures that the historical volatility reflects the time horizon relevant to the option's expiration.

### 2.3 Converting Between Price and Yield Volatility

- The modified duration of a security provides the link between price and yield volatilities.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Price Volatility} = \text{Yield Volatility} \times \text{Modified Duration}$$
  - Where:
	- **Price Volatility**: Percentage change in price.
	- **Yield Volatility**: Absolute change in yield.
	- **Modified Duration**: Sensitivity of price to yield changes.

#### 2.3.1 Example Conversion
- **Given**:
  - Yield Volatility: 0.50% (annualized).
  - Modified Duration: 5.
- **Calculation**:
 $\text{Price Volatility} = 0.50\% \times 5 = 2.5\%$$

## 3. Implied Volatility

### 3.1 Definition and Importance

- Implied volatility represents the market's expectation of future volatility over the life of an option.
- It is derived from the observed market price of an option by solving the option pricing model for the volatility input.

### 3.2 Calculation of Implied Volatility

- Implied volatility is calculated using iterative numerical methods,  as there is no closed-form solution.
- The process involves:
  1. Inputting the observed market price of the option into an option pricing model (e.g.,  Black-Scholes).
  1. Adjusting the volatility input until the theoretical price matches the observed price.

#### 3.2.1 Example
- **Given**:
  - Observed Call Price: $2.50.
  - Strike Price: $100.
  - Underlying Price: $102.
  - Time to Expiration: 90 days.
  - Risk-Free Rate: 2%.
- **Process**:
  - Use the Black-Scholes model to iteratively solve for the implied volatility that equates the theoretical price to $2.50.

### 3.3 Applications of Implied Volatility

- **Market Sentiment**:
  - Implied volatility reflects the market's expectations of future uncertainty.
  - High implied volatility indicates greater expected price fluctuations.
- **Option Pricing**:
  - Implied volatility is a critical input for pricing options and structuring option strategies.
- **Volatility Arbitrage**:
  - Traders exploit discrepancies between implied and empirical volatility to generate profits.

## 4. Comparing Empirical and Implied Volatility

| **Aspect** | **Empirical Volatility** | **Implied Volatility** |

| **Definition** | Historical measure of past price/yield changes. | Market's expectation of future volatility. |

| **Calculation** | Based on standard deviation of historical data. | Derived from observed option prices. |

| **Time Horizon** | Retrospective (past volatility). | Prospective (future volatility). |

| **Use Case** | Evaluating historical risk. | Pricing options and assessing market sentiment. |

## 5. Practical Applications of Volatility in Fixed Income Markets

### 5.1 Option Pricing and Strategy Design

- Volatility is a key input in option pricing models,  influencing the premium of calls and puts.
- Traders and portfolio managers use volatility to design strategies that align with their market outlook and risk tolerance.

### 5.2 Risk Management

- Understanding volatility helps investors assess the risk of their portfolios and implement appropriate hedging strategies.
- For example,  high volatility may prompt the use of protective puts to limit downside risk.

### 5.3 Volatility Arbitrage

- Traders exploit differences between implied and empirical volatility to identify mispriced options.
- **Example**:
  - If implied volatility is higher than empirical volatility,  traders may sell options to capture the premium.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

- Volatility is a measure of uncertainty in the price or yield of a security and plays a central role in option pricing and strategy design.
- Empirical volatility is based on historical data,  while implied volatility reflects market expectations of future uncertainty.
- The choice of volatility measure depends on the specific application,  such as pricing options,  managing risk,  or designing trading strategies.
- Converting between price and yield volatility requires an understanding of modified duration,  which links the two measures.

By mastering the concepts of empirical and implied volatility,  investors can make informed decisions in the fixed income and options markets,  optimizing their strategies to align with market conditions and their investment objectives.

# Lecture Notes: Interest-Rate Caps,  Floors,  and Participating Structures

## 1. Introduction to Interest-Rate Caps and Floors

- Interest-rate caps and floors are derivative instruments that provide asymmetric interest-rate risk management capabilities,  similar to options.
- **Caps**: Protect against rising interest rates by capping the maximum rate on floating-rate liabilities.
- **Floors**: Protect against falling interest rates by establishing a minimum rate of return on floating-rate assets.
- These instruments are highly customizable,  allowing users to tailor protection to specific needs by selecting parameters such as the underlying index,  strike rate,  term,  settlement frequency,  and notional amount.

## 2. Features of Interest-Rate Caps and Floors

### 2.1 Underlying Index
- The underlying index determines the reference rate for the cap or floor.
- Common indexes include:
  - [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] (e.g.,  3-month LIBOR).
  - Treasury bills.
  - [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 â€“ Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]].
  - Certificates of deposit.
- The maturity of the index (e.g.,  1-month,  3-month,  or 6-month LIBOR) is an additional variable.

### 2.2 Strike Rate
- The strike rate is the threshold rate at which cash flows are exchanged between the purchaser and seller.
- **Caps**:
  - Higher strike rates result in lower premiums because the likelihood of the cap being "in the money" decreases.
- **Floors**:
  - Higher strike rates result in higher premiums because the likelihood of the floor being "in the money" increases.

### 2.3 Term of Protection
- The term of the cap or floor can range from several months to 30 years.
- Liquidity decreases for longer-dated caps and floors,  potentially increasing premiums.

### 2.4 Settlement Frequency
- Settlement frequency determines how often the strike rate is compared to the underlying index.
- Common frequencies include:
  - Monthly.
  - Quarterly.
  - Semiannually.
- Cash flows can be based on:
  - The average daily rate during the settlement period.
  - The spot rate on the settlement date.

### 2.5 Notional Amount
- The notional amount is the principal on which cash flows are calculated.
- Caps and floors can include amortization features to align with the declining balance of an underlying asset (e.g.,  mortgage-backed securities).

## 3. Pricing of Caps and Floors

### 3.1 Upfront Premium
- The upfront premium is the fee paid by the purchaser to the seller at the inception of the contract.
- Factors influencing the premium:
  - Strike rate.
  - Current level of the reference rate.
  - Volatility of the underlying index.
  - Length of the agreement.
  - Notional amount.
  - Special features (e.g.,  amortization,  termination options).

### 3.2 Option Pricing Theory
- Caps and floors are priced using option pricing models,  as they share characteristics with options.
- **Volatility**:
  - Higher volatility increases the premium for both caps and floors.
- **Strike Rate**:
  - Caps: Higher strike rates reduce the premium.
  - Floors: Higher strike rates increase the premium.
- **Term**:
  - Longer terms result in higher premiums due to the increased probability of a positive payoff.
- **Settlement Frequency**:
  - Shorter settlement frequencies result in higher premiums because there are more opportunities for payoffs.

## 4. Example: Interest-Rate Cap

### 4.1 Cap Details
- **Notional Amount**: $10,  000,  000.
- **Underlying Index**: 3-month LIBOR.
- **Maturity**: 3 years.
- **Strike Rate**: 6%.
- **Premium**: 145 basis points (1.45% of $10,   000,   000 = $145,  000).
- **Settlement Frequency**: Quarterly.
- **Day Count**: Actual/360.

### 4.2 Annualized Premium
- The upfront premium can be converted to an annual basis-point equivalent.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Premium funded at 5%.
  - 12 reset periods (quarterly over 3 years).
- **Calculation**:
  - Treat $145,  000 as the present value of a stream of equal quarterly payments.
  - Annualized premium = 52 basis points.

### 4.3 Cap Payments
- Payments are made when the reference rate exceeds the strike rate.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Payment} = (\text{Index Rate} - \text{Strike Rate}) \times \frac{\text{Days in Settlement Period}}{360} \times \text{Notional Amount}$$
- **Example**:
  - 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 7%.
  - Strike Rate = 6%.
  - Days in Settlement Period = 90.
  - Payment:
	$$\text{Payment} = (7\% - 6\%) \times \frac{90}{360} \times 10,   000,   000 = 25,   000$$

### 4.4 Effective Interest Expense
- The effective interest expense includes the amortized premium.
- **Maximum Rate**:
  - Strike Rate + Annualized Premium = 6% + 0.52% = 6.52%.
- **Exhibit 67-1**: Illustrates the capped liability's effective interest expense under various [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] scenarios.

## 5. Participating Caps

### 5.1 Definition
- A participating cap provides full protection against rising rates but requires the buyer to share a percentage of the benefit when rates fall below the strike rate.

### 5.2 Example: Participating Cap
- **Details**:
  - Strike Rate: 7%.
  - Participation Rate: 60%.
- **Scenario**:
  - [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] = 5%.
  - Difference = 7% - 5% = 2%.
  - Participation = 60% Ã— 2% = 1.2%.
  - Effective Interest Expense = [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + Participation = 5% + 1.2% = 6.2%.

### 5.3 Comparison with Non-Participating Cap
- **Bearish Scenarios**:
  - Non-participating caps have higher effective costs due to the amortized premium.
- **Bullish Scenarios**:
  - Participating caps have higher effective costs due to the participation feature.
- **Exhibit 67-3**: Compares effective interest expenses for participating and non-participating caps.

## 6. Participating Cap Structures

### 6.1 Definition
- Participating cap structures combine caps and swaps to hedge floating-rate liabilities.
- Caps are purchased without an upfront fee,  funded by executing an off-market swap at a higher fixed rate.

### 6.2 Example: Participating Cap Structure
- **Details**:
  - Floating Rate: [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + 10 bps.
  - Cap Strike Rate: 7%.
  - Swap Fixed Rate: 5% (off-market).
  - Cap Premium: 200 bps (2% of notional).
  - Present Value of Annuity: 2.76% (based on 0.6% spread over 5 years at 4.4% discount rate).
- **Allocation**:
  - Caps: 58%.
  - Swaps: 42%.
- **Exhibit 67-4**: Illustrates effective interest expenses under various [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] scenarios.

## 7. Interest-Rate Floors

### 7.1 Definition
- Floors protect the rate of return on floating-rate assets by establishing a minimum rate.
- **Example**:
  - Notional Amount: $10,  000,  000.
  - Underlying Index: 3-month Treasury bill.
  - Maturity: 3 years.
  - Strike Rate: 2%.
  - Premium: 85 basis points (0.85% of $10,   000,   000 = $85,  000).
  - Settlement Frequency: Quarterly.
  - Day Count: Actual/360.

### 7.2 Floor Payments
- Payments are made when the reference rate falls below the strike rate.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Payment} = (\text{Strike Rate} - \text{Index Rate}) \times \frac{\text{Days in Settlement Period}}{360} \times \text{Notional Amount}$$

## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 8.1 Caps
- Caps provide protection against rising rates while allowing the buyer to benefit from falling rates.
- The effective interest expense includes the amortized premium,  which increases the cost in low-rate scenarios.

### 8.2 Floors
- Floors protect the rate of return on floating-rate assets in falling-rate scenarios.
- The premium is influenced by the strike rate,  volatility,  and term.

### 8.3 Participating Structures
- Participating caps and swaps offer flexible hedging solutions by combining caps and swaps.
- These structures allow buyers to tailor their liability costs to specific rate scenarios.

By understanding the mechanics and pricing of caps,  floors,  and participating structures,  financial professionals can effectively manage interest-rate risk and optimize funding strategies.

out the credit risk of a corporate bond while retaining exposure to interest rate risk or other factors. This decomposition allows investors to isolate and manage specific risks more effectively.

## 7. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 7.1 Interest-Rate Floors and Caps
- **Interest-Rate Floors**: Provide protection against falling interest rates,  ensuring a minimum return on floating-rate assets. They are beneficial in bullish interest-rate scenarios where asset returns are subject to erosion.
- **Interest-Rate Caps**: Protect against rising interest rates by capping the maximum rate on floating-rate liabilities. They are analogous to buying a strip of put options on interest rates.
- **Cap/Floor Parity**: Similar to put/call parity in options,  cap/floor parity establishes the relationship between caps,  floors,  and interest-rate swaps. The cost of a cap should equal the cost of a floor struck at the same rate on an identical index,  ensuring no arbitrage opportunities.

### 7.2 Interest-Rate Collars and Corridors
- **Interest-Rate Collars**: Combine the purchase of a cap and the sale of a floor to hedge floating-rate liabilities. This strategy limits the liability rate between the floor and cap strike rates,  reducing the cost of protection but sacrificing benefits from market rallies below the floor strike rate.
- **Interest-Rate Corridors**: Involve buying a cap at a lower strike rate and selling a cap at a higher strike rate. This strategy reduces the cost of the lower strike cap while maintaining the benefit of falling interest rates. However,  it introduces risk if rates exceed the higher strike cap.

### 7.3 Credit Derivatives
- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: Allow the transfer of credit risk from one party to another,  providing a tool for hedging or assuming credit exposure. They are widely used by banks,  insurance companies,  hedge funds,  and other market participants.
- **CDS Indices**: Offer a diversified exposure to a portfolio of credits,  simplifying the process of managing macro-level credit risk.
- **Market Evolution**: The CDS market has evolved significantly since its inception,  with standardization efforts by ISDA and regulatory changes improving transparency and reducing systemic risk.

### 7.4 Applications of Credit Derivatives
- **Hedging Credit Risk**: CDS provide an efficient way to hedge credit risk,  replacing the need to short [[Class Notes 2 â€“ Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]].
- **Customization**: The bilateral OTC nature of CDS allows for tailored contracts to meet specific needs.
- **Leverage and Yield Enhancement**: CDS require minimal upfront payments,  enabling leveraged exposure to credit risk.
- **Risk Decomposition**: CDS can isolate credit risk from other risks,  such as interest rate risk,  allowing for more precise risk management.

## 8. Practical Considerations

### 8.1 Risk Management
- Interest-rate derivatives and credit derivatives are powerful tools for managing risk but require careful consideration of market conditions,  counterparty risk,  and liquidity.
- Strategies such as collars and corridors can reduce costs but may introduce additional risks,  particularly in extreme market scenarios.

### 8.2 Regulatory and Market Changes
- The introduction of centralized clearing and standardized contracts has improved the transparency and efficiency of the derivatives market.
- Market participants must stay informed about regulatory developments to ensure compliance and optimize their use of derivatives.

### 8.3 Strategic Use of Derivatives
- Combining interest-rate and credit derivatives can create sophisticated hedging strategies that address multiple risks simultaneously.
- Understanding the interplay between different instruments,  such as caps,  floors,  swaps,  and CDS,  is essential for effective portfolio management.

By mastering the mechanics,  pricing,  and applications of interest-rate and credit derivatives,  financial professionals can enhance their ability to manage risk,  optimize returns,  and navigate complex market environments.

# Lecture Notes: Credit Default Swaps (CDS) â€“ Mechanics,  Pricing,  and Settlement

## 1. Introduction to Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

- A **Credit Default Swap (CDS)** is a financial derivative that allows the transfer of credit risk from one party to another. It functions similarly to an insurance contract but is traded in financial markets and can be valued at any time.
- **Key Participants**:
  - **Protection Buyer**: Pays a premium to transfer the credit risk of a reference entity to the protection seller.
  - **Protection Seller**: Receives the premium and assumes the credit risk of the reference entity.
- **Purpose**:
  - Hedging credit risk.
  - Speculating on creditworthiness.
  - Structuring tailored credit investments.
  - Managing regulatory capital.

## 2. Mechanics of a CDS Contract

### 2.1 Structure of a CDS

- A CDS is a bilateral contract between a protection buyer and a protection seller.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Reference Entity**: The corporate or sovereign issuer whose credit risk is being transferred.
  - **Deliverable Obligations**: Bonds or loans of the reference entity that are covered by the CDS.
  - **Credit Events**: Specific events (e.g.,  bankruptcy,  failure to pay) that trigger the CDS.
  - **Notional Amount**: The face value of the debt being protected.
  - **Premium Leg**: Regular payments made by the protection buyer to the protection seller.
  - **Protection Leg**: Contingent payment made by the protection seller if a credit event occurs.

### 2.2 Premium Leg

- The **premium leg** consists of periodic fixed payments made by the protection buyer to the protection seller.
- **Calculation**:
 $\text{Premium Payment} = \text{Fixed Coupon} \times \text{Notional Amount} \times \text{Year Fraction (Actual/360)}$$
- **Key Features**:
  - Payments terminate after a credit event.
  - Fixed coupons are standardized (e.g.,  100 bps or 500 bps) and do not reflect the credit risk of the reference entity. Instead,  the upfront payment adjusts for credit risk.

### 2.3 Protection Leg

- The **protection leg** is a contingent payment made by the protection seller to the protection buyer if a credit event occurs.
- **Payment Amount**:
 $\text{Protection Payment} = \text{Notional Amount} \times (1 - \text{Recovery Rate})$$
  - **Recovery Rate**: The market-determined value of the deliverable obligations after a credit event.
- **Settlement Methods**:
  - **Cash Settlement**: Protection seller pays the difference between par and the recovery price.
  - **Physical Settlement**: Protection buyer delivers the impaired obligations to the protection seller in exchange for the notional amount.

### 2.4 Upfront Payment

- The **upfront payment** adjusts for the difference between the fixed coupon and the market-implied credit spread of the reference entity.
- **Key Factors**:
  - If the fixed coupon is lower than the market-implied spread,  the protection buyer makes an upfront payment to the protection seller.
  - If the fixed coupon is higher than the market-implied spread,  the protection seller makes an upfront payment to the protection buyer.

## 3. Credit Events in CDS Contracts

### 3.1 Definition of Credit Events

- A **credit event** is a predefined event that triggers the protection leg of a CDS contract.
- **Types of Credit Events**:
  - **Hard Credit Events**: Cause all pari passu debt obligations to trade at the same price.
	- Bankruptcy.
	- Failure to pay.
	- Obligation acceleration.
	- Obligation default.
	- Repudiation/moratorium.
  - **Soft Credit Events**: Do not cause all pari passu debt obligations to trade at the same price.
	- Restructuring.

### 3.2 Restructuring Credit Event

- **Restructuring** refers to a consensual agreement between a reference entity and its creditors to modify debt terms in a way that negatively impacts creditors.
- **Challenges**:
  - Restructuring creates a "delivery option" for the protection buyer,  who can choose the cheapest-to-deliver obligation.
  - This can lead to windfall gains for the protection buyer and larger losses for the protection seller.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Introduction of restructuring clauses:
	- **Old-Restructuring (Old-Re)**: 30-year maturity limit on deliverables.
	- **Modified-Restructuring (Mod-Re)**: Limits deliverables to those maturing within the greater of the CDS termination date or 30 months after the restructuring date.
	- **Modified-Modified Restructuring (Mod-Mod Re)**: Similar to Mod-Re but with a 60-month limit for restructured obligations and a 30-month limit for non-restructured obligations.
	- **No-Restructuring (No-Re)**: Excludes restructuring as a credit event.

## 4. Settlement of CDS Contracts

### 4.1 Auction Process

- The settlement of a CDS contract after a credit event involves determining the recovery price of the deliverable obligations through a market-wide auction.
- **Objectives**:
  1. Prevent short squeezes by ensuring sufficient deliverable obligations.
  1. Establish a common recovery price across the CDS market.
  1. Handle soft restructuring credit events.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Dealers submit bids and offers for the deliverable obligations.
  - The final recovery price is determined based on the auction results.

### 4.2 Settlement Timeline

- **Credit Event Determination**:
  - Before 2009: Bilateral decision based on publicly available information.
  - After 2009: Determined by a centralized determinations committee.
- **Key Dates**:
  - **Effective Date**: Protection begins 60 days before the credit event determination request.
  - **Scheduled Termination Date**: Standardized to March 20,  June 20,  September 20,  or December 20 of the specified year.

## 5. Pricing and Valuation of CDS Contracts

### 5.1 Quoted Spread and Fixed Coupon

- The **quoted spread** reflects the market-implied credit risk of the reference entity.
- The **fixed coupon** is standardized (e.g.,  100 bps or 500 bps) and does not vary with credit risk.
- **Upfront Payment**:
  - Adjusts for the difference between the fixed coupon and the quoted spread.
  - **Example**:
	- Fixed Coupon: 100 bps.
	- Quoted Spread: 160 bps.
	- Upfront Payment: Protection buyer pays the protection seller to compensate for the lower fixed coupon.

### 5.2 Mark-to-Market Valuation

- The value of a CDS contract changes over time due to:
  - Changes in the quoted spread.
  - Changes in interest rates.
- **Key Insight**:
  - A long protection position (buying CDS protection) gains value when the quoted spread widens,  as the cost of protection increases.
  - A short protection position (selling CDS protection) gains value when the quoted spread tightens,  as the cost of protection decreases.

## 6. Applications of CDS

### 6.1 Hedging Credit Risk

- CDS provide an efficient way to hedge credit risk without selling the underlying bonds or loans.
- **Example**:
  - A bank holding [[Class Notes 2 â€“ Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] can buy CDS protection to hedge against default risk.

### 6.2 Speculation

- CDS enable market participants to express views on the creditworthiness of a reference entity.
- **Example**:
  - Buying CDS protection is equivalent to shorting the credit risk of the reference entity.
  - Selling CDS protection is equivalent to going long on the credit risk of the reference entity.

### 6.3 Structured Credit Investments

- CDS can be used as building blocks for structured credit products,  such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
- These products provide tailored risk-return profiles for specific investor needs.

### 6.4 Regulatory Capital Management

- Banks can use CDS to hedge credits with high regulatory capital charges,  provided the hedge is recognized as economically effective by regulators.

## 7. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 7.1 Mechanics of CDS

- A CDS is a bilateral contract that transfers credit risk from the protection buyer to the protection seller.
- The premium leg consists of fixed periodic payments,  while the protection leg is contingent on a credit event.

### 7.2 Credit Events and Settlement

- Credit events trigger the protection leg of a CDS and include bankruptcy,  failure to pay,  and restructuring.
- Settlement involves determining the recovery price through an auction process.

### 7.3 Pricing and Applications

- The upfront payment adjusts for the difference between the fixed coupon and the quoted spread.
- CDS are versatile tools for hedging,  speculation,  structured credit investments,  and regulatory capital management.

By understanding the mechanics,  pricing,  and applications of CDS,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and optimize their investment strategies.

of a portfolio of CDS contracts,  where the premium payments are adjusted for the surviving notional of the reference portfolio.

## 1. Introduction to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Indices

- Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and CDS indices are essential tools in the credit derivatives market,  providing investors with mechanisms to hedge credit risk,  speculate on creditworthiness,  and gain diversified exposure to credit markets.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The mechanics of CDS contracts and indices.
  - The innovations introduced by the 2009 Big Bang Protocol,  including the Determinations Committee (DC) and auction-based settlement.
  - The compression cycle and its role in reducing systemic risk.
  - The structure,  pricing,  and applications of CDS indices.

## 2. The 2009 Big Bang Protocol and Determinations Committee

### 2.1 Introduction of the Determinations Committee (DC)

- The **2009 Big Bang Protocol** introduced a centralized mechanism for determining credit events,  replacing the bilateral process that existed previously.
- **Key Features**:
  - Five regional DCs: Americas,  Asia (excluding Japan),  Japan,  Australia-New Zealand,  and EMEA (Europe,  Middle East,  and Africa).
  - Membership includes both buy-side and sell-side representatives to ensure impartiality.
  - Decisions require an **80% supermajority** for approval.

### 2.2 Credit Event Determination Process

- **Process**:
  1. A market participant submits a request to the DC secretary to investigate a potential credit event.
  1. The request must include publicly available information supporting the claim.
  1. The DC has **two business days** to meet,  investigate,  and vote on whether a credit event has occurred.
  1. If more time is needed,  the DC can vote to extend the investigation period.

- **Outcomes**:
  - For **hard credit events** (e.g.,  bankruptcy,  failure to pay),  CDS contracts are automatically triggered.
  - For **restructuring credit events**,  the protection buyer or seller must choose to trigger the contract.

### 2.3 Restructuring Credit Events

- Restructuring is not an automatic trigger because it is not a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] event and may be a precursor to one.
- **Triggering Rules**:
  - If the protection buyer triggers,  the basket of deliverable obligations corresponds to the CDS contract's scheduled termination date.
  - If the protection seller triggers,  the basket corresponds to the longest maturity (30-year) bucket.
- **Implications**:
  - Both parties prefer the other to trigger due to the differing value of deliverable obligations.
  - The "use it or lose it" rule requires careful timing to avoid missing the triggering deadline.

## 3. The Compression Cycle

### 3.1 Purpose and Mechanics

- The **compression cycle** is a process designed to cancel out mutually offsetting CDS positions,  reducing the number of outstanding contracts and systemic risk.
- **Key Features**:
  - Conducted quarterly across the credit derivatives market.
  - Focuses on contracts held by dealers who choose to participate.
  - Reduces the number of contracts participating in subsequent auctions,  minimizing the need for physical assets.

### 3.2 Role of TriOptima

- TriOptima is the primary provider of compression services.
- **Process**:
  - Dealers submit their positions to TriOptima,  which uses an algorithm to identify offsetting transactions.
  - The algorithm calculates the optimal set of transactions to minimize outstanding contracts.
  - Dealers can choose whether to execute the proposed transactions.
- **Impact**:
  - Between 2008 and 2010,  the compression process eliminated approximately **$14.5 trillion** of credit derivative contracts.

## 4. Settlement of CDS Contracts

### 4.1 Auction Process

- The auction process determines the recovery price of deliverable obligations after a credit event.
- **Stages**:
  - **Stage One**: Determines the indicative recovery price (Internal Market Midpoint Price,  IMMP) and net open interest.
  - **Stage Two**: Matches net open interest with market participants to establish the final auction price.

### 4.2 Stage One: Indicative Recovery Price

- **Process**:
  - Dealers submit bid/offer prices and physical settlement requests.
  - An algorithm calculates the IMMP by rejecting outliers and averaging the remaining bid/offer spreads.
  - The IMMP is rounded to the nearest 1/8th of a point.
- **Net Open Interest**:
  - Represents the aggregate demand for physical settlement.
  - Determines the size and direction of the demand for deliverable obligations.

### 4.3 Stage Two: Final Auction Price

- **Process**:
  - Participants submit limit orders to buy or sell deliverable obligations.
  - An order-matching algorithm fills the net open interest,  starting with the most competitive prices.
  - The final auction price is constrained to be within a specified range (cap amount) of the IMMP.
- **Settlement**:
  - The final auction price is used to settle all CDS contracts,  including both cash and physical settlements.

## 5. CDS Indices

### 5.1 Overview

- CDS indices provide diversified exposure to credit markets and are widely used for hedging and speculative purposes.
- **Key Features**:
  - Equally weighted at issuance for simplicity and diversification.
  - Issued semiannually with multiple maturities (e.g.,  1,  3,  5,  7,  and 10 years).
  - Most liquid series is the "on-the-run" index.

### 5.2 Standard CDS Indices

| **Name** | **Domicile and Type of Credits** | **Number of Credits** |

| **CDX.NA.IG** | North American investment-grade | 125 |

| **CDX.NA.HY** | North American high-yield | 100 |

| **CDX.NA.XO** | North American crossover | 35 |

| **CDX.EM** | Emerging market sovereign | 15 |

| **CDX.EM.Diversified** | Emerging market sovereign/corporate | 40 |

| **iTraxx Europe** | European investment-grade | 125 |

| **iTraxx Europe XO** | European crossover | 40 |

| **iTraxx Japan** | Japanese investment-grade | 50 |

| **iTraxx Asia ex-Japan**| Asian non-Japanese investment-grade | 50 |

| **iTraxx Australia** | Australian investment-grade | 25 |

### 5.3 Mechanics of CDS Indices

- **Premium Leg**:
  - The buyer pays a fixed coupon based on the surviving notional of the reference portfolio.
  - The surviving notional decreases as credits in the portfolio experience credit events.
- **Protection Leg**:
  - The seller compensates the buyer for losses due to credit events,  based on the recovery rate of defaulted credits.

## 6. Applications of CDS and CDS Indices

### 6.1 Hedging Credit Risk

- CDS and CDS indices provide efficient tools for hedging credit risk in individual credits or broad portfolios.
- **Example**:
  - A bank can hedge its exposure to a portfolio of [[Class Notes 2 â€“ Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] by buying protection on a CDS index.

### 6.2 Speculation and Arbitrage

- CDS indices allow investors to express views on credit markets or exploit mispricings.
- **Example**:
  - Selling protection on a CDS index is equivalent to taking a long position on the creditworthiness of the reference portfolio.

### 6.3 Regulatory Capital Management

- Banks use CDS to reduce regulatory capital requirements by transferring credit risk to third parties.

## 7. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 7.1 Innovations in the CDS Market

- The 2009 Big Bang Protocol introduced centralized credit event determination and auction-based settlement,  improving transparency and efficiency.
- The compression cycle has significantly reduced systemic risk by eliminating redundant contracts.

### 7.2 CDS Indices

- CDS indices provide diversified credit exposure and are widely used for hedging and speculative purposes.
- The mechanics of CDS indices mirror those of individual CDS contracts,  with adjustments for the surviving notional of the reference portfolio.

By understanding the mechanics,  pricing,  and applications of CDS and CDS indices,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and optimize their investment strategies.

# Lecture Notes: Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and CDS Indices â€“ Mechanics,  Valuation,  and Risk Management

## 1. Introduction to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and CDS Indices

- Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial derivatives that allow the transfer of credit risk from one party to another. They are widely used for hedging,  speculation,  and structured credit investments.
- CDS indices are portfolios of CDS contracts that provide diversified exposure to credit markets,  enabling investors to hedge or speculate on macro-level credit risk efficiently.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The mechanics of CDS and CDS indices.
  - Valuation methodologies for CDS contracts.
  - The relationship between CDS and bond markets.
  - Risk management and trading strategies involving CDS and CDS indices.

## 2. Mechanics of CDS Contracts

### 2.1 Key Features of CDS Contracts

- **Protection Buyer**: Pays a regular premium (fixed coupon) to the protection seller in exchange for protection against credit events.
- **Protection Seller**: Receives the premium and compensates the buyer if a credit event occurs.
- **Reference Entity**: The corporate or sovereign issuer whose credit risk is being transferred.
- **Credit Events**: Events that trigger the protection leg,  such as bankruptcy,  failure to pay,  obligation acceleration,  repudiation/moratorium,  and restructuring.
- **Notional Amount**: The face value of the debt being protected.

### 2.2 Premium Leg

- The premium leg consists of regular fixed payments made by the protection buyer to the protection seller.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Premium Payment} = \text{Fixed Coupon} \times \text{Notional Amount} \times \text{Year Fraction (Actual/360)}$$
- Payments continue until the contract matures or a credit event occurs.
- If a credit event occurs between two payment dates,  the accrued portion of the premium is paid by the protection buyer.

### 2.3 Protection Leg

- The protection leg is a contingent payment made by the protection seller to the protection buyer if a credit event occurs.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{Protection Payment} = \text{Notional Amount} \times (1 - \text{Recovery Rate})$$
  - **Recovery Rate**: The market-determined value of the deliverable obligations after a credit event.
- Settlement can be:
  - **Cash Settlement**: The seller pays the difference between par and the recovery price.
  - **Physical Settlement**: The buyer delivers the impaired obligations to the seller in exchange for the notional amount.

### 2.4 Upfront Payment

- The upfront payment adjusts for the difference between the fixed coupon and the market-implied credit spread of the reference entity.
- **Key Insights**:
  - If the fixed coupon is lower than the market-implied spread,  the protection buyer makes an upfront payment to the seller.
  - If the fixed coupon is higher than the market-implied spread,  the seller makes an upfront payment to the buyer.

## 3. Mechanics of CDS Indices

### 3.1 Premium Leg of CDS Indices

- The premium leg of a CDS index is equivalent to a portfolio of CDS premium legs linked to each reference credit in the index.
- All reference credits pay a fixed coupon equal to the index coupon.
- Payments continue until the contract matures or all credits in the index experience credit events (an unlikely scenario).

### 3.2 Protection Leg of CDS Indices

- The protection leg of a CDS index mirrors that of an equally weighted portfolio of CDS protection legs on the reference credits.
- **Process for Credit Events**:
  1. The affected credit is removed from the index across all maturities.
  1. The index is assigned a new version number to distinguish it from earlier versions.
  1. The removed credit becomes a standalone CDS position with a notional corresponding to its size in the index.
	 - Example: If the index notional is $10 million and there are 125 credits,    the standalone CDS notional is $80,  000.
  1. The standalone CDS participates in the standard auction process to determine the recovery rate.

### 3.3 Restructuring Credit Events in CDS Indices

- If the credit event is a restructuring:
  - The index buyer and seller can choose to trigger the standalone CDS contract.
  - If neither party triggers,  the standalone CDS remains on their books until maturity or a subsequent credit event.
  - Restructuring is excluded as a credit event in North American indices but included in European and Asian indices.

## 4. Valuation of CDS Contracts

### 4.1 Expected Present Value of Cash Flows

- The value of a CDS contract is the expected present value of future cash flows,  calculated under the risk-neutral measure.
- **Premium Leg Value**:
  - The expected present value of fixed coupon payments until maturity or a credit event.
  - Falls if the credit quality deteriorates,  as fewer coupons are expected to be received.
- **Protection Leg Value**:
  - The expected present value of the contingent payment (par minus recovery rate) in the event of default.
  - Increases if the credit quality deteriorates,  as the likelihood of default rises.

### 4.2 No-Arbitrage Relationship Between CDS and Bonds

- There is a fundamental no-arbitrage relationship between the upfront cost of a CDS and the price of a floating-rate bond issued by the same reference entity.
- **Key Insight**:
  - The upfront cost of a CDS equals the difference between par and the bond price,  adjusted for accrued interest and recovery assumptions.
- **Simplifying Assumptions**:
  1. The bond is funded at [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] flat.
  1. The bond pays a floating rate coupon equal to [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] plus the CDS fixed spread.
  1. The credit event occurs on a coupon payment date.

### 4.3 The CDS Basis

- The CDS basis is the difference between the CDS par spread and the bond [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spread.
- **Formula**:
 $\text{CDS Basis} = \text{CDS Par Spread} - \text{Bond [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spread}$$
- **Applications**:
  - Basis trading involves exploiting discrepancies between CDS spreads and bond spreads.
  - A "negative basis trade" involves buying the bond and buying CDS protection,  earning the bond spread while paying the CDS spread.

## 5. Risk Management and Trading Strategies

### 5.1 Hedging Credit Risk

- CDS contracts provide an efficient way to hedge credit risk without selling the underlying bonds or loans.
- **Example**:
  - A bank holding [[Class Notes 2 â€“ Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] can buy CDS protection to hedge against default risk.

### 5.2 Speculation and Arbitrage

- CDS contracts enable investors to express views on the creditworthiness of a reference entity.
- **Example**:
  - Buying CDS protection is equivalent to shorting the credit risk of the reference entity.
  - Selling CDS protection is equivalent to going long on the credit risk of the reference entity.

### 5.3 Valuation of Existing CDS Contracts

- The mark-to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the expected present value of the premium leg and the protection leg.
- **Formula**:
 $U(t) = V_{\text{Premium}}(t,  T) - V_{\text{Protection}}(t,  T)$$
  - Where:
	- $$U(t)$$: Mark-to-market value at time $$t$$.
	- $$V_{\text{Premium}}(t,    T)$$: Value of the premium leg.
	- $$V_{\text{Protection}}(t,    T)$$: Value of the protection leg.

## 6. Importance of the CDS Market

### 6.1 Post-2008 Reforms

- The CDS market underwent significant reforms after the 2008 financial crisis to improve transparency,  reduce systemic risk,  and ensure market-wide settlement mechanisms.
- **Key Changes**:
  - Introduction of centralized counterparties (CCPs) to reduce counterparty risk.
  - Standardized auction processes for credit event settlement.
  - Increased transparency through data publication by the DTCC.

### 6.2 Applications of CDS and CDS Indices

- **Hedging**: Protect against credit losses on individual credits or portfolios.
- **Speculation**: Express views on creditworthiness or market-wide credit risk.
- **Yield Enhancement**: Earn premiums by selling protection.
- **Regulatory Capital Management**: Reduce capital requirements by transferring credit risk.

## 7. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 7.1 CDS Contracts

- CDS contracts transfer credit risk from the protection buyer to the protection seller.
- The value of a CDS contract depends on the expected present value of the premium and protection legs.

### 7.2 CDS Indices

- CDS indices provide diversified exposure to credit markets and are widely used for hedging and speculative purposes.
- The mechanics of CDS indices mirror those of individual CDS contracts,  with adjustments for the surviving notional of the reference portfolio.

### 7.3 Risk Management

- CDS contracts and indices are versatile tools for managing credit risk,  enabling investors to hedge,  speculate,  and optimize their portfolios.
- Basis trading and other strategies exploit discrepancies between CDS and bond markets.

By mastering the mechanics,  valuation,  and applications of CDS and CDS indices,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and enhance portfolio performance.

# Lecture Notes: Credit Default Swaps (CDS) â€“ Par Spreads,  Flat Quoted Spreads,  and Valuation

## 1. Introduction to Par Spreads and Flat Quoted Spreads

- **Par Spread ($S(t,    T)$)**: The par spread is the coupon rate on a CDS contract that results in no upfront cost at inception. It is the spread that equates the present value of the premium leg to the present value of the protection leg.
- **Flat Quoted Spread ($\bar{\mathcal{S}}(t,    T)$)**: The flat quoted spread is the level of a flat CDS par spread curve that matches the model-implied upfront value to the market-quoted upfront value. It assumes a flat term structure of spreads and is analogous to the bond yield-to-maturity.

### 1.1 Key Differences Between Par Spreads and Flat Quoted Spreads

- **Par Spread**:
  - Requires knowledge of the full term structure of par spreads for accurate valuation.
  - Cannot be used to imply a term structure of spreads from a single upfront value.
  - Was the market standard until 2010.
- **Flat Quoted Spread**:
  - Assumes a flat spread curve,  simplifying the valuation process.
  - Provides a one-to-one mapping between the quoted flat spread and the upfront cost of a CDS contract.
  - Has become the market standard since 2010 due to its simplicity and ease of use.

### 1.2 Relationship Between Par Spreads and Flat Quoted Spreads

- If the term structure of par spreads is flat,  the par spread and flat quoted spread are equal for all maturities.
- If the term structure is not flat,  the flat quoted spread provides an approximation that ignores the shape of the term structure.

## 2. Valuation Model for CDS Contracts

### 2.1 Requirements for the Model

The valuation model for CDS contracts must satisfy the following:

1. Capture credit events as single events that can occur at any future time.
1. Account for the timing of defaults and allow for a term structure of default probabilities.
1. Incorporate the payment of par minus the recovery rate following a credit event.
1. Reprice the term structure of market prices exactly.
1. Be fast to calibrate and compute.

### 2.2 Survival Probability ($Q(T)$)

- **Definition**: The survival probability $Q(T)$ is the probability that the reference entity survives without experiencing a credit event from today (time 0) to time $T$.
- **Properties**:
  - $Q(T)$ is a constant or decreasing function of $T$.
  - $Q(T)$ lies between 0 and 1.

## 3. Valuation of the Premium Leg

### 3.1 Premium Leg Formula

The premium leg represents the expected present value of the fixed coupon payments made by the protection buyer. It is given by:

$$
V_{\text{Premium}} = C(T) \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta(t_{i-1},    t_i) Z(t_i) Q(t_i)
$$

Where:

- $C(T)$: Fixed coupon (par spread or quoted spread).
- $\Delta(t_{i-1},    t_i)$: Year fraction between coupon payment dates.
- $Z(t_i)$: Discount factor at time $t_i$.
- $Q(t_i)$: Survival probability at time $t_i$.

### 3.2 Accrued Coupon Adjustment

- If a credit event occurs between coupon payment dates,  the accrued coupon must be accounted for.
- **Accrued Coupon Contribution**:
 $
  \frac{C(T)}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta(t_{i-1},    t_i) Z(t_i) (Q(t_{i-1}) - Q(t_i))
 $

### 3.3 Total Premium Leg Value

Combining the regular coupon payments and the accrued coupon adjustment,  the total premium leg value is:

$$
V_{\text{Premium}} = \frac{C(T)}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta(t_{i-1},    t_i) Z(t_i) (Q(t_i) + Q(t_{i-1}))
$$

This can be rewritten as:

$$
V_{\text{Premium}} = C(T) A(T)
$$

Where:

- $A(T)$: Risky annuity,  representing the expected present value of the premium leg assuming an annualized coupon of $C(T)$.

## 4. Valuation of the Protection Leg

### 4.1 Protection Leg Formula

The protection leg represents the expected present value of the contingent payment made by the protection seller in the event of a credit event. It is given by:

$$
V_{\text{Protection}} = (1 - R) \sum_{n=1}^M Z(t_n) (Q(t_{n-1}) - Q(t_n))
$$

Where:

- $R$: Recovery rate (assumed to be 40% for senior unsecured debt).
- $Q(t_{n-1}) - Q(t_n)$: Probability of default between $t_{n-1}$ and $t_n$.

## 5. Upfront Cost of a CDS Contract

### 5.1 Definition

The upfront cost $U(0)$ is the cost paid by the protection buyer to enter into a CDS contract. It is the difference between the protection leg value and the premium leg value:

$$
U(0) = V_{\text{Protection}} - V_{\text{Premium}}
$$

Substituting the expressions for $V_{\text{Protection}}$ and $V_{\text{Premium}}$:

$$
U(0) = (1 - R) \sum_{n=1}^M Z(t_n) (Q(t_{n-1}) - Q(t_n)) - C(T) A(T)
$$

### 5.2 Relationship Between Upfront Cost and Par Spread

The par spread $S(T)$ is the coupon rate that makes the upfront cost zero:

$$
S(T) A(T) = V_{\text{Protection}}
$$

For a CDS contract with a fixed coupon $C(T)$,  the upfront cost is:

$$
U(0) = (S(T) - C(T)) A(T)
$$

### 5.3 Relationship Between Upfront Cost and Flat Quoted Spread

For a flat quoted spread $\bar{\mathcal{S}}(T)$,  the upfront cost is:

$$
U(0) = (\bar{\mathcal{S}}(T) - C(T)) \bar{A}(T)
$$

Where $\bar{A}(T)$ is the risky annuity calculated using the flat quoted spread.

## 6. Calibration of the Survival Curve

### 6.1 Forward Default Rate ($h(t)$)

- The survival probability $Q(T)$ is expressed in terms of the continuously compounded forward default rate $h(t)$:

$$
Q(T) = \exp\left(-\int_0^T h(t) dt\right)
$$

- A piecewise flat term structure of $h(t)$ is commonly used for calibration.

### 6.2 Bootstrap Calibration

The calibration process involves determining the values of $h(t)$ that match the model-implied upfront values to the market-quoted upfront values for CDS contracts of different maturities.

1. Start with the shortest maturity (e.g.,  6 months) and solve for $h(0.5)$.
1. Use $h(0.5)$ to solve for $h(1.0)$ using the 1-year CDS upfront value.
1. Repeat for longer maturities.

## 7. Risk Management: Spread DV01

### 7.1 Definition

The Spread DV01 measures the sensitivity of the upfront value of a CDS contract to a 1 basis point parallel shift in the CDS spread curve:

$$
\text{Spread DV01} = U(t,    S + 1 \text{bp}) - U(t,    S)
$$

### 7.2 Components of Spread DV01

1. **Primary Term**:
   - Change in the upfront value due to the change in spread:
  $ -A(T,  S + 1 \text{bp}) \cdot 1 \text{bp} $$

1. **Secondary Term**:
   - Change in the risky annuity due to the change in spread:
  $ (S - C) \cdot (A(T,  S) - A(T,  S + 1 \text{bp})) $$

### 7.3 Applications

- Spread DV01 is used to hedge CDS positions against parallel shifts in the spread curve.
- Effective for contracts with similar maturities,  as it assumes parallel shifts in the spread curve.

## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 8.1 Par Spreads and Flat Quoted Spreads

- Par spreads require knowledge of the full term structure of spreads,  while flat quoted spreads assume a flat curve and simplify valuation.

### 8.2 Valuation of CDS Contracts

- The premium leg and protection leg are valued using survival probabilities,  discount factors,  and recovery rates.
- The upfront cost is the difference between the protection leg value and the premium leg value.

### 8.3 Risk Management

- Spread DV01 measures the sensitivity of a CDS contract to changes in the spread curve and is a key tool for hedging credit risk.

By understanding the mechanics,  valuation,  and risk management of CDS contracts,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and optimize their portfolios.

# Lecture Notes: Interest Rate Duration of a CDS and CDS Index Valuation

## 1. Introduction to Interest Rate Sensitivity of a CDS

- The **interest rate sensitivity** of a CDS contract is measured by its **IR DV01** (Interest Rate Dollar Value of 01). This metric quantifies the change in the upfront value of the CDS for a 1 basis point (bp) parallel upward shift in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] curve,  while keeping the par spread curve fixed.
- The IR DV01 is derived from the dependency of the CDS valuation on the **risky annuity**,  which is the present value of future premium payments.

### 1.1 Formula for IR DV01

The IR DV01 is given by:

$$
\text{IR DV01} = (C - S) \cdot \left(A^*(T) - A(T)\right)
$$

Where:

- \(C\): Deal spread (fixed coupon of the CDS).
- \(S\): Quoted spread (flat spread reflecting the credit risk of the reference entity).
- \(A(T)\): Risky annuity calculated using the original interest rate curve.
- \(A^*(T)\): Risky annuity calculated using the bumped interest rate curve.

### 1.2 Key Observations

1. **Sign of IR DV01**:
   - If \(C = S\),  the IR DV01 is zero because the CDS is priced at par.
   - If \(C > S\),  the IR DV01 is positive because the CDS buyer is overpaying for protection,  and the value of the risky annuity decreases with higher rates.
   - If \(C < S\),  the IR DV01 is negative because the CDS buyer is underpaying for protection,  and the value of the risky annuity decreases with higher rates.

1. **Magnitude of IR DV01**:
   - The interest rate sensitivity of a CDS is generally low compared to a fixed-rate corporate bond with the same maturity. This is because:
	 - A CDS is effectively a credit-risky annuity with annualized coupon payments of \((C - S)\).
	 - Unlike a bond,  a CDS does not involve a par payment at maturity.

1. **Comparison to Floating-Rate Notes**:
   - The interest rate sensitivity of a CDS closely resembles that of a par floating-rate note issued by the reference entity,  as both instruments are primarily driven by credit spreads rather than interest rates.

## 2. Example: IR DV01 of a CDS Contract

### 2.1 CDS Contract Details (Exhibit 69-5)

| **Parameter** | **Value** |

| Notional | $10,  000,  000 |

| Trade Date | February 3,  2011 |

| Maturity | March 20,  2016 |

| Deal Spread (\(C\)) | 100 bp |

| Quoted Spread (\(S\)) | 34.32 bp |

| Recovery Rate | 40% |

| IR DV01 | $84.26 |

### 2.2 Explanation of Valuation Outputs

1. **Price**:
   - The "clean" price of the CDS excludes accrued interest and represents the value of the contract for a protection seller who buys the CDS along with a par [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] floating-rate note.

1. **Principal**:
   - The clean value of the contract,  excluding accrued interest. For this CDS,  the principal value is \(-\$322,  035\).

1. **Accrued Interest**:
   - The accrued coupon since the last payment date (December 20,  2010) is \(-\$12,  778\),  reflecting 46 days of a 100 bp coupon.

1. **Cash Amount**:
   - The actual upfront payment required to enter the contract is \(-\$334,  813\). This reflects the compensation to the protection buyer for paying a deal spread (\(C = 100\) bp) higher than the quoted spread (\(S = 34.32\) bp).

1. **Spread DV01**:
   - The spread sensitivity of the CDS is \$5,  036.41,  meaning a 1 bp increase in the quoted spread curve increases the value of the CDS by this amount.

1. **IR DV01**:
   - The interest rate sensitivity of the CDS is \$84.26,  which is much smaller than the spread DV01,  highlighting that the CDS is primarily a credit-spread product.

## 3. Risky Annuity and Approximation for CDS Valuation

### 3.1 Risky Annuity Formula

The risky annuity \(A(T)\) is the present value of future premium payments,  adjusted for survival probabilities and discount factors. For a simplified approximation:

$$
A(\bar{S},    T) = \frac{1 - \exp\left(-\left(W + \frac{\bar{S}}{1 - R}\right)T\right)}{W + \frac{\bar{S}}{1 - R}} \cdot \frac{365}{360}
$$

Where:

- \(W\): Swap rate to the contract maturity.
- \(\bar{S}\): Quoted spread.
- \(R\): Recovery rate.
- \(T\): Time to maturity.

### 3.2 Example Calculation

Using the CDS details from Exhibit 69-5:

- Quoted spread (\(\bar{S}\)): 34.32 bp.
- Time to maturity (\(T\)): 5.122 years.
- Swap rate (\(W\)): 2.4%.
- Recovery rate (\(R\)): 40%.

The risky annuity is:

$$
A(\bar{S},    T) = \frac{1 - \exp\left(-\left(0.024 + \frac{0.003432}{1 - 0.4}\right) \cdot 5.122\right)}{0.024 + \frac{0.003432}{1 - 0.4}} \cdot \frac{365}{360} = 4.81764
$$

### 3.3 Upfront Value Calculation

The upfront value of the CDS is:

$$
U(t) = \left(\bar{S} - C\right) \cdot A(\bar{S},    T) - \text{Accrued Coupon}
$$

Substituting the values:

- \(\bar{S} = 34.32\) bp,  \(C = 100\) bp,  \(A(\bar{S},  T) = 4.81764\),  and accrued coupon = \(-\$12,  778\):

$$
U(t) = 10,   000,   000 \cdot \frac{(34.32 - 100)}{10,   000} \cdot 4.81764 - 12,   778 = -\$329,   992
$$

This is within 1.5% of the Bloomberg-calculated cash amount (\(-\$334,  813\)).

## 4. CDS Index Valuation

### 4.1 Mechanics of a CDS Index

- A CDS index is equivalent to a portfolio of CDS contracts on multiple reference credits,  each paying the same index coupon (\(C_I(T)\)).
- Credit events result in the removal of affected credits from the index,  with loss payments made as they occur.

### 4.2 Valuation Formula

The value of a CDS index for a protection seller is:

$$
V^{\text{Index}} = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{p=1}^P \left(C_I(T) - S_p(T)\right) A_p(T)
$$

Where:

- \(P\): Number of reference credits in the index.
- \(C_I(T)\): Index coupon.
- \(S_p(T)\): Par spread of reference credit \(p\).
- \(A_p(T)\): Risky annuity of reference credit \(p\).

### 4.3 Simplified Valuation Using Quoted Spread

For practical purposes,  the CDS index is treated as a single CDS contract with a flat quoted spread (\(\bar{S}_I(T)\)):

$$
V^{\text{Index}} = \left(C_I(T) - \bar{S}_I(T)\right) \bar{A}_I(T)
$$

Where:

- \(\bar{A}_I(T)\): Risky annuity of the index.

### 4.4 Risk Management

- The price sensitivities of a CDS index are identical to those of a single-name CDS with the same term structure of spreads,  recovery rate,  and maturity.
- The **CDS Index Basis** measures the difference between the index spread and the weighted average spread of its constituents. Deviations may arise due to market technical factors or restructuring clauses.

## 5. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 5.1 Interest Rate Sensitivity of a CDS

- The IR DV01 measures the sensitivity of a CDS to changes in interest rates and is generally low compared to its spread sensitivity (Spread DV01).
- The IR DV01 is positive if \(C > S\),  negative if \(C < S\),  and zero if \(C = S\).

### 5.2 CDS Valuation

- The upfront value of a CDS depends on the quoted spread,  deal spread,  risky annuity,  and accrued coupon.
- Simplified approximations can provide valuations within 1.5% of Bloomberg-calculated results.

### 5.3 CDS Index Valuation

- A CDS index is valued as though it were a single CDS contract,  simplifying risk management and pricing.
- The CDS Index Basis reflects deviations between the index spread and the weighted average spread of its constituents.

By understanding the mechanics,  valuation,  and risk management of CDS and CDS indices,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and optimize their portfolios.

# Lecture Notes: Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and Performance Attribution

## 1. Introduction to Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

- Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are financial derivatives that allow the transfer of credit risk from one party to another. They are widely used for hedging,  speculation,  and structured credit investments.
- Since the introduction of fixed coupons for CDS contracts in 2009,  entering into a CDS contract almost always involves an upfront cash payment,  which can be positive or negative depending on the relationship between the fixed coupon and the market-implied credit spread.

### 1.1 Key Features of CDS Contracts

- **Protection Buyer**: Pays a regular premium (fixed coupon) to the protection seller in exchange for protection against credit events.
- **Protection Seller**: Receives the premium and compensates the buyer if a credit event occurs.
- **Upfront Payment**: The size and sign of the upfront payment depend on whether the fixed coupon sufficiently compensates the protection seller for the market-perceived risk of a credit event.
  - If the fixed coupon is low,  the protection seller may receive cash at trade initiation.
  - If the fixed coupon is high,  the protection seller may have to pay cash at trade initiation.
  - The situation is reversed for the protection buyer.

### 1.2 Purpose of CDS Valuation

- The primary goal of CDS valuation is to calculate the upfront cash payment required to enter the contract.
- This requires a model that:
  - Accounts for the probability and timing of a credit event.
  - Values the premium leg,  considering the risk that not all coupons will be paid.
  - Values the protection leg,  which involves the unknown payment of par minus recovery at the time of a credit event.
  - Flexibly reprices the term structure of quoted market spreads.

### 1.3 Market Quotes: Par Spread and Flat Quoted Spread

- **CDS Par Spread**:
  - The par spread is the coupon rate that results in a zero upfront value for the CDS contract on the trade date.
  - The value of a CDS is a function of the term structure of CDS par spreads.
- **Flat Quoted Spread**:
  - Introduced in 2011,  the flat quoted spread assumes a flat term structure of par spreads that reprices the market-quoted upfront value.
  - Only one quoted spread is needed to value a CDS contract,  simplifying the valuation process.

### 1.4 Forward-Looking Nature of CDS Spreads

- The probability of a CDS experiencing a credit event,  as implied by market spreads,  usually exceeds the historical default probability for credits with the same initial rating.
- This is because CDS spreads are forward-looking and embed a risk premium.

### 1.5 Sensitivity Analysis

- CDS valuation models allow holders to calculate the sensitivity of the contract's value to changes in the quoted spread.
- This enables hedging with other CDS contracts or instruments.

### 1.6 CDS Indices

- For valuation purposes,  a CDS index can be treated as a single-name CDS and valued using the same model.
- CDS indices provide diversified exposure to credit markets and are widely used for hedging and speculative purposes.

## 2. Principles of Performance Attribution

- Performance attribution is a mathematical framework that splits the total outperformance of a portfolio versus a benchmark into contributions from individual decisions and actions.
- It helps quantify the contributions of decision-makers,  identify structural issues,  and clarify sources of portfolio risk and performance.

### 2.1 Key Requirements of Performance Attribution

1. **Additivity**: The contribution of two or more agents combined equals the sum of their individual contributions.
1. **Completeness**: The sum of all contributions equals the total portfolio outperformance.
1. **Fairness**: The allocation of outperformance to different agents is perceived as fair.

### 2.2 Multi-Period Attribution and Compounding

- Performance attribution over multiple periods must account for dynamic portfolio management and compounding effects.
- **Time-Weighted vs. Money-Weighted Returns**:
  - Time-weighted returns ignore portfolio size and are appropriate for managers without control over cash flows.
  - Money-weighted returns account for cash flows and are suitable for managers responsible for timing cash flows.
- **Example**:
  - A portfolio with a seed investment of $1,   000,   000 doubles in value in the first half of the year but loses 10% in the second half after attracting $100,  000,  000 in new investments.
  - Time-weighted return: 80%.
  - Money-weighted return: -17.24%.

### 2.3 Attribution Frequency

- The frequency of the attribution system should match the frequency of portfolio management decisions.
- Fixed income portfolios often require daily-frequency attribution models due to their dynamic interest-rate exposures.

### 2.4 Flexibility of Attribution Models

- A practical attribution system must:
  - Measure risk factors corresponding to portfolio manager decisions.
  - Independently measure contributions of each factor.
  - Align with published returns of the fund and its benchmark.
  - Be timely and adaptable to short and long time periods.

## 3. Sector-Based Attribution

- Sector-based attribution decomposes portfolio outperformance into:
  1. **[[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]**: Outperformance due to differences in sector weights between the portfolio and benchmark.
  1. **Security Selection**: Outperformance due to differences in returns within each sector.
  1. **Interaction Effect**: Joint effect of [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]] and security selection.

### 3.1 Mathematical Framework

- Portfolio return:
 $R^P = \sum_s w_s^P R_s^P$$
- Benchmark return:
 $R^B = \sum_s w_s^B R_s^B$$
- Total outperformance:
 $R^P - R^B = \text{Asset Allocation} + \text{Security Selection} + \text{Interaction}$$
- [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]:
 $\sum_s (w_s^P - w_s^B) \cdot R_s^B$$
- Security Selection:
 $\sum_s w_s^B \cdot (R_s^P - R_s^B)$$
- Interaction:
 $\sum_s (w_s^P - w_s^B) \cdot (R_s^P - R_s^B)$$

### 3.2 Recursive Allocation

- Large portfolios often involve multiple layers of management,  requiring recursive application of the attribution framework.
- Each sector can be treated as a smaller portfolio,  with its performance further decomposed into [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]] and security selection.

## 4. Factor-Based Attribution

- Factor-based attribution decomposes portfolio returns into contributions from common risk factors (e.g.,  interest rates,  spreads,  volatility) and a residual.
- **Mathematical Framework**:
 $R^P = \sum_k \alpha_k^P f_k^P + \varepsilon^P$$
 $R^P - R^B = \sum_k (\alpha_k^P - \alpha_k^B) \cdot f_k^P + (\varepsilon^P - \varepsilon^B)$$
- **Advantages**:
  - Explains systematic returns using risk factors.
  - Residual returns are idiosyncratic and small for well-diversified portfolios.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited flexibility in defining risk factors.
  - Does not attribute idiosyncratic returns to security selection.

## 5. Hybrid Performance Attribution

- The hybrid model combines sector-based and factor-based attribution,  offering flexibility to account for complex management structures.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Return Splitting**: Decompose total returns into factor contributions.
  1. **Factor Return Attribution**: Attribute outperformance to individual factors.
  1. **Recursive Application**: Apply the framework recursively to different management layers.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 6.1 Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

- CDS contracts involve upfront payments that depend on the relationship between the fixed coupon and market-implied credit spreads.
- Valuation models calculate the expected present value of the premium and protection legs,  accounting for credit event probabilities and timing.

### 6.2 Performance Attribution

- Performance attribution splits portfolio outperformance into contributions from [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]],  security selection,  and risk factors.
- Sector-based and factor-based attribution frameworks can be combined into a hybrid model to address the complexity of modern portfolio management.

By mastering CDS valuation and performance attribution principles,  financial professionals can effectively manage credit risk and optimize portfolio performance.

- Performance attribution is a systematic framework used to decompose portfolio outperformance into contributions from various factors,  decisions,  and exposures.
- It provides insights into the sources of risk and return,  linking ex-post performance to ex-ante management decisions.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - Factor return attribution.
  - Recursive decomposition of outperformance.
  - Applications of performance attribution as a portfolio management tool.
  - A detailed example of hybrid performance attribution using a fixed-income portfolio.

## 2. Factor Return Attribution

### 2.1 Common and Allocated Factors

- Factors are categorized into **common factors** and **allocated factors**:
  - **Common Factors**: Shared across the portfolio and benchmark,  such as yield curve exposure or duration.
  - **Allocated Factors**: Specific to individual securities or sectors,  such as credit spreads or security selection.
- The total portfolio outperformance is expressed as:

$$
R^{P} - R^{B} = \left(\sum_{k \in C} \alpha_{k}^{P} f_{k}^{P} - \sum_{k \in C} \alpha_{k}^{B} f_{k}^{B}\right) + \left(\sum_{k \in A} \alpha_{k}^{P} f_{k}^{P} - \sum_{k \in A} \alpha_{k}^{B} f_{k}^{B}\right)
$$

Where:

- \(R^{P}\): Portfolio return.
- \(R^{B}\): Benchmark return.
- \(\alpha_{k}^{P}\): Portfolio exposure to factor \(k\).
- \(\alpha_{k}^{B}\): Benchmark exposure to factor \(k\).
- \(f_{k}^{P}\): Portfolio factor return.
- \(f_{k}^{B}\): Benchmark factor return.

### 2.2 Decomposition of Factor Outperformance

- For each factor,  the outperformance is decomposed across sectors:

$$
\alpha_{k}^{P} f_{k}^{P} - \alpha_{k}^{B} f_{k}^{B} = \sum_{s} \alpha_{k,   s}^{P} f_{k,   s}^{P} - \sum_{s} \alpha_{k,   s}^{B} f_{k,   s}^{B}
$$

- **Common Factors**:
  - If the factor return is identical for the portfolio and benchmark (\(f_{k,  s}^{P} = f_{k,  s}^{B}\)),  the contribution simplifies to:
	$$\sum_{s} \left(\alpha_{k,   s}^{P} - \alpha_{k,   s}^{B}\right) \cdot f_{k,   s}$$
  - Example: Yield curve exposure managed at the portfolio level.
- **Allocated Factors**:
  - Allocated factors may have different realizations for different securities or sectors.
  - Example: Credit spreads,  which vary across securities within a sector.

### 2.3 Allocation Methods

#### Absolute Allocation
- Total portfolio exposure to a factor is determined by the net sector exposures.
- Decomposition:
  - **[[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]**:
	$$\sum_{s} \left(\alpha_{k,   s}^{P} - \alpha_{k,   s}^{B}\right) \cdot f_{k,   s}^{B}$$
  - **Sector Management**:
	$$\sum_{s} \alpha_{k,   s}^{P} \cdot \left(f_{k,   s}^{P} - f_{k,   s}^{B}\right)$$

#### Relative Allocation
- Total portfolio exposure to a factor is determined at the portfolio level,  with sector exposures constrained by the portfolio exposure.
- Decomposition:
  - **[[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]]**:
	$$\alpha_{k}^{P} \cdot \sum_{s} \left(\frac{\alpha_{k,   s}^{P}}{\alpha_{k}^{P}} - \frac{\alpha_{k,   s}^{B}}{\alpha_{k}^{B}}\right) \cdot \left(f_{k,   s}^{B} - f_{k}^{H}\right)$$
  - **Sector Management**:
	$$\sum_{s} \alpha_{k,   s}^{P} \cdot \left(f_{k,   s}^{P} - f_{k,   s}^{B}\right)$$
  - **Top-Level Exposure**:
	$$\left(\alpha_{k}^{P} - \alpha_{k}^{B}\right) \cdot f_{k}^{H}$$

Where \(f_{k}^{H}\) is the hurdle rate for the factor.

## 3. Recursive Application of Attribution

- The sector management terms (\(f_{k,  s}^{P} - f_{k,  s}^{B}\)) can be recursively decomposed into subsectors or individual securities.
- At the final stage,  the sector management term becomes **security selection**.
- Example:
  - Top-level duration exposure is decomposed into sector-level duration exposures.
  - Sector-level exposures are further decomposed into individual security contributions.

## 4. Example: Hybrid Performance Attribution

  - Underperformance: \( (239.2 - 164.1) \times -5\% = -3.8 \) bps.
- **Total Local Market Allocation Contribution**: -8.7 bps.

## 5. Applications of Performance Attribution

### 5.1 Linking Ex-Post and Ex-Ante Decisions

- Performance attribution links realized outperformance to the manager's initial views and decisions.
- Example:
  - The manager's bullish yen view contributed +16.1 bps,  validating the decision.
  - The underweight in the euro local market resulted in -3.1 bps,  highlighting an area for improvement.

### 5.2 Identifying Unanticipated Risks

- Attribution exposes unanticipated sources of risk and return.
- Example:
  - The yen local market underperformance (-5.0 bps) was incidental to the FX overweight and could be addressed in future allocations.

### 5.3 Data Validation

- Recursive decomposition facilitates the discovery of data errors in large financial systems.
- Example:
  - Discrepancies in sector weights or returns can be traced back to individual securities.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 6.1 Factor Return Attribution

- Common factors (e.g.,  yield curve) are managed at the portfolio level,  while allocated factors (e.g.,  credit spreads) vary across sectors and securities.
- Absolute and relative allocation frameworks provide flexibility in decomposing outperformance.

### 6.2 Hybrid Attribution

- Hybrid models combine sector-based and factor-based attribution,  enabling detailed analysis of portfolio performance.
- Recursive decomposition links top-level decisions to individual security contributions.

### 6.3 Portfolio Management Applications

- Performance attribution enhances portfolio management by:
  - Validating ex-ante views.
  - Identifying unanticipated risks.
  - Improving decision-making processes.

  - **Inflation Surprise Return**: The effect of unexpected inflation announcements on inflation-linked securities.
  - **Time Return**: The deterministic return component driven by yield-curve carry,  spread carry,  and volatility decay.
  - **Yield-Curve Change Return**: The impact of interest rate movements on portfolio returns,  including duration and convexity effects.

## 2. Prepayment Surprise Return

### 2.1 Definition and Example

- **Prepayment Surprise Return** measures the difference between actual prepayments and model-projected prepayments for mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
- **Example**:
  - **Security Price**: 105 (zero accrued).
  - **Model-Projected Prepayment**: 2.4% (25% CPR),  predicting a return of **+11.4 bp**.
  - **Actual Prepayment**: 1.3% (15% CPR),  resulting in a return of **-6.2 bp**.
  - **Prepayment Surprise Return**:
	$$\text{Surprise Return} = -6.2 \,    \text{bp} - 11.4 \,    \text{bp} = +5.2 \,    \text{bp}$$
- **Key Insight**:
  - The model-expected return (**+11.4 bp**) is part of the **time return** component,  while the deviation (**+5.2 bp**) is attributed to prepayment surprise.

  - **OAD**: 5.
  - **OAC**: -2.
- **Scenario**:
  - Interest rates fall by **10 bp per day** over 10 business days,  for a total change of **-100 bp**.
- **Formula**:
 $R^{\Delta YC} = -OAD \cdot \Delta r + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{OAC}{100} \cdot \Delta r^2$$
- **Calculation**:
  - **Duration Return**:
	$$-5 \cdot (-100) = +500 \,    \text{bp}$$
  - **Convexity Return**:
	$$0.5 \cdot \frac{-2}{100} \cdot (-100)^2 = -100 \,    \text{bp}$$
  - **Total Return**:
	$$+500 \,    \text{bp} - 100 \,    \text{bp} = +400 \,    \text{bp}$$

### 5.3 Daily Attribution Adjustments

  - Any unexplained yield-curve change return is attributed to movements between key-rate points or higher-order terms.

## 6. Implied Volatility Change Return

### 6.1 Definition and Sensitivities

- **Implied Volatility Change Return** measures the impact of changes in implied volatility on securities with optionality.
- **Sensitivity**:
  - **Vega**: Price change for a 1% parallel shift in the implied volatility surface.
- **Advanced Models**:
  - Generate partial Vegas for multiple points on the volatility surface.
  - Decompose implied volatility change return into parallel and non-parallel components.

### 6.2 Example

- **Scenario**:
  - Vega: 0.5.
  - Parallel Volatility Shift: +2%.
  - **Parallel Component**:
	$$\text{Return} = 0.5 \cdot 2 = +1.0 \,    \text{bp}$$
  - **Non-Parallel Component**:
	- Captures the effects of reshaping the volatility surface and interactions with other model parameters.

### 7.2 Example

- **Scenario**:
  - OASD: 4.
  - OASC: -1.
  - Spread widens by **50 bp**.
- **Formula**:
 $R^{\Delta \text{Spread}} = -OASD \cdot \Delta \text{Spread} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot OASC \cdot (\Delta \text{Spread})^2$$
- **Calculation**:
  - **Duration Return**:
	$$-4 \cdot 50 = -200 \,    \text{bp}$$
  - **Convexity Return**:
	$$0.5 \cdot (-1) \cdot (50)^2 = -125 \,    \text{bp}$$
  - **Total Return**:
	$$-200 \,    \text{bp} - 125 \,    \text{bp} = -325 \,    \text{bp}$$

# Lecture Notes: Advanced Attribution for Inflation-Linked Securities and Model Selection

## 1. Introduction to Inflation-Linked Securities Attribution

- Inflation-linked securities,  such as U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS),  require specialized attribution models to account for their unique return components.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - The decomposition of returns for inflation-linked securities into nominal interest rate exposure,  inflation-related components,  and residuals.
  - The importance of inflation spread,  inflation accretion,  and inflation surprise in explaining returns.
  - A comparison of attribution models for fixed-income portfolios,  highlighting the Fully Analytical model.

## 2. Return Decomposition for Inflation-Linked Securities

### 2.1 Key Components of Inflation-Linked Returns

1. **Nominal Interest Rate Exposure**:
   - **Yield-Curve Carry**: Return from rolling down the nominal yield curve.
   - **Yield-Curve Change**: Return from changes in nominal interest rates.

1. **Inflation-Related Components**:
   - **Inflation Accretion**: Return from realized inflation,  reflecting the adjustment of principal or coupon payments.
   - **Inflation Spread Carry**: Return from the difference between nominal rates and inflation expectations.
   - **Inflation Surprise**: Return from differences between realized and projected inflation.
   - **Inflation Spread Change**: Return from changes in inflation expectations.

1. **Residual**:
   - Captures unexplained differences between actual and modeled returns.

### 2.2 Example: Barclays Inflation-Linked U.S. TIPS Index (July 16,  2010 â€“ August 13,  2010)

- **Total Return**: +169.9 bp.
- **Nominal Interest Rate Exposure**:
  - Yield-Curve Carry: +27.7 bp.

- **Inflation-Related Components**:
  - Inflation Accretion: -3.0 bp.
  - Inflation Spread Carry: -13.1 bp.
  - Inflation Surprise: +5.3 bp.
  - Inflation Spread Change: -29.7 bp.
- **Residual**: -1.9 bp.

#### Observations
1. **Nominal Interest Rate Exposure**:
   - The majority of the return came from nominal interest rate exposure,  with yield-curve change contributing +184.6 bp.
1. **Inflation-Related Components**:
   - Inflation-related returns were negative overall (-40.6 bp),  driven by falling inflation expectations (-29.7 bp).
   - Inflation accretion (-3.0 bp) reflected market expectations of slight deflation at the beginning of the month.
   - Inflation surprise (+5.3 bp) indicated that realized inflation was slightly positive,  contrary to expectations.

### 2.3 Inflation Spread and Term Structure

- Inflation expectations did not fall uniformly across maturities:
  - **Short Bonds**: Positive inflation spread return,  indicating rising short-term inflation expectations.
  - **Long Bonds (30-Year)**: Positive inflation spread return,  indicating rising long-term inflation expectations.
  - **Intermediate Bonds (3.5â€“20 Years)**: Negative inflation spread return,  indicating falling inflation expectations.

#### Implications
- Inflation portfolio managers must carefully monitor the term structure of inflation expectations and use detailed analytics to manage partial sensitivities to inflation.

# Lecture Notes: Advanced Topics in Performance Attribution for Fixed Income Portfolios

## 1. Introduction to Advanced Performance Attribution

- Performance attribution in fixed income portfolios involves decomposing returns into contributions from various factors,  such as yield-curve movements,  implied volatility,  spreads,  inflation,  and foreign exchange (FX) exposures.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - **Multicurrency Attribution**: Decomposing global portfolio returns into FX allocation,  FX hedging,  and local market contributions.
  - **FX Hedging Effects**: Accounting for unintended exposures to local interest rates and cash balances.
  - **Local Market Allocation**: Separating global duration positioning from local curve advantages and excess returns.
  - **Curve Allocation to Local Markets**: Using curve-matching portfolios (CMPs) to analyze global interest rate positioning.

## 2. Multicurrency Attribution

### 2.1 FX Return Splitting

- **Base Currency Total Return**:
  The total return of a security denominated in a non-base currency can be expressed as:
 $ {}^{b}R_{i} = F_{i} + R_{i}F_{i} + R_{i} $$
  Where:
  - \( {}^{b}R_{i} \): Base currency total return of security \(i\).
  - \( F_{i} \): FX return (change in exchange rate).
  - \( R_{i} \): Local currency return.
- **Cross-Term**:
  - The cross-term \( R_{i}F_{i} \) represents the interaction between FX and local returns.
  - While typically small for fixed income securities,  it can become significant when FX and local returns have opposite signs and similar magnitudes.
- **Adjusted FX Return**:
  To separate FX performance from local management,  include the cash deposit return of each currency:
 $ {}^{b}R_{i} = \left(F_{i} + R_{i}^{depo}\right) + R_{i}F_{i} + \left(R_{i} - R_{i}^{depo}\right) $$
  Where:
  - \( R_{i}^{depo} \): Local cash deposit return.

### 2.2 FX Hedging

- **Purpose**:
  FX hedging overlays are used to manage FX exposures without affecting local market exposures. Common instruments include FX forwards and swaps.

#### 2.2.1 Exposure to Local Interest Rates
- FX hedging instruments often have unintended exposure to the short end of local interest rate curves,  especially during market crises.
- This exposure is considered part of the hedging return and not part of local market strategy decisions.

#### 2.2.2 Cash Balance Effect
- As FX rates fluctuate,  the mark-to-market value of FX forwards becomes nonzero,  creating a cash balance (positive or negative).
- Unless reinvested regularly,  this cash balance represents an unintended allocation to cash or leverage.
- **Solution**:
  - Capture this effect as the difference between the actual portfolio return and the hypothetical return if the FX hedge cash balance were reinvested daily.

### 2.3 FX Outperformance

- **Pure FX Outperformance**:
 $ {}^{FX}R^{P} - {}^{FX}R^{B} = \sum_{c} {}^{b}h_{c}^{P} \cdot \left(F_{c} + R_{c}^{depo}\right) - \sum_{c} {}^{b}h_{c}^{B} \cdot \left(F_{c} + R_{c}^{depo}\right) $$
  Where:
  - \( {}^{b}h_{c}^{P} \): Effective portfolio exposure to FX rate \(c\) after hedging.
  - \( {}^{b}h_{c}^{B} \): Benchmark exposure to FX rate \(c\).
- **FX Allocation**:
 $ \sum_{c} \left({}^{b}h_{c}^{P} - {}^{b}h_{c}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(F_{c} + R_{c}^{depo} - R_{b}^{depo}\right) $$

- **FX/Local Cross-Term**:
 $ \sum_{c} \left({}^{b}w_{c}^{P}R_{c}^{P} - {}^{b}w_{c}^{B}R_{c}^{B}\right) \cdot F_{c}^{B} + \left(\left({}^{b}w_{c}^{P} - {}^{b}h_{c}^{P}\right) - \left({}^{b}w_{c}^{B} - {}^{b}h_{c}^{B}\right)\right) \cdot R_{c}^{depo} \cdot F_{c}^{B} $$

## 3. Local Market Allocation

### 3.1 Local Market Outperformance

- After accounting for FX exposures and hedging,  the remaining outperformance is given by:
 $ {}^{L}R^{P} - {}^{L}R^{B} = \sum_{m} {}^{b}w_{m}^{P} \cdot \left(R_{m}^{P} - R_{m}^{depo,  P}\right) - \sum_{m} {}^{b}w_{m}^{B} \cdot \left(R_{m}^{B} - R_{m}^{depo,  B}\right) $$

- **Local Market Allocation**:
 $ \sum_{m} \left({}^{b}w_{m}^{P} - {}^{b}w_{m}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(\left(R_{m}^{B} - R_{m}^{depo,  B}\right) - \left(R^{B} - R^{depo,  B}\right)\right) $$

- **Local Market Management**:
 $ \sum_{m} {}^{b}w_{m}^{P} \cdot \left(\left(R_{m}^{P} - R_{m}^{depo,  P}\right) - \left(R_{m}^{B} - R_{m}^{depo,  B}\right)\right) $$

### 3.2 Factor-Based Local Market Allocation

- Local market allocation can be decomposed into contributions from risk factors such as yield-curve,  implied volatility,  and spreads:
 $ {}^{L}R^{P} - {}^{L}R^{B} = \sum_{k} \sum_{m_{k}} {}^{b}w_{m_{k}}^{P} \alpha_{k,  m_{k}}^{P} f_{k,  m_{k}}^{P} - \sum_{k} \sum_{m_{k}} {}^{b}w_{m_{k}}^{B} \alpha_{k,  m_{k}}^{B} f_{k,  m_{k}}^{B} $$

- **Allocation**:
 $ \sum_{k} \left(\sum_{m_{k}} \left({}^{b}w_{m_{k}}^{P} \alpha_{k,  m_{k}}^{P} - {}^{b}w_{m_{k}}^{B} \alpha_{k,  m_{k}}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(f_{k,  m_{k}}^{B} - f_{k}^{H}\right)\right) $$

- **Management**:
 $ \sum_{k} \left(\sum_{m_{k}} {}^{b}w_{m_{k}}^{P} \alpha_{k,  m_{k}}^{P} \cdot \left(f_{k,  m_{k}}^{P} - f_{k,  m_{k}}^{B}\right)\right) $$

## 4. Curve Allocation to Local Markets

### 4.1 Global Interest Rate Positioning

- Global interest rate positioning can be separated into:
  - **Global Duration Mismatch**: Contribution of the portfolio's overall duration position.
  - **Local Curve Advantage**: Contribution of interest rate exposure outside the reference currency.
  - **Excess of Curve Allocation**: Contribution of other risk exposures in each currency.

### 4.2 Curve Carry Attribution

- **Curve Carry Return**:
 $ R_{c,  j}^{carry} = y_{c,  j} \Delta t $$
  Where:
  - \( y_{c,  j} \): Yield at key-rate point \(j\) on curve \(c\).
  - \( \Delta t \): Time elapsed.
- **Local Curve Carry Allocation**:
 $ \sum_{c} \sum_{j} \left({}^{b}w_{c}^{P} \omega_{c,  j}^{P} - {}^{b}w_{c}^{B} \omega_{c,  j}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(\left(R_{c,  j}^{carry} - R_{c}^{depo}\right) - \left(R_{ref,  j}^{carry} - R_{ref}^{depo}\right)\right) $$

## 5. Practical Implications for Portfolio Management

### 5.1 FX Management
- **Key Takeaways**:
  - FX hedging introduces unintended exposures to local interest rates and cash balances,  which must be accounted for in attribution.
  - Explicitly separating FX and local returns provides a clearer view of portfolio performance.

### 5.2 Local Market Allocation

### Lecture Notes: Advanced Attribution for Global Yield-Curve Allocation and FX Positioning

## 1. Introduction to Global Yield-Curve Allocation and FX Positioning

- Global fixed-income portfolios often involve exposure to multiple currencies and yield curves. Proper attribution of performance requires decomposing returns into contributions from FX positioning,  yield-curve carry,  and yield-curve changes.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - **Global Curve Carry and Change Attribution**: Breaking down outperformance into carry and yield-curve change components.
  - **FX Allocation and Hedging**: Understanding the impact of FX positioning and hedging on portfolio returns.
  - **Practical Example**: Analyzing the performance of a U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio managed against the Barclays Global G4 Treasury Index.

## 2. Global Curve Carry Attribution

### 2.1 Curve Carry Management

- **Key Insight**: Curve carry management is zero by construction because the carry return at each key-rate point and the deposit rate return are uniform across all securities in the portfolio and benchmark.
- **Formula**:
 $\sum_{c}\sum_{j}^{b}w_{c}^{P}\omega_{c,  j}^{P}\cdot\left(\left(R_{c,  j}^{carry}-R_{c}^{depo}\right)-\left(R_{c,  j}^{carry}-R_{c}^{depo}\right)\right)=0$$

### 2.2 Global Curve Carry Over Deposit

- **Definition**: Measures the outperformance due to differences in portfolio and benchmark weights across curves and key-rate points.
- **Formula**:
 $\sum_{c}\sum_{j}\Big(^{b}w_{c}^{P}\omega_{c,  j}^{P}-^{b}w_{c}^{B}\omega_{c,  j}^{B}\Big)\cdot\Big(R_{ref,  j}^{carry}-R_{ref}^{depo}\Big)$$
- **Key Insight**: If no reference curve is used,  the global curve carry term becomes zero,  and the outperformance is broken down per curve and key-rate point:
 $\sum_{c}\sum_{j}\Big(^{b}w_{c}^{P}\omega_{c,  j}^{P}-^{b}w_{c}^{B}\omega_{c,  j}^{B}\Big)\cdot\Big(R_{c,  j}^{carry}-R_{c}^{depo}\Big)$$

### 2.3 Example: Euro Curve Carry Attribution

- **Average Yield**: 3.1%.
- **Carry Over Deposit Return**: 23.4 bp.
- **Market Value Overweight**: \(34.4\% - 29.8\% = 4.6\%\).
- **Contribution**:
 $(34.4\% - 29.8\%) \times 23.4 \,  \text{bp} = +1.1 \,  \text{bp}$$

## 3. Global Curve Change Attribution

### 3.1 Curve Change Management

- **Key Insight**: Curve change management is zero by construction because interest rate changes are uniform across all securities in the portfolio and benchmark.
- **Formula**:
 $-\sum_{c}\sum_{j}^{b}w_{c}^{P}KRD_{c,  j}^{P}\cdot\left(\Delta y_{c,  j}-\Delta y_{c,  j}\right)=0$$

### 3.2 Global Duration Mismatch

- **Definition**: Measures the outperformance due to differences in portfolio and benchmark key-rate durations relative to a reference curve.
- **Formula**:
 $-\sum_{c}\sum_{j}\Big(^{b}w_{c}^{P}KRD_{c,  j}^{P}-^{b}w_{c}^{B}KRD_{c,  j}^{B}\Big)\cdot\Delta y_{ref,  j}$$
- **Key Insight**: If no reference curve is used,  the global duration mismatch becomes zero,  and the outperformance is broken down per curve and key-rate point:
 $-\sum_{c}\sum_{j}\Big(^{b}w_{c}^{P}KRD_{c,  j}^{P}-^{b}w_{c}^{B}KRD_{c,  j}^{B}\Big)\cdot\Delta y_{c,  j}$$

### 3.3 Example: Euro Curve Change Attribution

- **Duration Overweight**: \(2.33 - 1.88 = 0.45\).
- **Average Yield Change**: -28 bp.
- **Contribution**:
 $(2.33 - 1.88) \times (-28 \,  \text{bp}) = -12.6 \,  \text{bp}$$

## 4. FX Allocation and Hedging

### 4.1 FX Allocation Outperformance

- **Definition**: Measures the outperformance due to deviations in portfolio and benchmark FX exposures.
- **Formula**:
 $\sum_{c} \left({}^{b}h_{c}^{P} - {}^{b}h_{c}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(F_{c} + R_{c}^{depo} - R_{b}^{depo}\right)$$

### 4.2 FX Hedging Effects

- **Definition**: Measures the impact of FX hedging instruments on portfolio returns,  including exposure to local interest rates and cash balance effects.
- **Key Insight**: FX hedging effects are captured as the difference between the actual portfolio return and the hypothetical return if the FX hedge cash balance were reinvested daily.

### 4.3 Example: Euro FX Allocation Outperformance

- **Excess FX Return**: 306.1 bp.
- **Market Value Overweight**: \(34.4\% - 29.8\% = 4.6\%\).
- **Contribution**:
 $(34.4\% - 29.8\%) \times 306.1 \,  \text{bp} = +14.1 \,  \text{bp}$$
- **Reported Contribution**: +14.8 bp (difference due to daily compounding).

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 6.1 Global Yield-Curve Allocation
- Curve carry management is zero by construction,  while global curve carry and change contributions depend on portfolio and benchmark deviations.
- Duration positioning in the U.S. dollar and euro markets drove most of the yield-curve outperformance.

### 6.2 FX Allocation and Hedging
- FX allocation contributed significantly to outperformance,  particularly from the euro's strengthening against the U.S. dollar.
- FX hedging effects were minimal,  reflecting effective implementation of the manager's strategy.

### 6.3 Practical Applications
- Advanced attribution techniques provide deeper insights into portfolio performance,  enabling managers to optimize risk-adjusted returns and refine investment strategies.

By mastering these concepts,  fixed-income portfolio managers can enhance their decision-making processes and achieve superior performance outcomes.

given by:

$$\sum_{s}\left(\beta^{P}w_{s}^{P}-\beta^{B}w_{s}^{B}\right)\cdot R_{s}^{B}$$

And the sector management term becomes:

$$\sum_{s}\beta^{P}w_{s}^{P}\cdot\left(R_{s}^{P}-R_{s}^{B}\right)$$

This approach shifts the responsibility for leverage decisions to the asset allocator,  who determines the total exposure to each sector. The sector managers are then evaluated based on their ability to generate excess returns relative to the benchmark within their allocated exposure.

### Lecture Notes: Advanced Performance Attribution in Fixed Income Portfolio Management â€“ Leverage,  Derivatives,  and Multi-Currency Portfolios

## 1. Introduction to Advanced Attribution Techniques

- Fixed income portfolio management often involves complex instruments such as derivatives,  multi-currency exposures,  and leverage. Proper attribution of performance requires decomposing returns into contributions from [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]],  security selection,  FX positioning,  and derivative overlays.
- This lecture focuses on:
  - **Leverage Attribution**: Handling leverage at both the portfolio and sector levels.
  - **Derivative Attribution**: Special treatment of currency,  interest rate,  and credit derivatives.
  - **Multi-Currency Attribution**: Decomposing global portfolio returns into FX and local market contributions.
  - **Practical Challenges**: Handling intra-period transactions,  unsettled positions,  and missing or inconsistent data.

## 2. Leverage Attribution

### 2.1 Leverage at Portfolio and Sector Levels

- **Key Insight**: Leverage decisions can be made at both the portfolio and sector levels. Proper attribution requires separating the contributions of top-level leverage from sector-level exposures.

#### 2.1.1 Asset Allocation with Leverage
- **Formula**:
 $\beta^P\sum_s\left(\frac{w_s^P\beta_s^P}{\beta^P}-\frac{w_s^B\beta_s^B}{\beta^B}\right)\cdot\left(R_s^B-R^H\right)$$
  - \( \beta^P \): Portfolio leverage.
  - \( \beta^B \): Benchmark leverage.
  - \( w_s^P \): Portfolio weight in sector \(s\).
  - \( w_s^B \): Benchmark weight in sector \(s\).
  - \( R_s^B \): Benchmark return for sector \(s\).
  - \( R^H \): Hurdle return.

#### 2.1.2 Sector Management with Leverage
- **Formula**:
 $\sum_{s}w_{s}^{P}\beta_{s}^{P}\cdot\left(R_{s}^{P}-R_{s}^{B}\right)$$
  - \( \beta_s^P \): Sector leverage in the portfolio.
  - \( R_s^P \): Portfolio return for sector \(s\).

#### 2.1.3 Diversification Term
- **Formula**:
 $\left(\sum_{s}w_{s}^{P}\beta_{s}^{P}-\beta^{P}\frac{\sum_{s}w_{s}^{B}\beta_{s}^{B}}{\beta^{B}}\right)\cdot R^{H}$$
  - Captures the effect of non-linear aggregation of leverage across sectors.
  - If leverage aggregates linearly (\( \beta^P = \sum_s w_s^P \beta_s^P \)),  this term vanishes.

### 2.2 Practical Implications of Leverage Attribution

1. **Linear vs. Non-Linear Aggregation**:
   - If leverage aggregates non-linearly (e.g.,  due to risk diversification),  the diversification term becomes significant.
   - Positive diversification effects occur when the portfolio benefits from uncorrelated sector exposures.

1. **Hurdle Return**:
   - The hurdle return (\( R^H \)) represents the minimum return required to justify leverage. Positive \( R^H \) amplifies the diversification effect.

1. **Reporting Leverage**:
   - Leverage should be reported separately to provide transparency and identify its impact on performance.

## 3. Derivative Attribution

### 3.1 Currency Derivatives

- **Purpose**: FX forwards and swaps are typically used for hedging currency risk.
- **Attribution Treatment**:
  - Remove FX hedges from local market attribution to isolate FX effects.
  - Account for:
	1. **Non-FX Return**: Return from FX hedges unrelated to currency movements.
	1. **FX Hedging Cash Balance Effect**: Implicit allocation to cash or leverage due to the mark-to-market value of FX hedges.

### 3.2 Interest Rate Derivatives

- **Purpose**: Interest rate derivatives,  such as government bond futures and swaps,  are used to manage yield-curve exposures.
- **Attribution Treatment**:
  - Include derivatives in yield-curve attribution but exclude them from [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]] and security selection.
  - Account for:
	1. **Curve Outperformance**: Contribution to yield-curve returns.
	1. **Cash Balance Effect**: Implicit allocation to cash or leverage due to the market value of derivatives.
	1. **Spread Effects**: Changes in the spread between futures prices and theoretical fair values.

### 3.3 Credit Derivatives

- **Purpose**: Credit derivatives,  such as CDS and CDX,  are used to manage credit exposures.
- **Attribution Treatment**:
  - Include credit derivatives in [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]] and security selection.
  - Explode credit indices (e.g.,  CDX) into single-issuer constituents for detailed attribution.
  - Account for:
	1. **Credit Spread Changes**: Contribution to excess returns over the yield curve.
	1. **Bucket Leverage**: Implicit leverage due to the basis of returns for credit derivatives.

## 4. Multi-Currency Attribution

### 4.1 FX Return Splitting

- **Formula**:
 $ {}^{b}R_{i} = F_{i} + R_{i}F_{i} + R_{i} $$
  - \( {}^{b}R_{i} \): Base currency total return.
  - \( F_{i} \): FX return.
  - \( R_{i} \): Local currency return.
  - \( R_{i}F_{i} \): Cross-term.

### 4.2 FX Allocation and Hedging

- **FX Allocation**:
 $ \sum_{c} \left({}^{b}h_{c}^{P} - {}^{b}h_{c}^{B}\right) \cdot \left(F_{c} + R_{c}^{depo} - R_{b}^{depo}\right) $$
  - \( {}^{b}h_{c}^{P} \): Portfolio FX exposure.
  - \( {}^{b}h_{c}^{B} \): Benchmark FX exposure.
- **FX Hedging Effects**:
  - Account for unintended exposures to local interest rates and cash balances due to FX hedges.

### 4.3 Local Market Allocation

- **Formula**:
 $ {}^{L}R^{P} - {}^{L}R^{B} = \sum_{m} {}^{b}w_{m}^{P} \cdot \left(R_{m}^{P} - R_{m}^{depo,  P}\right) - \sum_{m} {}^{b}w_{m}^{B} \cdot \left(R_{m}^{B} - R_{m}^{depo,  B}\right) $$
  - Decomposes local market outperformance into allocation and management components.

## 5. Practical Challenges in Attribution

### 5.1 Intra-Period Transactions

- **Issue**: Transactions that settle on a forward basis create intra-period returns and unsettled positions.
- **Solution**:
  - Report intra-period returns separately.
  - Distinguish between settled and unsettled positions,  as only settled positions earn carry.

### 5.2 Unsettled Positions

- **Issue**: Unsettled positions earn cash returns instead of security yields.
- **Solution**:
  - Account for the return difference (\( r^{cash} - r^{yield} \)) as carry outperformance.

### 5.3 Missing or Inconsistent Data

- **Issue**: Missing prices or discrepancies between portfolio and benchmark prices can distort attribution.
- **Solution**:
  - Use implied prices based on market changes to fill gaps.
  - Report pricing differences as a separate source of outperformance.

## 6. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 6.1 Leverage Attribution
- Properly account for leverage at both the portfolio and sector levels.
- Report diversification effects separately to capture non-linear aggregation of leverage.

### 6.2 Derivative Attribution
- Treat currency and interest rate derivatives as overlays,  excluding them from [[Lecture 2- Asset Allocation with Multiple Risky Assets|asset allocation]] and security selection.
- Include credit derivatives in regular attribution models,  exploding indices into single-issuer constituents.

### 6.3 Multi-Currency Attribution
- Decompose global returns into FX and local market contributions.
- Account for FX hedging effects,  including unintended exposures to local interest rates and cash balances.

### 6.4 Practical Recommendations
1. **Report Leverage and Derivatives Separately**:
   - Provide transparency into their contributions to performance.
1. **Handle Intra-Period Transactions**:
   - Capture intra-period returns and unsettled positions accurately.
1. **Address Missing Data**:
   - Use implied prices and report pricing differences separately.

By adopting these advanced attribution techniques,  portfolio managers can optimize risk-adjusted returns,  enhance decision-making,  and achieve superior performance outcomes.
