## INTRODUCTION
- There are numerous questions that arise when we think about the term structure
of interest rates,  such as:
1. Why does the term structure of interest rates tend to slope upwards?
1. What is the risk involved in investing in Treasury securities?
1. Can we predict medium-to-long term yields? What about returns?
## THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS
- The expectations hypothesis is the hypothesis that long-term yields just reflect
market participants' expectation of future interest rates
Long-term yield = Expected future short-term rates
- To illustrate,  let today be t and consider the case in which investors have perfect foresight of the next 1-year interest rates$y_ {t+1}(1)$.
- Investors then also know that the zero coupon bond price next year will be
$$Z_{t+1}(1)=e^{-y_{t+1}(1)\times1}$$
- Because under these assumptions,  Z_ {t+1}(1) is known today,  its value today is the
discounted value using the current 1-year yield:
$$Z_{t}(2)=Z_{t}(1)\times Z_{t+1}(1)=e^{-\langle y_{t}(1)+y_{t+1}(1)\rangle}$$
- Because the two-year yield also satisfies$Z_{t}(2)=e^{-y_{t}(2)\times2}$,  we obtain that under perfect foresight$$y_{t}(2)=\frac{1}{2}(y_{t}(1)+y_{t+1}(1))$$
## THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS (CNTD.)
- Extending this reasoning to n future one-year yields,  then under perfect foresight
the yield of a zero-coupon bond with n + 1 years to maturity is:
$$y_{t}(n+1)=\mathsf{Average}[y_{t}(1),   y_{t+1}(1),   …,   y_{t+n}(1)]={\frac{1}{n+1}}\stackrel{n}{\underset{i=0}{\Sigma}}y_{t+i}(1)$$
- The **expectations hypothesis** substitutes the perfect foresight with forecasts:
$$The\ long\ term\ yield=\ forecasted\ average\ path\ of\ future\ rates$$$$y_{t}(n+1)\ =\ E_{t}\left[\frac{1}{n+1}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}y_{t+i}(1)\right]\tag{1}$$
- Subtracting the current **1-year** yield,  we can also write$$y_{t}(n+1)-y_{t}(1)\ =\ E_{t}\left[\frac{1}{n+1}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}y_{t+i}(1)\right]-y_{t}(1)$$

## PRELIMINARY HEURISTIC EVIDENCE - DOES THIS RELATION HOLDS IN THE DATA?
- Heuristically,  next figure plots the expected future three-month rates from the survey of Professional Forecasters from 1981 to 2015.
- The forecasts are for the three-month T-bill rate for the current quarter,  denote in the figure by$r(t)$,  and for the next three quarters,  denoted by$r(t + 3m)$,  $r(t + 6m)$,  and$r(t + 9m)$,  respectively.

- Next figure shows the 1-year term spread,  defined as yt(1y) − r(t) together with the 1-year "expectation spread".
![](Lecture%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates-20240405072953056.png The 1-year term spread is greater than the "expectation spread" most of the time.
	- the expectation hypothesis does not hold (at least,  using survey forecasts).
## THE EXPECTATION HYPOTHpng AND FORWARD RATES
# Forward Rates and Term Structure

We observed in **Teaching Notes 1** that a forward rate at time$t$for an investment between$\tau_1$and$\tau_2$can be represented as:

$$
f_t(\tau_1,    \tau_2) = \frac{1}{\tau_2 - \tau_1} \ln \left( \frac{Z_t(\tau_1)}{Z_t(\tau_2)} \right) = \frac{1}{\tau_2 - \tau_1} \left( y_t(\tau_2)\tau_2 - y_t(\tau_1)\tau_1 \right) \tag{3}
$$
- Consider a sequence of maturities$\tau_i = \tau_{i-1} + \Delta t$,  for$i = 2,    \ldots,    n$. We have:
	- $f_t(\tau_1,    \tau_2) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(y_t(\tau_2)\tau_2 - y_t(\tau_1)\tau_1 \right)$
	- $f_t(\tau_2,    \tau_3) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(y_t(\tau_3)\tau_3 - y_t(\tau_2)\tau_2 \right)$
	- $\vdots$
	- $f_t(\tau_{n-2},    \tau_{n-1}) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(y_t(\tau_{n-1})\tau_{n-1} - y_t(\tau_{n-2})\tau_{n-2} \right)$
	- $f_t(\tau_{n-1},    \tau_n) = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(y_t(\tau_n)\tau_n - y_t(\tau_{n-1})\tau_{n-1} \right)$
- Summing over all of the forward rates,  we find
$$\sum_{i=2}^{n}f_{t}(\tau_{i-1},   \tau_{i})=\frac{1}{\Delta t}\left(y_{t}(\tau_{n})\tau_{n}-y_{t}(\tau_{1})\tau_{1}\right)$$
- Assuming τ1 = ∆t and defining ft(0,  ∆t) = yt(∆t),  we the obtain
$$y_{t}(\tau_{n})=\frac{\Delta t}{\tau_{n}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}f_{t}(\tau_{i-1},   \tau_{i})=\mbox{Average forward rates}\tag{4}$$
- The expectation hypothesis then implies that for every i the forward rate is equal to the expected future short-term rate:
$$f_{t}(\tau_{i},   \tau_{i}+\Delta t)=E_{t}[y_{t+\tau_{i}}(\Delta t)].$$
-![](Lecture%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates-20240405073248911.png Again,  expected future rates are mostly lower than forward rates.
## TIME VARYING RISK PREMIA
- The violation of the expectations hypothesis (and the time variation in sprepnguggests the existence of an additional term in Equation (1):
$$y_{t}(n+1)\ =\ E_{t}\left[\frac{1}{n+1}\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}y_{t+i}(1)\right]+RP_{t}\tag{5}$$
- where$RP_{t}$reflects a risk premium from holding the bond from$t$to$t+1$.
- The time variation in$RP_t$invalidates the expectations hypothesis.
	 - Even if the expectation of future interest rates does not change,  the yield curve may change because$RP_t$changes.
	- Therefore,  movements in the yield curve do not only correspond to variations in expected future short-term yields.
## TERM STRUCTURE DECOMPOSITION
- Let$y_t(n + 1$) = yield at t of a bond with *time to maturity* (n + 1) years from t
$$Z_{t}(n+1)=e^{-y_{t}(n+1)(n+1)}\tag{6}$$
- The value of this bond next year will then be
$$Z_{t+1}(n)=e^{-y_{t+1}(n)\times n}$$
- The yield next year yt+1(n) is not known. Assume it normally distributed
$$y_{t+1}(n)\sim{\cal N}\left(\bar{y},   V\right))\quad\mbox{with}\quad\bar{y}=E[y_{t+1}(n)]$$
- $Z_{t+1}(n)$is risky and so investors at$t$may require an additional discount$RP$:$$Z_{t}(n+1)=e^{-\left(y(1)+RP_{t}\right)\times1}E_{t}[Z_{t+1}(n)]\tag{7}$$
- Using the properties of the normal distribution we then obtain
$$E_{t}[Z_{t+1}(n)]=e^{-\overline{{{y}}}\times n+\frac{(n)^{2}}{2}V}$$
- Using (6) and (7) we then obtain
$$y_{t}\left(n+1\right)=\frac{1}{n+1}\times y_{t}\left(1\right)+\frac{n}{n+1}\times E_{t}\left[y_{t+1}\left(n\right)\right]\qquad\text{(Expected future yield)}$$$$+\frac{RP}{n+1}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(Risk premium)}$$$$-\frac{n^{2}}{2(n+1)}V_{t}\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\text{(Convexity)}\tag{8}$$
- The current long-term yield$y_t(n + 1)$depends on
	1. The weighted average between the current short-term yield and the expected long-term yield next year.
	1. A risk premium RP that market participants require to hold long-term zero coupon bonds with maturity n + 1 over safe bonds with maturity 1.
	1. A convexity term due to the nonlinear relation that exists between the yield$y_{t+1}(n)$and the price$$Z_{t+1}(n) = e^{−y_{t+1}(n)×n}$$
## EXPECTATION HYPOTHESIS (AGAIN)
- Let$RP_t = \frac{n^2}{2} V_{t}$Then the expectation hypothesis holds:
$$y_{t}\left(n+1\right)\,   =\,   \frac{1}{n+1}\times y_{t}\left(1\right)+\frac{n}{n+1}\times E_{t}\left[y_{t+1}\left(n\right)\right]\tag{9}$$
- Subtract$y_{t}\left(n+1\right)\times\left(n\right)/(n+1)$on both sides,  to get$$E_{t}\left[y_{t+1}\left(n\right)\right]-y_{t}\left(n+1\right)\,   =\,   \,   \,   \,   \,   \,   \,   \,   \frac{1}{n}[y_{t}\left(n+1\right)-y_{t}\left(1\right)]\tag{10}$$
- A steep term structure (on the RHS) signals the market expects an increase in the yield$y_t (n + 1)$between$t$and$t + 1$(on the LHS)
$$E_{t}\left[y_{t+1}\left(n\right)\right]>y_{t}\left(n+1\right)$$
	- market expects a low or negative return on$(n + 1)$maturity bond.
![](Lecture%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates-20240405074610622.webp)
- Example: On t =1/31/1994 yield curve was increasing and the spread was 3.3%.
- High spread *may* signalpng-term yield$y_t(30)$= 6.87% may increase.
- And indeed,  it [DiD](Lecture%2013-%20Difference-In-Differences%20(Part%202%20Of%202).md):$t + 1 =$1/31/1995 we have$y_{t+1}(29) = 7.81\%.$
- This implies a loss on investment:$R_{t,   t+1}=\frac{Z_{t+1}(29)}{Z_{t}(30)}-1=\frac{10.3893}{12.7048}-1=-18\%$
## DOES THE EXPECTATION HYPOTHESIS HOLD IN THE DATA?
- Does a high slope predict an increase in future yields? (i.e. should you go short?)
- In an influential paper,  Campbell and Shiller (1988) run the following regressions
$$\text{Changes in yield}=\alpha+\beta\times\text{Slope}_{t}+\varepsilon_{t+1}\tag{11}$$
$\bullet$That is,  from yield data we can compute a dependent "$Y$" variable
$$Y_{t}=\text{Changes in yield}=y_{t+1}\left(n\right)-y_{t}\left(n+1\right);\quad t=1,   2,   …,   T$$
- and an explanatory "X" variable
$$X_{t}=\mathsf{Slope}_{t}=\frac{1}{n}\left[y_{t}\left(n+1\right)-y_{t}\left(1\right)\right];\quad t=1,   2,   …,   T$$
- Then Campbell and Shiller (1988) run the regression
$$Y_{t}=\alpha+\beta X_{t}+\varepsilon_{t+1}\tag{12}$$
- The expectations hypothesis has$α = 0$and$β = 1.$
- We can see if this true in the data.

Notes: Regression results based on Fama Bliss discount bond data from CRSP. Sample: 1964 - 2006.

- Important to note:
- β ̸= 1 =⇒ Expectations Hypothesis is rejected
- *β <* 0 =⇒ steep yield curve predicts a **decrease** of long-term yield.
	- This is the opposite of the basic simple intuition about a raising yield curve.
- Bottom line: A steep yield curve predicts high returns of long-term bonds.
![](Lecture%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates-20240405074821841.webp)
- Example: On t =1/30/2004 yield curve was increasing and the spread was 4.1%.
- In the data,  high spread forecast a decline of long-term yield$y_t(30) = 5.347\%$.
- And indeed,  it [DiDpngcture%2013-%20Difference-In-Differences%20(Part%202%20Of%202).md):$t + 1$= 1/31/2005 we have$y_{t+1}(29)$= 4.655\%.
- This implies a gain on investment:$$
R_{t,  t+1}=\frac{Z_{t+1}(29)}{Z_t(30)}-1=\frac{25.9279}{20.1046}-1=+29\%
$$
## TIME VARYING RISK PREMIA
-  This result implies that the slope of the term structure predicts
$$L R P_{t}=R P_{t}-\frac{n^{2}}{2}V_{t},   \tag{13}$$
-  *LRP*t stands for "Log Risk Premium" (see below).
-  In fact,    we can rewrite (8) as
$$E_{t}\left[y_{t+1}\left(n\right)-y_{t}\left(n+1\right)\right]=\frac{1}{n}\left[y_{t}\left(n+1\right)-y_{t}\left(1\right)\right]-LRP_{t}\tag{14}$$
-  We know slope is not positively related to the left-hand-side (previous table)
	- then it must be positively correlated with $LRP_{t}$.
- When slope increases so does *LRP*t,    thereby killing the positive correlation.
-  Implication:
	- High slope ̸⇒ market expects higher future rates.
	- High slope ⇒ high risk premium ⇒ high expected return of long-term bonds
		- strong price increase ⇒ low future yield.
## THE PREDICTABILITY OF BOND RETURNS
-  The Log Risk Premium $LRP_t$ can also be rewritten as:
$$LRP_{t}=E_{t}\left[\log\left(\frac{Z_{t+1}\left(n\right)}{Z_{t}\left(n+1\right)}\right)-\log\left(\frac{1}{Z_{t}\left(1\right)}\right)\right]\tag{15}$$
- The expectation hypothesis implies $LRP_{t}=0$.
 +  To test for this hypothesis,    denote the Log Excess Return (LER) from holding a long-term zero coupon bond over the short term bond by
$$LER_{t}=\log\left(\frac{Z_{t+1}\left(n\right)}{Z_{t}\left(n+1\right)}\right)-\log\left(\frac{1}{Z_{t}\left(1\right)}\right)\tag{16}$$
- LER ${}_{t}$* is the ex-post realized empirical counterpart of *LIRP*:
$$LRP_{t}=E_{t}[LER_{t}]$$
4To see this,    substitute in (15) the expressions log(Zt+1(n)/Zt(n + 1)) = −yt+1(n)n + yt(n + 1)(n + 1) and
− log(1/Zt(1)) = yt(1) and then use (8).
## FAMA BLISS REGRESSIONS
-  Fama and Bliss (1987) then run the following regression
$$LER_{t}=\alpha+\beta\left[f_{t}(n,   n+1)-y_{t}(1)\right]+\varepsilon(t)\tag{17}$$
- The expectation hypothesis has $LPR_{t}=0$,    and therefore $\alpha=\beta=0$.

$$

Panel B: Log Excess Return Prediction from Forward Slope

- β is significantly different from zero,  and indeed positive.
- This finding,  again,  shows that the excess log return is in fact predictable:
- When the forward spread is strongly positive,  on average investments in longterm bonds generate a higher return compared to short term bonds.
## COCHRANE AND PIAZZESI FACTOR
- Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) have shown that a specific combination of forward
rates successfully predicts excess log returns.
- The predicting factor is defined by
$$x_{t}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}y_{t}(1)+\gamma_{3}f_{t}(2,   3)+\gamma_{5}f_{t}(4,   5)$$
- The parameters γi are estimated in a first stage regression:
- Define
$$\overline{{{L}}}E\overline{{{R}}}_{t}=0.25\times\sum\limits_{n=2}^{5}L E R_{t}(n)$$
- Then,  estimate γi's with:
$$\overline{{{L}}}E R_{t}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}y_{t}(1)+\gamma_{3}f_{t}(2,   3)+\gamma_{4}f_{t}(4,   5))+\varepsilon_{t}$$
- The estimates for 1964 - 2006 sample are cγ0 = −3.26,  cγ1 = −1.87,  cγ3 = 3.94,
and cγ5 = −1.64.
## COCHRANE AND PIAZZESI REGRESSION

-  The coefficients are strongly positive,    and the R2 higher than in Panel B,    showing that including information on the whole term structure helps predict bond excess returns.
## COPING WITH INFLATION RISK: TREASURY INFLATION-PROTECTED SECURITIES
-  Treasury coupon bonds are in nominal terms,    as they pay in dollars.
-  How much you can buy with those dollars depends on inflation before maturity.
-  Over long periods,    the inflation can be pretty high.
-  CPI index = weighted average of the representative good prices.
-  The change in the CPI measures the realized inflation during the period.
## SIMPLE EXAMPLE
-  We have monthly income of $10,    000 and let CPI = price of consumption basket.
-  How much we can buy at a given time $t_1$ is $C(t_1) =\$10,    000/CPI(t_1)$.
	+ E.g. if $CPI(t_1)$ = 10 =⇒ we can buy 1000 units of consumption basket.
- If basket only contains$10-burgers,    we can buy  $C(t_1)$  = 1000 burgers at t1.
-  Let now be t2 and let our income be the same. Because of inflation,    now  $CPI(t_2)$  =
	- We can now only buy  $C(t_2)$  =$10,    000/ $CPI(t_2)$  = 500 burgers: big loss in consumption even if nominal income is the same.
## INFLATION RISK AND THE LOSS OF PURCHASING POWER
-  The ratio  $C(t_2)$ / $C(t_1)$  = loss in purchasing power of a dollar between t1 and t2.
-  This ratio is given by  $C(t_2)$ / $C(t_1)$  =  $CPI(t_1)$ / $CPI(t_2)$ .
	- In the previous example  $CPI(t_1)$ / $CPI(t_2)$  = 0.5 =⇒ we can only afford at t2 half of the goods we could buy at t1.
-  Changes in CPI are unknown =⇒ nominal securities have inflation risk
	- Risk that the dollar payoff will afford less consumption goods than expected.
-  Inflation-protected securities are vehicles that hedge against this inflation risk.
## TREASURY INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES (TIPS)
-  TIPS are coupon bonds issued with maturities of 5,    10,    and 20 years.
-  The coupon rate of TIPS is a constant fraction of the principal.
-  The principal changes over time in response to inflation.
	- If the CPI increases,    then the principal amount increases proportionally.
-  The Treasury publishes Index ratios
$$\mbox{Index ratio}(t)\ =\ \max\left(\frac{\mbox{Reference CPI}(t)}{\mbox{CPI}(\mbox{issurance})}\right)$$
Reference CPI$(t)\ =\ w(t)\ \mbox{CPI}(t-1)+(1-w(t))\ \mbox{CPI}(t-2)$
- where $w(t)$ is a weight that depends on the quoted day of the month.
-  Next Table contains quotes of Treasury securities on November 26,    2007.
	- Given the index ratio,    the next coupon payment is
Coupon payment$(t)=\dfrac{\text{Coupon rate}}{2}\times100\times\text{Index ratio}(t)$
## TREASURY SECURITIES ON NOVEMBER 26,    2007
![](Lecture%20Note%203%20Understanding%20The%20Term%20Structure%20Of%20Interest%20Rates-20240405081418999.webp)
Data Source: Bloomberg,    Inc.
## REFERENCE INDEX EXAMPLE
-  The quotes in the Table are for November 26,    2007. -  The CPI used to comppngdex ratio is not the November CPI.
- CPI values are released by BLS during the third week of the following month.
-  CPI used is instead the average between the August and September CPIs (207.917
and 208.490,    respectively).
- Because November 26 is 25 days after November 1,    the calculation is
$${\mathsf{C P I}}(t)={\frac{5}{30}}\times207.917+{\frac{25}{30}}\times208.490=208.3945.$$
-  An investor in TIPS is still subject to a small inflation risk during the two months
between the CPI measure and the actual payment.
## REAL BONDS AND THE REAL TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES
-  Borrowing and lending do not need dollars.
	- You can borrow a car from a friend and return it in a week.
	- If you forget your wallet,    you can ask your friend to buy a sandwich today with the agreement you will return the same sandwich tomorrow.
- If your "friend" see you very hungry today,    he may ask you to return a bigger sandwich tomorrow. I.e. charge a big *real* interest rate.
-  **Real bonds** are bonds that are denominated in units of a good instead of dollars.
-  Relevant to inflation linked securities are bonds that are denominated in units of the consumption basket that underlies the CPI index calculation.
-  A **real discount factor** $Z^{real}(t,    T)$ defines the *exchange rate* between consumption goods at t versus consumption goods at a later date T.
	- How "bigger" a sandwich are we willing to give back to the "friend" tomorrow to have a sandwich today?
## REAL RATES
-  From real discounts $Z_{real}(t,    T)$ compute the **real rate** as usual:
$$Z^{real}(t;T)=e^{-r_{real}(t;T)(T-t)}\times1\tag{19}$$
-  implies
$$r_{real}(t;T)=-\frac{\ln\left(Z^{real}(t;T)\right)}{T-t}\tag{20}$$
-  The **real term structure of interest rates** is r*real*(t; T) for maturities T.
-  The value (in consumption goods) of a real coupon bond with maturity T and coupon rate c is
$$P_{c}^{r e a l}(t;T)=\frac{c\times100}{2}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{r e a l}(t;T_{i})+100\times Z^{r e a l}(t;T)$$
## REAL BONDS AND TIPS
-  Suppose an investment bank purchases a TIPS and strips the coupons from principal,    generating a series of zero coupon bonds.
-  These zero coupon bonds pay an amount that is tied to the CPI.
-  Denoting by *Idx*(T) the CPI adjustment for maturity T (recall,    it depends on the CPI two months earlier),    the payoff of a zero coupon TIPS is as follows:
Zero-coupon TIPS payoff at $T$ = $$Z_{TIPS}=\dfrac{Idx(T)}{Idx(0)} \tag{21}$$ 
-  Idx(T)*/Idx*(0) = increase in the consumption basket price between 0 and T.
-  For simplicity,    assume $Idx(T) = CPI(T) =$ price of one unit of consumption basket
+  Given $Z^{real}(t,    T)$,    the value at t of a security paying *Idx*(T) (i.e. the amount needed to purchase one unit of consumption basket) is
	+ Present value of $Idx(T) = PV$ of one unit of consumption = $Z^{real}(t,    T)$
## REAL BONDS AND TIPS (CNTD)
-  This present value though is expressed in terms of units of the consumption basket ($Z_{real}(t,    T$) is an exchange rate of consumption at t for consumption at T).
-  We can convert this value to dollars by multiplying it by the *current* price of the consumption basket $Idx(t)$. We then obtain
	- Dollar present value of $Idx(T)=Z^{real}(t;T)\times Idx(t)$
Finally,    to obtain the payoff of the zero-coupon TIPS we must divide by$Idx(0)$:
Dollar value of a zero-coupon TIPS =$Z^{TIPS}(t;T)=Z^{real}(t;T)\times\frac{Idx(t)}{Idx(0)}$(22)
-  Given the value of zero-coupon TIPS,    we can value coupon bearing TIPS. -  Therefore,    a TIPS value at t,    with maturity T,    and coupon rate c is given by
$$P_{c}^{TIPS}(t;T)=\frac{Idx(t)}{Idx(0)}\times\left[\frac{c\times100}{2}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{real}(t;T_{i})+Z^{real}(t;T)\right]\tag{23}$$
## FITTING THE REAL YIELD CURVE
-  Clearly,    zero-coupon real bonds Z*real*(t; Ti) are not observable,    but they are embedded in the prices of TIPS.
-  We can use the price of TIPS to "back out" the discount factors Z*real*(t; Ti).
-  One limitation compared to the case of Treasuries is that we do not have available
as many bond prices,    and therefore the bootstrapping strategy is not applicable.
-  However,    we can use the curve fitting method using a flexible function for the
discount factor,    such as the Nelson Siegel model
$$r_{real}(0,   T)\ =\ \theta_{0}+(\theta_{1}+\theta_{2})\,   \frac{1-e^{-\frac{T}{\kappa_{1}}}}{\frac{T}{\kappa_{1}}}-\theta_{2}e^{-\frac{T}{\kappa_{1}}}+\theta_{3}\left(\frac{1-e^{-\frac{T}{\kappa_{2}}}}{\frac{T}{\kappa_{2}}}-e^{-\frac{T}{\kappa_{2}}}\right)\tag{24}$$
- From the previous table,    for instance,    we obtain the following results

-  Negative *real* rates are not uncommon.
- We give back our "friend" a smaller sandwich because its price skyrocketed.
## NOMINAL AND REAL INTEREST RATES
-  What is the relation between real and nominal rates?
-  We now show that nominal rate = real rate + expected inflation + inflation risk premium− convexity
-  Consider first the value today of$1 at T
$$Z(0,   T)=e^{-r(0,   T)T}\times\$1$$
- Alternatively,    we can express this in "consumption goods": $1 at T will buy C(T) = $\frac{1}{CPI(T)}$ units of consumption good.
-  Unfortunately,    this amount is not known today,    because CPI(T) is stochastic.
-  To compute the present value we need more assumptions.
-  Let π be the annualized inflation rate between 0 and T
$$\pi=\frac{1}{T}\ln\left(\frac{\mathsf{C P I}(T)}{\mathsf{C P I}(0)}\right)$$
## THE FISHER EQUATION UNDER PERFECT FORESIGHT
-  Consider first *Perfect Foresight*: Assume investors know π and hence CPI(T).
-  Then the value today of$1 at T in consumption good units is
$$\mathrm{Present~value~of}\;\;\;C(T)=Z^{r e a l}(0,   T)\times C(T)=Z^{r e a l}(0,   T)\times{\frac{\S1}{\mathsf{CPI}(T)}}$$
-  To obtain the *dollar* value,    we multiply this by the price of consumption good
$$\mathsf{D o l l a r \ pre se n t\;v a lu e\;o f\;\;}C(T)=\mathsf{C P I}(0)\left(Z^{r e a l}(0,   T)\times{\frac{\$1}{\mathsf{C P I}(T)}}\right)$$
-  The RHS is the$value of the quantity of consumption purchased by$1 at T.
-  It is therefore a *nominal* discount,    yielding the equality
$$Z(0,   T)=Z^{r e a l}(0,   T)\times\frac{\mathsf{C P I}(0)}{\mathsf{C P I}(T)}$$
-  Substitute to obtain the Fisher equation:
$$r(0,   T)=r_{r e a l}(0,   T)+\pi$$
## INFLATION RISK PREMIUM
-  Assume now inflation rate is not known and assume it is log-normal
$$\log\left(\frac{\mathsf{CPI}(T)}{\mathsf{CPI}(0)}\right)=x\sim\mathcal{N}(\pi\ T,   \sigma\pi^{2}\ T)$$
- This implies that the amount of consumption we can buy at $T$ is stochastic:
$$C(T)=\frac{\$1}{\mathsf{CPI}(T)}=\$1\times\frac{e^{-x}}{\mathsf{CPI}(0)}$$
-  Because C(T) is now risky,    we cannot discount it to today using the real bond
$$Z_{real}(0,    T) = e^{−r_{real}(0,   T)T}$$,    but we thus must add a risk premium κ.
-  Multiplying also by CPI(0) to obtain the dollar value,    we obtain
Dollar Present value of expected $C(T)=e^{-(r_{real}(0,   T)+\kappa)T}\times E[e^{-x}]$
$$=e^{-(r_{real}(0,   T)+\kappa)T}\times e^{-\pi T+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}T}$$
- This is dollar present value of \$1 at $T$. Therefore it equals$ Z(0,   T)=e^{-r(0,   T)T}$.
$$r(0,   T)=r_{real}(0,   T)+\pi+\kappa-\frac{1}{2}\sigma\pi^{2}$$
## THE ECONOMICS OF FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS
-  We now link all this to economic growth and agents' decisions.
-  We assume that investors have a utility function $U(C(t),    t)$. This is:
	- Decreasing with time: Eating soon is better than eating later.
	- Increasing in consumption: Eating more is better than eating less.
	- Concave: =⇒ Risk aversion: An amount of consumption that is *certain* is better than a fair bet to have more or less.
$$E\left[U(C)\right]<U\left(E[C]\right)$$
-  A widely used utility function is the Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA):
$$U(C,   t)=e^{-\rho t}\frac{C^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma}$$
$-\rho=$time-preference parameter
$-\gamma=-CU^{\prime\prime}(C)/U^{\prime}(C)=$relative risk aversion parameter.
## OPTIMAL SAVINGS
## INVESTMENT CONTEXT 
- An investor has wage $w(0)$ today and a random amount $w(T)$ at $T$. 
- Then investor consumption plan is $C(0) = \frac{w(0)}{CPI(0)}$ and $C(T) = \frac{w(T)}{CPI(T)}$.
- Suppose the investor now has an unexpected bonus today of $100 dollars.
- ## Decision Scenarios 
- ### Scenario 1: Immediate Consumption
1. Spend $100 today and buy $\frac{\$100}{CPI(0)}$ amount of the consumption good,    which will procure him/her an additional amount of utility
   - $$U'(C(0),    0) \times \frac{\$100}{CPI(0)}$$
   ### SCENARIO 2: DEFERRED CONSUMPTION
1. Save the 100 dollars,    and buy $\frac{\$100}{Z(0,   T)}$ zero coupon bonds with maturity $T$. At that time,    the investor can buy $\frac{1}{Z(0,   T) CPI(T)}$ of the consumption good,    for an additional amount of utility
$$\frac{\$100}{Z\left(0,   T\right)}\frac{1}{\mathsf{CPI}(T)}U^{\prime}\left(C(T),   T\right)$$
## EQUILIBRIUM
-  Equilibrium requires the agent to be indifferent between 1 and 2. Because quantities at T are unknown,    the indifference condition is
$$U^{\prime}\left(C(0)\right)\times{\frac{\$100}{\mathsf{CPI}(0)}}=E\left[{\frac{\$100}{Z\left(0,   T\right)\mathsf{CPI}(T)}}U^{\prime}\left(C(T),   T\right)\right]$$
-  By reshuffling,    we obtain
$$Z(0,   T)=E\left[\frac{\mathsf{CPI}(0)}{\mathsf{CPI}(T)}\times\frac{U^{\prime}(C(T),   T)}{U^{\prime}(C(0))}\right]$$
- In aggregate,    real consumption $C(t)$ depends on *real*$\mathsf{GDP}\ Y(t)$.
-  Assume that inflation and real GDP growth have the joiny log-normal distribution
$$\left.\begin{pmatrix}\log\left(\frac{\mathsf{CPl}(T)}{\mathsf{CPl}(0)}\right)\\\log\left(\frac{Y(T)}{Y(0)}\right)\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}\thicksim\mathcal{N}\left(\begin{pmatrix}\overline{\pi}\\\overline{g}T\end{pmatrix}\right.,   \begin{pmatrix}\sigma\pi^2T&,   &\sigma\pi\sigma_g\rho_{g,   \pi}T\\\sigma\pi\sigma_g\rho_{g,   \pi}T&,   &\sigma_g^2T\end{pmatrix}\right)$$
## EQUILIBRIUM PRICES 
### CRRA UTILITY FUNCTION
- Substitute the CRRA utility function:
  - $$U'(C,    t) = e^{-\rho t} C(t)^{-\gamma}$$
- And use $C(t) = Y(t)$ for $t = 0,    T$ to find:
  - $$Z(0,    T) = E\left[ e^{-x} \times \frac{e^{-\rho T} Y(T)^{-\gamma}}{Y(0)^{-\gamma}} \right]$$
  - $$Z(0,    T) = E\left[ e^{-\rho T} \times e^{-x-\gamma y} \right]$$
  - $$Z(0,    T) = e^{-\rho T} \times e^{-\pi T -\gamma} + \frac{1}{2}(\pi^2 + \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + 2 \gamma \sigma_g \sigma_{g,   \pi})T$$
### NOMINAL RATE CALCULATION
- Thus,    the nominal rate is:
  - $$r(0,    T) = \left( \rho + \gamma g - \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_g^2 \right) + \left( \pi - \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 \right) - \gamma \pi \sigma_g \rho_{g,   \pi}$$
    - **Real Rate $r_{real}(0,    T)$**: $\rho + \gamma g - \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_g^2$
    - **Expected Inflation & Convexity**: $\pi - \frac{1}{2} \pi^2$
    - **Risk Premium**: $-\gamma \pi \sigma_g \rho_{g,   \pi}$
## THE ECONOMICS OF THE REAL RATE
-  Following the same steps as above but using TIPS zero-coupon bonds ZTIPS(0,    T)
instead of nominal bonds Z(0,    T) we obtain the real rate as:
$$r_{r e a l}(0,   T)=\rho+\gamma\overline{{{g}}}-\frac{\gamma^{2}}{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}$$
-  The real rate depends on:
1. Time preference $ρ$:
	- High $ρ$ implies investors want to consume today rather then tomorrow. They will sell their (real) bonds which increase their yield.
2. The expected growth rate of the economy $g$:
	- If $g$ is high we expect to be rich at $T$ and hence consume a lot then. High $γ$ implies we want "stable consumption" over time. Hence we want to borrow to consume more today,    which increases real rates.
3. The volatility of GDP growth $σg$
	- Higher economic risk implies a higher desire to save for the "rainy days". We buy more (real) bonds,    which push their prices up and decrease yields.
	- The higher the risk aversion γ and the more we want to save.
## INFLATION RISK PREMIUM
-  We found $$\text{inflation risk premium} = −γσπσ_gρ_{g,   π}$$
-  where $$ρ_{g,   π} = \text{Correlation (Inflation,    real GDP growth)}$$
+  Intuitively:
	+ If $ρ_{g,   π} <0 \rho_{g\pi}$ =⇒ high inflation occurs when real GDP is low
		+ nominal bond is devalued in recessions,    when people most need the money! 
		+ -very risky security =⇒ high risk premium =⇒ high long-term yield
-  Next figures show that the correlation $ρ_{g,   π}$ was negative until late 1990s. It then became closer to zero. And then became strongly positive around 2008.
-  In the meantime,    real GDP volatility σg and inflation volatility σπ declined.
-  All of these variation are bound to impact the risk premium.

## EXPECTED EXCESS RETURN: THE MARKET MODEL
-  Another way to understand the risk premium of nominal bonds is to look at its
variation with the stock market
-  Under the CAPM,    for instance
$$E\ [\text{ Excess Return Nominal Bond}] = β × E\ [\text{ Excess Return Market}]$$
-  Next figure shows the time variation in the correlation between stock and bonds,   
and the corresponding CAPM beta.
-  Why did the CAPM beta change over time?
- David and Veronesi (2013,    JPE): Time varying role of inflation signals
- Late 1970s/ early 1980s: *Fear of stagflation* (high inflation and low growth)
=⇒ high inflation shocks are bad news for the economy =⇒ both nominal bonds and stock drop
- Mid 2000s: *Fear of deflation* (low inflation and low growth)
=⇒ high inflation shocks are good news for the economy =⇒ nominal bonds drop but stock rise

## MORE GENERAL FORMULAS
-  All previous formulas have "flat" term structures: r(0,    T) and rreal(0,    T) do not depend on T.
-  They can be generalized by assuming that expected inflation πt and expected GDP growth gt are time varying.
-  Using the continuous time methodology,    for instance,    we may assume
$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{d\pi_{t}\;=\;(\alpha\pi-\beta\pi\pi_{t})d t+\sigma_{\pi}\;d W_{\pi}}}\\ {{}}&{{d\bar{g}_{t}\;=\;(\alpha_{g}-\beta_{g}\bar{g}_{t})d t+\sigma_{\bar{g}}\;d W_{\bar{g}}}}\end{array}$$
- Inflation and real GDP growth themselves are
$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{d\log(\mathsf{CPI}_{t})\;=\;\pi_{t}d t+\sigma_{\pi}\;d W_{\pi}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{d\log(Y_{t})\;=\;\bar{g}_{t}d t+\sigma_{g}\;d W_{g}}}\end{array}$$
-  The same argument as above has
$$Z(t,   T)=E_{t}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C P I}(t)}{\mathsf{C P I}(T)}e^{-\rho(T-t)}\left(\frac{Y(T)}{Y(t)}\right)^{-\gamma}\right]$$
## BOND PRICING FORMULAS
-  Solving the expectation,    we obtain
$$Z(t,   T)=e^{A(t,   T)-B(t,   T)\overline{{{\pi}}}_{t}-C(t,   T)\gamma\overline{{{g}}}_{t}}$$
-  where
$$B(t,   T)=\frac{1-e^{-\beta\pi(T-t)}}{\beta\pi};\ \ \ \ \ C(t,   T)=\frac{1-e^{-\beta_{g}(T-t)}}{\beta_{g}}$$
- and $A(t,   T)$ is a complicated function of maturity $(T-t)$ which includes risk premia and other terms further discussed below.
-  The nominal yield curve is then
$$r(t,   T)=\frac{-A(t,   T)}{T-t}+\frac{B(t,   T)}{T-t}\ \pi_{t}+\frac{C(t,   T)}{T-t}\ \gamma g_{t}$$
- A higher expected inflation increases nominal yield,    but differentially across maturities
- A higher expected real growth increases nominal yields,    but differentially across maturities
## THE FUNCTION A(T,   T)
## BOND PRICING WITH MULTIPLE RISKS AND CONVEXITIES
- $A(t,    T)$ represents the pricing kernel for a bond from time $t$ to maturity $T$,    incorporating various risks and convexity effects:$$
  A(t,    T) = \left( -\rho + \frac{1}{2} \pi^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \gamma \rho_{g} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \right) (T - t)
  + \left[ \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi \pi} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_{\pi} + \gamma \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g - \alpha_{\pi} + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 + \frac{\gamma \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g}{\beta_{\pi} + \beta_g} \right] \left( \frac{1}{\beta_{\pi}} \left( (T - t) - B(t,    T) \right) \right)
  + \left[ \sigma_g \rho_{g \pi} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g + \gamma \sigma_g \rho_{gg} \sigma_g - \alpha_g + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \frac{\gamma \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g}{\beta_{\pi} + \beta_g} \right] \left( \gamma \left( (T - t) - C(t,    T) \right) \right)
  - \frac{1}{4} \gamma^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 B(t,    T)^2 - \gamma \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g B(t,    T) C(t,    T)
  $$

- Many risk premia are accounted for in bond pricing:
	  1. **Inflation risk premium**:$\gamma \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_g$. If$\rho_{\pi g} < 0 \Rightarrow Z(t,    T) \uparrow \Rightarrow r(t,    T) \uparrow$
	  1. **Expected inflation risk premium**:$\gamma \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} \sigma_{\pi}$. If$\rho_{g,    \pi} < 0 \Rightarrow r(t,    T) \uparrow$
	  1. **Expected growth risk premium**:$\gamma \sigma_g \rho_{g g} \sigma_g$. If$\rho_{g,    g} < 0 \Rightarrow r(t,    T) \uparrow$
- Bond pricing also includes multiple convexity effects.
## THE SHORT-TERM RATE AND MONETARY POLICY INTERPRETATION
## INTEREST RATE FORMULATION AND MONETARY POLICY
### OVERNIGHT RATE FORMULA
- As we take the limit$T - t \rightarrow 0$,  we obtain the formula for the "overnight" rate:
  $$
  r_t = \rho + \gamma g_t - \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_g^2 + \pi_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\pi}^2 - \gamma \pi_t \sigma_g \rho_{\pi,    g}
  $$
  - **Real Rate$r_{real,   t}$**:$\rho + \gamma g_t - \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_g^2$
  - **Expected Inflation & Convexity**:$\pi_t - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\pi}^2$
  - **Risk Premium**:$-\gamma \pi_t \sigma_g \rho_{\pi,    g}$
### TAYLOR RULE
- The Federal Reserve is believed to follow the so-called "Taylor rule" in setting its target Federal Fund rate,  which specifies:
  $$
  r_t = \alpha + \beta_1(\text{output}_t - \text{potential output}) + \beta_1(\pi_t - \text{target inflation})
  $$
- The "forward looking" Taylor rule uses "expected inflation" and expected output to their realized values.
- The result above can be casted in terms of monetary policy actions:
  $$
  r_t = \alpha + \gamma(g_t - \text{potential output}) + (\pi_t - \text{target inflation})
  $$
  - where$\alpha = \rho - \frac{\gamma^2}{2} \sigma_g^2 - \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\pi}^2 - \gamma \pi_t \sigma_g \rho_{\pi,    g} + \gamma \text{potential output} + \text{target inflation}$
## THE DYNAMICS OF THE REAL RATE
- From previous results and using Ito's formula,  the real rate follows a Vasicek model
$$d r_{r e a l,   t}=\beta_{g}\left(\bar{r}_{r e a l}-r_{r e a l,   t}\right)d t+\sigma_{r e a l}d W_{\bar{g}}$$
where
$$\overline{{{r}}}_{r e a l}=\rho+\gamma\frac{\alpha_{g}}{\beta_{g}}-\frac{\gamma^{2}\sigma_{\overline{{{g}}}}^{2}}{2};\quad\sigma_{r e a l}=\gamma\sigma_{\overline{{{g}}}}$$
- The real zero-coupon bond pricing formula is then
$$Z_{r e a l}(t,   T)=e^{\overline{{{A}}}(t,   T)-C(t,   T)r_{r e a l,   t}}$$
- where
$$\overline{A}(t,   T)=\left(\overline{r}_{real}^{*}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\sigma_{real}^{2}}{\beta_{g}^{2}}\right)\left[C(t,   T)-(T-t)\right]-\frac{C(t,   T)^{2}\sigma_{real}^{2}}{4\beta_{g}}$$
- where$\overline{r}_{real}^{*}=\overline{r}_{real}-\gamma\sigma_{g}\sigma_{real}\rho_{\rho,   real}$
- The above result was found in
- The risk neutral process of the real rate is
$$d r_{r e a l,   t}=\beta_{g}\left(\overline{{{r}}}_{r e a l}^{*}-r_{r e a l,   t}\right)d t+\sigma_{r e a l}d W_{g}^{*}$$
## FITTING REAL VASICEK TO TIPS
- We can use TIPS again to extract the real zero coupon bond prices - The procedure is the same for nominal Vasicek (see TN 7),  except with the
additional difficulty that we may not know what the short-term real rate rreal,  t
actually is.
- One possibility is to estimate r*real,  t* as well together with other quantities.
- For instance,  fixing σ*real* = (estimated from the time series of real rates),
we estimate the following parameters for November 27,  2007:
$$\beta_{g}^{*}=0.0166,   \;\;\;\bar{r}_{r e a l}^{*}=0.1695,   \;\;\;r_{r e a l}=0.0046$$
- The fit is not as good as with the Extended Nelson-Siegel model in this case. - Next figure shows the fitted term structure of real rates.

## CONCLUSIONS
- The term structure of interest rate depend on:
1. Expectation of future inflation 2. Expectation of future real growth 3. A whole set of risk premia
- Inflation risk premium
- Expected inflation risk premium - Expected growth risk premium
- Multi-factor models tend to fit well the term structure of interest rates
- The above setting with expected inflation and expected GDP growth can be generalized to any factors$ϕ_{1,   t},    ϕ_{2,   t}….$
- Moreover,  pricing formulas can be obtained using no-arbitrage methodologies,  as in TN 7.

# APPENDIX: DERIVATION OF TWO FACTOR MODEL

Define
$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{q}}&{{=}}&{{\log\left(\mathsf{C P I}\right)}}\\ {{y}}&{{=}}&{{\log\left(Y\right)}}\end{array}$$
so that
$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{d q}}&{{=}}&{{\overline{{{\pi}}}_{t}d t+\sigma_{\pi}d W_{\pi}}}\\ {{d y}}&{{=}}&{{\overline{{{g}}}_{t}d t+\sigma_{g}d W_{g}}}\end{array}$$
and recall$$d\overline{\pi}_{t}=\left(\alpha_{\pi}-\beta_{\pi}\pi_{t}\right)dt+\sigma_{\overline{\pi}}dW_{\overline{\pi}}$$$$d\overline{g}=\left(\alpha_{g}-\beta_{g}\pi_{t}\right)dt+\sigma_{\overline{\pi}}dW_{\overline{g}}$$
From the pricing equation we have
$$Z\left(t,   T\right)=E\left[e^{-\rho\left(T-t\right)-\left(q\left(T\right)-q\left(t\right)\right)-\gamma\left(y\left(T\right)-y\left(t\right)\right)}\right]$$
To be slightly more general,  consider the following case.
$$\begin{array}{l l l}{{Z\left(t,   T\right)}}&{{=}}&{{E\left[e^{-\rho\left(T-t\right)-\eta\left(q\left(T\right)-q\left(t\right)\right)-\gamma\left(y\left(T\right)-y\left(t\right)\right)}\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{e^{\eta q\left(t\right)+\gamma y\left(t\right)}E\left[e^{-\rho\left(T-t\right)}G\left(q\left(T\right),   y\left(T\right)\right)\right]}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{e^{\eta q\left(t\right)+\gamma y\left(t\right)}V\left(q,   y,   \overline{{{\pi}}},   \overline{{{g}}},   t\right)}}\end{array}$$
When$\eta = 1$we have the case for nominal bonds. When$\eta = 0$we have the case of real bonds. When$\eta$is intermediate,  this can be considered a case in which inflation affects the utility function of agents directly. A case in the literature is the one of money illusion.
From the Feynman Kac formula,  we have that$V$satisfies
$$\rho V = V_t + V_q E[dq] + V_y E[dy] + V_{\pi} E[d\pi] + \frac{1}{2} V_{qq} E[dq^2] + \frac{1}{2} V_{yy} E[dy^2] + \frac{1}{2} V_{\pi\pi} E[d\pi^2] + \frac{1}{2} V_{qy} E[dq dy] + \frac{1}{2} V_{q\pi} E[dq d\pi] + \frac{1}{2} V_{y\pi} E[dy d\pi]$$
with final condition

- $V(q,    y,    \pi,    T,    T) = e^{-\eta q(T) - y(T)}$
We can conjecture the following
- $V(q,    y,    r,    t,    T) = e^{-\eta q(T) - y(T)}$
Taking the first derivatives
- $V_{\pi} = A'(t; T) - \eta B'(t; T) - C'(t; T) V$
- $V_q = -\eta V; V_{qq} = \eta^2 V; V_{qy} = \eta V; V_{q\pi} = \eta B'(t; T) V; V_g = \gamma C'(t; T) V$
- $V_y = -V; V_{yy} = V; V_{y\pi} = \gamma B'(t; T) V; V_{\pi\pi} = \gamma^2 C'(t,    T) V$
- $V_g = -\gamma B(t,    T) V; V_{gg} = \gamma^2 C(t,    T) V^2$
Substituting and deleting the common$V$
$$\rho = A'(t; T) - \eta B'(t; T) - \gamma C'(t; T) + \eta \pi - \eta \gamma \pi B(t,    T) - \gamma C'(t,    T) - (\alpha_{\pi} - \beta_{\pi}\pi) + \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \eta B'(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi\pi} + \gamma C'(t,    T) \sigma_g \rho_{gg} + \eta \gamma B(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \gamma C(t,    T) \sigma_g^2$$
Factor out variables$\pi$and$g$:
$$\rho = -\eta B'(t; T) + 1 - \eta \gamma C'(t; T) + \eta \pi - \eta \gamma \pi B(t,    T) - \gamma C'(t,    T) + A'(t; T) + \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \eta B'(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi\pi} + \gamma C'(t,    T) \sigma_g \rho_{gg} + \eta \gamma B(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \gamma C(t,    T) \sigma_g^2$$
This is satisfied for all values of$\pi$and$g$if and only if the following system is satisfied:
- $0 = B'(t; T) + 1 - B(t,    T)$
- $0 = C'(t; T) + 1 - C(t,    T)$
and
$$\rho = A'(t; T) - \eta B'(t,    T) - \gamma C'(t,    T) + \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \eta B'(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi\pi} + \gamma C'(t,    T) \sigma_g \rho_{gg} + \eta \gamma B(t,    T) \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \gamma C(t,    T) \sigma_g^2$$
with final conditions
- $B(T,    T) = 0; C(T,    T) = 0; A'(T; T) = 0$
The first two ODEs have solutions
- $B(t,    T) = \frac{1 - e^{-\beta_{\pi}(T-t)}}{\beta_{\pi}}$
- $C(t,    T) = \frac{1 - e^{-\beta_g(T-t)}}{\beta_g}$
The last ODE has solution
$$A(t,    T) = \left(-\rho + \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 + \eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g}\right)(T - t) + \left[\eta \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi\pi} + \gamma \sigma_g \rho_{gg} - \rho \sigma_{\pi} \rho_{\pi g} + \frac{\eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g}{\beta_{\pi} + \beta_g}\right] \frac{1}{\beta_{\pi}} \left((T - t) - B(t,    T)\right) + \left[\eta \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} + \gamma \sigma_g \rho_{gg} - \rho \sigma_g \rho_{gg} + \frac{\gamma \sigma_g}{\beta_{\pi} + \beta_g}\right] \frac{1}{\beta_g} \left((T - t) - C(t,    T)\right) - \frac{1}{4} \gamma^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2 B(t,    T)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 C(t,    T)^2 - \frac{\eta \gamma \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} B(t,    T) C(t,    T)}{\beta_{\pi} + \beta_g}$$
Setting$\eta = 1$provides the formula for$A(t,    T)$in the text. Moreover,  the case$\eta = 0$corresponds to the real bond,  obtaining
$$A_{real}(t,    T) = \left(-\rho + \frac{1}{2} \sigma_{\pi}^2\right)(T - t) + \left[\eta \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g} - \rho \sigma_{\pi} \sigma_g \rho_{\pi g}\right] + \left[\gamma \sigma_g \rho_{gg} - \frac{1}{2} \eta \gamma^2 \sigma_{\pi}^2\right](T - t) + \left[\frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2\right] - \frac{1}{2} \gamma^2 \sigma_g^2 C(t,    T)^2$$
