## INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES: FORWARDS AND FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS
- Effective risk management is carried out using derivatives,  such as forward,  futures,  and swaps.
- Forward contracts and Forward Rate Agreements allow firms to lock in interest rates in the future.
- A **Forward Rate Agreement (FRA)** is a contract between two counterparties who agree at time 0 to exchange the following net payment at a future date$T_2$

$$\text{Net payment at }T_{2}=N\times\Delta\times[r_{n}(T_{1}, T_{2})-f_{n}]\tag{1}$$

- where$r_n(T_1,  T_2)$is a$n$−times compounded floating reference rate, $f_n$is a fixed rate, $N$is the notional,  and$∆ = 1/n$
- Example: Today (T0) is January 2,  2020 (we will treat this as January 1 …) and suppose a firm has a$100 million receivable in six months on June 30,  2020. Ignoring overnight investing:
- If the firm will not need that cash immediately,  but,  say,  six month later,  it can lock-in an investment rate today for the future period$T_1  = 0.5$is July 1,  2020 to$T_2  = 1$is December 31,  2020 by entering into a forward rate agreement (FRA) with a bank.
- Assume the bank quotes the (semi-annually compounded) annualized rate of$f_2 = 1.59\%$.
- When the firm receive \$100 million in six months ($T_1$) it can invest it at the then current floating rate$r_2(T_1,  T_2) = r_2(0.5,  1)$,  which is not known today.

#### A FORWARD INVESTMENT

![](aforwardinvestment.svg)

## HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK
- Clearly,  using the banks offer locks in the rate$f_{2}$for the period$T_1$to$T_2$for the firm,  as

$$\text{Total amount} = \left\{ \$100 \text{ million} \times \left[1 + \frac{f_2}{2}\right] \right\} \quad (\text{Return on investment})$$$$+ \left\{ \frac{N}{2} \times [f_2 - r_2(0.5,  1)] \right\} \quad (\text{FRA payment)}$$$$= \$100 \text{ million} \times \left[1 + \frac{f_2}{2}\right]$$$$= \$100\text{million} \times \left[1 + \frac{0.0159}{2}\right]= \$100.79 \text{ million}$$

- The question is: How does the bank determine the forward rate f2?
- Through a simple trading strategy.

## TRADING STRATEGY TO COMPUTE FORWARD RATE

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240414082741031.png)

- The bank is perfectly hedged.
- Note also that the quoted forward rate is effectively implicit in the ratio

$$M=\frac{Z(0, 0.5)}{Z(0, 1)}=1+\frac{f_{2}}{2}$$

- in the first step of the trading strategy.
- This fact leads to the notion of the forward discount factor,  given by$\frac{1}{M}$.

## THE FORWARD DISCOUNT FACTOR
- The **forward discount factor** at time$t$defines the time value of money between two future dates, $T_1$and$T_2  > T_{1}$.
- Given the discount factors$Z(t,  T_1)$and$Z(t,  T_2)$,  the forward discount factor is given by

$$F(t, T_{1}, T_{2})=\frac{Z(t, T_{2})}{Z(t, T_{1})}\tag{2}$$

- Indeed,  note that in the example$Z(0, 0.5)=0.9918$and$Z(0, 1)=0.9840$implying a forward discount factor$$F(0, 0.5, 1)=\frac{Z(0, 1)}{Z(0, 0.5)}=0.9921 \tag{3}$$
- From any discount factor (forward or not),  we can compute the$n-$times compound rate as$$f_{n}\left(t, T_{1}, T_{2}\right)=n\times\left(\frac{1}{F\left(t, T_{1}, T_{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{\left(n+\left(T_{2}-T_{1}\right)\right)}}}-1\right)\tag{4}$$
- For instance,  in the example we have

$$f_{2}(0, 0.5, 1)=2\times\left(\frac{1}{F\left(0, 0.5, 1\right)^{\frac{1}{2\times {0.5}}}}-1\right)=1.59\%, $$

## THE SPOT CURVE AND THE FORWARD CURVE

- The **forward curve** gives the relation between the forward rate$f(0,  T,  T + ∆)$and the time of.the investment T. Curves on January 2,  2020
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240412234143923.png)

## THE VALUE OF A FORWARD RATE AGREEMENT

- In previous example,  suppose 3 months later,  on April 1,  2020,  the firm decides to close its FRA.
- As interest rates changed between January and April,  so did the *value* of the FRA.
- Recall bank's earlier strategy:
	- (a) short one T-bill maturing at$T_1$and
	- (b) long$M = 1.0079$T-bills maturing at$T_2$.
- This portfolio (a) + (b) replicates the cash flow that the firm will receive.
	- =⇒ its value a$t$= value of the FRA for the firm. Thus:
Value of FRA to the firm at$t$$$=V^{FRA}\left(t\right)=M\times Z(t, T_{2})-Z(t, T_{1})\tag{5}$$
- On April 1,  2020 (= t),  we had$Z(t,  T_1) = \$0.9993$and$Z(t,  T_2) = \$0.9981$. Therefore
$$V^{FRA}_t = 1.0079 × Z(t,  T_2) − Z(t,  T_1) = 1.0079 × \$0.9981 − \$0.9993 = \$0.00671 million$$
	- =⇒ On April 1,  2020,  the FRA initiated 3 months earlier was worth$671, 176.83 to the firm.
- In general,  using the definition$1 + f_n(t,   T_1,  T_2)∆ = Z(t,   T_1)/Z(t,  T_2)$,  we have

$$V^{FRA}(t)=N\times Z(t, T_{2})\times\left[M-\frac{Z(t, T_{1})}{Z(t, T_{2})}\right]\tag{6}$$$$=N\times Z(t, T_{2})\times\Delta\times\left[f_{n}(0, T_{1}, T_{2})-f_{n}(t, T_{1}, T_{2})\right]$$

## INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES: SWAPS

- A plain vanilla **fixed-for-floating interest rate swap** is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange cash flows at$T_1,  T_2, …,  T_n = T$,  with$T_i = T_{i−1} + ∆$,  according to

Net Cash Flow at$$T_{i}=N\times\Delta\times[r_{n}(T_{i-1})-c]\tag{7}$$

- where$n = 1/∆$is the reference rate compounding frequency.
- The constant c is called **swap rate**.

## - HOW DO WE DETERMINE THE **VALUE OF A SWAP**?

- At inception,  the value is zero,  as the counterparties agree to swap future payments,  not today.
- After inception,  as the floating rate changes,  so does the value of the swap.
- Consider the party with net cash flow (7). This party is effectively long a floating rate bond ($P_{FR}(t,  T$)) and short a fixed rate bond with coupon$c (P_c(t,  T))$.
- =⇒ the value of the swap is

$$V^{swap}(t, c, T)=P_{FR}(t, T)-P_{c}(t, T)\tag{8}$$

- At every$T_i$,  the value of$PFR(T_i,  T) = 100$. Therefore,  at these times

$$V^{swap}(T_{i};c, T)=100-\left(\frac{c}{2}\times100\times\sum\limits_{j=i+1}^{M}Z(T_{i}, T_{j})+Z(T_{i}, T_{M})\times100\right)\tag{9}$$

## THE SWAP RATE AND THE SWAP CURVE

- How is the swap rate $c$ determined?
- The swap rate $c$ is given by that number that makes $V^{swap}(0; c,  T) = 0$ in (8).
- Rewriting the equation for any payment frequency$n$and payment dates$T_1,  … T_M$,  we have

$$V^{swap}(0;c, T)=100-\left(\frac{c}{n}\times100\times\sum\limits_{j=1}^{M}Z(0, T_{j})+Z(0, T_{M})\times100\right)=0\tag{10}$$

- Solving this equation for$c$we find

$$c=n\times\left(\frac{1-Z\left(0, T_{M}\right)}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{M}Z\left(0, T_{j}\right)}\right)\tag{11}$$

- The swap curve at time $t$ is the set of swap rates (at time $t$) for all maturities $T_{1}$,  $T_{2}$, …,  $T_{M}$.
- I denote the swap curve at time $t$ by $c (t,  T_{i}) \text{ for } i = 1,  …,  M$.

## THE SWAP CURVE AND THE "CLASSIC" LIBOR CURVE
- The swap curve implicitly contains the discount factors $Z(0,  T_i)$ that market participants use to quote swaps in the OTC market.
- From the swap curve,  we can then bootstrap out such discounts by inverting (11):

$$Z\left(t, T_{1}\right)=\frac{1}{1+\frac{c(t, T_{1})}{n}}\tag{12}$$

while for $i = 2,  …,  M$

$$Z\left(t, T_{i}\right)=\frac{1-\frac{c\left(t, T_{i}\right)}{n}\times\Sigma_{j=1}^{i-1}\, Z\left(t, T_{j}\right)}{1+\frac{c\left(t, T_{i}\right)}{n}}\tag{13}$$

- The resulting yield curve is called LIBOR curve.

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240412234909341.png)

### SWAP SPREAD TRADES AND THE RISK IN CONVERGENCE TRADES
- Today is June 30,  2006,  and we are looking to make a profit on the swap spread.
- The market presented the following data:
	- 3-month LIBOR: 5.5081%.
	- 3-month repo rate: 5.27%.
	- 5-year swap rate: 5.69%.
	- 5-year T-note with a 5.125% coupon priced at$100.1172,
	- and yield-to-maturity 5.10%.
- The swap spread equals the yield to maturity of the Treasury note minus the swap rate

$$S S=5.69\%-5.10\%=0.59\%=59\ b p s$$

- That is,  receiving the fixed rate from the swap and paying the yield in a short T-notes would return 59 basis points per year.
- To secure this return of 59 basis points,  we have to pay the LIBOR rate,  as part of the swap,  and receives the repo rate,  as part of a [Reverse Repurchase](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md) agreement to short the T-note.

## THE LIBOR-REPO SPREAD
- The spread between LIBOR and repo (LRS) is$LRS = 5.5081\% − 5.27\% = 0.2381\%$
- The net spread is$SS − LRS = 35.19$bps.
- This spread is not very large,  but the LIBOR-repo spread has been historically relatively stable at around 21 bps and so this net spread (SS − *LRS*) still appears a relatively safe trade.
- Using daily data from Jan 2000 to Jun 2006,  the distribution of the LIBOR-repo spread is as
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413020653936.png)
- Even in extreme circumstances,  the net spread would be at least$0.59\% − 0.37\% = 22 bps$

## THE TRADE
- We finally decided to go ahead,  and enter into the following transactions:
1. Short the 5-year bond through a [Reverse Repo](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md) transaction. In cash flow terms,  the fund would receive the repo rate and pay the coupon.
1. Enter into a fixed-for-floating swap,  in which we would receive fixed and pay LIBOR.
#### REVERSE REPO
- We want to set up a$100 million trade. Thus,  we need to sell
$$N=\frac{\$100\text{million}}{100.1172}=998, 829\text{ Treasury notes (for }\$100\text{ par value)}\tag{14}$$
- Assuming haircut = 0,  we then borrow N = 998,  829 5-year T-notes from the repo dealer,  sells them in the cash market for$100 million,  and gives this cash to the repo dealer.
- Assume we enter into a term [Reverse Repo](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md) with 3-months maturity,  and rolls it over every three months.
- Because the repo dealer keeps the \$100 million at every reset date,  our total cash flow every quarter is$$\left.\text{[Reverse Repo] CF}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{\$100\textbf{ mm}}{4}\times r(t-0.25)-N\times100\times\frac{5.125\%}{2}&\text{if }t\text{ is a coupon date}\\\frac{\$100\textbf{ mm}}{4}\times r(t-0.25)&\text{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\right.$$

#### FIXED -FOR-FLOATING SWAP
- We have to enter into a 5-year,  fixed-for-floating swap in which we pay the 3-month LIBOR rate and receive the 5-year fixed swap rate.
- In a plain vanilla fixed-for-floating swap,  the floating payments occur at quarterly frequency,  while the fixed payments occur at semi-annual frequency,  therefore exactly matching the payment frequency of the [Reverse Repo](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md) transaction discussed earlier.
- Denoting ℓ(t) is the 3-month LIBOR rate at time t,  the swap cash flows are then given by

$$
\left.\text{Swap CF}(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{c}\$100\mathrm{~mm}\times\frac{5.69\%}2-\frac{\$100\mathrm{~mm}}4\times\ell(t-0.25)\mathrm{~if~}t\mathrm{~is~fixed~payment~date}\\-\frac{\$100\mathrm{~mm}}4\times\ell(t-0.25)\mathrm{~otherwise}\end{array}\right.\right.
$$

## THE QUARTERLY CASH FLOW
-It is useful to decompose the quarterly cash flow in two components,  the swap spread (SS) component and the LIBOR-repo spread (LRS) component.
- We have that every six months,  the swap spread component of the cash flow is

$$\text{SS CF every six months } =\$100\mathtt{mm}\times\dfrac{5.69\%}{2}-N\times100\times\dfrac{5.125\%}{2}$$$$=\$285, 499.73$$

- The second component is the LIBOR-repo spread,  which every quarter is given by

$$\text{LRS CF every three months} =\dfrac{\$100\text{mm}}{4}\times(r(t-0.25)-\ell(t-0.25))$$

- For instance,  on June 30 the$r(0) = 5.27\%$while$ℓ(0) = 5.5081$%,  implying

$$\text{LRS CF on September 30,  2006 }=$-\$59, 525.00$\tag{15}$$

- Since the LIBOR-repo spread is relatively stable,  we expect to receive approximately

$$\text{Total expected net cash flow per year }=2\times\$285, 499.73-4\times\$59, 525.00 =\$332, 898$$

- ….but risk may be just around the corner …

### NET CASH FLOWS FROM SWAP SPREAD TRADE

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413001954481.png)

## UNWINDING THE POSITION?

- Given the large negative quarterly payments due to the increase in the LIBOR-repo spread,  we
may start thinking about whether we should unwind their position.
- First question is: What is the value of the position?

## - THE VALUE OF THE [[Reverse Repurchase]]

- The ex-coupon value of the repo position on rollover quarter$t$is

$$\text{Value [Reverse Repo](} =\$100 mm -N\times P_{note}(t, T)$$

- where$P_{note}(t,  T)$is the value of the T-note at time t.
#### - THE VALUE OF THE FIXED-FOR-FLOATING SWAP

- As time passes and interest rates fluctuate,  the value of the swap changes. We have:

$$\mathrm{Value~swap~at~}t=P_{c}(t, T)-P_{F R}(t, T)$$

- where PFR(*t,  T*) is the LIBOR-based floating rate bond,  and Pc(*t,  T*) is the fixed rate coupon
bond with coupon c = 5.69% =swap rate,  given by

$$P_{c}(t, T)=\frac{100\times5.69\%}{2}\times\sum_{i=1}^{n_{t}}Z(t, T_{i})+100\times Z(t, T_{n_{t}})$$

- Here, $Z(t,  T_i)$is the LIBOR discount curve (see next Figure)
### THE LIBOR CURVE: JUNE 2006 – JUNE 2008

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413002218281.png)

## THE SURPRISE

- On March,  2008,  as we start unwinding the position,  we have a good news: the value of the swap is now$10.21 million.
- Indeed,  the LIBOR yield curve now ranges between 2.7% at 1 month,  and 3.3% at 5 years,  which pushes up the value of the fixed part of the swap to$110.21 million.
- Because the floating part is always equal to$100 million at reset dates,  by closing the position we would obtain an inflow of$10.21 million.
- However,  as we close the swap,  we have also to close the [Reverse Repo](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md).
- The bad news is that now the T-note we are shorting is trading at$110.23.
- Given the accrued interest of$1.28,  the total losses from the short position amount to$100 million −N ×$111.51 = −$11.38 million.
- In sum,  to close the position on March,  2008,  we receive$10.21 million from the swap,  but we have to pay$11.38 million on the [Reverse Repo](Reverse%20Repurchase%20Agreement%20Operations.md),  for a total loss of$1.16 million. This number far outweighs the cumulative cash flows we have so far received.

## THE SWAP SPREAD TRADE VALUE

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413002314426.png)

### CONCLUSION: THE RISK IN RELATIVE VALUE TRADES

1. **Cost of Carry**,  due to the variation in the cost-of-carry,  i.e. the cash-flow per period that a trade is expected to generate.
	- In swap spread trade,  it is the difference between the swap spread and the LIBOR-repo rate.
	- An arbitrageurs may find that holding up the trade is generating cash outflows that outstrip the expected gain from convergence.
1. **Market Risk**,  that is,  the potential capital losses due to the variation in the underlying spread.
	- In a relative value trade speculators bet on the convergence of the underlying spread to an average level.
	- However,  such spread may either not converge to the average level,  or just widen for a while.
1. **Funding Risk**,  that is,  the ability to hold up the position until maturity.
	- Even for those (arbitrage) trades in which a hedge fund is certain to make profits if it holds the position until maturity,  it is quite possible that the spread may widen further before it narrows.
	- If the spread widens,  then the hedge fund would potentially suffer large capital losses.
	- It is then key for the hedge fund survival that it has sufficient capital in cash or a large borrowing capacity that makes it able to withstand the capital loss.

## FUNDING RISK DURING THE CRISIS?

- Funding risk is especially important during periods of crisis,  for a number of reasons:
1. All risk-based spreads - the spreads between a risky securities and Treasury securities - tend to widen,  as investors dump risky securities and purchase safe U.S. Treasuries.
	- =⇒ Relative value trades experience large capital losses.
1. Lenders are more wary of default risk,  and increase haircuts,  margins,  etc.,  making capital effectively more scarce
	- It becomes harder for a hedge fund to keep up the position.
1. Investors withdraw money from hedge funds,  if they can.
- Hedge funds must liquidate positions,  at a loss.
- Next figure shows negative swap spreads during the crisis for long term swaps

### NEGATIVE SWAP SPREADS DURING THE CRISIS

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413002516315.png)

## NEGATIVE SWAP SPREAD AND NO ARBITRAGE

- Negative swap spreads are a textbook arbitrage opportunity:
- Buy Treasury and pay fixed in a fixed for floating swap
$\Longrightarrow$Cash Flow at$t=\left(c^{T-Bond}-c^{swap}\right)+\left(LIBOR_{t}-REPO_{t}\right)$
- Both terms are positive. The first because of the negative swap spread,  and the second because
LIBOR is the rate for uncollateralized borrowing,  while REPO is the rate for collateralized borrowing.
- This is a textbook arbitrage opportunity if an arbitrageur can hold the position to maturity.
- The risk of the spread increasing further,  generating severe capital losses,  may make arbitrageurs wary of entering the market.
- At reset dates,  the value of the trade is

$$V_{t}^{T r a d e}=(P_{c}^{T-B o n d}(t, T)-P_{c}^{S w a p}(t, T))$$

- If the swap spread becomes even more negative,  e.g. the yield on T-bond increases while the one of the swap remains the same,  then$V^{Trade}_t$decreases even more.

### NEGATIVE SPREADS CONTINUE

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413002628495.png)

## VIOLATION OF NO-ARBITRAGE DURING THE 2007 - 2008 CRISIS
- The violation of no-arbitrage rules was widespread during the recent crisis
- For instance,  another simple arbitrage restriction that was violated was the covered interest rate parity (CIP)
- The simple rule in the [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) market according to which the forward exchange rate$F_{t, T}$equals the spot$M_t$times the ratio of investment rates in domestic versus foreign country.
- For instance,  if$M_t$= *US/EURO* exchange rate,  then

$$F_{t, T}=M_{t}e^{(r_{\$$

}-r_{e})(T-t)}$$

- Next figure shows the difference

$$F_{t, T}^{data}-F_{t, T}$$

- before and during the crisis.

## CIP VIOLATION DURING THE 2007 - 2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS: EURO / DOLLAR

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413003013025.png)

### CIP VIOLATION DURING THE 2007 - 2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS: UKP / DOLLAR

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413003028723.png)

### WHY DID COVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY FAIL DURING THE 2007-2009 CRISIS?
- Holding US Treasuries has its own "convenience yield" when everyone needs cash collateral. - During the crisis,  from the graph,  we had the following violation:

$$F_{t, t+m}^{d a$t$a}>F_{t, t+m}=M_{t}\;e^{(r_{\$}-r_{e})m}$$

- Recall that in this case,  an arbitrage trade requires the following:
- (a) Short Euro forward;
- (b) borrow dollars (or sell US Treasuries);
- (c) change them into Euro;
- (d) invest in Euro (or buy Euro bonds)
- But point (b) failed during the crisis,  as:
	1. Increase in credit risk concerns impaired the ability of any financial institution to borrow;
	1. Holding safe dollars (US Treasuries) is valuable during a financial crisis for liquidity management
		- US Treasuries are the only collateral accepted for short-term lending transactions.
		- It is very valuable to hold on to them for future cash management

## SOME HISTORY

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413003435092.png)

### OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAPS (IS)
- In a Is,  the two counterparties agree to exchange fixed for floating payments,  where the floating payment is tied to the cumulative return from an overnight rate
- Federal funds rate,  SOFR in US. Europe: short-term rate (eSTR),  (formerly Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) rate).
- Given a notional N,  the floating rate payment at time Ti is

$$CF\left(T_{i}\right)=N\left(\prod\limits_{j=1}^{n_{j}}\left(1+r_{t_{j}}\delta\right)-1\right)\tag{16}$$

- where δis the daily interval,  rt is the reference (annualized) overnight rate,  and nj is the number of days between reset periods.
- The day count convention is normally Actual/360.
- In the continuous time limit ($\delta\to0$),  we have that

$$CF\left(T_{i}\right)=N\left(e^{\frac{T_{i}^{T}}{T_{i-1}}\, r\left(n\right)\mathrm{d}n}-1\right)\tag{17}$$

- Is with maturity less than 1 year have only one payment at the maturity.
- Is with longer maturities have normally quarterly payments.

## WHAT IS THE VALUE OF IS?
- The value of Is is the difference between the floating leg and the fixed leg:

$$V_{t}^{OIS}=V_{t}^{Floating}-V_{t}^{Fixed}\tag{18}$$

- **Floating Leg**: At reset dates,  and assuming the payment of a principal at maturity of the swap,
the value of the floating leg is par.
- Indeed,  investing the notional N in the overnight index daily gives at$T_i$

$$N\prod_{j=1}^{n_{j}}\left(1+r_{t_{j}}\Delta\right)=C F\left(T_{i}\right)+N$$

- =⇒ we can replicate the floating payments,  plus a residual of notional at maturity$T_i$,  with an
	investment N at time 0.

- lt follows$$V_0^{Floating}=N$$

.

- **Fixed leg:** Given a proper discount function ZOIS (0,  Ti),  we obtain

$$V_{0}^{Fixed}=N\ c\ \Delta\ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)+N\ Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{n}\right)\tag{19}$$

- The value of the contract at inception is zero, $V^{OIS}_0= 0.$
- It follows from (18) then that

$$V_{0}^{O I S}=V_{0}^{F l o a t i n g}-V_{0}^{F i x e d}=0\tag{20}$$

- This equation implies that the swap rate c can be computed from

$$1=c\, \Delta\, \, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)+Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{n}\right)\tag{21}$$

- which gives
$$
c(T_{n}) = \frac{1}{\Delta} \frac{1 - Z^{[OLS]}(0, T_{n})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Z^{[OLS]}(0, T_{i})} \tag{22}
$$

- where we now emphasize that the coupon rate $c$ is for a swap with maturity $T_{n}$,  and thus write $c(T_{n})$.

## IS DISCOUNT CURVE
- Given the Is coupon rates c (Ti) for every maturity Ti,  we can bootstrap the Is zero-coupon curve from (20).
- We obtain the relation:

$$Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)=\frac{1-c\left(T_{i}\right)\, \Delta\, \, \Sigma_{j=1}^{i-1}\, Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{j}\right)}{1+c\left(T_{i}\right)\Delta}\tag{23}$$

- recalling,  however,  that Is with maturity less than or equal to 1 year generally have only one payment.
- Next Figure shows an example of bootstrapping from Is quotes,  on January 2,  2009. Panel A reports the original Is quotes from Bloomberg. Panel B uses the quotes from Panel A along with bootstrap methodology (23) and defines the Is discount function$Z^{OIS}(0,  T)$.

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413003806860.png)

- However,  if we try after the crisis,  we obtain the following figure:

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413003826513.png)

- which are quite different.

## CAPS,  FLOORS AND COLLARS
- A cap pays a stream of payments at$T_i,  i = 1, ..,  n$with$T_{i+1} = T_i + ∆$,  where

$$C F\left(T_{i+1}\right)=\Delta\times N\times\operatorname*{max}\left(r_{n}\left(T_{i}, T_{i+1}\right)-r_{K}\right)$$

- where$∆$is the time interval between payments, $N$is the notional and$r_n (T_i,  T_{i+1})$is the n−times compounded LIBOR rate.
- A floor pays$$CF\left(T_{i+1}\right)=\Delta\times N\times\max\left(r_{K}-r_{n}\left(T_{i}, T_{i+1}\right)\right)$$

## BLACK'S FORMULA FOR CAPLET VALUATION

- It is market practice to use Black's model to value Caps and Floors. - The main assumption is that under risk-adjusted probabilities (called "forward risk neutral probabilities"),  the LIBOR rate has a log-normal distribution:

$$\ln\left(r_{n}\left(T_{i}, T_{i+1}\right)\right)\sim N\left(\mu_{i}, \sigma_{f, i+1}^{2}T_{i}\right)$$

- where we assume σf, i+1 is a constant volatility and the subscript i + 1 is maturity of the caplet.
- The valuation formula is then the following:

$$\mathsf{caplet}(T_{i+1})=\Delta\times N\times Z\left(0, T_{i+1}\right)\left[f_{n}(0, T_{i}, T_{i+1})\mathcal{N}\left(d_{1}\right)-r_{K}\mathcal{N}\left(d_{2}\right)\right]\tag{24}$$

- where$f_{n}(0, T_{i}, T_{i+1}$is the forward rate,  and$$d_{1}=\frac{\ln\left(f_{n}(0, T_{i}, T_{i+1})/r_{K}\right)+\sigma_{j+i+1}^{2}T_{i}/2}{\sigma_{j+i+1}\sqrt{T_{i}}};\quad d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma_{j+i+1}\sqrt{T_{i}}$$
- Notice: We discount the payoff using$Z (0,  T_{i+1}$) and not$Z (0,  T_i)$as the cash flow is realized at time$T_{i+1}$.

## EXAMPLE
- On November 1,  2004. Consider a 1-year,  quarterly cap with strike rate$r_K = 2.555\%$.
- Assume this cap is *trading* at volatility$σ_f = 23.5\%$.
- The current LIBOR discount curve is as follows
- $Z(0,  0.25) = 99.4580$;
- $Z(0,  0.5) = 98.8510$;
- $Z(0,  0.75) = 98.1899$;
- $Z(0,  1) = 97.4834$.
- From the LIBOR curve,  we can compute the quarterly compounded forward rates:
- Forward Discount Factors

$$F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})=\frac{Z(0, T_{i})}{Z(0, T_{i-1})}$$

- Forward rates

$$f_{4}(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})=4\times\left(\frac{1}{F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})}-1\right)$$

- We obtain
- $f_4(0,  0.25,  0.5) = 2.4562\%;$
- $f_4(0,  0.5,  0.75) = 2.6932\%;$
- $f_4(0,  0.75,  1) = 2.8987\%$
- The last input in the Black's formula is the volatility$σ_f × √T_i$
- From the *quoted* volatility$σ_f = 23.5\%$,  we obtain

$$\begin{array}{l c l}{{\sigma_{f}\sqrt{T_{1}}}}&{{=}}&{{23.5\%\sqrt{0.25}=11.75\%;}}\\ {{\sigma_{f}\sqrt{T_{2}}}}&{{=}}&{{23.5\%\sqrt{0.50}=16.62\%;}}\\ {{\sigma_{f}\sqrt{T_{3}}}}&{{=}}&{{23.5\%\sqrt{0.75}=20.35\%.}}\end{array}$$

- At this point we have all the information to compute the value of each caplet in the cap.
- In particular,  using the formula for$d_1$and$d_2$we obtain
- $d_1(0.5) = -0.2770$;
- $d_2(0.5) = -0.3945$
- $d_1(0.75) = 0.4000;$
- $d_2(0.75) = 0.2338$
- $d_1(1) = 0.7218$;
=$d_2(1) = 0.5183$
- Then
$\text{caplet } (0.50)\ =\ \Delta\times N\times Z\, (0, 0.50)\, [2.4562\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{1}())-2.555\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{2}())]$$=\ 0.0184$

$\text{caplet } (0.75)\ =\ \Delta\times N\times Z\, (0, 0.75)\, [2.6932\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{1}())-2.555\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{2}())]$$=\ 0.0617$

$\text{caplet } (1.0)\ =\ \Delta\times N\times Z\, (0, 1.0)\, [2.8987\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{1}(1.0))-2.555\%\times{\cal N}\, (d_{2}(1.0))]$$=\ 0.1057$

- and we obtain the value of the 1-year cap:

$$C a p(1Y)=0.0184+0.0617+0.1057=0.1859$$

## FLAT VOLATILITIES AND FORWARD VOLATILITIES
- Caps and floors are *quoted* in terms of flat volatilities.
- The volatility across caplets is kept constant for each cap.
- For example,  from Bloomberg (code SSRC),  one finds quotes such as

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413004737317.png)
Source: Bloomberg.

- Each entry is a flat volatility for an "at-the-money" instrument,  meaning that its strike rate (equal for all the caplets) is the swap rate with the same maturity of the cap.
- The payment frequency of the underlying caps and floors is 3 months.
- Since the first payment at horizon 3 months is known at time 0,  it is practice to set this caplet equal to zero.

## FLAT VOLATILITIES AND FORWARD VOLATILITIES
- As an example,  from Table 1,  we obtain the following prices for caps
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413005322596.png)
## FLAT VOLATILITIES AND FORWARD VOLATILITIES
- Issue: Consider the caps with maturities$T = 0.5,  T = 0.75,  T = 1.$
- The$T = 0.5$cap has only one caplet with (implied)volatility 21.156%
- The$T = 0.75$cap has two caplets each computed with (implied) volatility 22.066%
- The$T = 1$cap has three caplets each computed with (implied) volatility 23.500%
- It looks like the *same* caplet would have a different price,  depending on which cap it belongs to.
- Instead,  it is only a quoting convention,  and due to the distinction between **Flat** (or quoted) volatility and Forward Volatility
- The **Forward Volatility** (or spot volatility) of a caplet with maturity$T$and strike rate$r_K$is the volatility$σ^{Fwd}_f(T)$that characterizes that particular caplet.

## FLAT VOLATILITIES AND FORWARD VOLATILITIES
- Next table illustrates the relation between forward volatility and flat volatility
- The forward volatility is used to price individual caplets and thus obtain a value of the cap. - The flat volatility is used to *quote* the cap,  once its price is determined in the previous step. - The flat volatility is a sort of average (forward) volatility used for quoting purposes only.

## EXTRACTING THE FORWARD VOLATILITY FROM FLAT VOLATILITY

- To set up arbitrage strategies,  we need Forward Volatilities,  and not Flat volatilities.
- How do we extract the Fwd volatility from the Flat volatility?
- It is simple and analogous to the extraction of the discount$Z(t; T)$from bonds and swaps.
- We start from the shortest maturitity,  and then bootstrap the Fwd volatility out of the Flat volatility,  by using an iterative method.
- Consider a cap with maturity$T_i$and let$σ_f(T_i)$be its "flat volatility".
- Denote also$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_j)$the forward volatilities for$j = 1,  2,  …,  n.$
- For all$T_i$the following equations must hold

$$\begin{array}{l l}{{c a p\left(T_{i}\right)\ =\ \sum\limits_{j=1}^{i}c a p l e t\left(T_{j}, \overline{{{r}}}_{K, i}, \sigma_{f}(T_{i})\right)}}\\ {{\qquad\qquad\qquad\left(\mathrm{How~the~market~quotes}\right)}}\\ {{\qquad\qquad\qquad\left(T_{j}, \overline{{{r}}}_{K, i}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{j})\right)}}\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{r l}{={}}&{{}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{i}c a p l e t}\\ {{}}&{{}{\mathrm{(Implied~by~no~arbitrage)}}}\end{array}$$

- where notice that the difference between the first and the second line is just the volatility.

## HOW DO WE EXTRACT THE$Σ^{FWD}_F(T_J)$?
- **Step 1**: Use the quoted (flat) volatilities to obtain cap prices for all maturities (see Table 2).
- **Step 2**: For the shortest maturity ($T_1  = 0.5$),  the cap has only one caplet,  and thus the forward and flat volatility must coincide. Thus:

$$\sigma_{f}(0.5)=\sigma_{f}^{F w d}(0.5)=21.156\%.$$

- Step 3: For each subsequent time$i=2, ..$,  we use the following three step procedure:
1. Use the previously extracted forward volatilities$\sigma_f^{Fwd}(T_j)$for$j=1, .., i-1$to compute the caplets up to$T_j, Caplet\left(T_j, r_{K, i}, \sigma_f^{Fwd}(T_j)\right)$
1. Obtain the dollar value of the remaining caplet$T_i$as the difference between the cap price for$T_i$(obtained in Step 1) and the sum of caplets up to$T_{i-1}$

$$\text{Dollar value of }T_i \text{ caplet }=Cap(T_i)-\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}Caplet\left(T_j, r_{K, i}, \sigma_f^{Fwd}(T_j)\right)$$

1. Find the (forward) volatility$\sigma_f^{Fwd}(T_i)$such that

$$Caplet\left(T_i, r_{K, i}, \sigma_f^{Fwd}(T_i)\right)= \text{Dollar value of$T_i$caplet}$$

Dollar value of$T_{i}$**caplet**$=Cap(T_{i})-\sum\limits_{j=1}^{i-1}Caplet\left(T_{j}, r_{K, i}, \sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(T_{j})\right)$

1. Find the (forward) volatility$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_j)$such that

$$C a p l e t\left(T_{i}, r_{K, i}, \sigma_{f}^{F v d}(T_{i})\right)=\mathrm{Dollar~value~of~}T_{i}\mathrm{~caplet}$$

## EXAMPLE
- For instance,  the second cap ($T_2  = 0.75$) has a dollar price of$*Cap*(T_2) = \$0.1059$. We now use the three-step procedure in Step 3 above:
1. Compute the$T_1$caplet using the forward volatility$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_i)$= 21.1564\% just computed.
Using the Black formula,  we obtain

$$C a p l e t(T_{1}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{1}))=\$0.0273$$

1. The dollar value of the$T_2$caplet is then

$$\text{Dollar value of$T_2$caplet} =Cap(T_{2})-Caplet\left(T_{1}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(T_{1})\right)$$

$=$$\$0.1059-\$0.0273=\$0.0786$

1. Use the Black formula again to find the (forward) volatility$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_2)$such that

$$C a p l e t\left(T_{2}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{2})\right)=\$0.0786\ \implies\ \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{2})=22.81\%$$

- Similarly,  the T3 forward volatility is obtained as follows:
1. Compute the$T_1$and$T_2$caplets using the forward volatilities$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_1)$= 21.1564% and
$σ^{Fwd}_f(T_2)$= 22.81% just computed. Using the Black formula with the new strike rate$r_K =$
1.4420%,  we obtain

$$\begin{array}{l}{{C a p l e t(T_{1}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{1}))=\$0.0157}}\\ {{C a p l e t(T_{2}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{2}))=\$0.0605}}\end{array}$$

1. The dollar value of the$T_3$caplet is then

$$\text{Dollar value of$T_3$caplet} =Cap(T_{3})-\sum\limits_{j=1}^{2}Caplet\left(T_{j}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{Fud}(T_{j})\right)$$

$=$$\$0.1859-(\$0.0157+\$0.0605)=\$0.1096$
3. Use the Black formula again to find the (forward) volatility$σ^{Fwd}*f(T_3)$such that
$$C a p l e t\left(T_{3}, r_{K}, \sigma_{f}^{F w d}(T_{3})\right)=\$0.1096\ \ \Longrightarrow\ \ \sigma*{f}^{F w d}(T_{3})=25.54\%$$

- Figure 1 plots the forward and flat volatilities on November 1,  2004
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010625250.png)
- Flat volatilities can be thought of a "cumulated averages" of forward volatilities.
- Cap (Quoted) Volatility Changes Over Time.
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010654352.png)
- The average forward volatility curve is hump shaped:
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010713355.png)
- The forward volatility has various shapes through time:
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010740064.png)
- The forward volatility is strongly time varying:
![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010802155.png)

- where "slope$=\sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(10)-\sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(1)$" and "curvature$=2\sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(2)-\sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(1)-\sigma_{f}^{Fwd}(10)$.

## PUT-CALL PARITY
- A put-call parity relationship exists for caps and floors.
- Clearly,  a portfolio of a long caplet and short floorlet with equal strikes gives

$$\operatorname*{max}\left(r_{n}\left(\tau, T\right)-r_{K}\right)-\operatorname*{max}\left(r_{K}-r_{n}\left(\tau, T\right)\right)=r_{n}\left(\tau, T\right)-r_{K}$$

- But this is the payoff to a swap. Hence,  we have

$$\mathsf{c a p=f l o o r+s w a p}$$

## SWAPTIONS
- A buyer of a swaption has *the right,  but not the obligation* to enter into a swap with given characteristics (such as maturity,  swap rate,  payment frequency,  etc.) at a given maturity$T_O$.
- Ina *payer swaption* the swaption buyer has the right to enter into a swap as a fixed-rate payer (and receive floating.) In a *receiver swaption* the swaption buyer has the right to enter into the swap as fixed-rate receiver (and pay floating).
- For instance,  in Table 1,  an investor can purchase an at-the-money six-month option to enter into a 10-year swap at "implied volatility" of 21.883%.

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413010916470.png)

- A swap,  recall,  is a contract between two parties to exchange at times$T_1, ..,  T_n$the net cash flows

$$C F\left(T_{i+1}\right)=\Delta\times N\times\left(r_{K}-r_{n}\left(T_{i}, T_{i+1}\right)\right)$$

- On each of the reset dates dates,  the value of the swap is

$$V\left(T_{i}, r_{K}\right)=P\left(T_{i}, T;r_{K}\right)-100$$

- where$P (T_i,  T; r_K)$is the price of a coupon bond with$r_K$as coupon rate and maturity$T$.
- Consider an option that gives its holder the right (not the obligation) to enter as the fixed rate
receiver in the swap at time$T_O = T_{i^∗}$for some$i^∗ < n$,  at the exercise rate$r_K$.
- Let$c (T_{i^∗},  T)$be the market swap rate at time$T_{i^∗}$for a swap maturing at$T$.
- If$c (T_{i^∗},  T) < r_K$,  optimal to exercise the option (and receive$r_K$instead of lower$c (T_{i^∗},  T).$
- If$c (T_{i^∗},  T) *> r_K$,  optimal not to exercise the option (better receive the market rate$c (T_{i^∗},  T).$

## SWAPTION PAYOFF
- We now show that the payoff of a receiver swaption is positive if and only if the market swap rate is below the strike swap rate:

$$V\left(T_{i^{*}}, r_{K}\right)>0\Longleftrightarrow c\left(T_{i^{*}}, T\right)<r_{K}$$

- The payoff from the Swaption can be written as

$$
\begin{align} \text{Payoff} &= V\left(T_{i^*}, r_K\right)-0 \\ &= V\left(T_{i^*}, r_K\right)-V\left(T_{i^*}, c\left(T_{i^*}, T\right)\right) \\ &= \left[P\left(T_{i^*}, T;r_K\right)-100\right]-\left[P\left(T_{i^*}, T;c\left(T_{i^*}, T\right)\right)-100\right] \\ &= P\left(T_{i^*}, T;r_K\right)-P\left(T_{i^*}, T;c\left(T_{i^*}, T\right)\right) \\ &= \sum_{j=i^*+1}^n Z\left(T_{i^*}, T_j\right)r_K\Delta N+Z\left(T_{i^*}, T_n\right)\times1 \\ &- \sum_{j=i^*+1}^n Z\left(T_{i^*}, T_j\right)c\left(T_{i^*}, T\right)\Delta N-Z\left(T_{i^*}, T_n\right)\times1 \\ &= \sum_{j=i^*+1}^n Z\left(T_{i^*}, T_j\right)\Delta N\left(r_K-c\left(T_{i^*}, T\right)\right) \end{align}
$$

- The value of a swap at time$T_O$is positive if and only if$(r_K − c (T_{i^∗},  T)$)
- Clearly,  the option buyer exercises the option if and only if the payoff is positive,  so the receiver
swaption payoff at$T_{i^∗}$is

$$\mathrm{Payoff~of~Receiver~Swaption}~=~\sum\limits_{j=i^{*}+1}^{n}{Z\left(T_{i^{*}}, T_{j}\right)\Delta N\operatorname*{max}\left(r_{K}-c\left(T_{i^{*}}, T\right)\right)}$$

- The payoff to the swap is equivalent to the cash flow

$$\Delta N\max\left(r_{K}-c\left(T_{i^{*}}, T\right)\right)$$

determined at$T_{i^∗}$,  paid out at times$T_{i^{*}+1}, T_{i^{*}+2}, …, T_{n}$,  and thus discounted to$T_{i^{*}}$through the terms$\Sigma_{j=i^{*}+1}^{n}\, Z\left(T_{i^{*}}, T_{j}\right)$.

- The payoff at each time Ti∗+j is always the same determined at$T_{i^∗}$.
- Similar,  the payer swaption payoff at$T_{i^∗}$is

$$\mathrm{Payoff~of~Payer~Swaption}~=~\sum\limits_{j=i^{*}+1}^{n}Z\left(T_{i^{*}}, T_{j}\right)\Delta N\operatorname*{max}\left(c\left(T_{i^{*}}, T\right)-r_{K}\right)$$

### PAYOFF OF RECEIVER SWAPTION

![](Z.%20Clippings/Lecture%20Note%204%20Interest%20Rate%20Derivatives-20240413011725253.png)

## SWAPTION PRICING

- The price of the receiver swaption is obtained by pricing each of those payments
$∆N max (r_K − c (T_{i^∗},  T),  0)$at times$T_{i^∗+1},  T_{i^∗+2}*,  …,  T_{i^∗+n}$,  individually.
- Like for caps and floors,  the Black's formula assumes that under the proper risk-adjusted probabilities,  the swap rate$c (T_{i^∗},  T)$is log-normally distributed

$$\log c\left(T_{i^{*}}, T\right)\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma_{T_{i^{*}}}^{2}T_{i^{*}})$$

- where$σ_{T_i^∗}$is the swap rate volatility,  which is what is quoted by market participants
- Thus,  the (risk adjusted) expected value of a payer and receiver cash flows at$T_{i^∗+j}$are,  respectively,

- where$f^s_n(0,  T_{i^∗},  T)$is the **forward swap rate.** and

$$d_{1}=\frac{\ln{(f_{n}^{s}(0, T_{i^{*}}, T)/r_{K})}+\sigma_{T_{i^{*}}}^{2}T_{i^{*}}/2}{\sigma_{T_{i^{*}}}\sqrt{T_{i^{*}}}};\quad d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma_{T_{i^{*}}}\sqrt{T_{i^{*}}}$$

- $µ$is set up so that$f^s_n(0,  T_{i^∗},  T) = E^∗_f[c (T_{i^∗},  T)]$under the proper risk-adjusted probabilities.

## SWAPTION PRICING

- Hence,  the value of a payer swaption$$\mbox{Payer Swaption}=\sum\limits_{j=i^{\prime}+1}^{n}\Delta\times N\times Z\left(0, T_{j}\right)\left[f_{n}^{*}(0, T_{i^{\prime}}, T){\cal N}\left(d_{1}\right)-r_{K}{\cal N}\left(d_{2}\right)\right]$$$$=AN\left[f_{n}^{*}(0, T_{i^{\prime}}, T){\cal N}\left(d_{1}\right)-r_{K}{\cal N}\left(d_{2}\right)\right]$$
- where$$A=\sum\limits_{j=i^{\prime}+1}^{n}\Delta\times Z\left(0, T_{j}\right)$$
- Similarly,  the value of a receiver swaption is

$$\text{Receiver Swaption}\ =\ A N\left[-f_{n}^{s}(0, T_{i^{*}}, T){\mathcal{N}}\left(-d_{1}\right)+r_{K}{\mathcal{N}}\left(-d_{2}\right)\right]$$

## HOW DO WE COMPUTE THE FORWARD SWAP RATE?
- This is implicit in the forward discount curve

$$F\left(0, T_{i^{*}}, T\right)=\frac{Z\left(0, T\right)}{Z\left(0, T_{i^{*}}\right)}$$

- Using that just as a discount function and following the same steps as for regular swap rate,  we can compute the Forward Swap Rate$f_{n}^{*}(0, T_{i^{*}}, T)$,  for a swap starting at time$T_{i}$,  and lasting until time$T_{i}$,  as$$f_{n}^{*}(0, T_{i^{*}}, T)=\frac{1}{\Delta\sum_{j=i^{*}+1}^{n}F\left(0, T_{i^{*}}, T_{i}\right)}$$

## EXAMPLE
- Today is November 1,  2004. Consider a 1-year swaption to enter into a 5-year swap at strike rate$r_K = 3.751\%$.
- Table 1 shows that such a swaption is trading at implied volatility$σ^s_f = 27.404\%$.
- Table 4 provides the LIBOR discount curve up to$T = 6$.
- to derive the Forward Discount curve we also need$Z(0,  1) × 100 = 97.48.$
- We then obtain$$A=\Delta\times\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z(0, T_{i})=4.4046$$
- The forward swap rate can be computed from the forward discounts using the previous formula$f_{4}^{i}(0, T_{O}, T_{S})=4.261\%$

$$d_{1}=\frac{ln(4.261\%/3.751\%)+0.27404^{2}\times1/2}{0.27404\times\sqrt{1}}=0.6023\, \ d_{2}=0.6023-0.27404\times\sqrt{1}=0.3282$$

- The Black's formula then gives for a receiver swaption with$N=100$:$$\mathsf{Swaption}=\sum\limits_{j=i+j+1}^{n}\Delta\times N\times Z\left(0, T_{j}\right)\left[-f_{n}^{\circ}(0, T_{i}, T)\mathcal{N}\left(-d_{1}\right)+r_{K}\mathcal{N}\left(-d_{2}\right)\right]$$$$=\$1.0026$$
