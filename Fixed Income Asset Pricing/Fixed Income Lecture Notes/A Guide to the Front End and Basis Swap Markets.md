# A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets

The demand for short-term interest rate instruments and derivatives has increased significantly in recent years in response to unprecedented volatility. Policy rates were slashed markedly during 2008 and 2009 in response to the global financial crisis. Meanwhile,  the spreads between various short-term benchmark rates became much more volatile as credit concerns caused historically stable relationships to unravel. For example,  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates rose even as central banks cut policy rates.

Derivatives trading in the front end of the USD rates market increased 33% from the beginning of 2008 to mid-2009. Hedgers increased their usage of short-term instruments in order to protect their cash flows better from unexpected moves in spreads and/or policy rates. Meanwhile,  speculators increased their trading of more tailored products such as Is to express views on policy rates while becoming far more active in the basis markets to take advantage of spread movements.

Recent events provide a useful context for discussing the breadth of products available to market participants in the short-term rates and basis markets. This primer starts with the building blocks of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market and moves on to cover the most common instruments in the front-end and basis markets. Sections are devoted to products and are intended to be self-contained. Each section consists of an overview outlining the salient features of the product followed by examples of usage. Sample term sheets for the instruments and derivatives are provided in the Appendix.

# The Basics

 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]

### London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)

"[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is the rate at which an individual Contributor Panel bank could borrow funds,  were it to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in reasonable market size,  just prior to 11:00 am London time." – British Banker's Association

In the early 1980 s,  in order to ensure continued growth in the trading of numerous new instruments such as interest rate swaps and currency options,  there arose the pressing need to establish a uniform benchmark index against which these instruments could be referenced. That search for a uniform benchmark culminated in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] indices. Today,  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] serves as the foundation for the bulk of front-end trading and is quoted for a number of tenors and currencies. [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is not a traded rate,  but rather the outcome of a poll of bank rates submitted to the British Banker's Association (BBA) at 11 am GMT each London business day. The official fixings are calculated by the BBA in conjunction with Reuters and are released to the Telerate/Reuters page 3750 and on Bloomberg to BBAL.

The term "funds" in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] definition refers to unsecured deposit rates,  which tend to trade at or above secured (repo) rates. LIBORs reflect "offshore" deposit rates,  which allow banks to avoid regulation or registration applicable to onshore deposit markets and thus require an added spread to equivalent onshore rates. Note that the terms "Eurodollar",  "Euroyen",  etc.,  refer to USD or JPY deposits trading outside of their respective domestic deposit markets and are not related to the euro currency.

The fixed [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate is not precisely linked to the rate a contributing bank would bid for funding,  nor is it directly tied to the rate at which a given contributor would offer funding. Instead,  it reflects where a given bank deems it could borrow funds in reasonable size should it seek to do so. In essence,  the banks are being asked to disclose the rate at which they **believe** the market would be willing to offer cash to them should they desire funding. It is the contributing bank's perception of where others would offer them funding. Sentiment is,  therefore,  critical for the direction of LIBOR.

To compute the USD LIBORs,  the BBA queries 16 banks each morning,  ranks the rates from highest to lowest,  removes the top and bottom quartiles and then arithmetically averages the remaining rates. This average is the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixing for the day,  for a particular tenor. The process is repeated for each tenor to compute the corresponding [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixings (Exhibit 2). The day-count convention used in the submissions and fixings is actual/360.

[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates reference accrual periods,  with lengths that correspond to the specific [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] tenors. The start of the accrual period and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixing date need not,  and most often do not,  coincide. In the case of USD,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixing date precedes the accrual start date (also known as the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spot date or [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Value date) by two London business days. The procedure for calculating the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spot date from the fixing date is outlined below.

#### **Steps to calculate the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spot date:**
- 1. Start with today's date.
- 2. Go forward two good London business days from (1).
- 3. If the date from (2) is a good New York business day,  (2) is the USD [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spot.
- 4. If (2) is not a good New York business day,  advance forward until both a good London and New York day is reached. This date is then the USD [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spot.

[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixings are generally slower to adjust to small changes in rates than the real-time derivative markets since LIBORs represent deposit rates with wider bid-offer spreads than derivatives. These wider margins allow the fixing panels to adjust rates incrementally,  as the bid/offer prices will likely remain valid after a small rate change.

Generally,  timing can significantly impact [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixings. Around quarter-end and year-end turns,  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates can spike as banks' willingness to lend diminishes near balance sheet reporting periods. In addition,  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixings after central bank meetings jump noticeably,  even when policy changes are fully expected,  since cash participants generally want to see the changes before they adjust rates. Notably,  the volatility of changes in Wednesday/Thursday fixings is not significantly greater than that of other days even though the value date for Thursday's fixing is three calendar days ahead of Wednesday's value date.

### [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Market]]

[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]]

"Federal funds,  or fed funds,  are unsecured loans of reserve balances at Federal Reserve Banks that depository institutions make to one another. The rate at which these transactions occur is called the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] ." (Federal Reserve Bank of New York)

Banks maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks to serve two primary purposes – to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. The **reserve requirement** is a central-bank-mandated minimum level of reserves that must be held against demand deposits. Currently,  the reserve requirement in the US stands at 10%,  measured over a period of two weeks (the reserve maintenance period). Any reserves in excess of the reserve requirement are considered **excess reserves**. In the US,  banks and other eligible institutions trade these reserves in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market,  a free trading market,  to redistribute total reserves in the banking system. Institutions that have excess reserves lend reserves to institutions that have reserve deficiencies with loan terms that are typically overnight,  although longer terms can also be arranged.

The eligible entities that can participate in the federal funds market include commercial banks,  thrift institutions,  agencies and branches of foreign banks in the United States,  federal agencies and government securities dealers. 1

Although [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] are unsecured loans,  they are considered safer than unsecured deposits because they occur in the Federal Reserve system under the oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market as a tool to implement [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]. It does so by setting the target level for the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] at every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and changing the reserve balances in the system to effect the desired [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] . The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is charged by the FOMC to "create conditions in reserve markets" that encourage the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] to trade close to a certain level and from time to time **may or may not** intervene in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market.

While the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target rate is set at the FOMC meetings,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] itself is a traded rate that is determined by the trading counterparts in a free market environment. Thus the Fed does not dictate the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] . During the course of the day,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] can vary from transaction to transaction. The **federal funds effective rate**,  commonly referred to as the fed effective,  is the weighted average of all brokered trades in the federal funds market on a given day and is used as a benchmark in many short-term interest rate instruments. The official fixing is calculated by the Federal Reserve and published between 7:30am and 8:00am EST to the H0.\1 series of Federal Reserve Statistical Releases. It can also be found on Bloomberg under FEDL and on Reuters page FEDFUNDS 1. The fixing is released with a one-day lag,  and thus to avoid confusion,  the fixing has an attached correct reference date. For example,  brokered trades in the federal funds market for value date 2-Mar-09,  are averaged and published on 3-Mar-09,  but carry an associated date label of 2-Mar-09.

Excess reserve balances rose sharply from late 2008 into 2010 as the Federal Reserve created reserves in order to fund its credit facilities and asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. These large excess balances depressed the funds rate,  and absent the Fed's payment of interest on excess reserves (IOER),  the effective rate would tend to trade near zero,  as banks would seek to dispose of unwanted reserves at any positive interest rate. For the foreseeable future,  IOER will likely be the primary tool to manage the effective rate. Liquidity-draining techniques (reverse repos,  time deposits) may be used to mitigate the impact of excess reserves on the effective rate at some point. Still it is likely that a persistent reserve overhang will dampen the impact of various seasonal factors that historically caused predictable sources of volatility in the effective rate.

Prior to 2008,  the funds market exhibited discernible trading patterns. At some point,  these factors may again become important considerations if the supply of excess reserves is reduced substantially.

Historically,  demand to borrow funds has generally been high on the market open because of offshore entities' needs to cover short balances. This demand often (but not always) tapers off throughout the day. Peak volume occurs in the afternoon after banks have reconciled overnight balances (3 pm - 6 pm).

Timing can have a significant impact on the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market. Some of the salient date effects are listed below:

- Daily Adjustments
	  - Weekends Effective is generally lower than the target as funds get lent out at a cheaper rate because of the longer time period.
	  - Thursdays Effective is generally higher than the target as Treasury bill auction settlement increases the demand for funds.
- Monthly Adjustments
	  - Month-end / Quarter-ends Effective is generally higher than the target as Treasury note auction settlement increases the demand for funds as does increased corporate borrowing for quarter-end balance sheets.
	  - Tax Days / Quarterly Refunding Effective is generally higher than the target as corporations (15 th of each fiscal quarter) and individuals (15 April) borrow to meet tax obligations. Another source of higher demand for funds is the quarterly Treasury refunding settlement on the 15 th of February,  May,  August and November.
	  - Mortgage Settlement dates Effective is generally higher than the target as mortgage bond payments (25 th of each month) drain balances of the Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) out of the system.
- Year-end Adjustments
	  - Year-end Effective is generally lower than the target as the Fed injects excess liquidity to the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] market.

# [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs) Overview

[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]] (FRAs) Overview|[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]]]]

A [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreement]](FRA) is an obligation to exchange a pre-specified fixed rate for a floating reference rate,  usually [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] in the case of USD,  at a pre-specified time in the future for a pre-determined period of time and notional amount. In other words,  a [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] is a way of locking in an interest rate today for borrowing/lending that is to take place at some time in the future. The buyer of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] pays the fixed rate,  while the seller receives the fixed rate.

The [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] level is a result of market supply and demand and thus is a reflection of market expectations of forward rates. In addition,  FRAs are over-the-counter instruments with highly customizable start and end dates compared to Eurodollar futures,  which are restricted to IMM dates. Because no principal is exchanged,  FRAs are credit-efficient instruments with credit risk limited to the difference between the reference and [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] rates. Thus,  FRAs can be used extensively to hedge against and express a view on future movements in interest rates.

Eurodollar (ED) futures are generally the cheapest way to express a view on the direction of rates or to hedge interest rate movements. However,  ED futures cover limited dates (IMM dates 2 ) and lack convexity,  making FRAs an attractive alternative. The importance of hedging for a specific day can be illustrated by the divergence between 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] and the first ED future in the wake of Lehman's collapse. Had an investor used ED futures to hedge a liability based on 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] by shorting the first ED future,  the investor would have amassed losses from both the change in the liability and the hedging position. If,  instead,  the same liability had been hedged with a [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] settling on the same date as the liability fixing,  the hedge would have been effective.

ED futures have a constant exposure of $25 per basis point move in interest rates and thus exhibit no "convexity". A FRA,  on the other hand,  shows a smaller change in value for a 1 bp rise in the forward interest rate than for a 1 bp decline in the forward rate (convexity).

FRAs are therefore a better hedge for fixed-rate assets and liabilities that are also convex.

A [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] is referenced by three dates – the fixing,  settle and maturity dates. On the **fixing date** the reference floating rate is observed. Once the fixing has been determined,  accrual begins and cash settlement is made on the **settle date**. In contrast to an interest rate swap,  the cash payment for a [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] is made at the beginning of the accrual period rather than at **maturity** (with appropriate discounting).

2 International Money Market (IMM) dates are the third Wednesdays of March,  June,  September and December.

### **FRA Shorthand Notation**

Notation can be a potential source of confusion in FRAs given the three dates that must be referenced to define the timeline of a FRA. Preferred shorthand notation takes the "A*B over C" form (for example,  1*4 over 10 th). "A" and "B" refer to the number of months to settle and maturity dates,  respectively,  and C references the specific day of the month for the maturity date. The step-by-step procedure for identifying the key dates based on the notation A*B over C is as follows:

- 1. Start with the current [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] **spot** date (not the current date).
- 2. Advance A months forward from (1).
- 3. Locate the Cth date of the month in (2) this is the settle date.
- 4. Advance B months forward from (1).
- 5. Locate the Cth date of the month in (4) this is the maturity date.
- 6. (B-A) month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is the reference rate (e.g.,  1 m,  3 m,  6 m,  etc. LIBOR).
- 7. Two London business days prior to (3) is the fixing date.

#### Notes

- A and B must be integers,  where B is greater than A.
- C can take on any of the following forms:
	  - Numbers: refers to the day of the month (e.g.,  "1 st,  10 th,  21 st);
	  - IMM: refers to the IMM date (3 rd Wednesday of the month);
	  - End: refers to the last good business day for both NY and London in any given month; and
	  - Omitted/spot: refers to the same day of the month as spot.
- If the settle/maturity date falls on a holiday,  the next good business day is used.

Exhibit 5 provides concrete examples of shorthand notation for FRAs followed by a list of the most common [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] contracts.

#### **Popular [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] runs**

Some of the most common [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] runs include the following:

- **FOMC FRAs** (the first [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] fixing after an FOMC meeting) are often used to hedge unexpected changes in the FOMC and the ensuing market reaction to the changes. These FRAs can also be used to express a view on FOMC outcomes.
- **FOMC switch**,  the one-day switch between two FRAs before and after FOMC,  allows investors to take advantage of,  or hedge against,  events that cause anomalies in the market,  such as a FOMC meeting.
- **Turn FRAs** (Oct 1 or Dec 31) are used in hedging/expressing directional views around specific fixings that are not covered by Eurodollar futures.
- **Turn switches** (Sep 30 vs. Oct 1,  and Dec 31 vs. Jan 1),  like FOMC switches,  are commonly used to take advantage of or hedge against idiosyncratic month-end,  quarter-end or year-end effects.
- **FRAs to hedge serial month exposures** (Jan,  Feb,  Apr,  May,  Jul,  Aug,  Oct,  Nov) are common given that the IMM Eurodollar futures only cover the first four serial months,  which are not very liquid,  and do not cover forward serial months. Thus FRAs are generally used for hedging serial month exposures.
- **End-of-quarter FRAs** tend to be popular,  as many corporations use them to hedge cash-flow volatility at quarter-end dates.

### FRAs used to hedge floating-rate notes

FRAs can be used to hedge against unfavorable movements in interest rates. In particular,  FRAs can be used to "lock-in" borrowing or lending costs,  to protect against changes in an asset's value because of swings in discount rates,  or to manage portfolio exposure to interest rates.

Consider,  for example,  an investor who is long $10 million XYZ floating-rate notes (FRNs) that pay 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + 20 bps every March 1,  June 1,  September 1 and December 1. Hypothetically,  this investor decides in June 2009 that 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is likely to decline prior to the September reset. The investor can protect himself against a decline in [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] with a FRA. Specifically,  the investor can sell a 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] for the period September 1 to December 1 (a 3 months forward,  3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] or 3 x 6 FRA) at the then prevailing rate of 0.766%.

On September 1,  3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] had fallen to 0.334% and the coupon on the XYZ floating-rate note reset at 0.534% (0.334% + 20 bps). Still,  the company would effectively receive a coupon rate of 0.966% (the 0.766% rate "locked-in" + 20 bps). The calculations are shown in Exhibit 7. On December 1,  the company's cash inflow comes from two sources – the FRN and the FRA. At a more conceptual level,  Exhibit 8 shows the cash flows that would result from hedging the FRN with a FRA.

#### **Exhibit 7: Hedging a FRN with a FRA**

### FRAs used to express a view on falling [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Rates

As of June 2009,  the 6 x 12 (6 months forward,  6-month FRA) and 6 x 9 (6 months forward,  3 month FRA) rates indicated that [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates would remain elevated at or above the then current levels even six month down the road as markets remained nervous. Suppose an investor believed that interbank lending rates would normalize and that the 6-month tenor had more room to fall than 3-month LIBOR. Because there is no futures contract referencing 6-month LIBOR,  the investor decides to utilize a FRA.

Source: Credit Suisse In particular,  had the investor sold the 6 x 12 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] on 10 June 2009 at 161 bps,  he would have realized a profit of 115 bps,  as

# Overnight Index Swaps Overview

[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Overnight Index Swaps Overview|Overnight Index Swaps]]

An Overnight Indexed Swap (Is) is a fixed/floating interest rate swap with the floating leg tied to a published overnight rate index. The start and end dates are highly customizable,  providing exposure to virtually any time period a counterparty wishes (the bulk of Is trades mature within two years,  however). The parties agree to exchange at the repayment date the difference between the agreed fixed rate and interest accrued from the geometric average of the floating overnight index rate,  on the agreed notional amount. Is counterparties do not exchange notional principal; settlement is made on a net basis.

Since their introduction in the 1990 s,  Is have become widely used,  very credit-efficient and liquid derivatives in all major currencies. They are used to hedge against,  or express a view on,  moves in overnight interest rates. The popularity of Is has increased in the wake of the 2007/2008 financial crisis,  as LIBOR-based instruments often did not capture movements in policy rates as a result of credit-induced widening in [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates.

In the U.S. market,  the reference rate is the overnight [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate as set forth in the Fed's H0.\1 release. Interest payments on bank reserves and open-market operations aim to equilibrate

the maintenance period average level of the effective rate and the Fed's stated policy rate. The effective rate data are published on Reuters page FEDM,  Bloomberg page FEDL and Telerate 118. A potential source of confusion in Is is that the fixing is released with a one-day lag the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate for a given business day is not released until the morning of the following business day,  generally around 7:30am. In addition to the sources cited above,  investors can subscribe to email alerts from the NYFRB at the web address: http://service.govdelivery.com/service/user.html?code=USFRBNEWYORK.

The accrual of the floating leg of the swap is identical to that of a strategy in which one borrows cash in the amount of the swap's notional principal,  invests in the overnight index rate and repeats the transaction,  investing principal plus interest on an overnight basis. The fixed leg accrual is a straightforward interest calculation using the contract's agreed fixed rate based on local currency money market conventions.

### Using Is to restructure bank liabilities

A bank receiving a one-year term deposit might wish to keep the liquidity of the oneyear point but not the one-year term or rate. The bank could receive fixed in a 1 year Is to achieve a shorter net liability term and (in an upwardly sloping curve) a lower funding rate. Exhibit 15 illustrates how this synthetic liability is structured.

Currently money-center banks are paying about 1.00% on 12-month certificates of deposit. By receiving fixed in a 1-year Is at 0.45%,  they can create a floating-rate 1 year liability that floats daily at effective funds plus 0.55%. With overnight rates hovering around 0.12%,  the bank would begin accruing the liability at a rate of 0.67% for a savings of 0.33%. For the hedge to deliver a net savings to the bank over the life of the deposit,  overnight rates would need to come in below the 0.45% compounded average implied by the Is rate.

**Exhibit 14: An upward-sloping money market curve allows positive carry for swapping term liabilities to overnight**

 ![500](_page_13_Figure_9.jpeg)

The bank might choose to employ such a strategy to express a view that short rates will be lower than implied by the Is market or simply to reduce the duration of its liabilities to match their book of assets better.

### Using Is to hedge repo funding rates

Liquidity in overnight repo markets is very good but tends to fall off substantially at longer terms. Purchasers of Treasury bonds,  for example,  can use the Is market to create term repo financing synthetically in order to avoid "paying up" to lock in an actual term repo. Overnight general collateral repo rates tend to track the effective funds rate very closely,  making Is an ideal instrument for terming out a repo.

The diagram in Exhibit 17 shows the mechanics of a synthetic term repo. Specifically,  the investor finances his bond with a repo on an overnight basis. Simultaneously,  he pays fixed in 1-year Is,  against which he

 ![500](_page_14_Figure_8.jpeg)

Receives the compounded average of the daily effective funds rate for the year. His net funding cost will be approximately the 1-year Is rate (0.45%) less the average spread between the overnight GC rate and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective (over the past ten years,  GC has averaged 8 bps below the effective rate). This would suggest an expected 1-year funding cost of approximately 0.37%. Note that the actual funding rate will vary based on the realized spread between GC and the effective rate and the spread between the repo rate on the bond and GC (the investor will lose the benefit of any episodes in which the bond trades special in repo). Additionally,  the repo rate is computed using simple interest,  where the effective rate leg of the Is trade is based on compounded interest,  which will reduce the precision of the hedge somewhat; however,  the difference will typically be quite small,  especially at low levels of interest rates.

More generally,  Is can be used to create term funding while raising funds in the overnight market.

### Using Is to take directional views on T-Bill/Is spreads

Is can be used along with Treasury bill purchases or sales to express views on T-Bill/Is spreads. Is and T-bill yields are essentially risk free – the T-bill because it is government-backed debt and the Is rate because it is based on lending among depository institutions under the oversight of the Federal Reserve. Thus the difference in the two rates (the spread) is mostly dependent on supply and demand. In times of crisis,  the demand for government debt can soar. Treasuries become the collateral of choice for funding,  using repurchases agreements (repos) in times of high uncertainty. T-Bill/Is spreads therefore tend to widen (on an absolute basis) during a crisis,  as illustrated in Exhibit 18.

 ![500](_page_15_Figure_7.jpeg)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/2ac33a403e9bc3e9cd05ab704cc5aa06fcba6ecb269d3233577ee5ae756044cb.jpg)

Distortions in the market allow for opportunities to exploit the dislocation of the spread between the Is and the T-bill (Is equivalent) yields. For instance,  should the spread be highly negative,  an investor expecting risk aversion to fade could short a T-Bill while receiving fixed in a matched-maturity Is (Exhibit 19).

### Using Is to anticipate the outcome of FOMC meetings

Meeting-to-meeting Is,  which cover the period from a given FOMC meeting to the next,  are an ideal vehicle for anticipating the rate outcome of an FOMC meeting. The Is fixed rate for a meeting-to-meeting Is is the expectation of the daily [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate compounded over the life of the swap. This expectation should be close to target rate expectations,  assuming the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target and effective rates trade close to each other and no inter-meeting rate moves are anticipated. Should an investor have reason to believe the rate change the market has priced in is not accurate,  he can use the meetingto-meeting Is to express his view. For example,  if an investor believes that the rate priced in is too low,  he can pay fixed in meeting-to-meeting Is.

### Using Is to hedge one leg of total return swaps

A total return swap (TRS) consists of exchanging the total return on a reference asset,  such as the S&P 500 Index,  with a floating reference rate plus or minus a spread. Often the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate is used as the floating reference. If an investor believes the market is underpricing the risk of a Fed hike before the next TRS fixing,  he can pay fixed in an Is spanning the period between TRS fixings to lock in a funding rate. Exhibit presents the mechanics of this hedge. 21

# FRA-OIS Spread Overview

The spread between current 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] and spot 3-month Is (often called the LIBOR/Is spread) is now frequently cited by the financial press,  market commentators and policymakers. The spread is seen as a bellwether for overall credit and liquidity conditions in the interbank market since it represents the premium paid to borrow funds in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] market versus the more secure[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market]]t. It also embodies a term premium,  as 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is compared with expectations for compounded overnight rates. Market participants can hedge against,  or express a view on,  future moves in LIBOR/Is by combining an [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] trade with a forward-starting Is position.

In a FRA/Is trade,  both legs of the trade cover the same notional principal amount (NPA). IMM FRA/Is is quoted from one quarterly IMM date reference to the next (they cover the same period as the quarterly ED futures contracts).

Generally FRA/Is is fairly liquid in the so-called "whites" (which cover the first four quarterly IMM contracts),  primarily because of the liquidity in the underlying products themselves. Is is generally most liquid through one year. Beyond one year,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] futures contracts used as a hedge by market makers become far less liquid and hedges are moved to FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps.

### Using FRA/Is as a hedge for general bank credit quality

The FRA/Is spread provides a hedge against general bank credit quality. With the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] leg tied to [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] (interbank lending rate) and the Is tied to the overnight [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate (minimal credit risk),  FRA/Is is a direct measure of the credit quality of financial institutions. Exhibit 24 shows the correlation of the 3 x 6 FRA/Is with the 5-year bank CDS. The 3 x 6 FRA/Is moves in much the same direction as the bank CDS,  indicating that as bank credit quality deteriorates the FRA/Is spread (in this case the 3 x 6 FRA/Is) widens.

A long FRA/Is spread position provides a hedge against deterioration of bank credit quality. Synthetically,  this would allow an investor to gain exposure to 3 month LIBOR/Is,  which increases with

 ![500](_page_18_Figure_5.jpeg)

Worsening bank credit quality. Exhibit 25 illustrates the net exposure based on current levels of 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] and Is rates,  three months forward. With the fixed rates already determined,  the variable pay-off is then [3 mL - 3 mOIS],  which will result in higher pay-offs with worsening bank credit quality.

### Using FRA/Is to express directional view on credit spreads

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/6217efc5339939e8afa0c135a735b848bacbf86c0b172277834fa4172bcac968.jpg)

FRA/Is can be used to express a directional view on credit spreads. During 2007 and 2008,  as the banking crisis unfolded,  LIBOR/Is widened significantly and remained at elevated levels until exogenous measures by the government helped credit conditions to thaw.

At the end of April 2009,  the 3-month LIBOR/Is spread started to decline after being elevated for many months. The FRA/Is market indicated that the LIBOR/Is spread was expected to remain at or above the then-current levels over the next three months. If an investor had believed that the banking crisis would not last much longer,  the FRA/Is structure could have been used as a credit-efficient way of expressing this view.

If an investor had anticipated that LIBOR/Is would come in more quickly than the forwards indicated at the end of April 2009 and accordingly sold the spread (by selling the 3 x 6 [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] and buying the 3 x 6 Is with the same start and end dates),  the trade would have resulted in a positive P&L. As shown in Exhibit 26,  the realized 3-month LIBOR/Is was consistently lower than anticipated by the forwards during the period in question. A hypothetical trade based on these premises is presented in Exhibit 27. Three months from the trade date,  the 3-month LIBOR/Is spread was 29 bps,  resulting in a P&L of 44 bps at settlement.

### Using FRA/Is to hedge swap spreads generically

Historically,  swap spreads and the LIBOR/Is spread have moved closely together. Exhibit 28 illustrates how the 2-year swap spread has generally moved in tandem with the 3-month LIBOR/Is spread. The same relationship also holds true for the 5-year and 10-year swap spreads. Thus being short the FRA/Is spread can be an approximate hedge for a long position in the 2-year swap spread,  for example.

# LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Basis Swaps

### Overview

A LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap is a floating-for-floating exchange of (netted) cash flows,  where the floating legs each reference a distinct [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] index. Recall that [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is meant to mirror an unsecured deposit rate. As such,  credit premium exists for term lending versus rolling funding in shorter intervals and the basis is the value of this optionality. A bank or investor that rolls one-month loans for three months has the option to cancel each month,  whereas a bank or investor who lends for a three-month term does not.

The LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis answers the question: What is the compounded short-tenor rate relative to the long-tenor rate? As shown in Exhibit 29,  the 3 month 1 mL/3 mL basis (3 s 1 s basis) is "X",  the difference between the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] compounded over three months and the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] also over the same period. A positive 3 s 1 s basis is a result of the compounded 1-month rate being less than the 3-month rate and represents banks' preference to lend for one month rather than three months.

 ![500](_page_20_Figure_6.jpeg)

X: 3 month 3 s 1 s basis; Y: 6-month 3 s 1 s basis

 ![500](_page_20_Figure_8.jpeg)

LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps can be an indication of lending preference,  basis

curve shape and credit/liquidity perceptions. Typically,  the term structure of the LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis is downward sloping,  i.e.,  the spread between the tenors decreases with time.

In the basis swap market,  spreads (basis) are quoted against the shorter underlying tenor,  while the payment is determined by the longer tenor. For example,  the 3 s 1 s basis is quoted as the 1 mL +/- spread and the payment frequency is quarterly. Both legs of a LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap use an actual/360 basis for accrual. Exhibit 30 shows the basic structure of the 3 s 1 s and 6 s 3 s basis swaps,  the most commonly traded LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps. The structures show the cash flows at each payment period (governed by the longer tenor).

### **Exhibit 30: 3 s 1 s and 6 s 3 s Basis Swap Structures (for buying/paying the spread)**

**The Stub** An important characteristic of the spot starting LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap is the "stub",  the first piece of the basis swap,  which is responsible for exposure to outright market direction. This exposure results from the first fixing being known at trade inception. For example,  at the start of the spot starting 3 s 1 s basis swap,  the first compounding rate for the 1-month tenor is already fixed,  as is the first payment for the 3-month tenor. This exposes the basis swap to changes in market direction. The payer of the basis has long market exposure,  i.e.,  the payer of the basis benefits from lower rates,  and conversely the seller has short market exposure. The stub can be measured as the difference between the longer-tenor [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] fixing and the shorter-tenor interest rate swap (IRS) that lasts for the term of the longer tenor. Thus the 3 s 1 s stub is: [3 mL – 3 m 1 s IRS].

### LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis as a hedge for interest rate uncertainty

Bank balance sheets typically have assets tied to 1-month LIBOR,  while their funding is achieved in 3-month LIBOR. The mismatch in assets and liabilities can be a source of additional risk since the basis between the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] and 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] is not constant (Exhibit 32). Thus,  in order to reduce this additional basis risk,  financial institutions can use a 3 s 1 s LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap.

Consider a financial institution that makes a student loan with monthly repayments at 8% over the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate. The funding is typically achieved through the issuance of debt based on 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] (with quarterly payments). Assume this institution

 ![500](_page_21_Figure_7.jpeg)

Is able to raise debt at 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + 80 bps for a 10-year term. In-order to match the quarterly payment of debt based on the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] to the asset that brings in loan reayments based on 1-month LIBOR,  the financial institution could buy a 3 s 1 s [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap for the term of ten years. The resulting difference between the asset and the funding is locked in,  based on the spread above the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] for the asset,  the spread over 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] for the debt and the 3 s 1 s basis for a 10-year term. Exhibit 33 shows how the asset and liability in question can be matched using the 3 s 1 s basis swap.

| Loan repayment (1 mL+8%) | Investor | Coupon payment on bond issued (3 mL + 80 bps) |

Exhibit 31: History of the Stub Source: Credit Suisse

On 14 November 2008,  the market expectation for 3 s 1 s was extremely low,  as illustrated by the 6-month 3 s 1 s basis swap spread (at 30 bps) versus the then-current spot 1-month/3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spread of 76 bps. At the time,  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates were on a downward trend and 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] decreased at a much faster pace than 3 month LIBOR. If an investor had believed that [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates would continue to fall over the coming six months and that the preference for shorter-term lending would persist given the uncertainty in the financial markets,  he/she would have found an opportunity in basis swaps.

An investor could have established a long position in the 6-month 3 s 1 s basis (by receiving in 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] vs. Paying in 1-month LIBOR). As it turned out,  the market had overestimated the scope for narrowing in the 1-month/3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spread and a long 3 s 1 s basis position would have been profitable (Exhibit 35).

In-order to match the quarterly payment of debt based on the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] to the asset that brings in loan repayments based on 1-month LIBOR,  the financial institution could buy a 3 s 1 s LIBOR/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap for the term of ten years. The resulting difference between the asset and the funding is locked in,  based on the spread above the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] for the asset,  the spread over 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] for the debt and the 3 s 1 s basis for a 10-year term. Exhibit 33 shows how the asset and liability in question can be matched using the 3 s 1 s basis swap.

### Using 6 s 3 s basis swaps to match bank assets and liabilities

In the international markets,  a significant amount of corporate funding is benchmarked to 6-month LIBOR,  i.e.,  companies raise funding by issuing debt tied to the 6-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate. At the same time,  international companies also generally hold assets linked to 3-month LIBOR. If left unhedged,  the exposure to the 6 s 3 s basis can be a source of risk (Exhibit 36). An investor who wants to minimize this basis risk can buy the 6 s 3 s basis as inexpensive insurance. The mechanics of how this can be achieved are laid out in Exhibit 37 below.

### Using 3 s 1 s basis swaps to convert issuance exposure from fixed to 1-month LIBOR

Issuers of fixed-rate debt may want to have exposure to 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] instead of a fixed rate to match their liabilities to their assets better or if they are concerned about falling interest rates. In order to achieve funding based on 1-month LIBOR,  the issuer can enter into a swap contract,  receiving fixed and paying 3-month LIBOR,  and use the 3 s 1 s basis swap to swap the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] exposure to 1-month LIBOR. The result is exposure to 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] instead of a fixed rate. Exhibit 38 shows how a synthetic exposure to 1 m [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] can be created for fixed-rate issuance using the 3 s 1 s basis swap.

### Using 3 s 1 s basis swaps to match assets and liabilities of mortgage portfolios

Issuers of mortgage loans that are based on the 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate with monthly repayments are often faced with an asset-liability mismatch since the funding for these loans is generally based on 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rates. The 3 s 1 s basis swap enables owners of mortgage portfolios to match their assets and liabilities better. The mechanics of this asset/liability matching using a 3 s 1 s basis swap are shown in Exhibit . 39

# Fed Funds/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Basis Swap

### Overview

A fed funds/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap is a floating-for-floating exchange of (netted) cash flows where the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] (FF) leg is tied to the fed effective rate and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] leg to 3-month LIBOR. Spreads are quoted against the FF leg and the payment is made quarterly. The basis swap is referred to simply as "Feds",  and thus "1 yr Feds" refers to a one-year FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap. With many institutions that fund based on the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective but have assets tied to LIBOR,  FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps can match assets and liabilities. The FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap captures bank credit and term premiums since it represents the spread between expected term bank funding rates (LIBOR) and a nearly risk-free daily rate (fed funds). FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps are used extensively in both hedging and speculation.

### **Exhibit 40: Cash flows at each payment date for a FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap**

Source: Credit Suisse

There is a two-day rate cut-off applied to the FF leg of the FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap because of the one-day lag in the release of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate. The final [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective fixing is applied to the last two fixing days. Exhibit shows a hypothetical calculation for the daily weighted arithmetic average of the fed effective rate. It is possible to trade absent the rate cut-off so long as the counterparty can make timely payment on the payment date. It is also possible to trade the basis swap versus 1-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] as long as the payment on the FF leg is clearly specified as monthly or quarterly. Monthly payment includes more rate cut-off periods over the year and thus additional bid/offer spreads will apply. 41

Note that the FF leg in a FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap differs from the floating leg of an Is (of the same maturity) in the way the daily weighted average is calculated. Is uses geometric averaging,  while the FF leg in a FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap uses arithmetic averaging.

### Using FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to convert a swap spread trade to a repo/Is trade

FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps can be used to convert a short swap spread trade synthetically into a repo/Is trade. This isolated exposure to repo/Is allows an investor to express a view on a cheapening of repo (for example,  if the investor expects Fed reverse repo operations). Swap spreads embed a credit component in addition to repo/Is expectations. Specifically,  being short the swap spread alone exposes the investor to the difference between the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate and the 3-month repo rate. The repo rate component would be expected to increase if liquidity conditions tighten. However,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] component,  which depends on credit risk of financial institutions,  can potentially increase by more than the increase in repo rates.

By constructing a repo/Is trade,  an investor can isolate the exposure to repo/Is. Exhibit 42 shows how the repo/Is trade can be created synthetically with the help of a swap spread and the FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap (based on current market prices).

### Using FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to hedge [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] floaters

The demand,  and thus the supply,  for [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] floaters has grown as investors seek to avoid LIBOR/FF spread risk in uncertain market environments. [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] floaters are also an attractive alternative for investors who use the repo market for overnight liquidity. These investors can invest core liquidity daily in a [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] floater instead of investing cash in the repo market,  which can sometimes be prone to limitations based on dealer balance sheets.

### Using FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to extract 5 yr 5 yr real fed funds

FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps allow investors to determine the market-implied 5 yr 5 yr real [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] . Specifically,  5-year and 10-year FF/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps can be used along with 5 yr 5 yr swaps to extract the market-implied 5 yr 5 yr [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] ,  which can then be used in conjunction with the 5 yr 5 yr TIPS breakeven to construct the market-implied 5 yr 5 yr real [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] . Standard interest rate rules specify that the long-run equilibrium for the real [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] is somewhere between 2% and 3%. The market-implied 5 yr 5 yr real [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] is presented in Exhibit 44. Dislocations from the long-run equilibrium may provide trading opportunities. For instance,  when the market-implied real [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds Rate]] is higher than 3%,  it is likely the implied rate will revert toward the long-run equilibrium range. An investor can express this view by receiving fixed in a 5 yr 5 yr Is while being long the 5 yr 5 yr TIPS breakevens.

# Prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Basis Swap Overview

The prime rate originated as the overnight domestic interest rate that commercial banks charged their most creditworthy customers. In the US,  the prime rate has generally been 300 basis points above the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target rate and is used extensively as a reference for loans like home equity lines of credit (HELOC),  credit cards,  and car and student loans. The official prime fixing is published as part of the Federal Reserve's H0.\1 release and is the rate posted by a majority of the top 25 insured U.S.-chartered commercial banks (by assets in domestic offices).

A prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap is a floating-for-floating exchange of (netted) cash flows,  where the prime leg is tied to the prime rate (H0.\1) and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] leg is tied to 3-month LIBOR. The prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] swap is similar to the fed funds/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap,  where the first leg is 3 month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] flat and the second non-[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] leg (prime) is computed as the weighted average of a daily rate. Payments are made quarterly and accruals are on an Act/360 basis for both legs. These basis swaps have a rate cut-off period of two days before the quarterly settlement on the prime leg because of the one-day lag in the release of prime rates. The final prime rate fixing is therefore applied to the last two fixing days.

Prime rates are based on riskier lending and generally are higher than LIBOR,  so the spread on this basis swap is typically negative and quoted as "prime minus spread."

A variant on the prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap is called the Discrete Prime basis swap,  where the prime leg depends on a single day per quarter instead of the three-month daily weighted average in the standard prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap case. However,  this structure is heavily exposed to inter-meeting FOMC rate changes,  as the FOMC meeting is extremely difficult to hedge without slippage.

**Exhibit 45: Historical Prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] Spread**

 ![500](_page_28_Figure_8.jpeg)

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps for asset liability matching

Banks often issue loans that are based on the prime rate with monthly repayments,  like credit card,  HELOC and car loans. However,  these loans tend to be funded by LIBORbased liabilities. In order to match their assets and liabilities,  banks that hold such loans can use prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps.

Assume a bank has a student loan portfolio with a maturity of ten years based on prime + 100 bps. Further,  assume the portfolio is funded by Eurodollar deposits that pay 3-month LIBOR. As seen in Exhibit 45,  the spread between the funding rate and the interest income from the loan is volatile and can be a source of risk. To hedge against the volatility in the prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spread,  the bank can pay prime versus [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] in a swap to lock in the difference between the funding rate and the interest income (Exhibit ). 46

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to hedge prime floaters

Issuers of floating-rate notes based on the prime rate may seek to fund in 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] in order to avoid exposure to unexpected hikes in the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target rate. Prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps can be used to convert the funding based on the prime rate to funding based on 3-month LIBOR. Exhibit 47 outlines how the hedge can be constructed using a prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap.

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to express a view on [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective diverging from target

The prime rate is the only rate that directly references the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target. The prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap can be used together with the FRA/Is spread to express a view on the divergence of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective from the target. If an investor expects the difference between the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target rate and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate to widen,  the hypothetical trade illustrated in Exhibit could be used to express this view. If,  on average,  over the three-month period starting three months from trade date,  the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target is higher than the effective by more than 5 bps,  the trade would result in a profit. Currently,  the relevant target for prime is the upper end of the Fed's range for the effective (0% - 0.25%); the effective has been trading 11-14 bps below this upper band. 48

 ![500](_page_30_Figure_2.jpeg)

Assume a bank has a student loan portfolio with a maturity of ten years based on prime $^+$ 100 bps. Further,  assume the portfolio is funded by Eurodollar deposits that pay 3-month LIBOR. As seen in Exhibit 45,  the spread between the funding rate and the interest income from the loan is volatile and can be a source of risk. To hedge against the volatility in the prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] spread,  the bank can pay prime versus [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] in a swap to lock in the difference between the funding rate and the interest income (Exhibit 46 ).

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swaps to hedge a credit card portfolio

Banks that issue credit cards often have credit card rates tied to the prime rate. The funding for these credit card loan portfolios tends to be based on the 3-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate. To hedge the mismatch between the credit card loan payments (monthly based on the prime rate) and the funding rate (3-month LIBOR),  the prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap can be used. Exhibit shows how the prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] basis swap can hedge a credit card portfolio by removing the exposure to the prime rate and instead locking in the interest income and funding rate differential. 49

A prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis swap is a floating-for-floating exchange of (netted) cash flows,  where the prime leg is tied to the prime rate (H0.\1) and the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] leg is tied to the overnight [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rate (H0.\1). Both legs are computed as the weighted arithmetic average of the daily rate and payments are made quarterly (accruals on an act/360 basis for both legs). The spread is quoted against the FF leg. These basis swaps have a rate cut-off period of two days before the quarterly settlement on both the prime and FF legs because of the one-day lag in the release of the prime and [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective rates.

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis swaps to express a view on consumer credit quality

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/0eaf8e91b17f0a0d594c111ee8158c66b92a448013774b4115818b1b8981d999.jpg)

The prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis can be viewed as a proxy for consumer credit quality,  with the prime leg tied to lending rate for banks' most creditworthy customers and the FF leg tied to a near risk-free interest rate. In practice,  the prime rate is 300 bps over the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target rate and changes only with the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target. However,  if consumer credit deteriorates significantly,  it is not unthinkable for banks to increase the spread over the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] target from current levels. If an investor believed this event was imminent,  he/she could express this view by receiving the prime leg and paying the FF leg,  as shown in Exhibit 50.

### Using prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis swaps to express a view on divergence of fed effective from target

The prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis is directly linked to the difference between [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] effective and the target rate (with prime at target + 300 bps). Note that the fed target is currently in a range between 0% and 0.25% and the prime rate is 300 bps higher than the upper bound on the range. If an investor expects the fed effective to diverge further from the target rate,  a prime/[[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Federal Funds Market|Fed Funds]] basis swap can be used to express this view. The mechanics of the trade would be the same as shown previously in Exhibit . 49
