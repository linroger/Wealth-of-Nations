**A Comprehensive Guide to Constructing Synthetic Replicating Portfolios**

  

In financial markets, synthetic replicating portfolios are powerful tools that allow investors to replicate the cash flows and payoffs of a financial instrument or derivative using a combination of other financial assets. This guide provides an extensive exploration of how various financial instruments and derivatives can be replicated. We delve into the mathematical derivations, payoff functions, and graphical representations of these replicating portfolios, assuming a complete market under the no-arbitrage condition.

**1. List of Financial Instruments and Derivatives**

  

The financial instruments and derivatives whose payoff functions can be replicated include:

  

• **Forward Contracts**

• **European Call Options**

• **European Put Options**

• **Zero-Coupon Bonds**

• **Coupon Bonds**

• **Fixed-for-Floating Interest Rate Swaps**

• **Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**

• **Quantos**

• **Binary Options**

  

  

  

**2. Replicating a Forward Contract**

  

A forward contract obligates the holder to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date at a price agreed upon today. The forward price  is determined to prevent arbitrage opportunities.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

The payoff  of a long forward contract at maturity  is:

  

  

  

where:

  

• = Spot price of the underlying asset at time 

• = Forward price agreed upon at initiation

  

  

  

**2.1 Using Underlying Asset and Risk-Free Asset**

  

**Strategy**: Replicate the forward contract by purchasing the underlying asset and financing the purchase by borrowing at the risk-free rate. The logic behind this strategy is to simulate the obligation of buying the asset at a future date by owning it now and accounting for the cost of carrying it through borrowing.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 unit of the underlying asset**

2 **Borrow  at the risk-free rate** 

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Asset Value**

2 **Repay Borrowed Amount with Interest**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

Under the no-arbitrage condition, the forward price  should be set such that:

  

  

  

Thus, the payoff becomes:

  

  

  

This matches the net payoff from the replication strategy, confirming that the combination of being long the asset and financing it through borrowing replicates the forward contract’s payoff.

  

**Explanation**

  

By purchasing the asset today and borrowing the funds to do so, we create a position where we own the asset but have a liability equal to the future value of the borrowed amount. At maturity, the asset’s value  offsets the debt repayment , resulting in a net payoff identical to that of a long forward contract.

  

  

  

**2.2 Using Options (Put-Call Parity)**

  

**Strategy**: Utilize the put-call parity relationship to replicate a forward contract using European call and put options with the same strike price and expiration date. The put-call parity establishes a fundamental relationship between the prices of calls, puts, and the underlying asset.

  

**Put-Call Parity Formula**

  

  

  

where:

  

• = Price of a European call option with strike 

• = Price of a European put option with strike 

• = Current price of the underlying asset

• = Risk-free interest rate

• = Time to maturity

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 European Call Option (Strike )**

2 **Short 1 European Put Option (Strike )**

3 **Invest  in Risk-Free Bond**

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Call Option Payoff**

2 **Put Option Payoff**

3 **Bond Matures**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

At maturity, the net payoff is:

  

  

  

This replicates the payoff of a forward contract with forward price .

  

**Explanation**

  

By going long a call and short a put with the same strike and maturity, and investing the present value of the strike price in a risk-free bond, we synthesize the obligations of a forward contract. The options’ payoffs ensure that we will effectively buy the asset at price  at maturity, matching the forward contract’s payoff.

  

  

  

**3. Replicating European Call Options**

  

A European call option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a specified strike price  on the expiration date .

  

**Payoff Function**

  

  

  

  

  

**3.1 Using Stock and Risk-Free Bond**

  

**Strategy**: Construct a replicating portfolio by combining a position in the underlying asset and a position in the risk-free bond. The key is to determine the appropriate proportion of each to mimic the option’s payoff.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Buy  units of the underlying asset**

2 **Borrow  at the risk-free rate** 

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Value of  units of the asset**

2 **Repay Borrowed Amount with Interest**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Determining  and** 

  

To replicate the call option payoff, we need to choose  and  such that:

  

  

  

Since the call option payoff is nonlinear and the combination of stock and bond provides a linear payoff, perfect replication requires dynamic adjustment (delta hedging) over time. However, at a single point in time (e.g., at initiation), we can approximate  using the option’s delta from the Black-Scholes model:

  

  

  

where  is the cumulative standard normal distribution function.

  

**Explanation**

  

By purchasing  units of the stock, we gain exposure to the asset’s price movements. Borrowing  finances this purchase. The combination aims to match the option’s sensitivity to changes in the underlying asset’s price. However, due to the option’s convexity, this replication is not perfect unless adjustments are made continuously, which is beyond static replication.

  

  

  

**3.2 Using Put Options and Forward Contracts**

  

**Strategy**: Utilize the put-call parity to express the call option in terms of a put option and a forward contract. This method leverages the known payoffs of puts and forwards to construct the call’s payoff.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 European Put Option (Strike )**

2 **Long 1 Forward Contract at price** Zero

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Put Option Payoff**

2 **Forward Contract Payoff**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

At maturity, the net payoff is:

  

  

  

**Explanation**

  

The forward contract ensures we have the obligation to buy the asset at price , while the put option provides protection if the asset’s price falls below . The combination effectively replicates the call option’s payoff, allowing us to benefit from price increases above  while limiting losses to zero if the price is below .

  

  

  

**4. Replicating European Put Options**

  

A European put option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified strike price  on the expiration date .

  

**Payoff Function**

  

  

  

  

  

**4.1 Using Stock and Risk-Free Bond**

  

**Strategy**: Create a replicating portfolio by shorting the underlying asset and investing in a risk-free bond. This approach aims to mirror the payoff profile of a put option.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Short 1 unit of the underlying asset**

2 **Invest  in Risk-Free Bond**

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Close Short Position by Buying Asset at** 

2 **Receive Bond Maturity Value**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Explanation**

  

By shorting the asset, we profit if the asset’s price declines. The investment in the bond ensures we have a fixed amount  at maturity. The net payoff  matches the put option’s payoff when . However, if , the net payoff becomes negative, which does not align with the put option’s payoff (which is zero in this case). Therefore, this strategy does not perfectly replicate the put option’s payoff across all possible outcomes without adjustments.

  

  

  

**4.2 Using Call Options and Forward Contracts**

  

**Strategy**: Use the put-call parity to express the put option in terms of a call option and a forward contract.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 European Call Option (Strike )**

2 **Short 1 Forward Contract at price** Zero

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Call Option Payoff**

2 **Forward Contract Payoff**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

At maturity, the net payoff is:

  

  

  

**Explanation**

  

The short forward position obligates us to sell the asset at price , while the long call option allows us to buy the asset if the price exceeds . This combination ensures that we capture the benefits of price declines below , replicating the put option’s payoff.

  

  

  

**5. Replicating Zero-Coupon Bonds**

  

A zero-coupon bond pays a single lump sum  at maturity  with no interim coupon payments.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

  

  

  

  

**5.1 Using Risk-Free Assets**

  

**Strategy**: Invest the present value of the future payment  at the risk-free rate to accumulate to  at maturity. This strategy is straightforward, relying on the time value of money.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Invest  in Risk-Free Asset**

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Receive Maturity Value**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

The present value  is calculated as:

  

  

  

At maturity, the investment grows to:

  

  

  

**Explanation**

  

By investing the discounted value of the future payment, we ensure that the investment will grow to the desired amount  at maturity. This mirrors the cash flow of a zero-coupon bond, effectively replicating its payoff.

  

  

  

**6. Replicating Coupon Bonds**

  

A coupon bond pays periodic coupon payments  and the face value  at maturity.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

  

  

  

  

**6.1 Using Zero-Coupon Bonds**

  

**Strategy**: Replicate a coupon bond by purchasing a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds that correspond to each coupon payment and the face value at maturity.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

For each payment at time :

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Buy Zero-Coupon Bond maturing at  with face value** 

2 **Buy Zero-Coupon Bond maturing at  with face value** 

_Total Investment_

  

**At Each Coupon Date  and Maturity** 

  

**Time** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

**Receive Coupon Payment**

**Receive Coupon Payment**

**Receive Coupon Payment and Face Value**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

By purchasing zero-coupon bonds for each cash flow, we lock in the payments at their present values, ensuring the cash flows occur as scheduled.

  

**Explanation**

  

This strategy decomposes the coupon bond into its constituent cash flows and secures each one individually. By matching the timing and amounts of the bond’s payments, we effectively replicate the bond’s cash flows using more fundamental instruments (zero-coupon bonds).

  

  

  

**7. Replicating Fixed-for-Floating Interest Rate Swaps**

  

An interest rate swap involves exchanging fixed interest payments for floating interest payments over a specified period.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

At each payment date :

  

  

  

where:

  

• = Fixed interest rate

• = Floating interest rate (e.g., LIBOR)

• = Notional principal

• = Time fraction for the period

  

  

  

**7.1 Using Bonds**

  

**Strategy**: Replicate the swap by taking opposing positions in a fixed-rate bond and a floating-rate bond with the same notional principal and payment dates.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long Floating-Rate Note (FRN)**

2 **Short Fixed-Rate Bond**

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Each Payment Date** 

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Receive Floating Interest Payment from FRN**

2 **Pay Fixed Interest Payment on Bond**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

The net payoff at each payment date is the difference between the floating and fixed interest payments, which matches the swap’s cash flows.

  

**Explanation**

  

By holding a floating-rate note, we receive floating interest payments. By shorting a fixed-rate bond, we are obligated to pay fixed interest payments. The combination replicates the net cash flows of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap, allowing us to exchange fixed payments for floating ones.

  

  

  

**8. Replicating Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)**

  

Mortgage-Backed Securities are asset-backed securities secured by a collection of mortgages. They have complex cash flows due to prepayment risk.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

  

  

  

  

**8.1 Using Bonds and Options**

  

**Strategy**: Replicate an MBS by holding a long position in a fixed-rate bond and a short position in a call option on that bond. The logic is that homeowners have the option to prepay their mortgages, akin to a call option held against the investor.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 Fixed-Rate Bond (e.g., 30-year mortgage bond)**

2 **Short 1 Call Option on the Bond (Strike )**

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity or Prepayment Time ()**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Receive Bond Payments**

2 **Option Exercise (if )**

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

• **Bond Payoff ()**: Sum of coupon payments and face value.

• **Option Payoff ()**: , where  is the bond’s value at time .

• **Net Payoff**: Accounts for the possibility of prepayment (option exercise).

  

**Explanation**

  

By shorting the call option, we simulate the prepayment option that borrowers have. If interest rates decline (bond prices rise), borrowers are likely to prepay, and the option is exercised against us. This setup mirrors the cash flow characteristics of an MBS, capturing both the regular bond payments and the prepayment risk.

  

  

  

**9. Replicating Quantos**

  

Quantos are derivatives where the underlying asset is denominated in one currency but settled in another at a fixed exchange rate, insulating the payoff from exchange rate fluctuations.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

For a Quanto call option:

  

  

  

where:

  

• = Underlying asset price at maturity in foreign currency

• = Strike price in foreign currency

• = Fixed exchange rate

  

  

  

**9.1 Using Options and Currency Forwards**

  

**Strategy**: Combine a foreign call option and a forward contract to fix the exchange rate.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long Call Option on Foreign Asset (Strike )**

2 **Enter into Forward Contract to Sell Foreign Currency at Rate** Zero

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Call Option Payoff in Foreign Currency**

2 **Sell Foreign Currency at Fixed Rate** 

_Net Payoff ()_

  

**Explanation**

  

The foreign call option provides the right to buy the foreign asset at . The forward contract locks in the exchange rate  for converting any foreign currency proceeds into domestic currency. This combination ensures that the payoff depends only on the performance of the foreign asset, not on exchange rate movements, replicating the Quanto’s payoff.

  

  

  

**10. Replicating Binary Options**

  

A binary (digital) option pays a fixed amount if the underlying asset meets certain conditions at expiration.

  

**Payoff Function**

  

For a cash-or-nothing binary call option:

  

  

  

where:

  

• = Fixed payout

• = Indicator function (1 if , 0 otherwise)

  

  

  

**10.1 Using Call Spreads**

  

**Strategy**: Approximate the binary option by constructing a tight call spread, buying a call at  and selling a call at , where  is very small.

  

**Trades and Timing**

  

**At Initiation (Time 0)**

  

**Step** **Trade** **Price**

1 **Long 1 Call Option at Strike** 

2 **Short 1 Call Option at Strike** 

_Net Cash Flow_

  

**At Maturity (Time )**

  

**Step** **Cash Flow** **Amount**

1 **Net Payoff**

_Net Payoff ()_ if , else 0

  

**Mathematical Derivation**

  

As :

  

  

  

**Explanation**

  

The tight call spread creates a payoff that is non-zero only in a narrow range above the strike . By adjusting  and the quantities involved, we can approximate the binary payoff. This method relies on the properties of options to create a step-like payoff profile similar to that of a binary option.

  

  

  

**11. Visualizations and Payoff Diagrams**

  

To better understand the replication strategies, we provide payoff diagrams using Plotly for selected instruments.

  

**Example: Replicating a European Call Option Using Put and Forward**

  

**Code for Payoff Diagram**

  

import numpy as np

import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Payoff functions

payoff_call = np.maximum(S_T - K, 0)

payoff_put = np.maximum(K - S_T, 0)

payoff_forward = S_T - F

payoff_replication = payoff_put + payoff_forward

  

# Create plot

fig = go.Figure()

  

# Plot Call Option Payoff

                  legend_title='Payoff',

                  showlegend=True)

  

fig.show()

  

**Explanation**

  

The diagram illustrates that the payoff from the combination of a long put option and a long forward contract (red dashed line) matches the payoff of a long call option (blue solid line). The vertical dashed line indicates the strike price .

  

  

  

**12. Conclusion**

  

This comprehensive guide has provided detailed explanations of how to construct synthetic replicating portfolios for various financial instruments, including forwards, options, bonds, swaps, MBS, quantos, and binary options. By understanding the underlying logic and mathematical derivations, investors and practitioners can effectively replicate desired payoffs and implement strategies that align with their financial objectives.

  

We included step-by-step derivations, detailed trade breakdowns, and payoff diagrams created with Plotly to visually represent how each replication works. This guide serves as a valuable resource for understanding and constructing replicating portfolios in a complete market under the no-arbitrage condition.

  

**Note**: All examples assume continuous compounding and frictionless markets without transaction costs or taxes. The strategies discussed are theoretical and may require adjustments in real-world applications due to market imperfections and transaction costs.
