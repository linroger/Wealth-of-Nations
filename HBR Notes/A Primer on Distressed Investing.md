# A Primer on Distressed Investing

by Stephen G. Moyer,  Distressed Debt Alpha,  David Martin,  Orix Corp.,  and John Martin,  Baylor University*

Acquiring control of a company typically involves buying the firm's equity and then assuming its liabilities. For example,  when Chevron purchased Atlas Energy in February of 2011,  it paid Atlas's shareholders $46.53 per share for their stock and assumed the firm's debt. The net result was that Chevron paid $3.2 billion in cash and assumed $1.1 billion in net debt to complete the transaction. But it is possible to acquire control of a company without paying anything to its current equity holders when the firm is financially distressed and having trouble meeting its debt obligations. In such circumstances,  the value of the firm often drops to the point that its equity—and possibly the value of other securities in its capital structure-could be wiped out entirely if the firm files for bankruptcy or gets restructured outside of court. The process of acquiring control of a firm's assets by investing in its debt prior to or during a restructuring of its capital is known as distressed or "vulture" investing.

Distressed investing can also be thought of as a form of "value investing." Both value and distressed investors buy the securities of firms that they feel are undervalued. However,  unlike value investing,  where the returns arise through an appreciation of the purchased security in its original form (e.g.,  shares of stock),  in distressed investing the returns often come from securities that are received in exchange for the ones originally purchased (for example,  common stock received in exchange for debt purchased in the distressed firm).

The term vulture investor,  which was popularized by Hillary Rosenberg in her book The Vulture Investors,  comes from the notion that the investor "preys" on the distressed firm in hopes of gaining control over all or a portion of the firm's assets at a bargain price. In this setting,  it is not hard to imagine why the atmosphere in which vulture investments are made is frequently contentious,  especially since some of the security holders of the distressed firm face the prospect of losing some or all of their investment. These "battles" are usually waged among competing groups of experienced institutional investors who have purchased the various claims at prices they thought were attractive at the time of purchase and the process can be a zero-sum game where some investors clearly lose. As a result,  many distressed investors have garnered a well-deserved reputation for being ruthless.

Well-known distressed investors include Leon Black,  Martin Whitman,  Marc Lazary and Carl Icahn,  as well as a growing list of private equity firms.' However,  many people may be surprised to learn that mild-mannered Warren Buffett has long been an investor in distressed companies. For example,  Berkshire bought $255 million of senior,  unsecured notes of Seitel,  Inc.,  a provider of geological data to oil companies,  in the hopes of gaining control of the firm,  which was in bankruptcy at the time. But the planned takeover failed when Seitel was able to repay the notes preventing Berkshire from gaining control of the firm.'

There is nothing inherently wrong with distressed invest-ing. In fact,  distressed investors are a critical component of the U.S. capital markets. When a company's distress becomes known,  the ease with which corporate debt claims can be traded today means that the holders of the debt of a distressed firm change rapidly. The original lenders,  who were presumably anticipating a relatively low-risk,  performing debt instrument,  are replaced by distress investors hedge funds and other sophisticated investors) with the risk tolerance to participate in the restructuring of the firm.

Viewed in this fashion,  distressed investors are a valuable source of liquidity that enables the original investors or lenders to the company to sell their investments and reduce their exposure to the often risky process of bankruptcy. And in so doing,  such distressed investors also facilitate the restructuring of failed companies? In a widely cited article called "The End of Bankruptcy" that was published in 2002,  the authors argued that (even back then) the majority of companies that experienced financial distress no longer entered bankruptcy.* Moreover,  as we discuss below,  the companies that do enter Chapter 11 often have a prearranged plan to expedite the bankruptcy process. Thus,  the traditional idea of a Bankruptcy Court as the principal forum where creditors,  shareholders,  and the board of directors negotiate the firm's future has been fading away for some time? Replacing the old administrated system is a market-driven process in which the distressed investor is a key player.

In the pages that follow,  we discuss a specific form of proactive distressed investingone that involves acquiring control of a firm's assets by investing in its debt prior to a restructuring event.'° Lack of awareness of the process by which creditors take control of distressed firms,  the growing number of distressed investors,  and the importance of the function they play in the economy are our principal motives for writing this paper.

The paper is organized as follows:

- In Section 1 we describe the restructuring process in terms of three steps: valuation of the distressed firm's assets,  development of a new capital structure for the distressed firm,  and execution of the plan to gain control of the distressed firm and implement the new capital structure.
- Section 2 uses a hypothetical case study to illustrate the three-step process and the fact that distressed investing is more than a mechanical process or mere financial exercise. To navigate the three-step investing process success-fully,  distress investors must consider a host of legal,  financial,  and behavioral problems.
- Section 3 examines the potential for profits from distressed investing in the context of our hypothetical example. The purpose of this discussion is to explore the risk-reward proposition of distressed investing.
- Section 4 provides a discussion of the factors that conspire to mak[DiD](Lecture%2013-%20Difference-In-Differences%20(Part%202%20Of%202).md)uccessful distressed investing difficult. The potential profits from distressed investing come out of various structural and behavioral aspects of the market and the complexity encountered in both valuing the distressed firm and constructing and executing a successful restructuring plan.

## THE THREE-STEP RESTRUCTURING PROCESS

The objective of the kind of distressed investing we will be considering here is to acquire the post-reorganization equity of a distressed firm at a discount by purchasing what the distressed investor hopes are undervalued debt claims. We discuss the process of gaining control of the equity of a distressed firm as a three-step process.

Step 1: Value the underlying business/assets of the firm. The fundamental question that must be answered first is,  what is the value of the firm's assets? This value determines to a large extent which of the firm's creditors will be entitled to receive a partial or full recovery. That is,  which creditors are "in the money." Their recovery could be in cash,  new securities,  or some combination thereof. For example,  if the firm's assets are estimated to be worth $100 million and it has outstanding senior debt claims of $150 million as well as more junior preferred and common equity,  then it is likely that only the senior debt claims will receive any recovery. Based on the numbers,  this recovery will only be for a portion (66%) of the face value of their claim; and unless the company is being liquidated,  the senior debt will probably receive new debt or equity securities rather than cash. The last creditor tranche or group that receives anything in the restructured firm is commonly referred to as the "fulcrum security,  " since the owners) of this tranche" of securities tends to gain control of the restructured firm's equity through the restructuring process. To simplify our discussion we will refer to the "fulcrum security" as a single tranche of a firm's debt. In practice the fulcrum security is the tranche or tranches that will receive all or a majority of their recovery in the form of the post-reorganization equity. It is the fulcrum security owners that then will control the equity of the restructured firm.

Step 2: Determine the appropriate capital structure for the restructured business. Step 2 addresses the issue of how to "resize" or best capitalize the business,  given that in most cases some business or economic challenge has caused the business to decline in value relative to where it was when the firm was originally financed. A number of considerations,  both financial and political,  will be factored into the appropriate capital structure of the restructured firm,  and this will in turn affect the identification of the fulcrum security and the form or type of recovery that the various "in the money" constituencies of creditors will receive. From a financial perspective,  the firm's "debt capacity" might be viewed as the upper limit of how much debt should be left on the firm. Although maximizing leverage is often one approach to improving potential equity returns,  it obviously increases risk and thus the parties to the restructuring may view a less levered capital structure as more appropriate. For example,  in the 2001 restructuring of the Washington Group,  an Idaho-based engineering and construction services firm,  the creditors believed that reducing or eliminating the perceived risk that the firm might default in the future was so critical to winning future business and obtaining project bonding that the restructured entity initially had no long-term debt.! The post-restructuring debt level may also affect which pre-restructuring tranches will receive debt versus equity in the restructuring. Those that receive equity become the new owners of the firm and their pre-restructuring debt tranche is the fulcrum security. A distinctive feature of distressed investing is that the new equity is typically created by the conversion of the fulcrum tranche(s) of the firm's debt into ownership of a majority of the firm's equity.'S As a result,  the distressed holders of that debt will assume control of the firm's equity and hence control the restructured firm's assets.

Step 3: Execute the restructuring plan. In this step,  the company's pre-reorganization capital structure is replaced by the new capital structure derived in Step 2,  either through a bankruptcy or an out-of-court process. In the restructuring process,  holders of the company's securities are distributed something of value in satisfaction of their claim,  unless their securities are deemed worthless or "out-of-the-money,  " in which case they are then either "wiped out" in a bankruptcy process or materially diluted in a voluntary exchange. As we noted earlier in Step 1,  the distribution can include cash,  securities (debt or equity),  or some combination of the two. In certain situations,  the distressed firm may raise new capital by borrowing or issuing new securities in the capital markets. Such capital is typically used to repay some of the claims of the pre-restructuring creditors. Under the scenario where no capital is raised through the capital markets,  the firm's pre-reorganization creditors will receive newly issued securities (which can include debt,  equity,  or some combination) in satisfaction of their claims.

## ILLUSTRATING THE DISTRESSED INVESTING PROCESS—HOMEMAX INC

Since distressed investing can be extremely complicated,  we use a hypothetical company named HomeMax Inc. to illustrate the process. HomeMax is financially distressed and facing the prospect of bankruptcy or an out-of-court restructuring (i.e.,  workout). The firm was a successful regional home supply retailer operating in the prosperous northwestern U.S. Although it competed with Home Depot and Lowes,  it successfully differentiated itself by targeting upscale customers with higher-end appliances and fixtures in combination with superior interior design services.

### THE HOMEMAX STORY: A PATH TO FINANCIAL DISTRESS

HomeMax was a late-2003 leveraged buyout by Train & Co.

(Train),  a well-regarded private equity investment firm,  which purchased HomeMax just as the recovery from the 2000-2002 recession began to accelerate. Train paid $562.5 million for HomeMax,    which in 2003 generated $75 million in earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and amortization (EBITDA) on revenues of $500 million. The price paid by Train represented a valuation multiple of 7.5 times (in the industry,  and hereafter in this article,  this is expressed as "7.5x)

EBITDA,  which was in line with where retailers were being valued at that time.' Train financed the acquisition,  which included approximately $75 million of assumed liabilities,    with $200 million in secured bank debt,  $100 million in senior notes,    and an equity contribution of $262.5 million. Summary data for the leveraged acquisition are set forth as in Exhibit 1.

Initially,  the acquisition appeared to be a stroke of genius. As the economy recovered and housing expanded at record rates,  sales grew approximately 15% annually and Train's operating execution expanded its EBITDA margin (EBITDA/Revenues) from 15% to 19%. HomeMax began generating so much free cash flow that Train immediately started extracting dividends and,  by the end of 2006,  it had reduced its net equity investment to slightly over $100 million. Had it sold HomeMax at that time for the then going market multiple for retailers of 8.5x EBITDA,    it might have generated an investment gain of approximately $800 million!

But it did not. Instead,  impressed with its investment acumen and buoyed by its still bullish outlook for the housing market,  Train decided to make a significant acquisition to rapidly expand HomeMax into Northern California—a contiguous,  and similarly upscale,  geographic region —by purchasing HomeLux,  a strategically similar home product retailer. HomeLux,  in Train's view,  was almost exactly like HomeMax in 2003,  but with even more upside potential.

In 2006 it generated $500 million in revenue but only $60 million in EBITDA,  representing an EBITDA margin of 12% as compared to the 19% earned by HomeMax. Assuming Train could quickly integrate HomeLux's operations with HomeMax,  they were expected to generate comparable operating results (if not improved results given the larger operating scale). So confident was HomeMax that it could realize significant operating synergies,  it agreed to buy HomeLux for $540 million,    representing a slight premium of 9.0x HomeLux's 2006 EBITDA of $60 million. After taking into account $70 million in assumed liabilities,    HomeMax financed the transaction with $325 million in debt and a $145 million equity contribution (which was actually less than the dividends they had already extracted from HomeMax—so in a sense they were purchasing HomeLux with no additional investor capital). Summary data relating to the HomeLux acquisition is set forth in Exhibit 2.

However,  things did not go as planned. Integration issues hurt financial performance and required significantly more capital expenditures than budgeted. In addition,  Train,  like almost everyone else,  had not foreseen the housing collapse in late 2007 and the significant recession that ensued. The enlarged HomeMax suffered revenue declines of 20% in 2008 and 15% in 2009,  and the EBITDA margin collapsed to as low as 6%,  resulting in moderately negative cash flow (see Exhibit 3). While this might have been financed with incremental secured bank debt,  the banks had almost completely withdrawn from the market at that time and Train was forced to contribute incremental equity in 2009 and 2010 just to keep HomeMax solvent.

### HOMEMAX'S CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION

Let's assume that it is now the first calendar quarter of 2012.

After reviewing the performance data in Exhibit 3,  it appears that the economy stabilized in 2011,  HomeMax's operations improved significantly and,  compared to 2010,  its EBITDA increased by approximately 50% to $79.75 million during 2011. However,    as shown in Exhibit 4,    at the end of 2011,    HomeMax's total debt is $625 million,  giving it financial leverage of 7.8x EBITDA.

This poses a serious problem for Train. Given HomeMax's slower growth outlook in general,  and the mixed outlook for housing at the end of 2011,  the market valuation multiple for firms like HomeMax had declined to 7.0x EBITDA,  implying a total enterprise value for HomeMax of only $558 million (i.e.,    7 x $79.75 million). Since HomeMax's total debt is $625 million,    Train is materially "under water" (i.e.,    it has lost all of its equity investment). Putting Train aside,    HomeMax also has a looming liquidity problem because both its first-and second-lien secured notes (hereinafter referred to as "IL" and "2L,   " respectively) mature at the end of the current year (December 31,    2012). Furthermore,    HomeMax's bankers have advised the firm that it is very unlikely that these notes can be refinanced for at least two reasons: First,    the 1L and 2L debt in aggregate represent $400 million,  or 5.0x leverage,  which is significantly more than the 3.0 to 3.5x leverage that lenders are willing to extend in the current climate. Second. the $100 million in senior notes that Train used to finance the original HomeMax buyout in 2004 are maturing in 2014.

This is a problem because even if a lender could be found to refinance the maturing 1L and 2L debt,  they would be reluctant to do so because,  in just two years,  HomeMax will face another refinancing challenge: Right now it looks like there is not sufficient enterprise value to cover the senior notes (i.e.,  HomeMax's enterprise value is only $558 million compared to its total debt of $625 million),  and so those notes (collectively,  the senior notes due 6/30/14 and the senior notes due 9/30/15) now appear impossible to refinance.

|EBITDA/Revenues %|11.0%|7.0%|6.0%|6.0%|9.0%|

In other words,  even if the secured debt is refinanced,  a restructuring or bankruptcy shortly thereafter is a significant risk and few lenders,  even distressed investors,  like to assume that much risk and uncertainty. This would be particularly true in HomeMax's case. A close examination of its balance sheet in Exhibit 4 shows that tangible assets—the kind of assets that in the worst case liquidation scenario a secured creditor would seize and sell—amount to only $414 million

(i.e.,  total assets less goodwill),  barely more than the $400 million in aggregate 1L and 2L debt. So Train and HomeMax have a problem.

### ENTER THE DISTRESSED INVESTORS

None of HomeMax's travails will have gone unnoticed by the distressed investor community. Exhibit 5 shows the projected value of HomeMax's various debt tranches over time. The methodology used to derive these estimates is roughly the same as investors would employ in trying to establish the value of the various debt tranches. First,  as discussed above,  the investor would estimate the enterprise value of HomeMax using recent and expected future operating performance and current market valuation metrics." Then this valuation would be compared against the capital structure,  in priority of recovery,  ° to estimate the recoveries that could be expected if the company were forced to file bankruptcy at that time."

The volatility of HomeMax's EBITDA and the related valuation may appear startling. However,  many enterprises can have drastic swings in operating performance,  and what has been modeled here,  while severe,  is not implausible." When investors confront such volatility-particularly the original lenders who were hoping for a reasonably certain return of capital as their primary investment scenario-they understandably become concerned about the viability of highly leveraged businesses. This is what creates the opportunity for the distressed investor. But it is obviously not a risk-free endeavor. For example,  in 2009 when HomeMax incurred almost $15 million in negative cash flow (Exhibit

1. and it was very unclear that the housing market had bottomed,  its viability would have certainly been in question.

The recovery implications of the volatility in enterprise value observed in Exhibit 5 are illustrated graphically in Exhibit 6 as a "waterfall" recovery analysis. The notion of the waterfall is a euphemism for the value that is available to fund the recovery of the money owed by HomeMax to its various classes of creditors. In 2010,  for example,  while there appeared to be sufficient value to "cover" 100% of the 1L debt,  it was enough to cover only 60% of the 2L debt,  and none of the Senior Notes. Thus one would have expected that the trading value of the 2L debt to have been in the 50s or lower (since a distressed investor who believes the recovery value is 60 will have to bid less in order to make a profit).

The Senior Notes would trade at even larger discounts-perhaps between 10 and 25% of par. Why would anyone be willing to pay 20 for notes that appear to have no recovery value? There are several reasons.

- First,  the investor would consider the probability of getting one or more years of the 10% coupon. If the investor thought it was reasonably likely he would receive one year of coupons,  then his effective net cost would be reduced to 10. If the investor thought HomeMax would pay the coupon for two years,  then he would recoup his investment and yet still have a claim that effectively represents substantial option value if HomeMax recovers.
- Second,  the distressed investor would consider what Train might be willing to do. As of 2009 or 2010,  Train was clearly out of the money based on the valuation. But if Train believes that HomeMax's operational challenge is due simply to a cyclical downturn in the economy,  then Train may be willing to inject additional equity to preserve their option value. After all,  the negative cash flow of $15 million in 2009 is only 6% of the $250 million Train has invested would they be willing to invest additional capital to extend their option?

In addition,  the distressed investor would recognize that Train inherently has better information about the situation,  regardless of the amount of research effort the distressed investor devotes to the investment. Do they see ways of cutting more costs rapidly? Are most of the stores cash flow positive with a few that have serious problems? If so,  would shutting down the weak performing stores solve the problem?

At the extreme,  the skeptical investor may wonder whether reported results represent the "best" Homemax can do,  or whether a number of subtle revenue deferral or expense acceleration techniques have been used to "sandbag" performance in an effort to scare investors.

Another possibility the distressed investor might contemplate is whether Train might decide to start buying the Senior Notes—which as we will see when we discuss a restructuring shortly,  could be another strategy for Train to continue its equity participation in HomeMax. If Train becomes a big buyer of the Senior Notes,  they may push up the price to say 30,  and the distressed investor who purchased at 20 might sell and walk away with a quick 50% profit (plus any coupon income). So depending on how savvy,  aggressive,  and/ or committed the distressed investor believes Train to be,  there are several potential scenarios that could benefit a deeply discounted investment in the unsecured notes.

### THE RESTRUCTURING DYNAMIC

After our little exercise in time travel back to 2009 to better understand the thought process of the distressed investor,  let's return to the beginning of 2012 and examine the challenge year. Practically speaking,  the logical course for the parties is to attempt to negotiate a voluntary restructuring with the existing creditors and,  if that proves unsuccessful,  to file for bankruptcy when the secured debt matures and non-payment causes a default.

To understand this,  we will first explain the economic/ negotiating position of each of the parties to the negotiation. Given the colorful and sometime vitriolic personalities of some distressed investors,  one might get the impression that restructurings are determined by who yells the loudest or makes the most outlandish threats. But as a practical matter,  the parties are sophisticated and rational,  and thus the resolution will generally turn on the legal and economic leverage of the various parties involved.

### THE OWNERS-HOMEMAX/TRAIN

Why would HomeMax/Train (we group these together because Train,  HomeMax's owner,  will effectively be making the decisions even though technically the HomeMax board of directors will be the explicit actor) see it as in their best interest to negotiate a voluntary restructuring? The economic answer is that voluntary restructurings are much less expensive than bankruptcy—in both direct and indirect costs. So at one level,  it's just a matter of economic efficiency. However,  Train will view itself,  even though it is underwater in the current market context,  as having option value in its equity stake. In particular,  given that HomeMax's operations seem to be improving,  Train could reasonably believe that if they could just hold on for a couple more years,  HomeMax's value could return to its 2007 level and Train would once again have a profitable investment.

So Train will be interested in a voluntary restructuring so long as it retains an amount of equity value that is comparable to,  or better than,  what it might receive in a bankruptcy. If the creditors are dogmatic and refuse to give Train any equity value,  then Train may view itself as better off in a bankruptcy where perhaps they can delay the process and hope that continued improvement in the general economy will lead to a higher market valuation at the end of the Chapter 11 reorganization process. Specifically,  if the bankruptcy filing isn't until the end of 2012,  and it takes at least a year to go through the process,  then Train will argue that HomeMax should be valued with reference to the outlook in 2014,  which could be materially better than today. If the creditors don't offer Train something,  it has little or nothing to lose by pursuing this strategy.

### THE CREDITORS

How will the various creditor constituencies look at the situa-tion? As a general matter,  they also recognize that a voluntary restructuring is less costly than bankruptcy,  so they will prefer that approach as long as it leaves them at least as well off as if there was a bankruptcy.

### SECURED CREDITORS

Looking back to Exhibit 5,  it seems fairly clear that Home-Max is worth well in excess of the $250 million owed to the 1L lenders. Consequently,  the 1L lenders are in a fairly safe position and will likely not play a very significant role in the restructuring negotiations. The 1L lenders will be confident that in a bankruptcy they will recover full value so they will not accept anything less than this in the voluntary restructuring. All the parties will likely see it this way,  so it will just be a "

'given" from the outset that any restructuring has to give the 1Ls full value. But this could mean either finding funds (a new third-party loan,  or new loans from the other creditors or Train) to have the 1L paid off,  or negotiating a loan extension that the 1L lenders,  in their discretion,  find attractive and would voluntarily accept.

![[image1 2.png|image1 2.png]]

What will be the perspective of the 2L creditors? Based on the assumed 2011 valuation of $558 million (Exhibit 5),    it is fairly clear that the 2L lenders would enjoy a full recovery in a bankruptcy and thus they too will approach the voluntary restructuring with the view that they should get at least a full recovery. However,    the 2L creditors are in a very interesting position because of the debt capacity issue discussed earlier. The impetus for the restructuring is the fact that the capital markets will not refinance all the secured debt. Assuming new lenders might provide $275 million in new secured loans (approximately 3.5x 2011 EBITDA of $79.75 million),    the $250 million of 1L debt could be refinanced,  but only $25 million of the 2L's $150 million outstanding amount could be refinanced. So the holders of the 2L,  which we will assume contain some new distressed investors that purchased notes at a discount,  will recognize that they must accept equity because that would be the likely outcome in a bankruptcy. Of course,  from the perspective of the distressed holders,  this was likely their strategy all along. Indeed,  they might be disappointed that HomeMax operations improved so quickly because if they purchased in 2009 they may have hoped to get all of HomeMax's equity.

The bottom line,  then,  is that the 21 holders will not accept less than $150 million in value (i.e.,  cash or new securi-ties) in the voluntary restructuring. But whether this will be all equity or some mix of cash,  debt and equity must be negotiated. It should also be noted that,  given the valuation,  the trading value of the 2L notes will likely be fairly close to par and that this market assessment will be a further negotiating lever supporting their demand for a par recovery.

### UNSECURED CREDITORS

Finally,  we consider the perspective of the Senior Note holders? First,  we should note that even though there are two issues,  one maturing in 2014 and one in 2015,  if we assume that their terms are the same,  they will essentially work together as a group because in a bankruptcy they would both be in the same class and the maturity difference would be irrelevant. As they consider the alternative of a bankruptcy,  they will perceive more potential volatility or risk than the holders of either the 1L or 2L. Per Exhibit 5,  the current valuation implies a recovery to them of 70%.

But if there is a bankruptcy and the out-of-pocket costs associated with the bankruptcy are $30 million,  then their recovery could fall to 57%." In addition to the out-of-pocket costs,  the business might be harmed by the bankruptcy because of negative press or the defection of key employees.

If this were to happen,  then the recovery could fall even more. Also,  in a bankruptcy the unsecured notes would not receive current interest payments whereas it is very likely that the 1L holders will continue to get paid interest,  which adds to the perceived cost of bankruptcy. On the other hand,  they will also look at HomeMax's improving operating trends and believe that to the extent bankruptcy actually gave the company/economy more time to heal and improve,  its valuation would improve. These notes will likely have largely traded to distressed investors. If these investors bought in the 20s,  then they are probably already sitting on attractive mark to market gains (if the implied recovery is 70,  then the notes would likely be trading somewhere in the 50s)0.\1 Also,  they will fully expect to receive their recovery in equity—it's just a question of how much of the equity they are able to negotiate for themselves.

### SUMMING UP THE NEGOTIATION

We can summarize the framework for the negotiation as follows: The unsecured note holders have the least amount of leverage but to the extent that the 2L holders want to avoid the cost and risk of a bankruptcy,  it will be in their interest to give the Senior Notes a meaningful recovery to obtain their cooperation. Similarly,  both the 21s and the Senior Notes will likely accept that they will have to give Train some amount of equity (which will include some equity to management to make sure they are properly incentivized) simply because the voluntary restructuring is much more likely to be successful if management/equity is supportive.

The exact dynamics of the negotiation are unpredictable and will be influenced by the personalities of the participants. The major points of discussion will be exactly how the company should be valued,  how much debt there should be,  how the equity should be split,  and so forth. And every additional quarter or even month that passes will be factored into the conversation so the parties may have differing senses of urgency.

### A POTENTIAL STUMBLING BLOCK—THE HOLDOUT PROBLEM

At this point it is important to raise one other important dynamic that inevitably develops and is among the most common reasons voluntary restructurings fail to occur even though they are economically more efficient: the holdout problem. We will expand upon the actual mechanics of how a voluntary restructuring is effected later,  but it is important at this point to note that voluntary restructurings basically involve the parties voluntarily exchanging the securities they hold for new securities or cash. One of the reasons why it is essential to have management or the equity holder's cooperation is that if the exchange is going to involve the issuance of additional stock by the company,  2 then both management and the equity holders' cooperation and consent are essen-tial. However,  to participate in the exchange is a voluntary decision for all holders and,  under American law,  " financing contracts do not allow a decision of a majority or even supra-majority of holders to change the major economic terms (i.e.,  coupon rate,  principle amount,  or maturity date) of a financing agreement. If an individual Note holder does not want to participate in the exchange,  then those Notes must be paid in accordance with their terms. The dilemma this raises and it is primarily a problem for the Notes in the HomeMax case—is that even if the majority of the Senior Note holders negotiate a deal that gives them a greater than expected 75% recovery,  a single holder can,  by not participating,  keep his notes and be fairly assured of receiving a 100% repayment in 2014 or 2015 when they mature because HomeMax should be significantly stronger financially.?° This dynamic creates the risk that not enough holders will participate to meaningfully reduce the company's debt burden and thereby frustrate the original purpose of the transaction.

There are a few techniques that are used to try and coerce the cooperation of the debt holders. While beyond the scope of this article to explore in detail,  the basic construct is for those holders that do participate to exchange into an instrument that is senior,  from a credit perspective,  to the security being exchanged. This confronts the holdout with the risk that if the company ultimately files for bankruptcy before the holdout's claim is paid,  they risk a reduced or even zero recovery due to the credit seniority of the participating holders.

As a practical matter,  the best scenario for success is to have a very high percentage of the security in question held by a small group of holders who are involved in the negotiation. If,  for example,  four distressed investors had collectively accumulated 95% of the Note and all had taken part in the restructuring negotiation and agreed to participate in the exchange,  then the chances of success are much greater.

## THE PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE HOMEMAX

What is proposed below is but one possible restructuring outcome. Other scenarios might have been negotiated depending on the predilections of the constituent parties; however,  the one presented here is plausible. Specifically,  the key features of the plan include the following:

HomeMax will enter into a new $275 million 1st lien (3.5x leverage) term loan and use the proceeds,    among other things,    to pay off the existing 1L loan. HomeMax will also issue 9,   900,   000 new shares of common stock,    which will effectively dilute the original 100,   000 outstanding shares held by Train. Subtracting the $275 million loan obligation from the 2011 estimate of enterprise value found in Exhibit 5 of $560 million (we round up from $558.25 million to simplify the numbers),  " the implied equity value for HomeMax is $285 million or $28.50 per fully diluted share.

The existing 2L Note will in aggregate receive $150 million in the form of the remaining $25 million of the new loan proceeds plus approximately $125 million in newly issued shares (which is 44% of the restructured firm's equity). Holders of the 2L notes will have the opportunity to exchange each existing note for $166.70 in cash and 29.37 shares of stock,  which represents an equity recovery of $837.005 ($28.50 per share x 29.37 shares) for an implied aggregate per bond recovery of $1,   003.71 ($166.70 in cash plus $837.005 in equity).

The Senior Notes will in aggregate receive 51.50% of the newly issued shares. Holders will have the opportunity to exchange each existing Note for 22.66 shares of stock for an implied per bond recovery of $646 (22.66 shares × $28.50).

Train will receive 2.00% of the newly issued shares. When combined with its existing 100,  000 shares,  it will hold 2.98% of HomeMax's fully diluted shares with an implied value of approximately $8.5 million.

Management will be granted 2.0% of the newly issues shares with an implied value of approximately $5.6 million.

The effect of the proposed voluntary restructuring is summarized in Exhibit 7. Reflecting on the negotiating dynamics described above,  we can sum up the deal as follows:

The 1Ls receive 100% of their claim out of the proceeds from the new 1st Lien financing.

The 2Ls receive a full recovery (albeit in both cash and equity).

Train and management were able to extract about $14.1 million of value,    as compared to a potential $0 recovery in a bankruptcy. This sum is about 50% of what a bankruptcy would have cost had they not cooperated.

The Senior Notes are theoretically better off in the restructuring since the estate would have lost an assumed $30 million in value due to bankruptcy costs.

Now let's consider the deal from Train's perspective.

They may have calculated that they could have gotten more by forcing a bankruptcy and extending their option to take advantage of a potential economic turnaround. However,  for this to work out,  the enterprise value of HomeMax would have had to increase to $669.1 million,  or an additional 20%.

The basic analysis behind this conclusion is that for the value of the equity of Train and Management to equal the $14.1 million in the settlement,    the enterprise value of HomeMax must be $669.1 million:

Equity Value - Enterprise Value(EV) - Total Value Face Debt - Bankrupty Costs

$14.1 million - Enterprise Value(EV) - $625 million - $30 million

Enterprise Value (EV) = $14.1 million + $625 million + $30 million = $669.1 million

Given all the risks associated with a bankruptcy and achieving that goal,  they may have felt that $14.1 million,  plus the optionality in the stock,  was a decent deal.

The Notes are the group that in this scenario conceded value relative to their initial implied recovery of 70 to get the deal done. Their implied recovery was 64.6,  primarily because the entire "tip"" needed to get Train's cooperation came from them. It is worth mentioning that we basically posited that this group may have been able to purchase their stake in the Senior Notes in 2009 when the trading levels may have been in the 15-25 (% of face value) range. So they had already made substantial returns on their investment. Thus,  to concede a few points to minimize the risks attendant to a bankruptcy seems like a good decision. * Furthermore,  the Notes will in aggregate own 51% of fully diluted shares so they may ascribe a "control premium" to their position that isn't reflected in the mathematical derivation of share value.

## THE MECHANICS OF THE VOLUNTARY EXCHANGE OFFER

We have discussed conceptually how HomeMax gets from the recognition of their refinancing related liquidity problem to its resolution via a voluntary exchange offer that transfers control of the company to distressed investors. Next we discuss what concrete activities would happen for this to be accomplished. No two situations are identical,  but the first step that needs to occur is for the various parties to begin a dialogue. Sometimes this will result from management and/ or the equity sponsor becoming proactive and requesting a meeting with its significant creditors. However,  the equity sponsor may think this signals weakness and wait for the other side to make the initial approach.

If management decides to be proactive,  they will typically engage special bankruptcy/workout counsel and retain a specialized financial advisor to help them assess their options.

When they have a plan formulated,  the financial advisor will then use its market intelligence resources to identify who are the major holders of the various debt tranches. For the 1L bank debt,  this will usually be the agent bank. For the 2L and the Senior Notes,  this will require approaching various distressed investors who the financial advisor believes have been accumulating positions. While a bit of a dramatization,  the initial conversation with the distressed investor might go as follows:

Financial Advisor: Hi,  we understand you own a lot of HomeMax Senior Notes. As you are probably aware,  the Company may face some liquidity problems in the near future and would like to invite you to join an ad hoc committee to discuss solutions that might be mutually beneficial to all parties.

Distressed Investor: I don't see any problem. I expect them to pay me the money I'm owed or I will own the company.

Financial Advisor: That's probably not a very realistic scenario. Would you like to discuss ways of avoiding the $0 recovery you prospectively face if the company is forced to liquidate.

After some additional witty repartee,  the distressed investor will probably view it as advisable to engage in the process.

When investors owning a majority or significant percentage of the classes have been identified (and these may be distressed investors as well as original investors that never sold at the lows),  they will have a conversation among themselves to see if they can agree on how to proceed. As a practical matter,  the community of distressed investors is fairly small and they will likely know each other from prior deals. The first agenda item will be deciding which lawyer to hire to represent them ar company expense. Next they will likely also select a financial advisor to represent them,  again at company expense. Since the economic interests of the 2L Notes and the Senior Notes are in significant conflict,  they will likely each insist on their own professionals for advice.

With the various advisors in place,  a series of meetings commences with the objective of negotiating the voluntary resolution. Typically the professionals carry out the majority of these negotiations after formulating strategy with the investors they represent,  but sometimes investors will get involved at critical junctures-particularly when negotiations have stalled and some direct "horse trading" must occur to advance the process. There will often be veiled threats made that we have not discussed. The Senior Notes might find reasons to argue that the 2L security-related documentation is defective and that they are materially under secured. Or,  the Senior Notes might threaten to sue Train for mismanagement or because it took out dividends which,  they will allege,  made the company insolvent. Train might counter that if the Senior Notes really want to pursue their litigation,  HomeMax will almost certainly end up in a nasty Chapter 7 liquidation where the Senior Notes will receive nothing.

Such is the day-to-day life of a distressed investor. In the end,  rational minds usually prevail and the framework for an agreement is developed and the practical issue becomes "can it be effected or will there be too many holdouts."

Mechanically the process usually starts with one of the lawyers drafting a term sheet that then gets refined and agreed to by all the parties. Then various contracts and/or securities law related documents will need to be drafted.

Since HomeMax will need to issue a massive number of new shares,  it will need to obtain board of director and shareholder approval—but these are basically technicalities given that Train is in control. In the final steps,  a formal and legally binding offer of exchange will be delivered to the holders of the 2L Notes and Senior Notes. Because of the ever present holdout problem,  these exchange offer documents will always condition effectiveness on a very high participation rate. In other words,  they will typically contain a clause that says unless at least 95% of the outstanding securities participate in the proposed exchange,  none of the securities tendered for exchange will be accepted and the exchange will not occur.

If all of the terms of the exchange offer are satisfied,  then the documents will set forth in detail the exchange mechan-ics. This basically entails the holder delivering the note to the company whereupon the company will cancel the note and give the holder the new securities that the exchange offer documents specify (for example,  each note would be cancelled and receive 22.66 shares of HomeMax common stock in exchange). As a practical matter,  this is now just a matter of electronic postings credited to an account.

## WHAT IF A VOLUNTARY RESTRUCTURING CANNOT BE COMPLETED?

As can be deduced from the discussion above,  there can be many reasons why a voluntary restructuring,  even though often economically sensible,  cannot be completed. The primary problem is usually the holdout problem. However,  sometimes it is simply not possible to negotiate an agreement among the parties. In the HomeMax case,  it would be easy to disagree about the valuation. The 2Ls might strongly believe that HomeMax is only worth $450 million and demand a much larger percentage of the fully diluted shares to make them whole. If the holders of the Senior Notes believe they would do better in a bankruptcy,  after all risks and expenses are factored in,  then the two parties might never reach an agreement.

If no agreement can be reached or the exchange fails because of holdouts,  then the company will likely be forced to file for reorganization under Chapter 11. While beyond the scope of this article to discuss in detail the intricacies of Chapter 11 reorganizations,  essentially Chapter 11 reorganization is a court-supervised restructuring process that has,  as one of its important powers,  the ability to force the partici pation of holdouts. Basically if the statutorily prescribed majority approves the proposed treatment of creditors in a Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization ("Plan"),  then the terms of the Plan are imposed on everyone in the class. So the holdouts are forced to participate.

Speaking in very broad terms,  the process of a larger Chapter 11 is similar to the voluntary restructuring process. Typically it will be in everyone's interest to plan a Chapter 11 process that is as inexpensive as possible. Such pre-negotiated Chapter 11 bankruptcies are often referred to as "pre-arranged" or “pre-packaged" bankruptcies. Expenses incurred in Chapter 11 are usually a function of legal fees,  which are directly tied to failure to reach agreements about fundamental issues in advance. Accordingly,  it is usually in the best interest of most parties to try and reach a broad agreement on major issues in advance of the technical filing of a Chapter 11 petition. To that end,  the company will go through the same process of selecting lawyers and financial advisors and try to have a dialogue with its creditors to develop some general agreement on a Plan in advance.

Once a Chapter 11 petition has been filed,  an unsecured creditor committee will be formed. The company will be given the first opportunity to present a Plan. To do that it will negotiate with the Official Unsecured Creditor committee and other creditor constituencies (i.e.,  in the HomeMax case,  the 1L and 21 holders) to see if a restructuring that everyone will support can be developed. At some point,  whether every creditor agrees or not,  the company will typically formally propose a Plan that in substance could be similar to the proposed voluntary restructuring terms provided for above,  with the exception that Train would likely not receive any equity unless HomeMax's valuation improves. This process involves obtaining the Bankruptcy Court's approval to solicit creditor votes in support of the Plan. If the Court approves that step of the process,  then (similar to the formal exchange offer) a document called a Plan Disclosure Statement and the Proposed Plan of Reorganization will be sent to all the affected creditors,  who will have the choice of voting to accept the treatment the Plan proposes for their claim. For example,  the HomeMax Plan could propose to cancel the Notes and convert them in to 22.66 shares of new stock— just like the Exchange Offer. If the requisite majorities of the various classes of creditors entitled to vote approve the Plan,  then it will usually be easy to convince the court to subsequently confirm or approve the Plan.

Sometimes individual classes of creditors will approve the Plan while other classes will not. In this case,  the Plan proposes nent (usually the company) can ask the Court to confirm the Plan over the objection of a dissenting class. This can lead to contentious (i.e.,  expensive) litigation before the Court to try and resolve the matter. If no creditor classes approve the Plan,  then confirmation cannot even be requested and the process starts over,  but the Court may allow the creditors (as opposed to the company,  which is given the initial opportunity) to propose a Plan. In the worst case scenario where a Plan which the Court can confirm is never developed,  the case may be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation —which usually results in lower recoveries for all creditors and thus is a powerful incentive for them to make concessions that would make a confirmable Plan possible.

Because the Chapter 11 process and outcome can sometimes be very similar to a voluntary reorganization,  one of the common techniques used to coerce holdouts into participating in the voluntary reorganization is basically to combine the exchange offer with what is called a pre-planned Chapter 11 filing. 37 In this approach,  the exchange offer document will effectively say that,  if the conditions for the exchange offer aren't satisfied,  then the company will immediately file a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 and propose a Plan that essentially has the same terms as the proposed voluntary exchange offer. As applied to HomeMax,  this strategy would try to force participation by all of the holders of the Notes by effectively saying the exchange is inevitable; the only difference is that it you don't cooperate and force a Chapter 11,  the stock you receive will be worth less because of the higher bankruptcy expenses.

However,  it should be noted that there can be many issues that will make a voluntary restructuring ineffective. In fact,  a better way of thinking about the issue is to note that a voluntary restructuring is likely only appropriate where the primary problem facing the company is its capital structure. If the basic issues are something more fundamental to the company's operations,  then Chapter 11 may be the only path that can solve its problems. For example,  what if HomeMax had a large percentage of its stores generating negative cash flow due to contract rental rates that were too high (i.e.,  current market rates for its competitors were much lower). Although we won't digress to discuss them,  Chapter 11 offers tools for dealing with this type of problem. Alternatively,  HomeMax could have an uncompetitive collective bargaining agreement. Again,  Chapter 11 is often the only way to deal with this type of issue.

## HOW PROFITABLE IS DISTRESSED INVESTING?

How does one analyze the potential investment return to the distressed investor in the HomeMax example? The first issue is determining a comparable basis of analysis.

Let's consider an investor in the Notes. That investor exchanged the Note for 22.66 shares of stock at the end of 2011 and,  at the time of exchange,  the shares were valued at $28.32 (see Exhibit 8). But what was the "cost" of those shares to the investor? That depends on when the Notes were purchased and the trading levels at that time. For example,    assume that the investor bought the Notes at the end of 2010 for a price of 50.38 In that case,    the effective cost of the equity actually received in the restructuring would then be $22.07/ share ($500/22.66)." Thus,    after the exchange offer,    the investor had more than a 28% ($6.25/22.07) improvement in the value of the investment in simple terms. Moreover,  the owner of the Note also received two interest payments of $50,  which increases the holding period return to 51%. But the distressed investor will always be looking forward and attempting to estimate future performance and the implications for the return on investment.

Assume that Exhibit 8 shows the investor's projected performance for HomeMax for 2012 and 2013. If these projections are even close to being realized then the distressed investor should realize very attractive investment returns. But this assessment is based on the estimated enterprise value (and corresponding equity value) of the restructured firm,  not on realized values.

If HomeMax were a publicly traded firm,  it would be apparent from trading prices how the marketplace values the restructured firm. Since HomeMax is a private firm,  the distressed investor will not have independent market validation,  but he would likely know within a year whether he had made a good investment (because of the firm's operations).

He would then have to confront the complicated problem of how to exit or monetize the investment. In market environments where there is strong investor demand for initial public stock offerings (IPOs),  this approach might be used —in effect selling the company to the public market. Alternatively,  the new equity holders could try to sell HomeMax to a strategic or,  more commonly,  a financial buyer. However,  the interest and ability of such investors can be cyclical,  which is a further risk element the distressed investor must consider.

To examine the possible returns to the distressed investor,  consider the range of potential levels of EBITDA for 2012 in combination with different EBITDA valuation multiples shown in Exhibit 9. For example,  if HomeMax generates approximately the same EBITDA in 2012 that it earned in 2011 ($79.75 million) and the valuation multiple is the same (7.00x),    the enterprise value of the firm will be $558.3 million (Panel A),  and the per share value of the firm's equity will be $28.33 per share (Panel B).

Distressed investors typically use two metrics to measure the return on investment. The first is the so-called "cash on cash" return. For example,  assume the investor paid X for the investment and in aggregate (including interest and fees) recovered Y. In that case,  Y/X measures the ratio of value received to invested capital. In Panel C,  the estimated cash on cash return is calculated assuming a purchase at the end of 2010,  the receipt of interest during 2011,  40 and a monetization at year-end 2012 at a range of valuations. For example,  if we assume that EBITDA is equal to $79.75 and the valuation multiple of EBITDA is 7.0X,    then the estimated value of HomeMax's shares of stock is $28.33 and the cash on cash return would be 1.48x.

The second return metric is the investment's internal rate of return or IRR. In Panel D we compute the expected internal rates of return (IRR) over the same time period assuming the same range of exiting valuations and interim cash flows. For example,  in the investor's "base" case,  where

2012 EBITDA is expected to improve to $109.52 million,    and assuming no change in valuation multiple,    the value per share is expected to increase to $49.16 per share for a cash on cash return of 2.43x and an IRR of 61.0%. But as can also be seen in Panel D,  the distressed investor faces significant downside risk should the economy falter or if management in unable to improve the integration of HomeLux into the company. In the most extreme case considered earlier in Exhibit 7,  in which EBITDA drops back to $60 million and the multiple falls to 6.0x,  the distressed investor is assumed to have an IRR of -28.0%!

Clearly,  the potential rewards of distress investing are great but so are the possibilities of loss. In sum,  the ultimate success or failure of the restructuring depends on the firm's ability to generate cash flow (EBITDA) as well as on general market conditions that determine valuation multiples.

## WHY DISTRESSED DEBT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES EXIST?

Money gets made in distress investing,  like value investing,  by looking for opportunities to purchase the securities of undervalued firms. But why do these opportunities exist? In the discussion that follows,  we explore some of the factors that make this type of investing difficult. After all,  if everyone could do it,  the opportunities to engage in distress investing would disappear very rapidly. Specifically,  here are some specific reasons why we might expect the securities of financially distressed firms to trade at prices lower than their intrinsic value:

Information Asymmetries—Information about distressed company securities is sometimes hard to come by. For example,  many material events-such as a Judge's comments or rulings made on an issue in Bankruptcy Court—will not receive broad news coverage,  particularly in smaller cases. Thus,  unless the investor is attending the hearing (which is certainly not costless),  or watching the bankruptcy docket closely,  the event may only be known by a small fraction of investors.

Market frictions-The market for distressed securities is very illiquid and there will be a significant "bid/ask" spread when purchasing a distressed instrument. For example,  the bid might be 40 and the offer 42. Usually with some negotiation a more mid-point price is found. But the clear implication of such a "spread" implies is that if the investor really wanted to buy the security today (perhaps in anticipation of a favorable development) they would have to "lift the offering" and pay 42 to be certain of making the purchase.

But now let's assume that whatever they hoped would happen did not happen,  or did not have the impact they had expected and they want to sell. If we assume no price movement or change in spread,  the investor would have to "hit the bid" and sell at 40. So in a stable market the "in and out" trade would "cost" 2 points,  or 4.7% of invested capital. That represents a very high transaction cost and thus only investors with very high conviction and a longer expected holding period tend to participate.

c. Behavioral Distortions and "Irrational" Transaction Motivations In large markets,  like the U.S. Treasury market or a large-cap equity market,  there are literally thousands of active participants and theoretically almost any investor could participate. However,  in the market for distress securities,  the relevant universe of possible investors is much,  much smaller,  and many potentially well-informed participants (e.g.,  a high yield bond fund) may not be able to participate because the terms of their investment management agreements will frequently preclude them from purchasing "CCC"-,  "D'-,  or "NR"- rated securities. Further,  many institutions' investment guidelines require them to sell securities if their ratings drop below a certain level (typically B3/B-).* Such "irrational" or non-economic behavior can lead to price distortions in the market.

d. Intestinal fortitude. Investing in distressed companies can be likened to running into burning buildings.

Howard Marks,  Chairman of Oaktree Capital Management,  suggested that opportunities to invest in distressed debt often follow a "period of lax lending practices by creditors followed by a period of fundamental and psychological weakness.

This is because,  in his view,  in true "bull" markets the consensus investor outlook is that the positive cycle will go on indefinitely and thus credit protections are less important since the value of assets will always increase. But the opposite occurs in bear markets,  where the consensus outlook is so negative that prices decline to the point where there is very little downside risk. Thus,  the opportunity to profit from investing in distressed firms is often tantamount to following a contrarian strategy.

Specialized skills and knowledge are required —The distressed investment community is quite small compared to the general fixed income and equity markets. Although the distressed investing field has grown,  there are far fewer experienced investors and much less capital committed to the area than the more general fixed income or equity markets.

Risk and uncertainty-distress investing involves much more than good financial intelligence. Identifying good prospects is just the first step in what can become a lengthy process involving negotiations among multiple security holder groups that may not produce a restructuring plan that all security holders can agree to,  in which case the costs and uncertainties of the legal system are added through a potential bankruptcy process. Distressed firms can languish in the netherworld between healthy operations and bankruptcy for an extended period of time. For example,  although HomeMax's financial future may have been doubt-ful,  the firm's management could retain control over the assets as long as they simply continued to pay debt service and remain in compliance with debt covenants. Moreover,  with distressed investing there is a very real prospect of investments where a zero recovery is possible. Given these various risks and uncertainties,  the values assigned to the firm's securities can deviate from their intrinsic worth for an extended period of time.

If the successful restructuring of the firm is highly uncer-tain,  then the distressed investor would require appropriate risk-adjusted returns for assuming the risks associated with undertaking the restructuring. In other words,  if the firm's securities were trading at their expected recovery value after a restructuring,  the investor would have no incentive to undertake the risk inherent in the restructuring. Some discount to estimated intrinsic value,  sometimes referred to as the "margin of safety,  "43 would thus be necessary to entice the distressed investor to undertake investment. How big the discount would have to be would depend upon the perceived risk of failure and the worst-case recovery expected in that scenario.

As pointed out above,  because HomeMax has a relatively small proportion of tangible assets on its balance sheet,  in the event of a liquidation the recovery to even the secured creditors may be nominal. The distinction we are making here is between investing in the equity of a once distressed firm that has completed a restructuring and investing in a currently distressed firm facing a risky restructuring; since any rational investor would prefer the certainty of the former,  a discount is required to attract participation in the latter.

## CONCLUSION

What happens to good businesses that take on too much debt financing? The answer is that they have a propensity to default,  which leads to their being restructured and beginning operations anew. Although often reviled,  distress or vulture investors are the instruments of change that carry out such restructurings in the hope of reaping substantial rewards for themselves (and their investors in the case of distressed funds). Their actions result in the restructuring of troubled companies whose capital structures include more debt than its cash flows can service (i.e.,  the firm is overleveraged). Once restructured,  the company can continue operating as a viable business,  thereby avoiding the need to liquidate the firm's assets and lay off its employees. In this article,  we review the process by which corporate restructuring takes place. The distressed investor acquires a portion of the debt in the distressed firm that will be transformed into the equity of the firm should it go into default. He then seeks to recapitalize the firm with a capital structure that is better suited to the distressed firm's existing or expected cash flows. The negative connotations of distressed investing can be traced to the "re-shuffling

" of investor claims that is involved in creating the new capital structure and any adverse effects that the restructuring might have on the interests of the out-of-the-money prior investors or the operations of the firm. In the latter case,  the restructuring may involve cost cutting that leads to employee layoffs and/or reduced benefits to the firm's remaining employees.

To be sure,  there are other ways that investors can engage in a form of distressed investing that do not involve attempting to gain control of the firm. For example,  in the HomeMax example we used for illustration,  holders of either the 2L Notes or the Senior Notes could have just sold their holdings when prices appreciated in 2011. They did not have to stick around and exchange their claims for common stock and become part of the equity of the firm.
