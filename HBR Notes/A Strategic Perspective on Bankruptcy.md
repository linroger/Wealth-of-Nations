# A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy

For the managers of a company with obligations to claimholders that exceed its ability to fulfill them, the choice between out-of-court reorganization and a court-supervised reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code involves complex economic, legal, and ethical considerations.

Over the five-year span that began in 2007, 619 public companies in the U.S. representing more than $2.0 trillion in combined assets entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings (see **Exhibit 1**).1 While fifteen years earlier managers had reluctance to damage their reputations by taking a company into bankruptcy,2 it is now a more frequent path for companies in financial distress. Nevertheless, reorganizing the obligations and operations of a distressed company remains a time-consuming, complex process with uncertain timelines, numerous hazards, and unknown outcomes.

## The Challenges of Reorganizing under the Bankruptcy Code

The proximate cause of bankruptcy, and the most reliable warning flag to stakeholders, is a company’s inability to pay debts because of a disruption in cash flow. This scenario is usually preceded by visible signals that may include changes in financing conditions or the competitive landscape, problems in product development processes, disruptions to sales and customer relationships, or a sudden flood of tort litigation.

**Entry** The decision of whether to file for relief with a bankruptcy court lies with management

(i.e., “voluntary bankruptcy”) or a company’s creditors (i.e., “involuntary bankruptcy”). The Bankruptcy Code is federal law, and U.S. bankruptcy courts are specialized divisions of U.S. district courts. The primary way a creditor initiates an involuntary bankruptcy is after a company has failed to pay debts when they become due. Yet when courts seek to apply this standard, they do not use balance sheet or equity definitions of solvency; instead they consider the totality of the circumstances.3 Involuntary bankruptcies are rare.

Companies can find that the threat of a voluntary bankruptcy filing—a “take-it-or-get-nothing” threat for suppliers, employees, or creditors—is an effective bargaining tool when negotiating with claimants. A large and specialized industry of legal and financial professionals can advise management on the advance negotiation of a reorganization plan. Such “pre-packaged” filings can reduce time under court supervision from twelve months to three.

**Procedure** When reorganizing under court supervision, public companies are subject to the procedures established by the Bankruptcy Code. These procedures were designed to organize and encourage consensual bargaining among the several classes of claimants on the company’s cash flows (see **Exhibit 2** for a process outline). In court, the company gains time in which to make decisions, take action, and propose a resolution. Debt service and legal proceedings are subject to an automatic 120-day stay, which may be extended. Tort litigation can be halted, consolidated, and moved from regular courts into bankruptcy courts, which some view as more sympathetic to management.4

If management elects to reorganize out of court, it enjoys more freedom of action because the operational calendar remains under management control. However, there is also less certainty with regard to the actions and priorities of creditors, employees, and shareowners. This uncertainty makes it difficult for management to establish a future date when the crisis will be resolved, and also increases uncertainty for claimholders and customers alike while increasing the likelihood of defection.

During a court-supervised restructuring, extraordinary demands are placed on management. Devoting the proper attention to continuing operations is a challenge even during out-of-court proceedings. Under court supervision, the automatic stay and the requirement to negotiate and approve a restructuring plan within a specified time period fix the calendar for management. Moreover, under court-supervised reorganization, disclosures and reorganization plans are public record. Potentially sensitive information may be exposed to competitors.

**Cost** Out-of-court restructuring is generally less expensive in terms of professional fees than incourt restructuring. While specialized consulting and advisory firms exist to advise distressed companies, management retains discretion over engaging outside services. During court-supervised proceedings, discretion is reduced, and fees in major public bankruptcies can run into tens of millions of dollars.

The costs of retaining professional advice and special cash compensation programs1 for management during court-supervised restructuring may be offset by the potential financial benefits to the company of eliminating interest payments and halting debt and supplier payments. Operating costs during distress are increased as credit becomes scarcer and terms of payments are tightened up; suppliers frequently require cash payments for parts or inventory shipments during both in-court and out-of-court restructurings.

**Coordinating claims** A company that is deemed at risk of bankruptcy faces an acute challenge when coordinating several constituencies’ claims on the company’s assets without the supervision of the court. The challenge is increased when a company has multiple creditors because the company must reach consensus with its creditors, and the incentive for any single creditor to hold out is high.

In court, claims are subject to a strict precedence and resolution framework. The Bankruptcy Code defines the hierarchy of claims in court-supervised bankruptcy proceedings (see **Exhibit 3**). A majority of creditors and two-thirds of the value of claims in each class must approve a proposed reorganization. If a majority in a class cannot agree, the court can force claimants to accept a reorganization plan.

The court often requires a liquidation value to be submitted that reflects the current market value of the assets if they were sold. Book value is often discounted to reflect disposal of the assets in a short time frame, often at auction. When compared to the hierarchy of claims, each creditor class can evaluate their potential recovery under this alternative which can be used as a basis for negotiations.

While the intent of the code is to encourage consensual bargaining, the opportunity remains for bad-faith negotiation. Parties must weigh their strategic options as they decide whether to push for acceptance of a plan or hold out for more favorable treatment. “In a bankruptcy, the level of cooperation you get in negotiations is at the level of the least reasonable person involved,” observes Jeff Werbalowsky, managing director of Houlinah, Lokey, Howard & Zukin.5 Observers also cite a wide variance among the courts; some judges and courts are viewed as more sympathetic to management interests, while others are thought to favor creditors. Courts that favor management are more likely to grant extensions to the 120-day stay to allow management more time to craft a successful reorganization plan.

**Market for corporate control** All companies in distress encounter a volatile market for corporate control. The uncertainty of negotiating reorganization proposals is further complicated by the uncertainty of market movements in the ownership of various claims. While the stay under Chapter 11 halts payments and legal proceedings, the market for a company’s debt and equity continues. This volatility is greater under court supervision, where the strategic value for so-called “vulture investors” of holding various quantities of a company’s different obligations is subject to information asymmetries and coordination problems of their own. Not infrequently, claimholders acquire claims within other classes in order to gain influence in restructuring negotiations.

**Continuing operations** The survival of a distressed company depends on its ability to restore operating cash flows to a sustainable level. Under court supervision, companies commonly find easier access to credit because any new obligations are often given priority over all other debt obligations. This cash infusion can be vital to the company’s ability to continue to operate its business.

Continuing operations under court supervision face unique challenges. First, management actions are subject to court scrutiny. Under Chapter 11, management may be permitted to retain control of the company under the theory that management knows more about the business and is therefore more likely to turn it around successfully. In the case of alleged fraud or management misconduct, however, the court will appoint a trustee to oversee operations. Yet even in cases without a trustee, management must seek court approval for any major decision, including the securing of new credit, employing professionals to work on the bankruptcy, and disposing of assets outside the normal course of business. While bankruptcy courts often will allow companies to reject executory contracts,2 other obligations are hard to break. For example, management must persuade the court that there is no alternative plan under which the company could successfully emerge from bankruptcy before underfunded pension obligations can be transferred to the federal Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. Likewise, before rejecting a collective bargaining agreement, the debtor usually has to demonstrate to the court a good-faith effort to renegotiate the contract privately.6

Second, commitment of employees, partners, and customers suffers under court supervision. This has been observed in cases of companies that depend on highly skilled employees, strategic business partnerships, or long-term customer relationships. While it may be appealing to relinquish burdensome obligations and generate immediate cash savings, the effect of the consequent loss of goodwill should be carefully considered in light of the future value of the affected relationships. Transaction-based businesses—notably airlines and retail—have established histories of frequent recourse to court-supervised reorganizing, while relationship businesses—for example, financial services, business technology, and durable goods—are notably absent. Restructuring in this class may be more likely to be conducted out of court or through the sale of all or part of the business.

**Social cost** When management attempts to shed its obligations to improve a company’s position, the burden of the foregone claim falls elsewhere. Investors, creditors, suppliers, employees, and retirees have varying abilities to absorb the costs of a failed claim; few stand any chance of being made whole under court-supervised bankruptcy. The various players have different avenues available to absorb their losses, but even government guarantee programs are at risk. Recourse to the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the spin-off of unfunded pension obligations has strained the resources of the tax-funded body and may increase political pressure to rewrite statutes.

The exercise of the most drastic restructuring tools has consequences for firms and for the social compact on which the conduct of business rests. Firms and institutions alike face the long-term loss of goodwill with the public and regulators. This arises in part because of the frequency with which court-supervised restructurings have been perceived as tactics used to circumvent obligations to customers (e.g., product liability), employees (e.g., contracts, pensions, health care) and the public (e.g., environmental cleanups). While the stigma of a court-supervised restructuring may be less severe today among executives and boards of directors, the stain persists among other stakeholders in a firm.

## Two Different Paths

While in-court and out-of-court reorganizations face the same sources of uncertainty, the differences in their treatment yield sharply contrasting paths and outcomes:

- In out-of-court restructurings, and under volatility caused by investors’ uncertainty, the challenge of coordinating creditors is far higher than under court supervision. However, the goodwill of customers and employees is less threatened, the company controls its calendar, critical company information, and management attention, and the company has the potential to restore value for the holders of its equity.
- In court-supervised restructurings, on the other hand, the company gains the ability to selectively extract assets in a 363 sale, unilaterally alter leases and employee contracts and suspend payments to creditors. However, the ultimate outcome is highly unpredictable and may negatively impact the company’s competitive position due to the vagaries of the particular court, the maneuvers of vulture investors, the mandatory disclosures of further financial and operating information, and the loss of goodwill from customers, employees, and the public.

**Exhibit 2** Outline of Events in a Business Bankruptcy

- A company comes into a situation of present or perceived future financial distress. Usually, the company incurs excessive losses, or expects future losses, from causes including poor sales, mismanagement, excessive debt, lawsuits and product liability, fraud, labor costs and labor disturbances, etc.
- The company defaults on its debt or otherwise appears to be incapable of continuing to meet its obligations.
- Restructuring negotiations are held with creditors and other interested parties (e.g., employees, stockholders, etc.).
- When it is determined that bankruptcy is unavoidable, the company files a bankruptcy petition under Chapter 11 (bankruptcy with intent to reorganize and continue operation). Creditors may file an involuntary petition to force the company into Chapter 11. Alternatively, if there is no hope for reorganization, the company, or its creditors, files a petition for Chapter 7 (bankruptcy with intent to liquidate the company). In either case, an automatic stay takes effect to prevent creditors from seizing property or prosecuting actions against the company.
- The business continues to operate under the control of the existing company management (the company is called debtor-in-possession). However, the bankruptcy court may appoint a trustee to run the company if conditions warrant. A trustee is usually appointed in Chapter 7, and usually not in Chapter 11.
- Interested parties, including creditors, stockholders, employees, retires, etc., form committees to negotiate their claims against the company.
- A plan (or plans) of reorganization is submitted by the company or other interested parties (e.g., creditor’s committees). For the first 120 days of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company has the exclusive right to submit a plan of reorganization. Thereafter, any interested party may submit a plan, unless the bankruptcy court grants an extension of the exclusivity period.
- A disclosure statement is produced that contains information on the company and its plan of reorganization. The disclosure statement must be approved by the court.
- After the disclosure statement is approved by the court, the disclosure statement and associated plan of reorganization are submitted to a vote by all impaired creditors and stockholders. (If the plan is rejected, new plans are submitted or the bankruptcy is converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7.) Generally, each class of creditor must approve the plan by a majority in number and two-thirds in value of that class. If a plan is not accepted by all parties, the sponsor of that plan can request that the bankruptcy court issue a cram-down. In a cram-down, the court confirms the plan or reorganization over the objections of one or more classes.
- The plan of reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court.
- The company emerges from Chapter 11 when the conditions of the plan of reorganization have been satisfied. Alternatively, if no plan or reorganization can be agreed upon, the bankruptcy can be converted from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7. In Chapter 7, a trustee is appointed and the company assets are sold, usually by auction. Proceeds from the sale compensate the parties involved and the company ceases to exist.

## **A Glossary of Technical Terms Related to Bankruptcy in the U.S.**

This note briefly describes the most important legal forms of U.S. bankruptcy: Chapter 7 and Chapter 11, and provides definitions of technical terms related to the bankruptcy process.

# Legal Forms of Bankruptcy—an Overview

The U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 8) authorized Congress to enact “uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” The rules of bankruptcy are set by Congress through the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U. S. Code). The Code was last updated by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.

The parts of the Code most relevant to corporations are Chapter 7 (liquidation) and Chapter 11 (reorganization).

**Chapter 7** of the Bankruptcy Code governs the process of the liquidation of the debtor.  In a liquidation, the company ceases to operate its business. Its assets are sold and the proceeds distributed to its creditors.

**Chapter 11** governs the reorganization of a company that continues to do business while in bankruptcy. Normally in Chapter 11, the company files a petition for protection from its creditors and the case is assigned to a bankruptcy judge, who supervises the process. The current management and board of directors remain in charge, and they have the sole right to propose a plan of reorganization during first 120-days after the filing. (This exclusivity period can be extended at the discretion of the judge.)

The company stops paying interest and principal on its debts1 and its assets are subject to a so called automatic stay. The bankrupt company can also raise new financing that takes priority over its existing debts. Claims against the company are sorted into classes and a committee formed to represent each class. Classes are asked to vote on the plan of reorganization if their claims are “impaired” but not wiped out.  By law, a plan of reorganization must be accepted by at least one impaired class. If some classes agree but others dissent, the judge can “cram down” the plan, imposing it on the dissenters. In practice, however, cramdowns take place only after a long, slow process of debate and negotiation. Once the judge approves the plan of reorganization, he or she has the power to discharge the company’s former debts. The company then emerges from Chapter 11 as a going concern with a more sustainable capital structure.

# Technical Terms related to Bankruptcy

- **363 sale** – allows specific assets to be sold as a way to recover value leaving other assets in the estate for liquidation or reorganization.
- **Absolute priority** – This basic principle of U.S. bankruptcy law stipulates that a junior claim shouldn’t receive a dollar of value until all prior claims are paid in full. The so-called “payment waterfall” is as follows: secured creditors, unsecured creditors, preferred stockholders, and common stockholders. A judge cannot approve a plan of reorganization that violates absolute priority.
- **Automatic stay** – an automatic injunction (i.e., court order) that halts actions by creditors. With certain exceptions, creditors cannot collect interest or seize assets from a debtor who has filed for bankruptcy. However, some collateral pledged to derivatives contracts is exempt from the automatic stay, and is forfeited to counterparties.
- **Claim** – a right to payment from the debtor. Claims include bonds and other debt securities, accounts payable to suppliers, unpaid wages to employees, and payments under contracts (such as union contracts, pension plans, and leases) that obligate the debtor to make a series of payments over time.
- **Cramdown** – a feature of the bankruptcy process that allows a plan of reorganization to be confirmed by the bankruptcy court despite being rejected by some classes of impaired creditors. Plan confirmation requires the approval of at least one impaired class. Other impaired classes may vote against the plan and still be forced to accept it.
- **Creditor** – the owner of a claim. A credit committee is appointed to represent this class of claims.
- **Debtor** – the entity (a person or corporation) that has filed for bankruptcy.
- **Debtor-in-possession (DIP)** **financing** – a form of secured financing obtained after a bankruptcy filing. DIP financing is senior to all pre-existing claims. It generally carries a short maturity, and comes with fairly restrictive covenants. DIP financing if often arranged in anticipation of bankruptcy filing, and becomes available as soon as the petition is filed.
- **Discharge of debts –** At the end the bankruptcy process, the judge releases the debtor from liability for pre-bankruptcy debts. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the debtor emerges from bankruptcy with a lesser debts as specified by the plan of reorganization. In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the assets of the company have been sold and the proceeds distributed to creditors. A discharge of debts must obey the rules of absolute priority.
- **Exclusivity period** – the initial 120-day period immediately following the petition date during which the debtor has the exclusive right to file the plan of reorganization. The period may be extended at the judge’s discretion. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, creditors are free to submit their own plan or plans.
- **Fraudulent transfer –** transfer of assets from the company when the company is insolvent, makes the company insolvent or is not at fair market value.
- **Impaired claim –** A claim that under a given plan of reorganization will return less than 100 cents on the dollar to its owners. Creditors whose claims are impaired but not wiped out have the right to vote on the plan of reorganization. (Owners of claims that are wiped out, for example common stockholders are “deemed to reject” the plan, and do not vote.)
- **Involuntary petition** – a bankruptcy filing submitted by the creditors of a company rather than the company itself. An involuntary petition requires the participation of no fewer than three creditors with _bona fide_ claims of at least $10,000.
- **Liquidation –** In Chapter 7, the process by which the debtors assets are identified and sold and the proceeds distributed to creditors. Liquidation is administered by a government-appointed trustee. Liquidation value is an estimate of the current market value of the assets.
- **Plan of reorganization** – A document that identifies the various classes of claims against a company and how they will be treated in the bankruptcy process. This document lays out the plan for the company’s emergence from bankruptcy court. It must be confirmed by at least one impaired class of creditors in order to be put into effect. The plan is generally developed in a negotiated process between the company and its creditors under the oversight of the judge.
- **Prepackaged Bankruptcy (Prepack) –** A method of filing for bankruptcy in which the debtor negotiates a plan of reorganization with its creditors, and solicits vote of the impaired classes in advance of its bankruptcy petition. The pre-negotiated plan of reorganization and a description of the solicitation are submitted to the court at the same time as the bankruptcy petition. Prepackaged bankruptcy can greatly shorten the amount of time a firm spends in bankruptcy.
- **Secured debt** – Debt for which the creditor has the right to pursue specific pledged property upon default. Unsecured claims generally include trade payables to vendors who sold items or services on standard open terms without collateral.
- **Trustee –** In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a trustee is appointed to administer the liquidation of assets and the distribution of proceeds to the creditors. In some Chapter 11 situations, a Trustee is assigned in cases where there has been fraud or serious mismanagement.
- **Voluntary petition** – a bankruptcy filing submitted by the company itself. Voluntary petitions are much more prevalent than involuntary ones.
- **Vote on the plan of reorganization –** Creditors with impaired claims have the right to vote by class on any plan of reorganization. A class is deemed to approve a plan if two-thirds in amount and onehalf in number of the creditors in that class voted to accept the plan.
