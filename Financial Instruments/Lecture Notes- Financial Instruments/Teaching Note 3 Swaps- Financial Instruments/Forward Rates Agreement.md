### NO ARBITRAGE PRINCIPLE
+ An Arbitrage Opportunity is a trading strategy that either
	1. Costs nothing today and yields a positive profit in the future; or
	2. Yields a positive profit today, and zero cash in the future.
+ In well functioning markets, no arbitrage opportunities may arise.
	+ If there were, arbitrageurs would take massive positions to profit from them, equilibrating the market.
+ The value of derivative securities, including forwards, futures, swaps and options, are determined by assuming that no arbitrage opportunities exist.

---
### THE LAW OF ONE PRICE

Securities with identical payoffs must have the same price.

+ Otherwise, an arbitrage opportunities arises
	+ Buy Cheap / Sell Dear
+ Buy the low-priced security and sell the high-priced one.
+ At maturity the arbitrageur is hedged, since the cash flows are the same.

## FORWARD CONTRACTS
+ A Forward contract is an agreement between two counterparties to buy or sell a prespecified amount of goods or securities at a prespecified future date$T$at a prespecified price$F$
 + It does not cost anything to enter into a forward contract at time 0
	 + The contract is about exchanging goods (or securities) for money in the future, and not today.
 + The prespecified price$F$moves to ensure that the value of the forward contract is zero for both counterparties at the inception of the contract.
+ Let$N$be the size of the contract and${} S_t$the price of the good or security at$t$.

-The Profit/Loss at$T$are$$\text{P/L counterpary long the forward} =N\times(S_T-F)$$$$\text{P/L counterpary short the forward} =N\times(F-S_T)$$

+ For instance, the party long the forward agrees to buy at$T$a security for$F$when its value is$S_T$
	+ If$S_T> F$, it makes a profit (it pays only$F$instead of$S_T)$
	+ If$S_T< F$, it makes a loss (it pays$F$instead of the cheaper${} S_T)$
+ On the other hand, the party short the forward agrees to sell at$T$a security for$F$when its value is${} S_T$
	 + If$S_T< F$, it makes a profit (they receive higher price$F$above prevailing market price of$S_T)$
	 + If$S_T> F$, it makes a loss (they receive a price$F$below the market price${} S_T)$

Long forward exchange rate: At maturity, purchase foreign currency and pay with home currency
Short forward contract: At maturity, purchase home currency and pay with foreign currency

***Forward contract to exchange foreign currency for home currency
+ Forward contract to exchange EUR for USD
+ Spot Exchange Rate:$S_{0} \frac{USD}{EUR}$
+ Forward Rate:$F_{0,T} \frac{USD}{EUR}$
+ US Interest Rate:$r_{USD}$
+ EUR Interest Rate:$r_{EUR}$

***Pricing of Forward Exchange Rate Contracts
+ Consider a US Investor with USD N to invest for 1 year. The Investor has 2 options to invest.
1. **Strategy A**
	2. Deposit N at at$r_{USD}$yielding at maturity T:$$\text{Payoff}_{A}=Ne^{(r_{USD})*T}$$
2. **Strategy B**
	1. Exchange USD N into EUR$\frac{N}{S_{0}}$
	2. Invest EUR$\frac{N}{S_{0}}$at$r_{EUR}$yielding at maturity T:$$\text{Payoff}_{B}= \left(\frac{N}{S_{0}}\right)e^{(r_{EUR})*T}$$
	3. Enter into a forward contract to buy dollars, paying euros at forward rate$F_{0,T}$(Short forward).$$\text{Dollars recieved }= F_{0,T}* \left(\frac{N}{S_{0}}\right)e^{(r_{EUR})*T}$$
3. Under no arbitrage, the payoffs to the two strategies must be equal.$$F_{0,T}* \left(\frac{N}{S_{0}}\right)e^{(r_{EUR})*T} = Ne^{(r_{USD})*T}$$
4. Solving for$F_{0,T}$,$$F_{0,T}=S_{0}e^{(r_{USD}-r_{EUR})*T}$$

#### ARBITRAGE STRATEGY WHEN $F_{0,T} > S_0 \TIMES E^{(R_S-R_E) \TIMES T}$

ie. quoted forward contract is overvalued.
Short forwards contract by paying euros and accepting dollars

1. **Enter a forward contract to sell$N$euros at the forward rate$F_{0,T}$:**
	   Commit to sell euros in the future at the currently quoted forward rate.
	   This is equivalent to shorting the forward.
1. **Borrow$N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0$dollars and use it to buy$N \times e^{-r_e \times T}$euros:**
	   Take a loan in dollars now, which will be repaid by the proceeds of selling euros at the forward rate.
	   Convert the borrowed dollars to euros at the current spot rate.
3. **Invest$N \times e^{-r_e \times T}$euros at the euro interest rate$r_e$until$T$:**
	   Invest the euros at the Euro LIBOR rate, expecting them to grow back to$N$euros over time$T$.
### AT MATURITY $T$
+ **Receive$\$F_{0,T} \times N$from the forward sale of euros:**
   - This is the dollar amount you get from selling$N$euros at the forward rate.
+ **Pay back the dollar loan of$\$(N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0) \times e^{r_s \times T}$:**
   - Repay the dollar loan which has grown to this amount with the US interest rate over time$T$.

+ **The dollar profit at$T$is:**$$N \times (F_{0,T} - M_0 \times e^{(r_s-r_e) \times T})$$

  1. Short forward contract (sell euros, buy dollars)
  2. Borrow dollars
  3. Buy euro
  4. Invest in euro deposits
At maturity,
5. Collect returns from euro deposits
6. Deliver euros and receive dollars
7. Pay back loan obligation

### ARBITRAGE STRATEGY WHEN $F_{0,T} < M_0 \TIMES E^{(R_S-R_E) \TIMES T}$
1. **Enter into a forward contract to buy$N$euros at forward rate$F_{0,T}$:**
	+ This step locks in the price at which you will buy euros in the future.

2. **Borrow$N \times e^{-r_e \times T}$euros:**
	+ Borrow euros now at the current Euro LIBOR rate, and you will need to pay back the borrowed amount multiplied by the exponential of the negative Euro interest rate times the time to maturity$T$.

3. **Exchange them to$N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0$dollars:**
	+ Convert the borrowed euros to dollars at the current spot rate.

4. **Invest$N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0$dollars at the dollar interest rate$r_s$:**
	+ Invest the dollar amount at the current US LIBOR rate, and the investment will grow according to the dollar interest rate over the time to maturity$T$.

5. **At maturity$T$, the arbitrageur:**
	+ Receives$N$euros from the forward contract and pays$F_{0,T} \times N$dollars for them.
	+ Pays back the euro loan of$N \times e^{-r_e \times T}$euros, which has grown to$N$euros by$T$.
	+ Receives proceeds from the dollar investment, which is the invested amount multiplied by the exponential of the dollar interest rate times$T$.

6. **Dollar Profit at$T$:**
	+ The profit is calculated as the proceeds from the dollar investment minus the cost of buying euros in the forward contract.

1. Long forward (buy euros, pay dollars)
2. Borrow euros
3. Convert to dollars
4. invest in dollars deposits
At maturity,
5. Collect returns from dollar deposits
6. Pay dollars to forward counterparty
7. Collect euros
8. Use euros to pay back euro loan

### TABLE 1: OVERVALUED FORWARD RATE
+ In this scenario, the arbitrageur believes that the forward rate for buying euros is overvalued, meaning that the market's forward rate is higher than what it should be based on interest rate differentials.

| Trade | Payoff |
| --- | --- |
| Enter a forward contract to sell euros at the overvalued forward rate $F_{0,T}$ | 0 |
| Borrow euros at the current spot rate $M_0$ | $-N \times e^{-r_e \times T}$ |
| Convert borrowed euros to dollars at spot rate $M_0$ | $N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0$ |
| Invest the dollar amount at the US interest rate $r_s$ | $N \times e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0 \times e^{r_s \times T}$ |
| At maturity $T$, fulfill the forward contract | $-N \times F_{0,T}$ |
| Pay back the euro loan | $N$ |
| **Net Profit/Loss at $T$** | $N \times (e^{-r_e \times T} \times M_0 \times e^{r_s \times T} - F_{0,T})$ |

### TABLE 2: UNDERVALUED FORWARD RATE
+ In this scenario, the arbitrageur believes that the forward rate for buying euros is undervalued, meaning that the market's forward rate is lower than what it should be based on interest rate differentials.

| Trade | Payoff |
| --- | --- |
| Enter a forward contract to buy euros at the undervalued forward rate $F_{0,T}$ | 0 |
| Borrow dollars at the current spot rate $M_0$ | $-N \times e^{-r_s \times T} \times M_0$ |
| Convert borrowed dollars to euros at spot rate$M_0$|$N \times e^{-r_s \times T}$|
| Invest the euro amount at the Euro interest rate$r_e$|$N \times e^{-r_s \times T} \times e^{r_e \times T}$|
| At maturity$T$, fulfill the forward contract |$N \times F_{0,T}$|
| Pay back the dollar loan |$N \times e^{-r_s \times T} \times M_0 \times e^{r_s \times T}$|
| **Net Profit/Loss at$T$** |$N \times (F_{0,T} - e^{-r_s \times T} \times M_0 \times e^{r_s \times T})$|

# Forward Rates Agreement

+ The earlier derivation was obtained for currency forwards.
+ Similar derivations hold for other securities, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.
+ Here is a list of "formulas". A good exercise is to go over the steps again.

| Security | Forward Price |
|----------|---------------|

| Currency (e.g. dollar vs euro) |$$F_{0,T} = M_0 \times e^{(r_s-r_e)T}$$

|

| Stock: no dividend |$$F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{rT}$$

|

| Stock: dividend yield$q$|$$F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{(r-q)T}$$

|

| Stock: known Dividend$D$at$T_1 < T$|$$F_{0,T} = \left(S_0 - D \times e^{-rT_1}\right) \times e^{rT}$$

|

| Commodity: Storage cost$U$. No "convenience yield" |$$F_{0,T} = \left(S_0 + PV(U)\right) \times e^{rT}$$

|

| Commodity: % storage cost$u$. No "convenience yield" |$$F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{(r+u)T}$$

|

| Commodity: % storage cost$u$, convenient yield$y$|$$F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{(r+u-y)T}$$

|

| Bond: Zero Coupon with Maturity$T^* > T$|$$F_{0,T} = \frac{Z(0,T^*)}{Z(0,T)}$$

|

| Bond: with Semi-annual Coupon$c$, Maturity$T_n$|$$F_{0,T} = \frac{\sum_{i=m+1}^{n} c \times \frac{Z(0,T_i)}{Z(0,T)} + c \times \frac{Z(0,T_n)}{Z(0,T)}}{1 + \frac{i}{2} \times \frac{Z(0,T)}{Z(0,T)}}$$

|

+ In all cases, the value of a forward contract at time$t > 0$(after initiation) is:

$$f_{t,T} = e^{-r(T-t)}[F_{0,T} - F_{t,T}]$$

3. Assume that at time t months the Euro appreciated from$S_{0}$to$S_{t}$, with$S_0<S_t$
4. If the US firm wants to cancel the contract with the bank, how much does it have to pay?

	+ The US firm can enter into the reverse forward contract with the bank, with payoff$$\text{Dollar payoff at$T$of reverse forward contract} = N × (S_{T} − F_{t, T})$$Now:$$F_{t,T} = S_t × e^{(r_{USD}−r_{EUR})×(T −t)}$$
	+ The reverse contract neutralizes the former one.
+ Payoff at$T$from forward + reverse forward$$= N\times (F_{0,T}-S_T)+N \times(M_T-F_{t,T})$$$$= N\times(F_{0,T}- F_{t, T})$$
+ The US firm will have to pay the bank$N\times(F_{0,T}- F_{t, T})$at$T$
	+ The Present Value of$N\times(F_{0,T}- F_{t, T})$is the value of the original forward contract to the US firm

$$
f_{t,T}=e^{-r_{\$}\times(T-t)}\times(F_{0,T}-F_{t,T})\times N
$$

+ Since it costs$e^{-r_{\$}\times(T-t)}\times(F_{0,T}-F_{t,T})\times N$to close the position, the value of the forward contract to the firm must equal this amount.
	+ Vice-versa, the value to the bank must be$e^{-r_{\$}\times(T-t)}\times(F_{0,T}-F_{t,T})\times N$

> [!note]
> The above formula is general: The value of a forward contract to $sell$ euros at a prespecifled
>
> price $K$ is always given by $$f_{t,T}=e^{-r_{\$}\times(T-t)}\times(K-F_{t,T})$$

To summarize, we found:

1. The Forward (Delivery) Price - the price decided at time 0 to buy / sell goods (Euros) in the future is given by$$
\begin{aligned}F_{0,T}=S_0\times e^{(r_{\$}-r_e)T}\end{aligned}

$$
2. The value of an $existing$ forward contract to deliver goods (Euros) at preset price $K$ (determined some time in the past) is equal to the cost / profit of closing the contract: $$ f_{t,T}=[K-F_{t,T}]\times e^{-r_{\$}(T-t)}$$
- This is the value of forward contract to $sell$. 

- What is the value of a forward contract to buy (i.e. a long forward contract?)

**Valuation of a Long Forward Contract at Time $t$
Set Up the Current Value Notation
- Let $F_{0,T}$ be the forward rate agreed upon at initiation for exchange at future time $T$.
- Let $F_{t,T}$ be the forward rate at the intermediate time $t$ for the same exchange at time $T$.
- Let $S_t$ be the spot rate at the intermediate time $t$.
- Let $r$ be the domestic risk-free interest rate; $r_{\text{USD}}$.
- Let $N$ be the notional amount of foreign currency (Euros in this context) to be exchanged.

**Determine the Payoff of the Original Forward Contract
- At maturity $T$, the payoff to the long position in the original forward contract is $$N \times (S_T - F_{0,T})$$
***Calculate the Reverse Forward Contract
- To exit the forward position, the firm enters into a reverse forward contract, agreeing at time $t$ to sell Euros at the new forward rate $F_{t,T}$.
- The payoff of the reverse contract at maturity $T$ is $N \times (F_{t,T} - S_T)$.

***Combine Forward and Reverse Forward Payoffs
- The two payoffs $N \times (S_T - F_{0,T})$ and $N \times (F_{t,T} - S_T)$ offset each other.
- The net payoff from both contracts at $T$ is $N \times (F_{0,T} - F_{t,T})$.

***Calculate the Present Value at Time $t$
- The present value of the net payoff is the value of the original forward contract to the long position. 
- That value, discounted back from $T$ to $t$, is calculated as: $$f_{t,T} = N \times (F_{0,T} - F_{t,T}) \times e^{-r \times (T - t)}$$
***Final Value of a Long Forward Contract at Time $t$
- The value of the long forward contract at time $t$ is therefore: $$f_{t,T} = N \times (F_{0,T} - F_{t,T}) \times e^{-r_{\text{USD}} \times (T - t)}$$
This equation reflects the current value of the long forward position: If $F_{0,T} > F_{t,T}$, the value is positive, indicating that the spot rate has moved favorably since the contract was initiated. Conversely, if $F_{0,T} < F_{t,T}$, the value is negative, reflecting an unfavorable move in the spot rate. As you mentioned, since it costs $f_{t,T}$ to close the position (buy back the forward contract), this must also be the value of the original forward contract from the perspective of the long (buy) side.

To summarize our findings:
- The Forward (Delivery) Price - The price determined at time 0 to buy or sell the foreign currency (Euros in this case) in the future is given by: $$F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{(r_{\text{USD}} - r_{\text{EUR}})T}$$
- The Value of an Existing Long Forward Contract - The value of a forward contract agreed upon in the past at a preset price for the future delivery of the foreign currency is equal to the cost or profit of closing the contract, which, if taken at time ( t ), can be expressed as: $f_{t,T} = (K - F_{t,T}) \times e^{-r_{\text{USD}}(T-t)} \times N$ where $K$ is the delivery price set at contract initiation and $N$ is the notional amount of the foreign currency.

- So, to find the value of a forward contract to buy (a long forward contract), if it is between the start and the maturity date, you use the last equation with $K = F_{0,T}$, which represents the agreed forward rate at initiation: $$f_{t,T} = (F_{0,T} - F_{t,T}) \times e^{-r_{\text{USD}}(T-t)} \times N$$
- This is the present value of the profit or loss from a forward contract from the perspective of the holder of a long position in that contract. 
- It accounts for how much the holder stands to gain or lose from the contract's current value compared to what was initially locked in at $t=0$.

##  EXAMPLE 1: THE FORWARD PRICE OF A STOCK WITH KNOWN DIVIDEND PAYMENT
- Consider a stock with price $S_0$ which pays a known dividend at time $T_1 < T$.
- The pricing formula $F_{0,T} = (S_0 - PV(D)) e^{rT}$.
- **Arbitrage argument**: What if $F_{0,T} > (S_0 - PV(D)) e^{rT}$
## ARBITRAGEUR:
- At time 0:
  1. Short forward $F_{0,T}$;
  2. Borrow $(S_0 - PV(D))$ with maturity $T$ and $PV(D)$ with maturity $T_1$;
  3. Use total $S_0$ to buy stock.
- At time $T_1$
  * Receive dividend $D$ from stock. Use it to repay $PV(D)$ loan at $T_1$.
- At time $T$:
  1. Receive $F_{0,T}$ from sale of stock (which is covered, because of (c) above);
  2. Repay the loan $(S_0 - PV(D))e^{rT}$
**Payoff at $T$**: $$F_{0,T} - (S_0 - PV(D))e^{rT} > 0$$
---

## EXAMPLE 2: THE FORWARD PRICE OF A STOCK WITH CONSTANT DIVIDEND YIELD
- **Dividend Yield** = Stock’s payoff per unit of stock price = $D/S_t$
- Continuously compounded dividend yield $q$
  - $\Rightarrow$ Total dividend in a small interval $[t, t + dt]$ is $D_t = q \times S_t \times dt$
- Forward price: $F_{0,T} = S_0 \times e^{-(r-q)T}$
- **What if** $F_{0,T} > S_0 \times e^{-(r-q)T}$?
  1. Short Forward at $F_{0,T}$
  2. Borrow $S_0 \times e^{-rT}$ and buy $N_0 = e^{-qT} < 1$ shares.
  3. For every $t$ reinvest the dividends in the stock.
     - Change in number of shares in a small interval $dt$: $$(N_{t+dt} - N_t) = N_t \times \frac{D_t}{S_t}$$, $N_t \times q \times dt$
     - Total number of shares between 0 and $T$: $$N_T = N_0 \times e^{qT} = e^{-qT} \times e^{qT} = 1$$
- The arbitrageur has exactly the right amount of shares to cover the short forward position.
**Payoff at $T$**: $$F_{0,T} - S_0 \times e^{-(r-q)T} > 0$$

### COVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY VIOLATION DURING THE 2007 - 2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS
- Sometimes, arbitrageurs fail to keep markets together.
- The 2007 - 2009 provides a simple example.
- Define the discrepancy between forward and the “theoretical” forward rate as:
**Basis** = Traded Forward Rate – Theoretical Forward Rate $$= \frac{F_{traded} - F_{L,t+m}}{F_{L,t+m}}$$
where $m$ = maturity (e.g., 3 months, 6 months etc.), and recall $$F_{L,t+m} = S_t e^{(r_s-r_e)m}$$
- The latter relation is also called "Covered Interest Rate Parity" (CIP)
- If Basis above is not close to zero, we say that there is a violation of the covered interest rate parity.

---
### WHY DID COVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY FAIL DURING THE 2007-2009 CRISIS?
- Holding US Treasuries has its own “convenience yield” when everyone needs cash collateral.
- During the crisis, from the graph, we had the basis being positive. That is: $$F_{data,L,t+m} > F_{L,t+m} = M_t e^{(r_s-r_e)m}$$
- Recall that in this case, an arbitrage trade requires the following:
  1. Short forward;
  2. Borrow dollars (or sell US Treasuries);
  3. Change them into Euro;
  4. Invest in Euro (or buy Euro bonds)
- But point (b) failed during the crisis, as:
  1. Increase in credit risk concerns impaired the ability of financial institutions to borrow;
  2. Holding safe dollars (US Treasuries) is valuable during a financial crisis for liquidity management
     - US Treasuries are the only collateral accepted for short-term lending transactions.
     - It is very valuable to hold on to them for future cash management
