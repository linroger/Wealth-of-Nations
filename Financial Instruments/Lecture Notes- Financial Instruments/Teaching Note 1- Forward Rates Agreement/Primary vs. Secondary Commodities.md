In discussing the commodity prices in Table 1,  we invoked considerations that did not arise with financial assets,  but that will arise repeatedly when we discuss commodities. Among these are:

- Storage costs. The cost of storing a physical item such as corn or copper can be large relative to its value. Moreover,  some commodities deteriorate over time,  which is also a cost of storage. By comparison,  financial securities are inexpensive to store. Consequently,  we did not mention storage costs when discussing financial assets.
- Cash-and-carry markets. A commodity for which the forward price compensates a commodity owner for costs of storage is called a carry market. (In such a market,  the return on a cash-and-carry,  net of all costs,  is the risk-free rate.) Storage of a commodity is an economic decision that varies across commodities and that can vary over time for a given commodity. Some commodities are at times stored for later use (we will see that this is the case for natural gas and corn),  others are more typically used as they are produced (oil,  copper). By contrast,  financial markets are always carry markets: Assets are always "stored" (owned),  and forward prices always compensate owners for storage.
- Lease rate. The short-seller of an item may have to compensate the owner of the item for lending. In the case of financial assets,  short-sellers have to compensate lenders for missed dividends or other payments accruing to the asset. For commodities,  a shortseller may have to make a payment,  called a lease payment,  to the commodity lender. The lease payment typically would not correspond to dividends in the usual sense of the word.
- Convenience yield. The owner of a commodity in a commodity-related business may receive nonmonetary benefits from physical possession of the commodity. Such benefits may be reflected in forward prices and are generically referred to as a convenience yield.

# Primary vs. Secondary Commodities

Commodities can be broadly classified as extractive and renewable.

- **Extractive commodities** occur naturally in the ground and are obtained by mining and drilling. These include metals (silver,  gold,  and copper) and hydrocarbons,  including oil and natural gas.
- **Renewable commodities** are obtained through agriculture and include grains (corn,  soybeans,  wheat),  livestock (cattle,  pork bellies),  dairy (cheese,  milk),  and lumber.

Commodities can be further classified as primary and secondary. **Primary commodities** are unprocessed; corn,  soybeans,  oil,  and gold are all primary. **Secondary commodities** have been processed. In Table 1,  gasoline is a secondary commodity.

Finally,  commodities are measured in uncommon units for which you may not know precise definitions.

- A barrel of oil is 42 gallons.
- A bushel is a dry measure containing approximately 2150 cubic inches.
- The ounce used to weigh precious metals,  such as gold,  is a troy ounce,  which is approximately 9.7% greater in weight than the customary avoirdupois ounce.
