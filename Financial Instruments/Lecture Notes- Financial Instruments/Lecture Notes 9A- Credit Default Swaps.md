# Lecture Notes 9A- Credit Default Swaps
### Financial Instruments

Observations about CDS
John Heaton
The University of Chicago Booth School of Business

### Types of CDS,  Quantities

Types

- Single-name CDS: single reference entity such as a corporation or sovereign
- Multi-name CDS: cover defaults in a reference portfolio such as a basic credit default swap or a CDS index (typically an index of commonly negotiated single-name CDS)
Quantities:
- From BIS (2021): \$8.5 trillion notional at end of 2020. 1.5% of notional of all global derivatives.
- GFC likely reduced size we see even today
- $62\%$ now with central counterparties that act like exchanges.
- Increased size of sovereign CDS since GFC: 4% of total notional in 2007 to $14\%$ in 2020.
