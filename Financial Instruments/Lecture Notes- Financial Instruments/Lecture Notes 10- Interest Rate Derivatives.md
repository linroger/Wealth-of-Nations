## [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]]

- A [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreement]](FRA) is an agreement between two counterparties A and B according to which at maturity T
- Counterparty A makes a payment to B equal to$N × F × ∆$,  where$N$is the notional, $∆$the compounding frequency,  and$F$is a fixed rate decided at time$0$;
- Counterparty B makes a payment to A equal to$N × R(T_{0},  T) × ∆$,  where$T_{0}  = T − ∆$.
- The reference floating rate R is typically the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rate. The *forward rate* F is determined at time 0 so that the value of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] is zero.
- What is the value of this net cash flow at time 0 for given F?
- Assume we have available the values of zero coupon bonds$Z(0,   T_{0})\text{ and }Z(0,  T)$.
- The Net Cash flow to counterparty A is Net Cash Flow at$T\ =\ N\times\Delta\times(F-R(T_{0}, T))$
$$=\ N\times(1+F\times\Delta)$$(Fixed Leg)$$-N\times(1+R(T_{0}, T)\times\Delta)$$(Floating Leg)
- We compute the value of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] by computing the value of each leg.

## [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|Forward Rate Agreements]]
- Present value of fixed leg. This can be computed immediately:$$\mathrm{Value~of~Fixed~Leg}=Z(0, T)\times N\times(1+F\times\Delta)$$
- Present value of floating leg. This must be computed in two steps
- 1. Compute the value of cash flow$N × R(T_0,  T)$as of time$T_0$. Note that at that time we will know the rate$R(T_0,  T)$
	- Value of Floating Leg at$$T_{0}=\dfrac{\text{Cash Flow at } T}{1\text{ period discount}}=N\times\dfrac{(1+R(T_{0}, T)\times\Delta)}{(1+R(T_{0}, T)\times\Delta)}=N$$
1. Obtain the value of Floating Leg at 0
- Therefore,  the value of the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] is$$V=N\times[Z(0, T)\times(1+F\times\Delta)-Z(0, T_{0})]=N\times Z(0, T)\times\left[(1+F\times\Delta)-\frac{Z(0, T_{0})}{Z(0, T)}\right]$$
- The forward rate$F$makes this quantity equal to zero$$1+F\times\Delta=\frac{Z(0, T_{0})}{Z(0, T)}\Longrightarrow F=\frac{1}{\Delta}\left(\frac{Z(0, T_{0})}{Z(0, T)}-1\right)$$

## FORWARD RATE AGREEMENT: EXAMPLE
- It is November 1,  2022. A firm has a receivable of \$100 million in six months$(T_1 = 0.5)$,  and wishes to park this money for an additional six months (until$T_2 = 1$),  when it will need to use it for some capital expenditure.
- The firm is worried that the six month rate will decline at$T_{1}$and thus wants to lock-in a six-month rate *today*.
- To hedge,  the firm can enter into a six-month [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] with a bank for the period$T_1$to$T_2$,  and notional N =$100 million.
- Today the bank agrees to pay in one year ($T_2 = 1$) the amount$\frac{N}{2} × F(0.5,  1)$;
- The firm agrees to pay on the same day the amount$\frac{N}{2} × R(0.5,  1)$.
- That is,  they exchange the payment at$T_2 = 1$
	- Net payment of the firm at$T_{2}=\frac{N}{2}\times[F(0, )-R(0.5, 1)]\tag{1}$
- What is the forward rate?
- On November 1,  2022,  the value of 6-months Treasury bills is$Z(0,  0.5) = 97.728$and the value of 1-year Treasury bills is$Z(0,  1) = 95.713$. Thus:$$F(0, 0.5, 1)=2\times\left(\frac{Z(0, 0.5)}{Z(0, 1)}-1\right)=4.21\%.$$

## FORWARD RATE AGREEMENT: EXAMPLE
- Why does the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] solves the hedging problem of the firm?
- Because at$T_1 = 0.5$,  when the firm receives its \$100 million receivable,  it can simply invest it at the market rate$R(0.5,  1)$
- Then,  at$T_2 = 1$,  the firm receives the payoff from the investment,  plus the net payment from the FRA. In total:
Total amount at$T_{2}$$$=\ \left\{\$100\ \text{million}\ \times\left[1+\frac{R(0.5, 1)}{2}\right]\right\}\quad\text{(Return on investment)}$$$$+\left\{\frac{N}{2}\times[F(0.5, 1)-R(0.5, 1)]\right\}\quad\text{(FRA payment)}$$$$=\ \$100\ \text{million}\ \times\left[1+\frac{F(0, 5, 1)}{2}\right]$$$$=\ \$102.105\ \text{million}$$
- That is,  the firm locked in the forward rate$F(0.5,  1) = 4.21\%$

## INTEREST RATE SWAPS
- An interest rate swap is an agreement between two counterparties,  according to which at dates
$T_{1}$, $T_{2}$,  …$T_n$,  with$T_{i}$=$T_{i-1} + ∆$,  the counterparties exchange the net cash flows
$${\mathrm{Swap~Net~Cash~Flow~at}}T_{i}=N\times\Delta\times(K-R(T_{i-1}, T_{i}))$$
- The swap rate K is chosen to make the value of the swap equal to zero at time 0.
- What is the value of the swap at 0?
- Clearly,  this specific cash flow is the same we had earlier for a FRA,  and therefore
PV of Cash Flow at$T_{i}\ =\ N\times Z(0, T_{i})\times\left[(1+K\times\Delta)-\frac{Z(0, T_{i-1})}{Z(0, T_{i})}\right]$

$$=\ N\times Z(0, T_{i})\times\left[(1+K\times\Delta)-(1+F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})\Delta)\right]$$

$$=\ N\times\Delta\times Z(0, T_{i})\left[K-F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})\right]$$

- where we denote$F(0,   T_{i-1},   T_{i}$) the forward rate at time 0 for a [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) Overview|FRA]] between$T_{i-1}$and$T_{i}$.
- It follows that for given K,  the value of the swap is the sum of these values
$${\mathrm{Value~of~Swap}}=N\times\Delta\times\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z(0, T_{i})\times[K-F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})]$$
- The swap rate is then the K that makes the value of the swap equal to zero
$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z(0, T_{i})\times[K-F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})]=0\Longrightarrow K=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\times F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})$$
	- where
$$w_{i}=\frac{Z(0, T_{i})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}Z(0, T_{i})}$$
- The swap rate is a weighted average of forward rates. - This is very similar to our findings in Teaching Notes 2.

## INTEREST RATE SWAP EXAMPLE
- Today is November 1,  2022. A firm has receivables of$5.5 millions every six months for the next 5 years.
- The firm has also a 5-year,  semi-annual, $200 m floating rate debt outstanding,  with floating rate [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] + 4 bps.
- How can the firm use the receivables to service the coupons on the debt?
- A solution is to enter into a fixed-for-floating swap with an investment bank.
	- On November 1,  2022,  the swap rate for a 5-year fixed-for-floating swap was quoted at K = 5.46%.
- So,  the *net* cash flow to the firm from the swap contract is
Net cash flow to the firm at$$T_{i}  = 200 \text{ million } × 0.5 × [R(T_{i} −1,   T_{i}) − 5.46\%]$$
- Why does this swap resolve the problem?![](ddf363508a33988350b1bc3466b5578e.png)
- One of the main reasons for the massive increase in the size of the swap market is its flexibility for cash flow management and risk management.

## SOME HISTORY

![](096f82336d662be8e12414cdea9f13c4.png)

## OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAPS (IS)
- In a Is,  the two counterparties agree to exchange fixed for floating payments,  where the floating payment is tied to the cumulative return from an overnight rate
- Federal funds rate,  SOFR in US. Europe: short-term rate (eSTR),  (formerly Euro OverNight Index Average (EONIA) rate).
- Given a notional N,  the floating rate payment at time$T_{i}$is$$CF\left(T_{i}\right)=N\left(\prod\limits_{j=1}^{n_{j}}\left(1+r_{t_{j}}\delta\right)-1\right)\tag{2}$$
- where δ is the daily interval, $r_t$is the reference (annualized) overnight rate,  and$n_j$is the number of days between reset periods.
- The day count convention is normally Actual/360.
- In the continuous time limit ($\delta\to0$),  we have that$$CF\left(T_{i}\right)=N\left(e^{\int_{t-1}^{T_{i}}r\left(n\right)\mathrm{d}n}-1\right)\tag{3}$$
- Is with maturity less than 1 year have only one payment at the maturity.
- Is with longer maturities have normally quarterly payments.

## WHAT IS THE VALUE OF IS?
- The value of Is is the difference between the floating leg and the fixed leg:
$$V_{t}^{OIS}=V_{t}^{Floating}-V_{t}^{Fixed}\tag{4}$$
- **Floating Leg**: At reset dates,  and assuming the payment of a principal at maturity of the swap,  the value of the floating leg is par.
- Indeed,  investing the notional N in the overnight index daily gives at$T_{i}$
$$N\prod_{j=1}^{n_{j}}\left(1+r_{t_{j}}\Delta\right)=C F\left(T_{i}\right)+N$$
	- ⇒ we can replicate the floating payments,  plus a residual of notional at maturity$T_{i}$,  with an investment N at time 0.
- It follows$$V_0^{Floating}=N$$
- **Fixed leg:** Given a proper discount function$Z_{OIS} (0,  T_{i}$),  we obtain
$$V_{0}^{Fixed}=N\ c\ \Delta\ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)+N\ Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{n}\right)\tag{5}$$
- The value of the contract at inception is zero, $V^{OIS}_0= 0$.
- It follows from (4) then that
$$V_{0}^{O I S}=V_{0}^{F l o a t i n g}-V_{0}^{F i x e d}=0\tag{6}$$
- This equation implies that the swap rate c can be computed from$$1=c\, \Delta\, \, \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)+Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{n}\right)\tag{7}$$
	- which gives$$c(T_{n})=\frac{1}{\Delta}\frac{1-Z^{OLS}(0, T_{n})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}Z^{OLS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)}\tag{8}$$
	- where we now emphasize that the coupon rate$c$is for a swap with maturity$T_{n}$,  and thus write$c(T_{n})$.

## IS DISCOUNT CURVE
- Given the Is coupon rates$c(T_{i}$) for every maturity$T_{i}$,  we can bootstrap the Is zero-coupon curve from (6).
- We obtain the relation:$$Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{i}\right)=\frac{1-c\left(T_{i}\right)\, \Delta\, \, \Sigma_{j=1}^{i-1}\, Z^{OIS}\left(0, T_{j}\right)}{1+c\left(T_{i}\right)\Delta}\tag{9}$$
- recalling,  however,  that Is with maturity less than or equal to 1 year generally have only one payment.
- Next Figure shows an example of bootstrapping from Is quotes,  on January 2,  2009. Panel A reports the original Is quotes from Bloomberg. Panel B uses the quotes from Panel A along with bootstrap methodology (9) and defines the Is discount function$Z^{OIS}(0,  T)$.

- which are quite different.
## INTEREST RATE OPTIONS
- The market for plain vanilla interest rate options is very large.
- These include
	- Treasury bond options: Options to purchase a Treasury bond
	- Swaptions: Options to enter into a swap at a given strike (swap) rate.
		- Receiver Swaptions: Options to enter into a swap and receive the strike swap rate;
		- Payer Swaptions: Options to enter into a swap and pay the strike swap rate.
	- Caps and Floors: Securities that pay when rates go up (Caps) or down (Floors). Their cash flows are given by$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{}}&{{}}&{{\mathrm{Cap~CF~at~}T_{i}~=~N\times\Delta\times\operatorname*{max}\left(R(T_{i-1}, T_{i})-K\right);}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{\mathrm{Floor~CF~at~}T_{i}~=~N\times\Delta\times\operatorname*{max}\left(K-R(T_{i-1}, T_{i})\right)}}\end{array}$$
	- Popular derivative instruments to insure agains increases or decreases in interest rates ∗ For instance,  caps typically accompany floating rate bond issuance.
- Caption and Floortion: Options to enter into a cap or a floor.

## THE BLACK’S FORMULA FOR INTEREST RATE OPTIONS
- The assumptions of Black and Scholes do not apply to interest rate options
	- 1. The Black-Scholes model assumes a constant interest rate,  while we are trying to price risk on interest rates;
	- 2. The Black-Scholes model assumes constant volatility,  but if the underlying is e.g. a T-Bond,
the volatility depends on duration and thus it is declining with time.
- Even so,  practitioners use the Black-Scholes formula to price a number of interest rate derivatives
- For long this has been thought to be at best an approximation of no arbitrage models,  because of the violations to Black-Scholes formula's assumption described earlier
- In recent times,  it has been shown that the Black and Scholes formula can be derived by no-arbitrage principles under some assumptions.
- In what follow,  we only look at one simple example.

## EXAMPLE: THE BLACK'S FORMULA TO PRICE CAPS
- The Cap pays the sequence of cash flows
$$\mathrm{Cap~CF~at~}T_{i}=N\times\Delta\times\operatorname*{max}\left(R(T_{i-1}, T_{i})-K\right);$$
- where ∆ =$T_{i}$−$T_{i}$−1. Each payment is called a caplet.
- The original Black's formula uses as underlying the futures price,  which equals the forward price
when interest rates are constant.
- In the case of caplets,  we use the forward rate directly,  which is given by$$F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})=\frac{1}{\Delta}\left(\frac{Z(0, T_{i-1})}{Z(0, T_{i})}-1\right)$$
- The model assumes that under the proper risk-adjusted probabilities,  at time$T_{i}$, $$R(T_{i-1}, T_{i})=F(T_{i-1}, T_{i-1}, T_{i})\sim LogNormal$$
- with Variance$[R(T_{i} −1,   T_{i})] = σ^2_FT_{i-1}.$
- Then,  the Black formula (see Teaching Notes 5) has
$$C a p l e t(T_{i})=Z(0, T_{i})\times[F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})\times N(d_{1})-K\times N(d_{2})]$$
- where
$$d_{1}=\frac{\log\left(\frac{F(0, T_{i-1}, T_{i})}{K}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\sigma_{F}^{2}T_{i-1}}{\sigma_{F}\sqrt{T_{i-1}}};\quad d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma_{F}\sqrt{T_{i-1}}$$

## EXAMPLE: THE BLACK'S FORMULA TO PRICE CAPS
- Indeed,  market participants quote caps and floors directly in terms of implied volatility. For instance,  from Bloomberg we have
![](f155e82004596b82979fdd6b86ae8c94.png)
- Each entry is a volatility quote for an "at-the-money" instrument,  meaning that its strike rate(equal for all the caplets) is the swap rate with the same maturity of the cap.
- The payment frequency of the underlying caps and floors is 3 months.
- Since the first payment at horizon 3 months is known at time 0,  it is practice to set this caplet equal to zero.

## EXAMPLE: THE BLACK'S FORMULA TO PRICE CAPS

- Example: Consider a 1-year,  quarterly cap with strike rate$r_K = 2.555\%$,  quoted at volatility$σ_F = 23.5\%$.
- The current [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] discount curve is as follows$$Z(0,  0.25) = 99.4580; Z(0,  0.5) = 99.8510; Z(0,  0.75) = 99.1899; Z(0,  1) = 97.4834$$
- From the [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] curve,  we can compute the quarterly compounded forward rates:$$F(0,  0.25,  0.5) = 2.4562\%; F(0,  0.5,  0.75) = 2.6932\%; F(0,  0.75,  1) = 2.8987\%$$
- Finally,  from the quoted volatility$\sigma_{F}=23.5\%$,  we obtain the three relevant volatilities:$$\sigma_{F}\times[\sqrt{T_{1}}, \sqrt{T_{2}}, \sqrt{T_{3}}]\ =\ 23.5\%\times[\sqrt{0.25}, \sqrt{0.5}, \sqrt{0.75}]=[11.75\%\%\%].$$
- Using the formula for$d_1$and$d_2$we obtain$$d_{1}(0.50)=-0.02770;\, d_{2}(0.50)=-0.03945\Longrightarrow\mbox{Caplet}(0.50)=0.0184$$
$$d_{1}(0.75)=0.4000;\, d_{2}(0.75)=0.02328\Longrightarrow\mbox{Caplet}(0.75)=0.0617$$$$d_{1}(1)=0.7218;\, d_{2}(1)=0.5183\Longrightarrow\mbox{Caplet}(1)=0.1057$$
- obtaining$$Cap(1Y)=0.0184+0.0617+0.1057=0.1859$$
## THE TIME SERIES OF [[Lecture Note 6-Implied Volatility |IMPLIED VOLATILITY]]
- The quoted volatility of caps is strongly time varying,  denoting time variation in uncertainty
about changes in future interest rates.
![](54163984c3287d601b791751fa174d1a.png)

## INTEREST RATE TREES
- We now develop the same arguments we used in TN 4,  but for interest rates.
- Let$r_t =$be the six-month,  continuously compounded risk-free rate.
- Let$q = 1/2$be the (true) probability to move up or down on the tree.
	- The movement of the short-term interest rate is exogenous to investors.
	- E.g. the Federal Reserve sets the Fed Fund rate because of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] issues.

![](3a25798bbd6afb00995ba9571401c706.png)

## INTEREST RATE TREES
- The expected rate in six and twelve months are
$$\begin{array}{l l l}{{E\left[r_{1}\right]}}&{{=}}&{{\frac{1}{2}r_{1, u}+\frac{1}{2}r_{1, d}=0.02305}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{1}}\\ {{E\left[r_{2}\right]}}&{{=}}&{{\frac{1}{4}r_{2, u u}+\frac{1}{2}r_{2, u d}+\frac{1}{4}r_{2, d d}=}}\end{array}$$
- This tree naturally translates into a tree of one period (six months) zero coupon bonds.
	- Let$$Z_{i, j}\left(k\right)$$
- be the value of a zero coupon bond at index time$i$(e.g.$i = 1$),  at node j (e.g.$j = u,  d…$) and with maturity at index$k$(e.g.$k = 2$).
- For instance
	- $Z_0 (1)$=Zero at time 0 that matures at time 1
	- $Z_{1, u} (2) =$Zero at time 1 in node up that matures at time 2
## INTEREST RATE TREES
- Recall that since steps are every 6 months:
$$Z_{i, j}\left(i+1\right)=e^{-r_{i, j}{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
- We obtain
![](9fc00b2f962cde641682ec21c1466826.png)Important: Note that there is a key distinction between this zero-coupon tree,  and the trees for stocks in TN 4.

## INTEREST RATE TREES VS STOCK TREES
- For instance,  suppose you assume that the stock process is given by ($q = 1/2$to move up)
![](46c3bd2d4d70178950654f69122c75a5.png)
- It is always the same security whose price is quoted along the tree.
- This is important,  as if you buy the stock at time 0 for 50,  and wait one period,  you can sell it at 70 or 40 depending on the realization along the tree.

## INTEREST RATE TREES VS STOCK TREES
- This is not the case in the zero coupon tree we saw above.
	- The price along the tree is the price of a different security at each node: it is always the one period ahead zero coupon bond.
	- So,  if I buy at time$t = 0$for 0.94,  at time$t = 1$I will get 1 for sure,  and not 0.962 or 0.993.

## HOW CAN WE MODEL A PROPER TREE,  TO USE IN DERIVATIVE PRICING?
- We need more information.
- For instance,  assume that today$t=0$,  a zero coupon with maturity$T=1$(i.e.$i=2$) trades at$$Z_{0}(2)=0.9781$$
- Combining this price with the previous tree,  we obtain a tree for the bond maturing at i = 2
![](75f560b25c4f945b3ba5a43b8901a783.png)
- This is a proper asset pricing tree,  in the sense that the security along the tree is always the same,  namely,  the bond expiring at time$i = 2$.
- Since the last payoff of any bond is always 1,  we typically do not report it.

## RISK NEUTRAL PRICING ON TREES

- At this point,  risk neutral pricing allows us to price derivative securities on the interest rate tree. - As before,  we first compute the risk neutral probability to move up the tree q∗
- The expected risk neutral return to invest in the i = 2 bond is
$$E^{*}\left[\frac{Z_{1}\left(2\right)}{Z_{0}\left(2\right)}\right]=q_{0}^{*}\;\frac{Z_{1, u}\left(2\right)}{Z_{0}\left(2\right)}+\left(1-q_{0}^{*}\right)\;\frac{Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)}{Z_{0}\left(2\right)}$$
- Risk neutral pricing implies that this expected return must equal the safe return of an investment in a zero that matures at time$i = 1$
$$\underbrace{\frac{q_{0}^{*}}{Z_{0}\left(2\right)}+\left(1-q_{0}^{*}\right)}_{\mathrm{Expected~Return~on~2-period~bond}}\ =\ \frac{1}{\frac{Z_{0}\left(1\right)}{\mathrm{Return~on~1-period~Bond}}}$$
- yielding$$q_{0}^{*}=\frac{{Z_{0}\left(2\right)/Z_{0}\left(1\right)-Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)}}{{Z_{1, u}\left(2\right)-Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)}}$$
- Note that this is the same equation we found in TN4.

## RISK NEUTRAL PRICING ON TREES
- Given the risk neutral probability,  the value Vi of every traded security must satisfy
$$V_{0}=Z_{0}\left(1\right)E^{*}\left[V_{1}\right]$$
- For instance,  in the example we have
$$q_{0}^{*}=\frac{Z_{0}\left(2\right)/Z_{0}\left(1\right)-Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)}{Z_{1, u}\left(2\right)-Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)}=\frac{0.9781/0.9916-0.9963}{0.9808-0.9963}=0.6435$$

##### **OPTION ON INTEREST RATE**
- Suppose we want to price an option on the interest rate,  with strike r = 0.0168
- The payoffs are:$$\mathrm{pay}_{1, u}=100\times\max(r_{1, u}-\overline{r})=21.9\text{ and }\mathrm{pay}_{1, d}=100\times\max(r_{1, d}-\overline{r})=0$$$$\mathrm{Option}_{0}=Z_{0}\left(1\right)\times E^{*}\left[\mathrm{pay}_{1}\right]$$$$=0.9916\times\left(0.6435\times21.9+0.35645\times0\right)$$$$=13.97$$
##### QUESTION
- Under the risk neutral probabilities,  the expected interest rate is
$$E^{*}\left[r_{1}\right]=q_{0}^{*}\times r_{1, u}+(1-q_{0}^{*})\times r_{1, d}=0.0275$$
- If your boss asks you what is your forecast of the interest rate in six months,  would you tell him 2.75%?
- In the real world,  the expected interest rate was
$$E\left[r_{1}\right]=2.305\%<2.75\%=E^{*}\left[r_{1}\right]$$
- Passing from the real to the risk neutral world implies increasing the *expected* interest rate.

## A PROBLEM IN FINDING THE TREE FOR A BOND EXPIRING AT I = 3
- **What is then a tree for a bond expiring at** i = 3?
- Let$Z_0 (3) = 0.9615$be the current market price of a bond maturing at$T = 1.5$,  i.e.$i = 3$.
- ![](7abb1e6ab21ca9902f0cc70db2d7be0a.png)
- While from the interest rate tree we find Z2, j(3),  there is not an obvious way to compute Z1, j(3).
- We need **no arbitrage** restrictions.
- The first no arbitrage restriction is provided by the risk neutral probability$q^∗_0$,  which implies
$$Z_{0}(3)=Z_{0}(1)E^{*}\left[Z_{1}(3)\right]=Z_{0}(1)\left[q_{0}^{*}\ Z_{1, u}(3)+(1-q_{0}^{*})\ Z_{1, d}(3)\right]$$
- How can we compute$Z_{1, u}(3) \text{ and }Z_{1, d}(3)$?
- We can use the "implied tree" methodology,  discussed in TN 5.
- Let$q^∗_{1, u} \text{ and }q^∗_{1, d}$be the risk neutral probabilities to move up or down the tree at time$i = 1$.
- Since the same formula as earlier applies,  we have$$\begin{aligned}q_{1, u}^{*}&=\frac{Z_{1, u}\left(3\right)/Z_{1, u}\left(2\right)-Z_{2, ud}\left(3\right)}{Z_{2, uu}\left(3\right)-Z_{2, ud}\left(3\right)}\\q_{2, d}^{*}&=\frac{Z_{1, d}\left(3\right)/Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)-Z_{2, dd}\left(3\right)}{Z_{2, du}\left(3\right)-Z_{2, dd}\left(3\right)}\end{aligned}$$
	- Choose$Z_{1, u}(3)\text{ and }Z_{1, d}(3)$so that the *current* price of the bond$Z_0(3) = 0.9615$
- Problem: We have one equation (the value of the bond) and two unknowns$Z_{1, u}(3)\text{ and }Z_{1, d}(3)$
- We need one more equation. Use for instance$q^∗_{1, u} = q^∗_{1, d} = q^∗_1$
- Practically,  then,  for every$q^∗_1$we obtain the two values of$Z_{1, u}(3)\text{ and }Z_{1, d}(3)$from the equations above,  and thus the tree
- We can find numerically (e.g. using Solver) the value$q^∗_1$such that the price of the traded security$Z_0 (3) = 0.9615$equals the "model price"
$$\begin{array}{l l l}{{\widehat{Z}_{0}\left(3\right)\;=\;Z_{0}\left(1\right)\left\{q_{0}^{*}\;Z_{1, u}\left(3\right)+\left(1-q_{0}^{*}\right)\;Z_{1, d}\left(3\right)\right\}}}\\{ \mathrm{ where }}\\ {{Z_{1, u}\left(3\right)\;=\;Z_{1, u}\left(2\right)\left\{q_{1}^{*}\;Z_{2, u u}\left(3\right)+\left(1-q_{1}^{*}\right)\;Z_{2, u d}\left(3\right)\right\}}}\\ {{Z_{1, d}\left(3\right)\;=\;Z_{1, d}\left(2\right)\left\{q_{1}^{*}\;Z_{2, d u}\left(3\right)+\left(1-q_{1}^{*}\right)\;Z_{2, d d}\left(3\right)\right\}}}\end{array}$$
- We find$q_1^*=0.5912$which implies$Z_{1, u}(3)=0.959\text{ and }Z_{1, d}\left(3\right)=0.988$.

- In summary,  building trees to price fixed income securities is not straightforward.
- The task is made complicated from the fact that no-arbitrage restrictions exist between bonds of different maturities.

## THE HO LEE MODEL
- Moving from risk natural to risk neutral trees is complicated.
- The current main methodology is to build directly a risk neutral tree. - A famous model is the Ho Lee model.
$$r_{i+1}=r_{i}+\theta(i)\Delta\pm\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$
∆ occur with 1/2 (risk neutral) probability.
- where$\Delta$is the time step, $\theta(i)$is a function of time chosen to match current prices,  and$\pm\sqrt{\Delta}$occur with$\frac{1}{2}$(risk neutral) probability.
- This process generates a recombining tree,  independently of$\theta(i)$. Starting from$r_{0}$$$r_{1, u}=r_{0}+\theta(0)\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$$$r_{1, d}=r_{0}+\theta(0)\Delta-\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$

$$r_{2, uu}=r_{1, u}+\theta(1)\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$$$r_{2, ud}=r_{1, u}+\theta(1)\Delta-\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$$$r_{2, du}=r_{1, d}+\theta(1)\Delta+\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$$$r_{2, dd}=r_{1, d}+\theta(1)\Delta-\sigma\sqrt{\Delta}$$

- It is easy to see that$r_{2, ud}=r_{2, du}=r_0+(\theta(0)+\theta(1))\Delta$

## THE HO LEE MODEL
- The tree is "implied" as follows:
- **Inputs:** (a) Time series of short term interest rates; (b) Current bond prices.
1. From historical interest rates,  obtain an estimate of$σ = st.dev(∆r_i)$
1. Then,  compute$θ(i)$recursively,  as follows
	- Use bond maturing at time$i=2$to obtain$\theta(0)$
	- Use bond maturing at time$i=3$to obtain$\theta(1)$
	- Use bond maturing at time$i=n$to obtain$\theta(n-2)$
- In order to perform this,  we must first see how to use "risk neutral" trees to price bonds.

## USING RISK NEUTRAL TREES
- Assume that we built the risk neutral tree already,  and we simply use it.
- Let$r_{i, j}$be the 6 month,  continuously compounded interest rate.
- At every time (1 period = ∆ = 6 months),  there is equal risk neutral probability ($q^∗ = 1/2$) to move up or down.
![](c12efd1a89750d0a5a2d5.png)

## USING RISK NEUTRAL TREES
- From the tree, $Z_0 (1) = e^{−r_0∆} × 1 = 0.9916$
- What is the value of bond paying \$1 in one year ($i = 2$)?
- As usual,  it can be obtained by proceeding backward on the tree:
![](248db1d0173d726b5947c0b764edca6d.png)

- Similarly,  a bond paying \$1 in 1.5 years ($i = 3$):
![](1c77a7b826dc7915f4f19f7bd70b9d76.png)

## RISK NEUTRAL TREES

- In addition,  computers can be programmed rather easily to carry out the backward computation.
![](6ca6b0c00ce70e2530e1ebf581f0ef15.png)

## CALIBRATION OF HO LEE MODEL

- Given data on interest rates,  I estimated a volatility$σ =0.022$
- Given data from *current* zero coupon bonds (STRIPS) as of May 25 2007,  we can compute iteratively θ(i) so that model prices equal actual prices for every i.
- In the example below,  I am only showing the model price for T = 5 bond.
![](ee690048ac68710cb1544510ad1acd5c.png)

## INTERMEDIATE CASH FLOWS

- Notice that given a tree,  we can insert any type of known cash flow. - Specifically,  at any time-node (*i,  j*),  we just must add the CF
$$P_{i, j}=e^{-r_{i, j}\Delta}\left(\frac{1}{2}P_{i+1, j}+\frac{1}{2}P_{i+1, j+1}+C F_{i+1}\right)$$
- So,  for example,  a 1.5 year,  4% coupon bond is just given by
![](3cc18b0dcddbeff077a5896cc1c8a280.png)
- This tree gives "ex-coupon" prices.
## EXAMPLE: CALLABLE BONDS
- Trees turn out to be very useful tools (not only pedagogically).
- One of the most important features of them is the ability to deal with "American options."
- As a consequence,  a very simple application of the "tree" methodology is the computation of prices of callable bonds.
- Consider the 1.5 year,  4% coupon bond we discussed earlier,  but assume it is callable at par
- That is,  at any point in time before maturity,  the issuer (Treasury) may "call it back" in exchange of 100.
- In general,  bonds become callable after some period of time.
- For example,  the Nov 2012 Treasury bond is callable at par starting on Nov 2007.
- If the issuer calls the bond between coupon days,  it has to pay the accrued interest to the bond holder.

## EXAMPLE: CALLABLE BONDS - HOW DO WE COMPUTE THE PRICE OF THE IMPLICIT AMERICAN OPTION?

- At any node (*i,  j*) the issuer can decide whether to "exercise" option or wait.
- If exercises,  the payoff (= value of the option) is
$$C a l l_{i, j}^{\mathrm{Ex}}=P_{i, j}-100$$
- If waits,  the value of the option
$$C a l l_{i, j}^{\mathrm{Wait}}~=~e^{-r_{i, j}\Delta}E^{*}\left[C a l_{i+1}\right]=e^{-r_{i, j}\Delta}\left(\frac{1}{2}C a l_{i+1, j}+\frac{1}{2}C a l_{i+1, j+1}\right)$$
- Therefore,  the value at node *i,  j* is
$$Call_{i, j}=\max\left(Call_{i, j}^{\rm Wait}, Call_{i, j}^{\rm Ex}\right)$$$$=\max\left(e^{-r_{i, j}\times\Delta}E^{*}\left[Call_{i+1}\right], P_{i, j}-100\right)$$

-  At maturity $I=T/\Delta$ we have $$Call_{I, j}=0\mbox{ for all }j$$

## EXAMPLE: CALLABLE BONDS
##### WHAT IS THEN THE PRICE OF THE CALLABLE BOND?
- The buyer of a callable bond is: (1) buying a non-callable bond; + (2) Selling a call to the issuer.
- Hence,
$$\begin{array}{l l l}{{P_{0}^{\mathbf{Call}}\left(3\right)}}&{{=}}&{{P_{0}^{\mathbf{NoCall}}\left(3\right)-C_{0}\left(3\right)}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{101.93-1.16}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{100.77}}\end{array}$$
