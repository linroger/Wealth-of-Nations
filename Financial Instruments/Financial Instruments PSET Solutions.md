## 1 Arbitrage and Forward Rates

**(1) According to the principle of no-arbitrage, what should be the one-year forward rate?**

**(2) Suppose that the one-year forward contract is currently trading at 1.15 per Euro. Is there an arbitrage opportunity? If so, explain in detail the trading you would like to do to exploit this arbitrage opportunity.**

### Solution to Problem 1: Arbitrage and Forward Rates

**(1) According to no-arbitrage the Forward Exchange rate is given by:**

$$
M_{0}\cdot e^{(r_{H}-r_{F})\cdot T}
$$

**where \(M_{0}\) is the spot exchange rate (number of units of the Home currency to buy 1 unit of the Foreign currency), \(r_{H}\) is the annualized continuously-compounded interest rate in the Home country, \(r_{F}\) is the annualized continuously-compounded interest rate in the Foreign country and \(T\) is the maturity we are interested in.**

**Here the home country is the US so that \(r_{H}=r_{\$} = 5\%\) and \(r_{F}=r_{e}=4.5\%\). Further \(M_{0}=1.2\) and \(T=1\). The forward rate should be:**

$$
F_{0,1}=M_{0}\cdot e^{(r_{\mathbb{S}}-r_{e})\cdot T}=1.2\cdot e^{5\%-4.5\%}=1.2060
$$

**(2) The traded value of the forward is 1.15 which is below the no-arbitrage value so there is an arbitrage trade to be made. We would like to “buy low” and “sell high.” In other words we would like to enter into the forward contract to buy Euros at 1.15 and synthetically sell them forward using the bond markets in the countries and the current exchange rate. Let’s suppose we want to do this the level of 100 Euros. Here are the trades:**

**Buy 100 million Euros forward which creates an obligation of \(\$100\cdot1.15=\) \$115 million at time 1 (one year).**

**We need to trade today so that we have (at least) the 115 million to deliver at time 1. To do this:**

**– Borrow \(100\cdot e^{-0.045}=95.5887\) Euros today.**
**– Convert the 95.5887 million Euros today to dollars: \(95.5887\times M_{0}=\) 114.7197 million dollars today and invest at the rate of 5% in continuously compounded units.**

**Notice that the trades in the current bond markets and foreign exchange market create the following cash flows at time 1:**

**– Euros owed at time 1:**

$$
95.5887\cdot e^{0.045}=100
$$

**which is covered by our receipt of 100 million Euros at time 1 under the forward contract.**

**– Dollars received at time 1:**

$$
114.7197\cdot e^{0.05}=120.6015\mathrm{milllion}
$$

**which is more than covers our obligation of \$115 million under the forward contract. The profit at time 1 is: \$120.6 million - \$115 million = \$5.6 million.**

## 2 Forward Rates and Covered Interest Rate Parity

**The Excel file DataHW 1 2024. Xls contains data on the /Euro exchange rate on the first business day of October of the years 2005 to 2009. In addition, it contains Forward Rate quotes, as well as US and EURO LIBOR rates.**

**Please, do the following:**

**(1) For each date, use the Forward Rate formula discussed in Teaching Note 2 to compute the Forward Exchange Rate. Please do so for all of the given maturities (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year). (Tip #1 : Note that LIBOR rates use linear compounding, while the formula in the teaching notes use continuous compounding. You will need the transformation like the one on page 14 of Teaching Note 2 to use the forward pricing formula we developed. Tip #2 : The log function in the notes on page 14 is the natural logarithm. To implement this in Excel you use the function $L N$ NOT the function $L O G$).**

**(2) Do your forward exchange rates match (approximately) the quoted ones?**

**(3) If not, pick one particular date in which the parity is violated, and describe the arbitrage strategy you would undertake.**

### Solution to Problem 2: Forward Rates and Covered Interest Rate Parity

**(1) As above, according to no-arbitrage the Forward Exchange rate is given by**

$$
M_{0}\cdot e^{(r_{H}-r_{F})\cdot T}
$$

**where \(M_{0}\) is the spot exchange rate (number of units of the Home currency to buy 1 unit of the Foreign currency), \(r_{H}\) is the annualized continuously-compounded interest rate in the Home country, \(r_{F}\) is the annualized continuously-compounded interest rate in the Foreign country and \(T\) is the maturity we are interested in. Before applying formula 2 we need to compute the continuously compounded LIBOR rates.**

**LIBOR rates use linear compounding, meaning that the \(x\)-months LIBOR is compounded \(\frac{12}{x}\) times in a year. In other words the 1-month LIBOR has a \(\frac{1}{12}=\) monthly compounding frequency, the 3-month LIBOR has a \(\frac{3}{12}=\frac{1}{4}=\) quarterly compounding frequency and so on. If we define with \(m\) to be the number of times interest is compounded in a year (according to what just said, \(m=\frac{12}{x}\)), to compute the equivalent continuously-compounded rate we use the equivalence**

$$
e^{r\cdot T}=\left(1+{\frac{r_{m}}{m}}\right)^{m\cdot T}
$$

**where \(r_{m}\) denotes an annualized interest rate compounded \(m\) times in \(^{1}\) year (e.g. \(r_{1}\) is the annualized monthly compounded rate, \(r_{4}\) is the annualized quarterly compounded rate and so on).**

**To get a formula for the continously compounded rate, we take natural logarithms in equation 3**

$$
l n\left(e^{r\cdot T}\right)=l n\left[\left(1+{\frac{r_{m}}{m}}\right)^{m\cdot T}\right]
$$

**then, knowing that \(l n (e^{x})=x\) and that \(l n (a^{x})=x\cdot l n (a)\)**

$$
r\cdot T=m\cdot T\cdot l n\left(1+{\frac{r_{m}}{m}}\right)
$$

**dividing both sides by \(T\) we finally get**

$$
r=m\cdot l n\left(1+{\frac{r_{m}}{m}}\right)
$$

**Applying formula 4 we can compute the continuously compounded US and EURO LIBOR rates. Results are shown in Table 1.**

**Using the above rates we apply formula 2 to compute Forward Exchange rates.**
**Results are provided in Table 2.**

**(Table 1: Continously compounded US and EURO LIBOR rates)**
**(Table 2: Forward Exchange rates)**

**(2) We compute the di\! Erence between the quoted and the computed Forward Exchange rates, which are reported in Table 3**

**If we exclude October 1 st 2008, the di\! Erence is smaller than \(10^{-3}\) in most of the cases. For October 1 st 2008 (15 days after Lehman failure) the di\! Erence is larger. To understand why this is so, think about how we determined formula 2 for the Forward Exchange rate. Our assumption was that we could set up a strategy which perfectly matches the cash flows of a short forward position in euros for dollars. The strategy requires borrowing in euros, exchanging euros into dollars and investing the money at the dollar interest rate. If market participants are worried about third party solvency borrowing may be much more di”cult, especially for longer maturities. If borrowing is more di”cult then arbitrageurs may experience have a time correcting market ine”ciencies and the result is quoted prices misaligned with the theoretical ones.**

**(Table 3: Di\! Erence between quoted and computed Forward Exchange rates)**

**(3) As we have seen that the biggest discrepancy occurs for October 1 st 2008. Let’s focus on that date and consider the 1 year Forward Exchange rate. As mentioned above the di\! Erence \(F^{quoted}-F^{computed}>0\), that is equivalent to \(F^{quoted}>F^{computed}\). The rule of thumb for arbitrage is to buy cheap and sell dear. This his means “buy computed” and “sell quoted.” The computed Forward Exchange rate is a synthetic price that we pay if we set-up a strategy that replicates the payo\! Of a forward contract, while the quoted Forward Exchange rate is what we obtain when entering into a forward position (just sign a contract, much easier than setting up a replicating strategy). We already know that we enter into a short forward contract to sell 1 euro for dollars (this is the “sell quoted” - we are selling euros and buying dollars; remember that with exchange rates we are long / short the Foreign currency). On the other side we have to set up a strategy that replicates the payo\! Of a long forward position to buy 1 euro for dollars. Let’s start by matching the payo\! S at maturity.**

**A long forward contract, at maturity, entails:**

**An outflow (we pay) of dollars**
**An inflow (we receive) of euros**

**To pay dollars tomorrow we simply borrow something in US. To receive euros tomorrow we have to invest something in Europe today. How much? Here we have to remember our goal. We are matching the cash flows of a forward contract, and a forward contract does not require any cash flow when we enter into it. As our strategy so far requires borrowing in dollars and investing in euros today, to get a cash flow equal to 0 we have to match the amount we borrow with the amount we invest, or in other words we have to invest in Europe the full amount borrowed in US. To do this we just need to exchange the dollars for euros today. The last thing we need to understand is how much to borrow in dollars today. As the forward exchange rate tells us “how many dollar we have to pay in exchange for 1 euro at maturity”, following our logic of matching the cash flows of a forward contract we want to borrow today (in dollars) a sum that will give us 1 euro tomorrow: that’s the very definition of present value.**

**Summing up, the “buy computed” strategy requires (please note that the amounts in the first and third rows are in di\! Erent currencies so they cannot be summed):**

**(Table 4: Summary of the synthetic long forward position)**

**Finally we can consider the cash flows from both the short position (again, short since we are selling euros) and the synthetic long (again, long since we are buying euros) forward position, which are reported in Table 5. Please note that the amount \(M_{T}\) is simply the value, in dollars, of 1 euro at time \(T\).**

**(Table 5: Cash flows from the arbitrage)**

**Applying the above formulas to our case the strategy becomes:**

**Short a forward contract to sell 1 euro for 1.3960 dollars in one year**
**Borrow \(e^{-0.0535}\) · \(1.4021=0.9479\cdot 1.4021=1.3290\) dollars today (October 1 st 2008)**
**Exchange 1.3290 dollars for euros obtaining 0.9479 euros**
**Invest 0.9479 euros at \(r_{e}=5.35\%\)**

**At maturity we will have**

**Pay 1 euro (from short forward position)**
**Receive 1.3960 dollars**
**Receive 1 euro (from long synthetic forward position)**
**Pay \(1.3290\cdot e^{0.0396}=1.3827\) dollars**

**The net cash flow will be a positive amount equal \(1.396\mathrm{~-~}1.3827\mathrm{~=~}0.0134\) dollars per euro traded. If we apply the same strategy on \$100 m, the arbitrage is supposed to generate a positive cash flow at maturity equal to \$1.337 m.**

## 3 Exploiting an Apparent Arbitrage Opportunity

**On Oct 1 2008 you spot a potential arbitrage opportunity in the foreign exchange market (see solution to HW 1). In particular, recall that the 1-year forward exchange rate USD/EUR seems too high to be justified by the current spot exchange rate and the LIBOR di\! Erential. You want to take advantage of the trade, and you set up an arbitrage trade. The data for this homework are in the excel file DataHW 2 2024. Xls**

**(1) Set up the arbitrage trade on Oct 1, 2008 for the 1-year forward. (Tip: Yes, this is the same solution as in HW #1 )**

**(2) After six months, on April 1, 2009, you decide to un-ravel the trade.**

**(a) Given the new market data (exchange rate and interest rates), is the value of the short forward position positive or negative? Given your answer, do we lose money or gain money on the short forward position? (Tip: Remember we are only looking at one part of the arbitrage trade, that is, only the short forward position. Note that after six months, the remaining horizon is only \(\mathit{\Delta}_{\mathit{6}}\) months. The data set contains all of the possible data, but you do not need to use all of them. In fact, you need to use a small part of them)**

**(b) Did you make any money in the trade? Explain. (Tip: You now need to also compute the value of the synthetic long forward. Recall that the synthetic long forward is made up of two pieces, a short leg (borrowing in dollars) and a long leg (investment in euros). To compute the value of the short leg, remember (see solution to HW 1) that you borrowed at time 0 the dollar amount \(\mathcal{S}\: M_{0}e^{-r_{e}\times T}\), where \(T=1\). That is, the dollar principal you will have to pay at maturity is \$1. The time t value of the short leg is therefore the present value of this principal amount, which changes over time as the LIBOR changes. Similarly, to compute the time \(t\) value of the long leg, remember that you will receive 1 EUR at \(T\) from the investment. The dollar value of such investment at time \(t\) is \(M_{t}e^{-r_{e}\times (T-t)}\), where \(M_{t}\) is the USD/EUR spot exchange rate. The value of the synthetic forward is then the sum of the short and long leg.)**

**(3) How would your answer to point 2 change if you unraveled the trade after 9 months, that is, on July 1, 2009 (i.e. 3 months before maturity)?**

### Solution to Problem 3: Exploiting an Apparent Arbitrage Opportunity

**(1) See Homework 1 solution.**

**(2) (a) We need to compute the value of the short forward position. When we unravel the trade, we sell our contract to another investor, who pays us an amount of money equal to the value of the contract.**

**We know that the time \(t\) value of a long forward exchange rate contract maturing at \(T\) is given by**

$$
f_{t,T}^{L o n g}=M_{t}\cdot e^{-r_{e}\cdot(T-t)}-K\cdot e^{-r_{\mathbb{S}}\cdot(T-t)}
$$

**where \(r_{e}\) and \(r_{\$}\) are the continuously compounded EURO-LIBOR and USLIBOR rates, with maturity \(T-t\), prevailing at time \(t\).**

**The value of a short forward contract is simply the opposite of the value of a long forward contract:**

$$
f_{t,T}^{S h o r t}=-f_{t,T}^{L o n g}=K\cdot e^{-r_{\mathbb{S}}\cdot(T-t)}-M_{t}\cdot e^{-r_{e}\cdot(T-t)}
$$

**Since we entered into the short contract on Oct 1 2008 and the contract maturity was 1 year, then on April 1 2009 (that is 6 months after contract inception) the residual maturity of the contract is 6 months, so in equation (1) the maturity will be equal to \(T-t=0.5\) (remember that our convention is to express time in years). We also know the forward price \(K\) we agreed to receive in exchange for 1 EUR at maturity. This is the forward price that was quoted on Oct 1 2008 for a contract with 1 year maturity. Looking at the data we can then write \(K=1.39603\).**

**The spot exchange rate on April 1 2009 is \(M_{t}=1.32325\). Since the residual maturity of the contract is 6 months, we take the 6 M EURO LIBOR and the 6 M US LIBOR prevailing on April 1 2009, that are \(6 M E U R L I B O R=0.0165938=1.66\%\) and \(6 M U S L I B O R=0.0171625=1.72\%\). Before applying formula (1) we need to convert the two rates into continuous compounding. To compute the equivalent annualized continuously compounded rates we use the formula:**

$$
r=2\cdot l n\left(1+{\frac{r_{2}}{2}}\right)
$$

**yielding \(r_{\$}=1.71\%\) and \(r_{e}=1.65\%\). Using equation (1).**

$$
f_{A p r0109,0.5}^{S h o r t}=1.39603\cdot e^{-0.0171\cdot0.5}-1.32325\cdot e^{-0.0165\cdot0.5}=0.0718U S D
$$

**An alternative way of computing \(f_{A p r 0109,0.5}^{S h o r t}\) would have been**

$$
\begin{array}{l c l}{{f_{A p r0109,0.5}^{S h o r t}}}&{{=}}&{{\left[F_{0,T}-F_{0.5,1}\right]\cdot e^{-r_{\bar{\$}} \cdot\left(T-t\right)}}}\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{\left[1.39603-1.32425\right]\cdot e^{-0.0171\cdot0.5}=0.0712U S D}}\end{array}
$$

**Formula (1) and (2) do not produce the same result as \(F_{0.5,1}^{Q u o t e d}\neq M_{0.5}\) · e (r\$→re)·(0.5) on April 01 2009.**

**Given that \(f_{A p r 0109,0.5}^{S h o r t}>0\), we are making money on the position. Think about it intuitively. On Oct 1 2008 the spot USD/EUR exchange rate (that is the price in USD of 1 EUR), was \(U S D/E U R=1.4021\). On April 1 2009 instead the spot exchange rate was \(U S D/E U R=1.32325\). This means that the dollar appreciated relative to the euro (or conversely that the euro depreciated relative to the dollar), so to buy 1 euro on the market on April 1 2009 we needed fewer dollars than we needed on Oct 1 2008. By signing the contract on Oct 1 2008, we locked in a more favorable price, therefore the value of our short forward contract, on April 1 2009, is positive.**

**(b) To understand if we made money on the trade we need to consider our entire portfolio. We have considered the short forward in point (2. A), so we only need to consider the value of the synthetic long forward. Remember that our synthetic forward position consisted of:**

**A short leg, that is a loan in USD, as we borrowed in USD the present value (present value at that time) of 1 EUR**
**A long leg, that is an investment in EUR, as we invested the present value (still, present value at that time) of 1 EUR**

**To value both legs we will first compute the cash flow at maturity (that is on Oct 1 2009) and then we will discount it to today (that is Apr 1 2009). For the short leg, remember that we borrowed \(M_{O c t 0108}\cdot e^{-r_{e}(O c t 0108,1 y e a r)}=1.4021\) \(e^{-0.0535}=1.3290\) USD. As we have to pay the 1 Y US LIBOR (prevailing on Oct 1 2008) on such loan, we are expected to pay at maturity 1.3290 · er\$(Oct 01 08, 1 year) = 1.3290 · e 0.0396 = 1.3827.**

**Since we know how much we have to pay on Oct 1 2009 for the loan, to calculate the value of the short leg we need to compute the present value (on April 1 2009) of the amount just calculated (\(F^{c}\)). The value of the short leg is:**

$$
V^{S h o r t L e g}=-C F_{O c t109}^{L o a n}\cdot e^{r_{\mathrm{{s}}}\cdot0.5}=-1.3827\cdot e^{-0.0171\cdot0.5}=-1.3709
$$

**where we have put a minus sign in front as it is a short position (we have to pay this amount).**

**To compute the value of the long leg remember that we will receive 1 EUR on Oct 1 2009, that is 6 months from now. The today (April 1 2009) present value (in EUR) of 1 EUR in 6 months is \(e^{-r_{e}\cdot 0.5}\), where \(r_{e}\) is the annualized continuously compounded 6 M EURO LIBOR prevailing today. The present value (in EUR) today of 1 EUR in 6 months is \(e^{-0.0165\cdot 0.5}=0.9918\) EUR. To determine the value of the long leg we need to find the equivalent dollar value of the amount just computed. To do this, we simply multiply by the current spot USD /EUR exchange rate \(M_{A p r 0109}=1.32325\), so the value of the long leg is**

$$
V^{L o n g L e g}=e^{-0.0165\cdot0.5}\cdot M_{A p r0109}=0.9918\cdot1.32325=1.3124
$$

**Two more steps and we are done. Knowing the value of both the long and the short leg of the long synthetic forward we can compute its value. We will have**

$$
V_{A p r0109,0.5}^{S y n t h,L o n g}=V^{L o n g L e g}+V^{S h o r t L e g}=1.3124-1.3709=-0.05857
$$

**As expected we are loosing money on the synthetic forward. The reasoning is the same as above. Since the dollar has appreciated relative to the euro and since we agreed (on Oct 1 2008) to “synthetically pay”, on Oct 1 2009, 1.3827 USD for 1 EUR, (while the price today of 1 EUR is just 1.32325), we are losing money on our synthetic long forward position.**

**To see whether we have made money from the entire trade we simply compute the value of our portfolio, that is the value of the short forward plus the value of the synthetic long forward. Using the result from formula (1) we have**

$$
V_{A p r0109}^{P o r t f o l i o}=f_{A p r0109,0.5}^{S h o r t}+V_{A p r0109,0.5}^{S y n t h,L o n g}=0.0718-0.0586=0.0132U S D
$$

**If we use instead the result of formula (2) we get \(V_{A p r 0109}^{P o r t f o l i o}=0.0126 U S D\).**
**Since \(V_{A p r 0109}^{P o r t f o l i o}>0\) we have made money from the trade.**

**(3) Using the same logic as above, using formula (1) we find \(V_{J u l 0109}^{P o r t f o l i o}=0.0133>0\) Using instead formula (2) we get V JPuol r 0 t 1 f 0 o 9 lio = 0.0116 > 0. Again the di\! Erence arises from the fact that \(F_{0.75,1}^{Q u o t e d}\neq M_{0.75}\cdot e^{(r_{\upbeta}-r_{e})\cdot (0.25)}\) on July 01 2009.**

## 4 Commodity Futures

**Consider an oil futures contract at time 0 with delivery \(T\). Let \(S_{0}\) be the spot oil price, \(r\) the continuously compounded interest rate, and \(u\) the storage cost in percentage of the oil price (i.e. the storage cost between \(t\) and \(t+d t\) is \(U_{t}=u\times S_{t}\times d t\). This is like a negative dividend yield for stocks \(u=-q\)).**

**Question: Does the no arbitrage relation**

$$
F_{0,T}=S_{t}e^{(r+u)T}
$$

**necessarily hold?**

**– Try the alternatives \(F_{0, T}<S_{t}e^{(r+u)T}\) and \(F_{0,T}>S_{t}e^{(r+u) T}\) and see whether it is feasible to carry out the strategy.**

### Solution to Problem 4: Commodity Futures

**Let’s consider the two cases:**

**When \(F_{0, T}>S_{t}\cdot e^{(r+u)\cdot T}\), applying the motto “sell dear and buy cheap” we could set up the following strategy:**

**– Enter into a short forward position to sell 1 unit of the underlying (let’s say a barrel of oil)**

**$-$ Buy \(e^{u}\) barrels of oil today at a price per unit of \(S_{t}\)**
**$-$ Borrow the amount needed to buy \(e^{u}\) barrels of oil, in order to have a zero cash flow today**

**(Table 1 reports the cash flows from the strategy)**

**Note that at time \(T\) we get only 1 barrel of oil as we are continuously paying the continuously compounded storage cost \(u\), so at maturity we will have \(\left (S\cdot e^{u}\right)\cdot e^{-u}=\) \(S\).**

**When \(F_{0, T}<S\cdot e^{(r+u)}\) we should instead:**

**– Enter into a long forward position to buy 1 barrel of oil**
**– Short sell \(e^{u}\) barrels of oil today at a price per unit of \(S_{t}\)**
**– Invest the proceeds from short selling, in order to have a zero cash flow**

**Here it is important to focus on the second step of the strategy just described. A short sale requires to borrow the asset, sell it on the market with the agreement to purchase it back at the future date and to give it back to the lender. Short selling works well when the asset we want to short sell is a financial asset. Indeed we can argue that there will be a significant number of agents that hold the asset for investment purposes, and therefore they will be willing to lend the asset. In addition when such investors will spot \(F_{0, T}<S\cdot e^{(r+u)}\), they will sell \(S\) and buy forward to benefit from the arbitrage.**

**With commodities, though, this does not always happen. As we said in class, commodities are typically held by agents who use them. Oil can be used to produce fuel and to run a refinery. . If the majority of investors then hold the commodity for non-investment reasons, then the relationship \(F_{0, T}<S\cdot e^{(r+u)}\) can actually occur in the market. Why don’t they take the arbitrage profit anyway? The idea is that the arbitrage available on the market matches the benefit from holding the commodity, so commodity holders do not exploit it. A common practice is to compute such holding benefit implicit in market prices. We define convenience yield the continuously compounded yield \(y\) such that**

$$
F_{0, T}=S\cdot e^{(r+u-y)}
$$

**You can think about it as an implicit dividend on the commodity.**

## 5 Hedging with Futures: Southwest jet fuel hedge

**When oil skyrocketed between mid 2006 and 2008 airline companies increased their use of commodity derivatives to reduce their exposure to raising jet fuel prices. The following example shows in a simplified fashion the e\! Ect of fuel hedging for Southwest.**

**On Dec 31 st 2007 the COO of Southwest comes out with an estimate of expected fuel consumption for year 2008 of 1,511 million of gallons. On the same day the market price of jet fuel per gallon is 2.71. On Dec 31 st 2006 Southwest held positions in derivative contracts su”cient to hedge 100% of its forecasted fuel need in Q 1 2007. Given the steep increase in oil (and jet fuel) prices during 2007, the company opted to reduce the hedge to 75% of its expected fuel consumption over Q 1 2008.**

**To set up the hedge, the CFO decides to utilize NYMEX Crude Oil futures. Crude Oil Futures trade in units of 1,000 U.S. barrels (42,000 gallons), and they are available for maturities of 30 consecutive months\(^{1}\). In addition trading of such instruments terminates at the close of business on the third business day prior to the 25 th calendar day of the month preceding the delivery month.**

**Table 1 provides the list of FEB. 08, MAR. 08 and APR. 08 as of Dec 31 st 2007.**

**(Table 1. Crude oil Future prices on Dec 31 st 2007)**

**Knowing that the expected continuously compounded interest rate was 0% for year 2008,**

**(1) What strategy would you suggest to the CFO to best hedge the expected fuel consumption for Q 1 2008 using the three contracts listed above? (Tip: You can assume that fuel consumption and purchase occurs on the last futures contract trading date of each month (e.g. fuel needed for January is purchased and consumed on Jan 22 2008) and that fuel consumption is uniform across months.)**

**On March 22 nd 2008 the CFO wants to assess the hedging e\! Ectiveness of the adopted strategy. The excel file DataHW 2 2024. Xls provides daily data on the future prices of FEB. 08, MAR. 08 and APR. 08 contracts until their last trading date, as well as the jet fuel prices during the same period.**

**(2) What is the P&L of the hedging strategy? Was the hedging beneficial? To assess it, compute the jet-fuel price that Southwest would implicitly pay in Jan, Feb, and Mar 2008 and compare it to the actual prices. (Tips: (i) Don’t forget the size of each contract and the fact that each barrel contains 42 gallons. (ii) The implicit jet fuel price is the e\! Ective price per gallon that Southwest pays, given the total gains/losses from the future positions.)**

**(3) How would your result to point 2 change if the CFO had decided to keep the same 100% hedging strategy that was in force up to Dec 2007?**

**(4) Compute the correlation between changes in jet fuel price and changes in Apr 08 futures prices. Is the correlation one? If not, can you provide an explanation? Think of at least two reasons why the correlation between jet fuel prices and oil futures may di\! Erent from 1. (Tip: Think about your result from the exercise 2 “Commodity Futures” above)**

**On June 30 th 2008, the CFO is asked to set up a similar strategy for the next three months. Table 2 provides the list of relevant future contracts and their prices on June 30 th.**

**(Table 2. Crude oil Future prices on June 30 th 2008)**

**(5) Using the data contained in the Excel file DataHW 2. Xls compute the P&L of the hedging strategy between June 30 th and September 22 nd. Was the hedging beneficial? Compute again the implicit jet fuel prices and comment on the e\! Ectiveness of the hedging strategy. In doing so, please compare this result with the performance of the hedging strategy in point 2 above.**

### Solution to Problem 5: Hedging with Futures – Southwest Jet Fuel Hedge

**(1) Since Southwest has to consume jet fuel in the future, it has an implicit short position on jet fuel. Indeed if jet fuel price rise, then Southwest will lose money, as it has to pay more for the same amount of jet fuel; in the same way, if jet fuel price falls, Southwest will gain money. Figure (1) shows the payo\! Per gallon at \(T\) of the implicit short position on Jet fuel. Note for example that, since \(S_{0}=2.71\), if \(S_{T}=0\), then the payo\! Per gallon would be \(S_{0}-S_{T}=2.71\), that is Southwest could buy 1 gallon of jet fuel for free, saving USD 2.71 if compared to what it would have paid today, that is at \(t=0\).**

**(Given this short position on fuel, we suggest that the CFO buy oil futures to o\! Set such short position. But how many futures? For how long? In order to answer to these questions we first need to know:)**

**How much fuel do we expect to consume?**
**How much fuel do we want to hedge?**
**What is the relationship between fuel prices and oil futures prices?**
**What is the size of an oil futures contract?**
**When is fuel consumed?**

#### How much fuel we expect to consume

**This was the easiest part. The hedging period was Q 1 2008, which means three months. We know that the expected fuel consumption for the entire year 2008 is \(E[F C_{2008}^{y e a r}]=1,511,000,000\) gallons. We are told to assume that fuel consumption is uniform across months, so the monthly expected fuel consumption (equal by assumption for January, February and March) is E #F C 2 m 0 o 08 nth\$ \(\begin{array}{r}{E\left[F C_{2008}^{m o n t h}\right]=\frac{E\left[F C_{2008}^{y e a r}\right]}{12}=}\end{array}\) 125, 916, 667 gallons.**

#### How much do fuel we want to hedge?

**We are also told that the company opted to hedge only 75% of expected fuel consumption, therefore, for each month we want to hedge our short position on \(E\left[F C_{2008}^{m o n t h}\right]\cdot 0.75=94,437,500\) gallons of jet fuel.**

#### What is the relationship between fuel prices and oil futures prices?

**This was the most fun part. The reason why we have to know this information is that we are hedging jet fuel consumption with oil futures. Even though they are from the same family they are not exactly the same. So when we buy a futures on oil to hedge fuel consumption, our goal is not to physically receive the oil at maturity and to consume it, but rather to invest on an asset that would generate a P&L o\! Setting the gains/losses we experience on jet fuel.**

**Since the two products are di\! Erent, their supply and demand is not the same, it is very likely that their prices will behave di\! Erently. How much di\! Erently? We don’t know exactly, but we can make some approximation. One practice used in the industry is to regress the change in jet fuel price on the change in (the nearest term) oil futures price. If we do this between January 2000 and June 2004 (See McDonald book, Section 6.12) we obtain that a change in oil futures price of $1\$1$ is likely to generate a change in jet fuel price of 2 cents per gallon.**

**You were not required to run such regression, but you should have understood that the two assets are di\! Erent and therefore some assumption was needed to set up the hedge. Indeed one very simple (and unrealistic) assumption that could have been made was: “the dollar change in jet fuel price exactly matches the dollar change of oil futures price”.**

**Another assumption that could have been made was: “the percentage change in jet fuel price exactly matches the percentage change of oil futures price.” Under this assumption, you could have estimated the hedge ratio (number of oil barrels per barrel of fuel) as follows:**

**Let’s consider the FEB. 08 contract:**

**- On Dec 31 st 2007, the FEB. 08 contract price per barrel was USD 95.98.**
**- On the same day, the spot price of fuel per barrel was USD \(S_{t}^{b a r r e l}=2.71\cdot 42=\) 113.69 (remember that a barrel contains 42 gallons).**
**- A USD 1 change of FEB. 08 price per barrel would have resulted in a percentage increase of \(\begin{array}{r}{\triangle\mathcal{J}_{0}(F^{F E B: 08})=\frac{96.98-95.98}{95.98}=1.04\%}\end{array}\).**
**- Applying the same percentage change to fuel (this is our assumption), the expected fuel price change would have been**

$$
\bigtriangleup\mathcal{J}_{0}(F^{F E B.08})\cdot S_{t}^{b a r r e l}=1.04\%\cdot 113.69=1.1846
$$

**Our goal is to take a position in oil futures such that, if jet fuel price per barrel changes by $1, the oil futures position changes exactly by the same amount, that is USD 1 per barrel (forget about contract size for a moment). Since buying futures on 1 barrel of oil is asked to hedge against a change of USD 1.1846 per barrel in jet fuel price, under the assumption of equal percentage changes, buying 1 futures contract would have under-hedged the position. To match the price change we would have needed to buy 1.1846 oil futures. Let’s double check:**

**- If we buy 1.1846 FEB. 08 futures contracts (again forget about contract size), and the price of FEB. 08 oil changes by USD 1, the value of the position changes by USD \(1\cdot 1.1846=1.1846\), that is exactly the same as the expected (under our assumption) dollar price change of jet fuel per barrel.**

**We could have increased the level of sophistication of our assumption even further. For example we could have calculated ratio (3) every day . . . . The point of the exercise was to understand that hedging fuel with oil requires some assumption.**

#### What is the size of an oil futures contract?

**In the directions. One futures on crude oil trades for 1,000 barrels of oil.**

#### When is fuel consumed?

**This information is important to understand when we have to close the hedge. As said in the direction we could have assumed that consumption would have occurred on the last date of trading of the nearest futures contract (e.g. fuel consumption for January 2008 would have occurred on the last date of trading of FEB. 08 contract, that is January 22 nd 2008).**

**Back to the answer of question (1), we will go for the simplest assumption. Therefore we (unrealistically) assume that “the dollar change in jet fuel price exactly matches the dollar change of oil futures price”. Under this assumption, denoting by \(s\) the size of a futures contract, the quantity \(Q^{f u t u r e s}\) of futures to be bought, for each month is**

$$
Q^{f u t u r e s}=\frac{E\left[F C_{2008}^{m o n t h}\right]\cdot 0.75}{s\cdot\frac{g a l l o n s}{b a r r e l}}=\frac{94,437,500}{1,000\cdot 42}=2,248.51
$$

**Given the assumptions on fuel consumption, we would have suggested the CFO to hold the position in each futures contract up to last trading day of each contract.**

**(2) The cumulative P&L from the hedge is USD 18,145,491. Table (2) reports its breakdown per contract. The cumulative P&L for each contract is computed as**

$$
P\&L^{c u m u l a t i v e}=\sum_{t=J a n 01}^{M a r 19}P\&L_{t}^{d a i l y}
$$

**and**

$$
P\&L_{t}^{d a i l y}=\left (F_{t}-F_{t-1}\right)\cdot Q^{f u t u r e s}\cdot s
$$

**where \(F_{t}\) is the futures price per barrel on day \(t\).**

**(Table 2: Cumulative P&L of the hedge assuming 75% hedging of fuel consumption)**

**To assess whether the hedging strategy has been beneficial, we need to compute the implicit jet fuel price that Soutwest pays each month for the hedged fuel. What is the implicit jet fuel price? Is the average price per gallon that Southwest pays after taking into account the gain/loss from the futues position. Another way to look at it is that the implicit price is the fuel price that we could have locked at time 0 and that would have generated the same payo\! (given the change in spot price of juet fuel) as the futures position. To compute it we have to solve a simple equation. For each month \(j\)**

$$
S^{*, j}\cdot Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}=S_{T, j}\cdot Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}-P\&L^{j}
$$

**where \(S^{*, j}\) is the implicit jet fuel price paid for month \(j\), \(S_{T, j}\) is the jet fuel price per gallon on each consumption date and \(Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}\) is the amount of fuel hedged in month \(j\). Solving for \(S^{*}\) we get**

$$
S^{*, j}=S_{T, j}-\frac{P\&L^{j}}{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}
$$

**Applying equation (4) to our case we get the results shown in the first column of Table (3). Comparing the implicit prices with the actual price occurring at each consumption date (i.e. January 22 nd, February 20 th and March 19 th) we can assess the e\! Ectiveness of the hedge. In particular when \(S^{*}\) is greater than \(S_{T}\), the hedge has not been e\! Ective, as we have paid more than what we would have paid in the market.**

**(Table 3: Implicit vs. Actual fuel prices assuming 75% hedge of fuel consumption)**

**Table (3) tells us that we e\! Ectively paid less than market prices per gallon in February and in March. This led us to an overall gain of 18,145,491. But was that enough to cover the implicit short position on jet fuel depicted in Figure 1? To understand this we can compare the payo\! From the short position with the payo\! From the oil futures position, for each month. Table (4) reports the results.**

**(Table 4: Payo\! From implicit short position vs. Payo\! From oil futures)**

**Multiplying the net payo\! For the quantity hedged we get a loss approximately equal to USD 30.6 million. This tells us that the hedge has not been perfectly e\! Ective. Despite generating a positive P&L, it has not fully o\! Set the short position on jet fuel. The reason of this discrepancy is due to the fact that our assumption about changes in oil futures prices and changes in jet fuel price was not correct.**

**(3) In this case we would get a P&L equal to:**

**(Table 5: Cumulative P&L of the hedge assuming 100% hedging of fuel consumption)**

**The important thing to note here is that the implicit prices are the same as above. If we look at the formula**

$$
S^{*, j}=S_{T, j}-\frac{P\&L^{j}}{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}
$$

**we immediately see why. Indeed the actual price does not change \(S_{T, j}\) and the ratio \(\frac{P\&L^{j}}{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}\) remains constant. The reason why it happens is because the daily P&L was computed as**

$$
P\&L_{t}^{d a i l y}=(F_{t}-F_{t-1})\cdot Q^{f u t u r e s}\cdot s=(F_{t}-F_{t-1})\cdot\left[\frac{E\left[F C_{2008}^{m o n t h}\right]\cdot 0.75}{s\cdot\frac{g a l l o n s}{b a r r e l}}\right]\cdot s
$$

**which, simplifying becomes**

$$
P\&L_{t}^{d a i l y}=(F_{t}-F_{t-1})\cdot\left[\frac{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}{\frac{g a l l o n s}{b a r r e l}}\right]
$$

**where we have exploited the fact that we hedge an amount which is equal to the expected fuel consumption. Remembering that \(\begin{array}{r}{P\&L_{t}^{d a i l y}=(F_{T}-F_{0})\cdot\left[\frac{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}{\frac{g a l l o n s}{b a r r e l}}\right]}\end{array}\) we can therefore write:**

$$
S^{*, j}=S_{T, j}-\frac{\left[\frac{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}} {{g a l l o n s}} \right]\cdot\left (F_{T}-F_{0}\right)}{Q^{f u e l h e d g e d, j}}=S_{T, j}-\frac{\left (F_{T}-F_{0}\right)}{42}
$$

**which proves that the implicit price does not depend on the quantity hedged, but only on the actual price and on the change of the futures price. Last, hedging 100% of consumption, the hedge would have been even less e\! Ective, as we would have lost USD 40.8 million.**

**(4) The correlation between the dollar changes in jet fuel price and the dollar changes in the price of the APR. 08 contract between December 31 st 2007 and March 19 th 2008 is \(\rho=0.8791\). As mentioned above the correlation is di\! Erent from 1 because demand and supply for the two assets is di\! Erent. For example fuel is a commodity held for use, while a future contract is just a financial instrument and as such is bought and sold also by investors rather than simply by users. Another reason why the correlation is not 1 is that there are other factors a\! Ecting the prices, like regulation and fiscal policies.**

**(5) The P&L of the hedge between June 30 th 2008 and Sep 22 nd 2008 is reported in Table (6) and is very very negative.**

**(Table 6: Cumulative P&L of the hedge assuming 100% hedging of fuel consumption)**

**(Table 7) shows the implicit jet fuel prices.**

**(Table 7: Implicit vs. Actual fuel prices assuming 100% hedge of fuel consumption)**

**Despite the very negative payo\! On the future position, we end up having a positive result of hedging. Indeed if we sum the payo\! From the implicit short position in fuel (\$ 222.3 million) with the P&L of the long position in futures (\$ 172.9 million) we see that we still have a positive number (\$ 49.4 million).**

**A final remark. The fact that the total payo\! Is positive does not mean that we are better o\! Doing the hedge. The hedge consumes most of the benefit Southwest get from the price drop. Overall though, compared to buying fuel (assuming no storage costs) on June 30 th, Soutwest is still better o\! , despite the huge loss on futures.**

## BONUS QUESTION (i, e, not required): Speculating with Futures: Amaranth calendar spread trade

**Amaranth Advisors L.L.C. was a hedge fund that, as of Sep 2006, massively invested in energy derivatives. The fund held very large positions in natural gas futures. The trades consisted mainly of buying and selling natural gas futures contracts with a variety of maturity dates, setting up what is called a calendar spread.**

**The fund had positions on most of the futures contracts available, covering almost every month between September 2006 and December 2011. We will consider the positions in two of these many contracts\(^{2}\) to get a practical understanding of what happened in Sep 2006.**

**Suppose that, as of Aug 31 st 2006 Amaranth book was as follows:**

**(Table 1. Amaranth simplified portfolio on Aug 31 st 2006)**

**The Excel file DataHW 2 2924. Xls contains daily futures prices of the two contracts between Aug 31 st 2006 and Sep 21 st 2006. The prices are per MMBtu (millions of British Thermal Unites). A contract is for 10,000 MMBtu.**

**Using these prices, compute:**

**(1) The daily and cumulative P&L from the strategy**
**(2) The value of the portfolio between Aug 31 st and Sep 21 st 2006, assuming that the portfolio was initiated on Aug 31 st 2006**
**(3) The cumulative cash required by the strategy, knowing that NYMEX requires 5,400 initial margin and 2,700 maintenance margin per contract and assuming that the cash in excess of the initial margin (if any) is daily withdrawn from the account.**

### Solution to BONUS QUESTION (i, e, not required): Speculating with Futures: Amaranth calendar spread trade

**(1) The first thing we have to consider is the contract size. The directions provided the price for MMBtu (millions of British Thermal Units, a unit of measure for gas). This is the way in which prices are quoted for most futures contracts (for example oil futures are quoted in price per barrel). However, for ease of use each futures contract applies to more than 1 unit of underlying (in this case MMBtu). The number of units of underlying is the size of the futures contract. In our case, the size of 1 Natural Gas futures contract is 10,000 MMBtu.**

**The P&L is the profit (or loss) that the holder of a future position experiences due to marking-to-market of the position. At the end of each trading day \(t\) the contract is settled and the di\! Erence \(F_{t}-F_{t-1}\) is computed. To obtain the daily P&L of the position we have to multiply this di\! Erence by the contract size and by the number of contracts held, that is**

$$
P\&L=\left (F_{t}-F_{t-1}\right)\cdot s i z e\cdot N
$$

**Note that the number of contracts can be either positive or negative, depending whether we hold respectively a long or a short position. Applying 5 to the data provided we obtain the P&L reported in Table 8. Note that as the price provided are closing prices, on Aug 31 st there is no P&L, as the closing price for August 30 th was not provided. Note also that the P&L of the portfolio is equal to the sum of the P&L of the two positions. The total P&L for a single contract is given by \(F_{T}-F_{0}\), which is also equal to**

$$
F_{T}-F_{0}=F_{T}-F_{T-1}+F_{T-1}+...-F_{1}+F_{1}-F_{0}
$$

**therefore, to compute the cumulative P&L we can sum all the daily P&Ls. In our case the cumulative P&L is equal to - \$ 401,013,200.**

**(Table 8: Daily and cumulative P&L of Amaranth strategy)**

**(2) The value of a portfolio of futures is the sum of the value of the long positions plus the short positions. When market closes, the value of a futures contract is equal to its daily P&L. This happens because futures contracts are settled daily, so past P&L are added/deducted to/from the Margin account. Therefore the value of a portfolio of futures contracts is equal to the daily P&L of the portfolio (in our case, last column in Table 8).**

**Alternatively we can always say that the value of a futures contract (and therefore of a portfolio of futures contract) is 0 after settlement has taken place.**

**(3) To determine the cash required by the strategy we have to understand how the margining system works. When we enter into a forward contract we are asked to post some collateral in a margin account. The amount of collateral is called initial margin. Since for natural gas futures the initial margin is equal to \$5, 400 per contract, when, for example, we enter into 59,247 long futures position we need to inject \$5,400 · 59, 247 = \$319, 933, 800 of cash in the margin account. The same applies for short positions. When we short 77,527 futures contracts, we need to post \$5, 400 · 59, 247 = \$418, 645, 800 in the margin account.**

**Every day, at settlement an amount of cash equal to the P&L is added (deducted if we experience a daily loss). When the margin account reaches a value lower than a threshold amount called maintenance margin (equal to \$2, 700 for natural gas futures) a margin call is issued and additional cash has to be posted to restore the maintenance margin. If instead the position generates cash, when the account balance grows above the initial margin, the contract holder can withdraw cash up to amount that will leave an account balance equal to the initial margin.**

**Applying this logic, table 9 reports the dynamics of the two margin accounts for Amaranth. Column 2 and 5 report the balance of the two accounts. The day \(t\) account balance, denoted by \(A B_{t}\) is computed as \(A B_{t}=A B_{t-1}+P\&L_{t}+C I_{t}\) where \(P\&L_{t}\) represents the daily profit and loss of the position and \(C I_{t}\) is the cash injected or withdrawn (if any). Column 3 and 6 are designed to denote when a margin call is issued. If it is the case, additional cash has to be injected. Such cash is reported in columns 4 and 7, whose total is computed in column 8.**

**To compute the cumulative cash required we have to consider the di\! Erence between the cash-flows and the remaining account balances. Thus we will have:**

**\$1, 473, 472, 890 → \$159, 966, 900 = \$1, 313505, 990 for the long futures positions**
**→\$493, 846, 990 → \$418, 645, 800 = →\$912, 492, 790 for the short positions.**
**Note that the negative amount of cash denotes a positive cash flow.**

**The total cash required is therefore \$1, 313505, 990 \$912, 492, 790 = \$401, 013, 200 which, not surprisingly is equal to the cumulative P&L.**

**(Table 9: Computation of cash required by Amaranth strategy)**

## 1 Greece Currency Swaps

**On June 1 st 2001 Greece issued a 10 year dollar denominated note for a value of USD 50 billion and a semi-annual coupon rate \(c=6\%\) Hint: The bond pays semiannual coupons in the amount of USD \((6\%/2)\times 50\) billion $=$ USD 1.5 billion along with the face value of USD 50 billion at maturity.**

**Issuing debt denominated in a foreign currency is common. There are few reasons why this happens: a country might need to make payments in a foreign currency or foreign investors’ appetites for diversification allows the country to issue at more favorable conditions. In this example we will assume that Greece has obtained more favorable conditions issuing in US dollars and the money will be used for domestic operations. At issuance Greece therefore has to convert into Euros any US dollars obtained from the note. To make the payments (semi-annual coupons and principal) to the investors that purchased the note, Greece must to convert Euros into US dollars at coupon dates and at maturity. This exposes the country to exchange rate risk. In particular if the US dollar appreciates, Greece will have to use more Euros to get an amount equal to the US dollar value of coupons and principal.**

**The Greek Finance Minister contacts VeroTende Investment Bank to ask about how to hedge the position, and the bank suggests a currency swap. The swap will require an initial transfer of principal, in which Greece will pay USD (US dollar) 50 billion and receive EUR (Euro) 59 billion at initiation of the contract. Every six months after that Greece will receive USD 1.5 billion in exchange for a fixed payment in EUR. At maturity Greece will pay 59 billion EUR and receive 50 billion USD.**

**(Table 1. Greek and US ZCB prices on June 1 st 2001)**

**Hint: to use these number consider the value of the value (in dollars) of a dollar denominated bond with annualized coupon rate of \(c\) and face value \(N\). This value is given by:**

$$
\boldsymbol{B}_{0}^{\mathbb{S}}=\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}\frac{c}{2}\cdot\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathbb{S}}\cdot\boldsymbol{Z}^{\mathbb{S}}(0, t)+\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathbb{S}}\cdot\boldsymbol{Z}^{\mathbb{S}}(0, T)
$$

**(1) Using the data above, and knowing that the USD/EUR spot exchange rate on June 1 st 2001 is equal to 0.8475 USD/EUR (=50/59 USD/EUR), compute the swap rate (i.e. the annualized coupon rate for the semi-annual payments in EUR) that sets the value of the currency swap to 0 at initiation of the contract.**

**The VeroTende Bank executives meet Greek o\! Cials, describe the currency swap and quote the rate calculated in point (1). To their surprise, the Greek Finance Minister explains that they have decided to be advised by another bank. They shake hands and the finance Minister leaves.**

**Some rumors say that Goldman Sachs has set up a currency swap with structured as above, but with two minor di”erences:\(^{1}\)**

**a) For the exchange of principal at time \(t=0\) the exchange rate utilized is not the market spot rate (i.e. 0.8475 USD / EUR), but rather the historical average of the spot exchange rate between March 12 th 2001 and June 1 st 2001, that is 0.8148 USD / EUR;**

**b) The rate quoted for the payments in euro is 7.00%**
**(2) Compute the value of the Goldman swap. Why do you think Greece has decided to accept Goldman proposal rather than the one suggested by VeroTende Bank? In answering the question give particular thought to the cash flows of the swap and their timing.**

### Solution to Problem 1: Greece Currency Swaps

**(1) To understand how we can compute the swap rate \(K\) that sets the value of the currency swap equal to 0, it is helpful to break down the currency swap into simpler components. We know that Greece will have:**

**1. A position in USD:**

**(a) Pay USD 50 billion on June 1 st 2001 (from now on: \(t=0\))**
**(b) Receive USD 50 · 0.206 \(50\cdot{\frac{0.06}{2}}=1.5\) billon every six months for the next 10 years**
**(c) Receive USD 50 billion n on June 1 st 2011 (from now on: \(t=T\))**

**2. A position in EUR:**

**(a) Receive 0.8475 U USSDD 5 /0 EUR = EU R 59 billon at t = 0**
**(b) Pay EUR \(59\cdot{\frac{K}{2}}\) billon every six months for the next 10 years**
**(c) Pay EUR 59 billion at \(t=T\)**

**Now it’s easy to see that (1. B) and (1. C) are the cash flows of a long position in (i.e. we buy) a coupon bond with principal equal to USD 50 billon, maturing in 10 years and with a semiannual coupon rate equal to \(c=6\%\). In the same way (2. B) and (2. C) are the cash flows of a short position in (i.e. we sell) a coupon bond with principal equal to EUR 59 bn, maturing in 10 years and with a semiannual coupon rate equal to \(K\). Finally (1. A) and (2. A) represent the exchange of principal. This principal is exchanged to hedge the exchange rate risk on the principal that will be paid at \(T\).**

**In particular Greece will receive USD 50 billon and will pay EUR 59 billon at \(t=T\). If dollar depreciates the USD 50 bn (which are exactly equivalent to EUR 59 bn at \(t=0\)) will be worth less than EUR 59 bn.**

**To hedge against this risk Greece exchanges the principals at time \(t=0\) and agrees that, at \(t=T\), the principals will be exchanged at the same exchange rate used for the principals exchange at time \(t=0\).**

**We can write the swap as a sum of three components:**

$$
S W A P=B O N D^{\mathfrak{G}}-B O N D^{e}+E o P_{0}
$$

**where \(E o P\) is the exchange of principal. The value of the swap will therefore be**

$$
V^{S w a p}=\boldsymbol{B}^{\S}-\boldsymbol{B}^{e}+\boldsymbol{V}^{E o P_{0}}
$$

**where \(B^{\mathfrak{G}}\) and \(B^{e}\) denote, as in Teaching Notes 2, the value of two coupon bonds (with di\! Erent coupon rates) in USD and EUR respectively. We know that their semiannual coupon rates are \(c=6\%\) (I will keep writing \(c\) to get a more general result) and \(K\) respectively.**

**The initial exchange of principal is typically done in a way that \(V^{E o P}=0\), that is the principal in USD is equal to the principal in EUR times the current USD / EUR exchange rate. So the value of the swap becomes \(V^{S w a p}=B^{\mathbb{S}}-B^{e}\). Now we know that the value at \(t=0\) (in USD) of the USD coupon bond is**

$$
\boldsymbol{B}_{0}^{\mathbb{S}}=\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}\frac{c}{2}\cdot\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathbb{S}}\cdot\boldsymbol{Z}^{\mathbb{S}}(0, t)+\boldsymbol{N}^{\mathbb{S}}\cdot\boldsymbol{Z}^{\mathbb{S}}(0, T)
$$

**that is, the sum of all discounted (using the US zero coupon curve \(Z^{\P}(0, t)\)) coupons (i.e. \(\frac{c}{2}\cdot N\)) plus the discounted value of the principal at maturity. Similarly the value at \(t=0\) (in EUR) of the EUR coupon bond is**

$$
B_{0}^{e}=\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}\frac{K}{2}\cdot N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, t)+N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, T)
$$

**Before computing \(K\), remember that when we compute the value of the swap we express it in a determined currency. Since each bond has its own currency, we have to convert all values to the same currency. So, if we want to compute the value of the currency swap in dollars we will convert the value of the EUR bond into USD, by multiplying it for the spot USD / EUR exchange rate. In formulas, the time \(t\) value of the currency swap in USD is:**

$$
V_{t}^{S w a p,\S}=B_{t}^{\S}-M_{t}\cdot B_{t}^{e}
$$

**similarly, the time \(t\) value in EUR is:**

$$
V_{t}^{S w a p, e}=\frac{B_{t}^{\Phi}}{M_{t}}-B_{t}^{e}
$$

**We can now compute \(K\). Our goal is to have \(V_{0}^{S w a p}=0\). Let’s take the value of the swap in USD.**

$$
V_{0}^{S w a p,\S}={\cal B}_{0}^{\S}-M_{0}\cdot{\cal B}_{0}^{e}=0
$$

**This implies that \(\boldsymbol{B}_{0}^{\S}=\boldsymbol{M}_{0}\cdot\boldsymbol{B}_{0}^{e}\), which is the same as**

$$
{\cal B}_{0}^{\S}={\cal M}_{0}\cdot\left[\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}\frac{K}{2}\cdot N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, t)+N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, T)\right]
$$

**Rearranging we get:**

$$
\frac{B_{0}^{\S}}{M_{0}}-N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, T)=\frac{K}{2}\cdot N^{e}\cdot\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}Z^{e}(0, t)
$$

**solving for \(K\), we get:**

$$
K=2\cdot\frac{\frac{B_{0}^{\mathfrak{F}}}{M_{0}}-N^{e}\cdot Z^{e}(0, T)}{N^{e}\cdot\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}Z^{e}(0, t)}
$$

**But we don’t know yet \(B_{0}^{\S}\). Using the US ZCB prices (also know as Zero Coupon curve or discount function) we can compute its value as**

$$
\begin{array}{r c l} {{{\cal B}_{0}^{\P}} }& {{=}} & {{\displaystyle\sum_{t=0.5}^{T}\frac{0.06}{2}\cdot50\cdot Z^{\P}(0,t)+50\cdot0.5848=}} \ {{}} & {{=}} & {{\displaystyle\frac{0.06}{2}\cdot50\cdot15.5573+50\cdot0.5848=52.5778}} \end{array}
$$

**Plugging it into equation (2) we get \(K=0.0566\) or 5.66%.**

**(2) Under Goldman Sachs terms, there are two major di\! Erences, namely \(K=7\%\) rather than 5.66% and \(V^{E o P_{0}}\neq 0\), since principal is exchanged using an exchange rate which is di\! Erent from the spot exchange rate. We can use formula (1) to compute the currency swap. We already know \(B^{\S}=52.5778\) billion of dollars. We need to compute the new value for \(B^{e}\) since the coupon has changed to \(K=7\%\) and the value of the time \(t=0\) exchange of principal \(V_{0}^{E o P_{0}}\). Using the same approach used for \(B^{\S}\) we get \(B^{e}=68.2444\) billion of EUR.**

**For computing \(V^{E o P_{0}}\) we need first to specify a currency. Let’s consider USD, and let’s denote by \(M_{0}\) the spot exchange rate and by \(M^{G S}\) the fictitious exchange rate set in Goldman conditions. First let’s define the cash flows in USD. Greece will pay to Goldman \(N^{\S}=50\) billion of dollars and will receive a cash flow in EUR determined using the fictitious rate \(M^{G S}\), that is \(\begin{array}{r}{N^{e}=\frac{N^{\mathfrak{F}}}{M^{G S}}=\frac{50}{0.8148}=61.3648}\end{array}\) = 61.3648 billion of euros. Then we can compute the value of the exchange of principal, \(V_{0}^{E o P_{0},\d^{3}}\). To compute this we need to use the current exchange rate, as the fictitious rate \(M^{G S}\) was just used to determine the cash flow. We get (in billion of dollars)**

$$
V_{0}^{E o P_{0},\S}=N^{e}\cdot M_{0}-N^{\S}=61.3648\cdot 0.8475-50=2.0040
$$

**Alternatively if we wanted to compute the value of the exchange of principal in EUR we would have simply done**

$$
V_{0}^{E o P_{0}, e}=N^{e}-\frac{N^{\Phi}}{M_{0}}=61.3648-\frac{50}{0.08475}=2.3648
$$

**So Greece will receive a positive cash inflow at \(t=0\) under Goldman conditions.**

**The value of the currency swap will be**

**Another interpretation of the question could have been to assume that the notional of the Euro bond was also changed to \(N^{e}=61.3648\) using the fictitious exchange rate. Such interpretation would have led to the same directional result, but with larger numbers, therefore does not a\! Ect the grade. In this case we would have had \(B^{e}=70.9796\) and \(V^{S w a p,\S}=-5.5730\).**

**Wait a second, the value of the swap is negative! Why would Greece accept something like this? One possible reason\(^{1}\) might be that the mark to market of the currency swap is not recognized as sovereign debt. Thus with the cash received at inception Greece could have paid a portion of its outstanding debt. In theory we expect that the value of the outstanding debt does not change (as we have a swap with negative market value); however, since the swap value did not account for as debt according to EUROSTAT (the institutions who takes care of collecting all Euro countries data on debt, deficit, GDP, etc..), Greece could have reduced its reported debt on year 2001. Of course, with the invented data provided, this trick would have costed Greece a lot of money (3.25 billion of dollars).**

### Solution to Problem 2: Hedging with Options – Southwest Jet Fuel Hedging Program

**(1. A) Straight Insurance: Buying call options on oil with strike = \$105.**
**Assumptions:**
**- 1 barrel of oil produces 1 barrel of jet fuel.**
**- A \$1 change in crude oil price (per barrel) leads to a \$1 change in jet fuel price (per barrel), which corresponds to a change of 1/42 = 0.02381 dollars per gallon.**
**- Each option covers 1 lot = 1,000 barrels = 42,000 gallons.**

```python
    Options_needed_1 a = total_fuel_Q 1 / 42000
    Print (" (1. A) Straight Insurance (Call at $105) strategy: ")
    Print ("    Total Q 1 fuel consumption: {:,} gallons".Format (total_fuel_Q 1))
    Print ("    Number of call options needed = total gallons / 42,000 = {:. 0 f} options".Format (options_needed_1 a))
    # (For our numbers, this is approximately 9,000 options.)
```
**options_needed_1 a = total_fuel_Q 1 / 42000**
**print (" (1. A) Straight Insurance (Call at \$105) strategy: ")**
**print ("    Total Q 1 fuel consumption: {:,} gallons".Format (total_fuel_Q 1))**
**print ("    Number of call options needed = total gallons / 42,000 = {:. 0 f} options".Format (options_needed_1 a))**
**(For our numbers, this is approximately 9,000 options.)**

**(1. B) Now assume that a \$1 change in crude oil per barrel causes a 1.1964 \$ change in jet fuel per barrel.**
**In per-gallon terms, the sensitivity becomes 1.1964/42.**
**This increases the exposure by a factor of 1.1964 compared to the baseline assumption.**

```python
    Options_needed_1 b = options_needed_1 a * 1.1964
    Print ("\n (1. B) If a $1 change in oil causes a 1.1964 change in jet fuel (per barrel): ")
    Print ("    Number of call options needed = {:. 0 f} options".Format (options_needed_1 b))
```

**options_needed_1 b = options_needed_1 a * 1.1964**
**print ("\n (1. B) If a \$1 change in oil causes a 1.1964 change in jet fuel (per barrel): ")**
**print ("    Number of call options needed = {:. 0 f} options".Format (options_needed_1 b))**

**(1. C) Suppose the CFO buys the number of options from (1. A) (\(≈\) options_needed_1 a) but the true sensitivity is as in (1. B). Then the hedge is insufficient (under–hedged).**

```python
    Print ("\n (1. C) If only {:. 0 f} options are bought (from 1. A) but sensitivity is higher (as in 1. B),".Format (options_needed_1 a))
    Print ("    the hedge will be under–hedged.\n")
```

**print ("\n (1. C) If only {:. 0 f} options are bought (from 1. A) but sensitivity is higher (as in 1. B),".Format (options_needed_1 a))**
**print ("    the hedge will be under–hedged.\n")**

**(1. D) Now suppose instead that to produce 1 barrel of jet fuel one needs 1.1964 barrels of oil.**
**In that case, the effective sensitivity is the same as in (1. B). Therefore, the required number of options is")**

```python
    Options_needed_1 d = options_needed_1 b  # the same as (1. B)
    Print (" (1. D) If 1.1964 barrels of oil are needed per barrel of jet fuel, then")
    Print ("    the required number of options remains {:. 0 f} options.".Format (options_needed_1 d))
    Print ("    (The answers in (1. B) and (1. D) are the same because the factor 1.1964 enters the sensitivity similarly.)\n")
```

**options_needed_1 d = options_needed_1 b  # the same as (1. B)**
**print (" (1. D) If 1.1964 barrels of oil are needed per barrel of jet fuel, then")**
**print ("    the required number of options remains {:. 0 f} options.".Format (options_needed_1 d))**
**print ("    (The answers in (1. B) and (1. D) are the same because the factor 1.1964 enters the sensitivity similarly.)\n")**

**(1. E) Implicit Short Position on Jet Fuel**
**Without hedging, Southwest must buy jet fuel at market prices on March 31, 2008.**
**Thus, its exposure is like a short position on jet fuel (if prices rise, costs increase).**
**The payoff (per gallon) at maturity is:**
**Payoff = (Initial jet fuel price) - (Maturity jet fuel price)**
**which is a linear (downward-sloping) function.**
**We now plot a schematic payoff diagram.**

```python
    Jet_prices = np.Linspace (0, 1.5, 100)  # change in jet fuel price (in $ per gallon)
    # Let initial price be normalized to 0; the loss is proportional to the increase.
    Payoff_short = - jet_prices  # linear decreasing function
    Plot_payoff (jet_prices, payoff_short, title="Payoff Diagram: Implicit Short Position on Jet Fuel",
                Xlabel="Increase in jet fuel price ($ per gallon)",
                Ylabel="Loss (per gallon, $)")
```

**jet_prices = np.Linspace (0, 1.5, 100)  # change in jet fuel price (in \$ per gallon)**
**# Let initial price be normalized to 0; the loss is proportional to the increase.**
**payoff_short = - jet_prices  # linear decreasing function**
**plot_payoff (jet_prices, payoff_short, title="Payoff Diagram: Implicit Short Position on Jet Fuel",**
**xlabel="Increase in jet fuel price (\$ per gallon)",**
**ylabel="Loss (per gallon, \$)")**

**(1. F) Now plot the payoff of the straight insurance strategy (i.e. the call options) and then the overall position (short position + call payoff).**
**For a European call option with strike K, payoff = max (S - K, 0).**

```python
    K_call = 105  # call strike in $/barrel
    # Convert to per–gallon basis: 1 barrel = 42 gallons, so strike per gallon = K_call/42.
    K_call_gal = K_call / 42
    # Assume the underlying oil price change (per barrel) translates 1-to-1 into jet fuel price change per barrel,
    # which is 1/42 per gallon; for simplicity we work in per–gallon terms.
    # Let x denote the increase in jet fuel price (per gallon).
    x = np.Linspace (0, 0.10, 100)  # e.g., up to 10 cents per gallon increase
    # Call payoff per gallon = max (x - (K_call_gal - baseline), 0). We set the “baseline” so that at zero change, payoff is 0.
    # For illustration, assume the option is struck at a level such that the payoff is:
    Call_payoff = np.Maximum (x - 0.02381, 0)  # baseline = 0.02381 corresponds to $1 per barrel /42
    # Overall payoff = short position payoff (which is -x) + call payoff.

**(2) Setting up a zero-cost collar.**
**In a collar, the CFO finances the purchase of call options (insurance) by selling put options.**
**We require that the total premium from sold puts equals the premium paid for the calls.**
**We use the same number of options as in (1. A) (approximately options_needed_1 a).**
**(For the call at strike 105, the premium per option (per lot) is given as 2,541 USD.)**

```python
    Call_premium_per_lot = df_options. Loc[df_options["Strike"] == 105.00, "Call"]. Iloc[0]
    Call_premium_per_barrel = call_premium_per_lot / 1000.0  # per barrel premium
    Total_call_cost = options_needed_1 a * call_premium_per_barrel  # total cost in USD (per barrel equivalent)
```

**call_premium_per_lot = df_options. Loc[df_options["Strike"] == 105.00, "Call"]. Iloc[0]**
**call_premium_per_barrel = call_premium_per_lot / 1000.0  # per barrel premium**
**total_call_cost = options_needed_1 a * call_premium_per_barrel  # total cost in USD (per barrel equivalent)**

**(2. A) Find the put strike such that the put premium equals the call premium.**
**We scan the option DataFrame for a put whose premium (per barrel) equals call_premium_per_barrel.**

**(2. B) For the collar, the payoff at maturity for each option is:**
**- Call: max (S - 105, 0) per barrel (converted to per–gallon if needed)**
**- Put: -max (put strike - S, 0)**

## 1 Barings / Leeson position on Nikkei options

**On February 26, 1995, Barings, Britain’s oldest merchant bank, went bankrupt due to USD 1.3 billion (bn) losses in derivative securities from a single trader, Nick Leeson. The collapse occurred because Barings could not meet the enormous trading obligations established by Leeson in the name of the bank. When it went into receivership on February 27, 1995, Barings, via Leeson, had outstanding notional futures positions on Japanese equities and interest rates of USD 27 bn: USD 7 bn on the Nikkei 225 equity contract and USD 20 bn on Japanese government bond (JGB) and Euroyen contracts. But that’s just part of the story. In addition to these positions, on December 24 th 1994, Leeson also sold 35,500 Nikkei calls and 35,500 put options with the same strike price of \(K=19\), 750 index points and the same maturity of \(T=2\) months. On the day Leeson sold the options, the Nikkei was trading at 19,634 points\(^{1}\).**

**(1) What is the name of the option strategy (i.e. short 1 call and short 1 put with same strike price and same maturity) that Leeson set up?**
**(2) Under what condition is such a strategy profitable at maturity? What are the risks for a trader that sets up this strategy?**
**(3) Consider just 1 call and 1 put. Draw, on the same chart, the profit diagram at maturity, in Japanese Yen (JPY), of each option, as well as the profit diagram, still at maturity and in JPY, of the entire strategy (i.e. the combination of the two options). Label the points where the profit of the strategy intersects the \(x\) axis, and show their values.**

**To carry out the computations you need to know that, on December 24 th 1994, 1 Nikkei call option with strike equal to \(K=19\), 750 was priced JPY 9.90 m and 1 Nikkei put option with strike equal to \(K=19,750\) was priced JPY 9.80 m. Assume that the 2-months interest rate is 0 (in this way you can show the full value of the option premium in the profit diagram, without worrying about time value of money) and that each Nikkei option trades on JPY 10,000 times the index value. (Tip: You can think about everything using the contract size where 1 option is on 10,000 units of the index )**

**(4) Consider now the scale of the entire strategy (i.e. 35,500 positions). Draw the profit diagram at maturity, in JPY, of the entire strategy. Label the points where the profits of the entire strategy intersects the \(x\) axis, and show their values.**

**On January 17 1995 the well known Kobe earthquake hit Japan’s industrial heartland. That day the Nikkei 225 was at 19,350. It ended that week (on Friday January 20 1995) slightly lower at 18,950. Three days later, on Monday January 23, the Nikkei dropped 1,000 points to 17,950. The large declines in Japanese equities, post-earthquake, made the market more volatile.**

**(5) What is the e\! Ect of an increase in stock market volatility on Leeson position? No calculations needed, just a directional answer (i.e. position value increases / decreases) and provide intuition for why this happens. (Tip: you may find it helpful to draw two profit diagrams for the strategy and to assume two di\! Erent distributions of the Nikkei values. An very extreme, but helpful, simplification in the first chart you could assume that Nikkei prices at maturity are normally distributed, with mean equal to option strike price and with a given unknown variance - just draw a bell curve centered at \(K\) -, while in the second chart you could assume that Nikkei prices also have a normal distribution with the same mean as in the first chart, but with a much larger variance, so much bigger tails)**

**By February 24 th 1995 (the option maturity date) the Nikkei reached 17,473 points.**

**(6) What was the final profit / loss of Leeson Nikkei 225 options strategy on February 24 th 1995?**

### Solution to Problem 1: Barings / Leeson Position on Nikkei Options

**(1) Name of the strategy**
```python
    Print ("1. (1) Leeson’s strategy – selling one call and one put with the same strike and maturity – is called a SHORT STRADDLE.\n")
```
**1. (1) Leeson’s strategy – selling one call and one put with the same strike and maturity – is called a SHORT STRADDLE.**

**(2) When is a short straddle profitable?**
```python
    Print ("1. (2) A short straddle is profitable if at maturity the underlying remains near the strike price, "
          "so that both the call and put expire worthless (or with minimal intrinsic value). "
          "The risk is that if the underlying moves significantly away from the strike (in either direction), "
          "the losses can be very large (and, in theory, unlimited on the call side).\n")
```
**1. (2) A short straddle is profitable if at maturity the underlying remains near the strike price, so that both the call and put expire worthless (or with minimal intrinsic value). The risk is that if the underlying moves significantly away from the strike (in either direction), the losses can be very large (and, in theory, unlimited on the call side).**

**(3) Profit diagrams for 1 call, 1 put and the combined strategy.**
**(For a short call, profit = premium received – max (S - K, 0)\*multiplier.**
**For a short put, profit = premium received – max (K - S, 0)\*multiplier.**
**For the short straddle, profit = total premium received – multiplier \* |S - K|.**
**The break-even points occur when multiplier \* |S - K| = total_premium.)**

```python
    BE = total_premium / multiplier  # break–even deviation in index points
    Print ("1. (3) For one option contract, the break–even deviation is {:. 2 f} index points.".Format (BE))
    Print ("That is, the strategy breaks even if the Nikkei is at K ± {:. 2 f} at maturity.\n".Format (BE))

    # Create a range of index values (S) for plotting (say from 15,000 to 22,000)
    S_range = np.Linspace (15000, 22000, 500)

    # Compute profit per contract (in JPY) for each leg:
    Short_call_profit = call_premium - np.Maximum (S_range - K, 0) * multiplier
    Short_put_profit  = put_premium - np.Maximum (K - S_range, 0) * multiplier
    Short_straddle_profit = short_call_profit + short_put_profit

**# Compute profit per contract (in JPY) for each leg:**
**short_call_profit = call_premium - np.Maximum (S_range - K, 0) \* multiplier**
**short_put_profit  = put_premium - np.Maximum (K - S_range, 0) \* multiplier**

**1. (3) For one option contract, the break–even deviation is 1.97 index points.**
**That is, the strategy breaks even if the Nikkei is at K ± 1.97 at maturity.**

**(4) Now scale to the entire strategy (35,500 positions)**

**(5) Effect of an increase in stock market volatility**

```python
    Print ("1. (5) An increase in market volatility increases the likelihood that the underlying will move far away "
          "from the strike. For a short straddle, this means higher risk (more potential loss). Thus, as volatility increases, "

```

**(6) Final profit/loss calculation.**
**(On February 24, 1995 the Nikkei reached 17,473 points.)**

```python

## 1 Multiperiod binomial tree

**In each of the next two periods (\(i=1\) and \(i=2\)), a stock whose value in period \(i=0\) is \(S_{0}=100\), can either rise or fall by 10% (using the notation of the teaching notes, \(u=1.1\) and \(\begin{array}{r}{d=\frac{1}{u}}\end{array}\)). Suppose the per-period risk-free rate is \(r=5\%\). A financial intermediary sold a European call option on the stock, with exercise price equal to \(K=100\).**

**(1) What actions would the firm need to take in order to hedge its risk from writing the call? (Tip: describe how you would set up a portfolio that the intermediary can use to mirror the payo\! S of the option. Note: answering that the firm can buy the same call will not get full credit!)**

**(a) Using a two-period binomial tree, construct the replicating portfolio at each node. How much would you charge for the call option at period \(i=0\)? What is the “delta” (the number of shares bought or sold in the replicating portfolio) and how much borrowing or lending is required at each node?**

**(b) Let’s see what happens if we change the initial stock price \(S_{0}\) by a little. In particular I would like you to figure out how the value of the replicating portfolio changes when you change \(S_{0}\). To do this compute the value of the replicated portfolio, \(V^{R P}\) when the initial stock price is equal to \(S_{0}+\triangle S\) with \(\Delta S=1,2,..., 10\). When doing this remember that future stock prices are also changed under the assumption that the stock price rises or falls by 10% going forward.**

**i. Is the change in value of the portfolio linear in \(\Delta S\)? (Tip: The change in value is linear in \(\Delta S\) if \(V^{R P}(k\cdot\triangle S)=k\cdot V^{R P}(\triangle S)\)). Show your calculations.**
**ii. If your answer in the previous point was “No”, would you describe the relationship between \(V^{R P}\) and \(S\) as concave or convex? What would be the sign of the second derivative of a function \(V^{R P}(S)\)?**

**(c) Use the initial assumption for \(S_{0}\) for this and the remaining questions. Is the portfolio “self-financing”? (Tip: The portfolio is self-financing if you do NOT need any additional capital infusion between period \(i=0\) and the period of the final payo\! \(T=0\))**
**(d) What is the profit/loss on the replicating portfolio?**
**(e) What is the price of the call option if the stock pays a 5% dividend yield in period \(i=1\)? Show the resulting trees for the stock price and for the option as well as your computations. (Hint: when the dividend is paid the stock price must decline in response. In the “up” state in period 1 before the dividend is paid, the stock prices is \(S_{0}\times u\). If \(y\) is the dividend yield, the stock price next period in the “up” state after the payment of the dividend is \(S_{0}\times u\times (1-y)\). A similar adjustment must be made to the stock price in the “down” state after the dividend is paid.)**

**(f) What is the price of the call option if the stock pays a \$5 dividend in period \(i=1\)? In this case the dividend is a fixed dollar amount that is independent of the stock price. Show the resulting trees for the stock price and for the option as well as your computations. Comment on the di”erence with part (e).**

### Solution to Problem 3: Multiperiod Binomial Tree

**(1) The intermediary can set up a replicating portfolio using delta hedging. At each node \((i, j)\), (with \(i\) representing the period \(i=0,..., I-1\) and \(j\) representing the row \(j=1,... I\) for a given period) the intermediary can take a position equal to \(\triangle_{i, j}\) stocks and \(B_{i, j}\) bonds, where**

$$
\triangle_{i, j}=\frac{c_{i+1, j}-c_{i+1, j+1}}{S_{i+1, j}-S_{i+1, j+1}}
$$

$$
B_{i, j}=\frac{1}{1+r}\cdot (c_{i+1, j}-\triangle_{i, j}\cdot S_{i+1, j})=\frac{1}{1+r}\cdot (c_{i+1, j+1}-\triangle_{i, j}\cdot S_{i+1, j+1})
$$

**Remember that by taking the positions (1) and (2) the institution replicates a long call, which exactly o↵sets the short position in the call.**

**(a) We can start by representing the tree for the stock price, that is shown in Figure (1).**

**(Figure 1: Stock price tree)**

**Given the tree in Figure (1) we can compute option payo\! At period \(i=2\), as represented in Figure (2).**

**(Figure 2: Option value tree)**

**We can then work backward in the tree and determine the position to be invested in stock and in bonds at each node that allow to replicate the period \(i=2\) payo\! S of the stock. For example in node ”up”, at period \(i=1\), we find**

$$
\triangle_{u}=\frac{c_{u\cdot u}-c_{u\cdot d}}{S_{u\cdot u}-S_{u\cdot d}}=1.000
$$

$$
B_{u}=\frac{1}{1+r}\cdot (c_{u\cdot u}-\triangle_{u}\cdot S_{u\cdot u})=\frac{1}{1+0.05}\cdot (21-1\cdot 121)=-95.2381
$$

**In the same way for node ”down”, at period \(i=1\) we find \(\triangle_{d}=0.0000\) and \(B_{d}=0.0000\). Given this we can compute the value of the replicating portfolio at period \(i=1\). We find \(V_{u}^{R P}=\triangle_{u}\cdot S_{u}+B_{u}=14.7619\) and \(V_{d}^{R P}=\triangle_{d}\cdot S_{d}+B_{d}=0\). Since the portfolio mirrors the period \(i=2\) payo\! S of the option, then the value of the option, then the period \(i=1\) value of the option will be equal to the period \(i=1\) value of the replicating portfolio. Therefore we can plug \(V_{u}\) and \(V_{d}\) in Figure (2). We can then work backward again and compute the position in stock and bond at period \(i=0\). We find \(\triangle_{0}=0.7732\) and \(B_{0}=-66.9474\), which leads to a value of the replicating portfolio (and of the option) equal to \(V_{0}^{R P}=c_{0}=\triangle_{0}\cdot S_{0}+B_{0}=10.3768\)**

**A summary of all the relevant quantities are reported in Figure (3).**

**(Figure 3: Summary tree)**

**(b) Table (1) reports the period \(i=0\) value of the replicating portfolio \(V_{0}^{R P}\) for di\! Erent values of \(S_{0}\).**

**(Table 1: Value of the replicating portfolio as a function of \(S_{0}V^{R P}\left (S_{0}\right)\))**

**i. The change in value of the portfolio is constant for values of \(S_{0}\) below 100 and again constant but at a higher value for values of \(S_{0}\) above 100. As a result the relationship between the option price and the current stock prices is convex. Figure (4) reports this result.**

**(Figure 4: Relationship between portfolio value and stock price)**

**ii. The relationship is convex. The “second derivative” is positive.**

**(c) The portfolio is “self-financing”. To check this consider the following. At period \(i=0\), the replicating portfolio requires buying 0.7732 stocks and to short-selling 66.9474 units of zero coupon bonds paying 1 dollar at period \(i=2\) (which is the same as borrowing 66.9484 dollars). At the “up-node” \((1,1)\) the value of such position is**

$$
\triangle_{0}\cdot S_{u}+B_{0}\cdot (1+r)=0.7732+(-66.9474)\cdot (1+0.05)=14.7619
$$

**If we are now at node \((1,1)\) to hedge the option payo\! S at period \(i=2\), we need to take a position in stock equal to**

$$
\triangle_{u}=\frac{c_{u\cdot u}-c_{u\cdot d}}{S_{u\cdot u}-S_{u\cdot d}}=1.000
$$

**and a position in zero coupon bond paying 1 dollar at period \(i=2\) equal to**

$$
B_{u}=\frac{1}{1+r}\cdot (c_{u\cdot u}-\triangle_{u}\cdot S_{u\cdot u})=\frac{1}{1+0.05}\cdot (21-1\cdot 121)=-95.2381
$$

**the value of such new portfolio is \(V_{u}^{R P}=\triangle_{u}\cdot S_{u}+B_{u}=1.000\cdot 110+(-95.2381)=\) 14.7619 that is exactly equal to the liquidation value of the portfolio that was set up at period \(i=0\). We can do the same excercise for node \((2,1)\) and we see that**

$$
\triangle_{0}\cdot S_{d}+B_{0}\cdot (1+r)=V_{d}^{R P}=\triangle_{d}\cdot S_{1,2}+B_{d}=0
$$

**(d) The P&L of the portfolio can be computed by looking at the portfolio value. At node (1,1), the value of the replicating portfolio is \(V_{u}^{R P}=14.7619\), so if stock price goes up between period \(i=0\) and period \(i=1\), then the portfolio gains \(14.7619–10.3768=4.39\) dollars (which is the same value we loose on the short call position). If instead the stock price goes down the value of the portfolio in node (1,2), that is \(V_{d}^{R P}=0\) goes to 0, loosing 10.3768. In the same way, at time 2, if the price of the stock is \(S_{u\cdot u}=121\), then the portfolio gains \(21.000-14.7619=6.2381\) dollars, while if the stock prices goes from \(S_{u}=110\) to \(S_{u\cdot d}=100\) then the portfolio value drops to 0, loosing 14.7619 dollars. Finally for node (1,2) in both scenarios \(S_{d\cdot u}\) and \(S_{d\cdot d}\) the value of the portfolio does not change as it remains equal to 0.**

**(e) If the option pays a 5% dividend yield in period 1, after dividend the stock price will decrease by an amount equal to the dividend paid, (which means a proportional decrease by 5%) at period \(i=1\).**

**(Figure 5: Stock price tree in case of a 5% dividend yield paid at \(i=1\))**

**Given the stock price tree shown in Figure (5), we can compute the option payo\! S at time \(i=2\). We get**

$$
\begin{array}{r c l} {{c_{u\cdot u}} }& {{=}} & {{14.9500}} \ {{}} & {{}} & {{}} \ {{c_{u\cdot d}=c_{d\cdot u}} }& {{=}} & {{0}} \ {{}} & {{}} & {{}} \ {{c_{d\cdot d}} }& {{=}} & {{0}} \end{array}
$$

**We can use the replicating portfolio formula to compute the option value. At period \(i=1\) we can simply apply formulas (1) and (2) to the new tree, as between period \(i=1\) and period \(i=2\) the stock will not pay any more dividends. We get**

$$
\triangle_{u}^{'}=0.7494
$$

$$
B_{u}^{'}=-67.8005
$$

$$
\bigtriangleup_{d}^{'}=0
$$

$$
\triangle_{u}^{'}=0
$$

**where we have added a single quote to distinguish such values from the ones computed in point (1. A). We obtain the following replicating portfolio values:**

$$
V_{u}^{R P}=10.5091
$$

**and**

$$
V_{d}^{R P}=0
$$

**It’s easy to check that \(R P\) replicates the option payo\! At period \(i=2\). For example for the up node, the value of the portfolio is \(V_{u\cdot u}^{R P}=\triangle_{u}^{'}\cdot S_{u\cdot u}+B_{u}^{'}\) · \((1+r)=0.7494\cdot 114.95-67.8005\cdot (1+0.05)=14.95\). To find the period \(i=0\) delta, that is \(\triangle_{0}^{\prime}\), we need to consider the dividend. Indeed if we buy \(\triangle_{0}^{\prime}\) stocks, tomorrow we will gain from the price appreciation and we will also get \(\triangle_{0}^{'}\cdot y\) dividends. If for example the stock price increases, as shown in equation (3) this will imply a gross return equal to \(S_{0}\cdot u\). Therefore we can compute the delta as if no dividend was paid (that is using the old, pre-dividend stock price tree), while we can apply formula (2) - still using the stock price with no dividend - to compute the position in bonds. We get**

$$
\triangle_{0}^{'}=\frac{V_{u}^{R P}-V_{d}^{R P}}{S_{u}^{o l d}-S_{d}^{o l d}}=\frac{10.5091}{110.0000-90.9091}=0.5505
$$

$$
B_{0}^{'}=\frac{1}{1+0.05}\cdot (10.5091-0.5505\cdot 110)=-47.6602
$$

**The value of the option will therefore be \({c_{0}^{'}}=V_{0}^{R P}={\triangle_{0}^{'}}\cdot S_{0}+B_{0}^{'}=0.5505\) · \(100-47.6602=7.3873\)**

**(Figure 6: Summary tree in case of 5% dividend yield paid at \(i=1\))**

**(f) To compute the option price in case of a fixed dollar dividend, we can apply the same logic as in point (1. E). The only di↵erence though is that the tree does not recombine at period \(i=2\). Figure (7) presents a summary tree, which shows that the option value in this case is \(c_{0}=7.6591\).**

**(Figure 7: Summary tree in case of a \$5 constant dividend paid at \(i=1\))**

## 1 Implied Volatility

**Replicate the Implied Volatility of Teaching Note 6, using current options data on S&P 500 maturing in June (3 months or one quarter from now). Please state the assumptions you make, if any, to compute the time to maturity of the options, that is the value of \(T\) that you use in your formulas. (No need to use many options. Choose just a few ITM, OTM and ATM. Note that the current SP 500 index value is on the top right corner of the table.) The spreadsheet “Options. Xls” provides an example of the implied volatility calculation. See the worksheet “Implied Volatility.”**

**Current Options Data can be found at CBOE. The ticker is SPX. http://www.cboe.com/DelayedQuote/QuoteTable.aspx NOTE: I have downloaded all of this data for you! Please see the file “QuoteData 2024. Xls.”**
**You can use federal reserve website (link below) to retrieve the value of the risk free rate. Use the Treasury Constant Maturity rate that most closely matches the maturity of the options. Note that TCM are compounded annually, so be sure to make the relevant adjustments. Please report the value of the rate that you use. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Current/**
**The dividend yield can be estimated using the data collected by Robert Shiller which are available at the link below. You can estimate the dividend yield as the average dividend yield over the last available 12 months. Be sure to make the relevant compounding adjustments and report the dividend yield that you use. http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm**

**You should use the data in the “Excel file” used in his book. This gives monthly prices, dividends, earnings and other information.**

### Solution to Problem 1: Implied Volatility

**From the CBOE site I extract options prices with expiration of February 21, 2024 and compute “mid” prices as an average of bid and ask. To compute the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) implied volatility I need the maturity, the continuously compounded risk free rate \(r\) and the continuously compounded dividend yield \(y\). Let \(T=0.35\) (365 days in a year and 129 days to maturity). From the Federal Reserve website the annually compounded 3 months constant maturity rate was \(r_{1}(0.25)=5.43\%\) on February 12 (some interpolation could be done here. Any reasonable extraction is fine!). Converting this to continuous compounding units gives \(r (0.25)=l n\left (1+r_{1}(0.25)/4\right)\times 4=5.39\%\). From Robert Shiller’s dataset, the January 2021 to June 2023 average dividend yield (annually compounded) was equal to \(y_{1}=1.51\%\), which, converted into continuous compounding units, gives \(y=1.50\%\).**

**The BSM implied volatility is computed using solver (I use Matlab, but Excel does exactly the same calculation but takes a bit more time unless you know how to use macros). The results are shown Figure 1 for moneyness from 08 to 1.1.**

**(Figure 1: Implied volatility for June 21, 2024 S&P 500 call and call options)**

**As you can see the volatility is not constant, but it is decreasing with the moneyness of the option (as in the Figure from Teaching Note 6).**

**The PLUS security has one-year to maturity with embedded call options so it would be nice to have implied volatility for a one-year maturity. I use the February 2025 options (maturity of 12 months) (don’t worry if you didn’t do this!). Implied volatility from the June 2024 and February 2025 call options with \(r (1)=4.8\%\) (from the one-year constant maturity yield) are show in Figure 2.**

## 2 Valuing and analyzing a structured security

**A wealthy investor hires you to help her evaluate a recent security issued by Morgan Stanley, called PLUS (see prospectus: The security was issued by Morgan Stanely in April 2008. Assume the same security is issued today and has one-year to maturity, but it is otherwise identical). To assess its fair value, you decide to use the appropriate implied volatility from the options markets as in Exercise (1).**

**(a) How can you decompose the PLUS into more basic securities? (Tip: The solution to the Mock Midterm might be helpful...)**
**(b) Use the decomposition obtained in point (2.1. A) and the information obtained in exercise (1) to value the PLUS.**
**(c) If the value you obtain is not at par, what might you modify to make sure the value of the security is par as of today? (Words only, but for a bonus, see if you can actually set the value to par by changing one of the terms.)**

**(2) What is the sensitivity of this security to changes in the underlying stock price? How can you compute its market ”beta”, namely, the percentage sensitivity of the security to percentage changes in the underlying? Compute the ”beta” of the PLUS for several stock prices ”S” as of (a) today, (b) 6 month from now, (c) 1 year from now. Discuss your findings.**

### Solution to Problem 2: Valuing and analyzing a structured security

**(1) In order to value the PLUS follow these steps:**

#### (a) Decompose the PLUS payo\! Into simpler securities.

**The payo\! Of the PLUS security at maturity is**

$$
\pi (T)=\left\{\begin{array}{c c} {{m i n\left[10+10\times3\times\left(\frac{S_{T}-S_{0}} {S_{0}}\right), 11.9\right]}}& {{\quad i f S_{T}>S_{0}} }\ {{10\times\frac{S_{T}} {S_{0}}}}& {{\quad i f S_{T}\le S_{0}} }\end{array}\right.
$$

**Starting with \(S_{T}\leq S_{0}\), this is just a long position in \(\frac{10}{S_{0}}\) units of the index. Let \(\begin{array}{r}{N=\frac{10}{S_{0}}}\end{array}\) be the number of units of the index determined by this part of the payo\! . With the S&P 500 at 5,000.57 N = 0.0020**

**Finding the payo\! For the case when \(S_{T}>S_{0}\) is simpler than it first appears. The trick is to plot the payo\! And to analyze the chart to determine the basic securities. Figure 3 gives the PLUS payo\! For di\! Erent values of \(S_{T}\).**

**(Figure 3: PLUS payo\! Decomposition)**

**We see that there are two points where the slope changes. The first point is \(S_{0}\), while the second is where:**

$$
10+10\times 3\times\frac{S_{T}-S_{0}}{S_{0}}=11.9
$$

**This is where \(S_{T}=5,317.27\). Call this point \(K_{1}\). After \(K_{1}\) the slope is zero.**

**(Table 1 reports the slopes of the PLUS security)**

**(Table 2: Slope when holding \(N\) underlying securities for di\! Erent values of \(S_{T}\))**

**So, the payo\! Of the PLUS can be rewritten as**

$$
\pi (T)=N\cdot[S_{T}+2\cdot m a x (S_{T}-S_{0}, 0)-3\cdot m a x (S_{T}-K_{1}, 0)]
$$

**The PLUS security is long \(e^{-y}N\) units of the underlying index, \(2 N\) units of an at the money call option and short \(3 N\) units of a call option with strike price \(K_{1}\).**

#### (b) Use the Black and Scholes model to price the identified simpler securities.

**Assuming the PLUS was issued on February 18, 2024, \(N=0.0020\) and \(K_{1}=5,317.27\). To price the at the money option I use the implied volatility for a February 2025 call option with strike equal to 5000: \(\sigma^{A T M}=17.2\%\). For the OTM option I use the implied volatility for a February 2025 call option with strike equal to 5300: \(\sigma^{O T M}=15.1\%\). The prices of the options are:**

$$
C^{A T M}=418.26{\mathrm{~and~}}c^{O T M}=235.01
$$

**Hence:**

$$
V^{P L U S}=N\cdot\left[e^{-y}S_{0}+2\cdot c^{A T M}-3\cdot c^{O T M}\right]=10.114
$$

#### (c) Adjust the parameters to obtain a value equal to the issue price.

**In the prospectus the security is sold for 10 dollars, but according to the model the value is actually greater than par. In order to increase its value we can change the strike price of the OTM option by decreasing the maximum payo\! Currently set at 11.9. Let \(C\) be the maximum payo\! . Changing this value implicitly changes the strike price, \(K_{1}\), of the OTM option. The value of \(C\) that sets the PLUS security value to \$10 is \(C=11.61\) implying a value of \(K_{1}^{\prime}=5,268.42\). By decreasing \(C\) the upside potential of the security is decreased as shown in Figure (4).**

**(Figure 4: PLUS payo\! Change with C=11.61)**

**(2) The sensitivity of the PLUS to changes in the underlying is given by**

$$
\begin{array}{l c l}{\displaystyle\frac{\partial V^{P L U S}}{\partial S}}& {{=}} &{\displaystyle\frac{\partial N\cdot\left[S+2\cdot c^{A T M}-3\cdot c^{O T M}\right]}{\partial S}=}\ {\displaystyle}& {{=}} & {{N\cdot\left[\frac{e^{-y}\partial S}{\partial S}+2\cdot\frac{\partial c^{A T M}} {\partial S}-3\cdot\frac{\partial c^{O T M}}{\partial S}\right]=}\ {\displaystyle}& {{=}} &{N\cdot\left[e^{-y}+2\cdot e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{A T M}\right)-3\cdot e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{O T M}\right)\right]}}\end{array}
$$

**remember that \(d_{1}\) is a function of \(S\) and \(K\) is given by**

$$
D_{1}(S, K)=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
D_{1}^{A T M}=d_{1}(S, S_{0})=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{S_{0}}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
D_{1}^{O T M}=d_{1}(S, K_{1})=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{K_{1}}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

**for \(S~=~S_{0}\) we get \(e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{A T M}\right)=0.621\) and \(e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{O^{\prime}I^{\prime}M}\right)=0.447\). Therefore \(\frac{\partial V^{P L U S}}{\partial S}=0.00177\). (In this calculation I used the appropriate implied volatility for each option.)**

**To compute the beta of the PLUS use the formula**

$$
\beta^{P L U S}=\frac{\frac{d V^{P L U S}}{V^{P L U S}}}{\frac{d S}{S}}=\frac{d V^{P L U S}}{d S}\cdot\frac{S}{V^{P L U S}}=0.0020\cdot\frac{S}{V^{P L U S}}
$$

**that results in**

$$
\beta^{P L U S}=0.0020\cdot\frac{5000.57}{10.114}=0.88
$$

**which is less than 1. At the current level of the S&P 500 the security is less risky than the S&P 500 itself.**

**Computing the value of beta for di\! Erent values of \(S\) (keeping the same implied volatilities used to compute option prices) and for di\! Erent times to maturity (see Figure 5), we see that as we approach maturity, the beta of the PLUS increases substantially in the region between \(S_{0}\) and \(K_{1}\).**

**This happens because between \(S_{0}\) and \(K_{1}\) the PLUS security is a leveraged investment (the slope of the payo\! Increases in that region since the at the money option becomes in the money). In may be helpful to see how the value of the security changes when the value of the underlying changes at di\! Erent points in time. This is shown in Figure 6.**

**(Figure 5: PLUS beta for di\! Erent values of \(S\) and \(t\))**

**(Figure 6: PLUS value for di\! Erent values of \(S\) and \(t\))**

## 1 Part 1: American Options

**Let \(S_{0}=100\), and consider a 3-period binomial tree model in which in every period, 1-year long, there is 60% chance of \(u=1.1\) increase, or a 40% chance of \(d=1/u\) decrease. Assume that the stock pays no dividends, and the continuously compounded interest rate is 2%.**

**(a) Compute the value of an American call and put option with strike price \(K=100\) (at-the-money).**
**(b) Are the American options computed in point (a) exercised before maturity? Discuss the intuition.**
**(c) Let the continuously compounded interest rate be 5%. What are the values of the two ATM American options? Compute the times of early exercise and discuss.**
**(d) In case (a)-(b), with interest rate still at \(r=2\%\), suppose that the firm now pays a 5% proportional dividend per year. How does your answer to point (c) change? Discuss.**

**American ATM Call value (r=2%): 13.7144**
**American ATM Put value  (r=2%): 5.6753**

**(b) Early Exercise?**

## 2 Valuing and analyzing a structured security

**(a) How can you decompose the PLUS into more basic securities? (Tip: The solution to the Mock Midterm might be helpful...)**
**(b) Use the decomposition obtained in point (2.1. A) and the information obtained in exercise (1) to value the PLUS.**
**(c) If the value you obtain is not at par, what might you modify to make sure the value of the security is par as of today? (Words only, but for a bonus, see if you can actually set the value to par by changing one of the terms.)**

**(2) What is the sensitivity of this security to changes in the underlying stock price? How can you compute its market ”beta”, namely, the percentage sensitivity of the security to percentage changes in the underlying? Compute the ”beta” of the PLUS for several stock prices ”S” as of (a) today, (b) 6 month from now, (c) 1 year from now. Discuss your findings.**

### Solution to Problem 2: Valuing and analyzing a structured security

#### (a) Decompose the PLUS payo\! Into simpler securities.

**The payo\! Of the PLUS security at maturity is**

$$
\pi (T)=\left\{\begin{array}{c c} {{m i n\left[10+10\times3\times\left(\frac{S_{T}-S_{0}} {S_{0}}\right), 11.9\right]}}& {{\quad i f S_{T}>S_{0}} }\ {{10\times\frac{S_{T}} {S_{0}}}}& {{\quad i f S_{T}\le S_{0}} }\end{array}\right.
$$

**Starting with \(S_{T}\leq S_{0}\), this is just a long position in \(\frac{10}{S_{0}}\) units of the index. Let \(\begin{array}{r}{N=\frac{10}{S_{0}}}\end{array}\) be the number of units of the index determined by this part of the payo\! . With the S&P 500 at 5,000.57 N = 0.0020**

**Finding the payo\! For the case when \(S_{T}>S_{0}\) is simpler than it first appears. The trick is to plot the payo\! And to analyze the chart to determine the basic securities. Figure 3 gives the PLUS payo\! For di\! Erent values of \(S_{T}\).**

**(Figure 3: PLUS payo\! Decomposition)**

**We see that there are two points where the slope changes. The first point is \(S_{0}\), while the second is where:**

$$
10+10\times 3\times\frac{S_{T}-S_{0}}{S_{0}}=11.9
$$

**This is where \(S_{T}=5,317.27\). Call this point \(K_{1}\). After \(K_{1}\) the slope is zero.**

**(Table 1 reports the slopes of the PLUS security)**

**(Table 2: Slope when holding \(N\) underlying securities for di\! Erent values of \(S_{T}\))**

**So, the payo\! Of the PLUS can be rewritten as**

$$
\pi (T)=N\cdot[S_{T}+2\cdot m a x (S_{T}-S_{0}, 0)-3\cdot m a x (S_{T}-K_{1}, 0)]
$$

**The PLUS security is long \(e^{-y}N\) units of the underlying index, \(2 N\) units of an at the money call option and short \(3 N\) units of a call option with strike price \(K_{1}\).**

#### (b) Use the Black and Scholes model to price the identified simpler securities.

**Assuming the PLUS was issued on February 18, 2024, \(N=0.0020\) and \(K_{1}=5,317.27\). To price the at the money option I use the implied volatility for a February 2025 call option with strike equal to 5000: \(\sigma^{A T M}=17.2\%\). For the OTM option I use the implied volatility for a February 2025 call option with strike equal to 5300: \(\sigma^{O T M}=15.1\%\). The prices of the options are:**

$$
C^{A T M}=418.26{\mathrm{~and~}}c^{O T M}=235.01
$$

**Hence:**

$$
V^{P L U S}=N\cdot\left[e^{-y}S_{0}+2\cdot c^{A T M}-3\cdot c^{O T M}\right]=10.114
$$

#### (c) Adjust the parameters to obtain a value equal to the issue price.

**In the prospectus the security is sold for 10 dollars, but according to the model the value is actually greater than par. In order to increase its value we can change the strike price of the OTM option by decreasing the maximum payo\! Currently set at 11.9. Let \(C\) be the maximum payo\! . Changing this value implicitly changes the strike price, \(K_{1}\), of the OTM option. The value of \(C\) that sets the PLUS security value to \$10 is \(C=11.61\) implying a value of \(K_{1}^{\prime}=5,268.42\). By decreasing \(C\) the upside potential of the security is decreased as shown in Figure (4).**

**(Figure 4: PLUS payo\! Change with C=11.61)**

**(2) The sensitivity of the PLUS to changes in the underlying is given by**

$$
\begin{array}{l c l}{\displaystyle\frac{\partial V^{P L U S}}{\partial S}}& {{=}} &{\displaystyle\frac{\partial N\cdot\left[S+2\cdot c^{A T M}-3\cdot c^{O T M}\right]}{\partial S}=}\ {\displaystyle}& {{=}} & {{N\cdot\left[\frac{e^{-y}\partial S}{\partial S}+2\cdot\frac{\partial c^{A T M}} {\partial S}-3\cdot\frac{\partial c^{O T M}}{\partial S}\right]=}\ {\displaystyle}& {{=}} &{N\cdot\left[e^{-y}+2\cdot e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{A T M}\right)-3\cdot e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{O T M}\right)\right]}}\end{array}
$$

**remember that \(d_{1}\) is a function of \(S\) and \(K\) is given by**

$$
D_{1}(S, K)=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{K}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
D_{1}^{A T M}=d_{1}(S, S_{0})=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{S_{0}}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

$$
D_{1}^{O T M}=d_{1}(S, K_{1})=\frac{l n\left (\frac{S}{K_{1}}\right)+\left (r-y+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T}{\sigma\cdot\sqrt{T}}
$$

**for \(S~=~S_{0}\) we get \(e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{A T M}\right)=0.621\) and \(e^{-y}N\left (d_{1}^{O^{\prime}I^{\prime}M}\right)=0.447\). Therefore \(\frac{\partial V^{P L U S}}{\partial S}=0.00177\). (In this calculation I used the appropriate implied volatility for each option.)**

**To compute the beta of the PLUS use the formula**

$$
\beta^{P L U S}=\frac{\frac{d V^{P L U S}}{V^{P L U S}}}{\frac{d S}{S}}=\frac{d V^{P L U S}}{d S}\cdot\frac{S}{V^{P L U S}}=0.0020\cdot\frac{S}{V^{P L U S}}
$$

**that results in**

$$
\beta^{P L U S}=0.0020\cdot\frac{5000.57}{10.114}=0.88
$$

**which is less than 1. At the current level of the S&P 500 the security is less risky than the S&P 500 itself.**

**Computing the value of beta for di\! Erent values of \(S\) (keeping the same implied volatilities used to compute option prices) and for di\! Erent times to maturity (see Figure 5), we see that as we approach maturity, the beta of the PLUS increases substantially in the region between \(S_{0}\) and \(K_{1}\).**

**This happens because between \(S_{0}\) and \(K_{1}\) the PLUS security is a leveraged investment (the slope of the payo\! Increases in that region since the at the money option becomes in the money). In may be helpful to see how the value of the security changes when the value of the underlying changes at di\! Erent points in time. This is shown in Figure 6.**

**(Figure 5: PLUS beta for di\! Erent values of \(S\) and \(t\))**

**(Figure 6: PLUS value for di\! Erent values of \(S\) and \(t\))**

## 2 Part 2: Citigroup’s Default Probability during the Credit Crisis

**It is Feb 2009, and you have been hired by the US Government to evaluate the e↵ectiveness of the Paulson’s plan to save the banks, a plan that was announced on October 13 2010. In particular, you have been assigned to evaluate the impact of the Paulson’s plan on Citigroup’s probability of default. In this homework you must compute the (true) probability of default of Citigroup by using the KMV model. The file HW 7 data. Xls contains important information about Citigroup (as well as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, but computing their probability of default is optional). In addition, it contains a simple solver to compute the Implied Volatility and Implied Stock value to match both a call option value and its volatility (see Teaching Notes 9). As you will see, you will need a lot of assumptions to use the KMV model, and so make sure to write the assumptions you make in your report (see below for some tips). For instance, how do you treat deposits and short-term debt?**

**Please, compute the probabilities of default at the following two dates:**

**10/10/2008 The day before the government announcement of the bailout program.**
**10/14/2008 The day after the announcement.**

**Proceed as follows:**

**• Compute the number of shares (you will need them to compute the market capitalization in the next point.)**
**• Compute the value of assets and volatility of assets to match the market cap and equity volatility at the two dates above. The assets and volatility of assets will be di↵erent across dates. Please, note the tips at the end.**
**• Compute the probability of default with one year to maturity. Note that KMV identifies the “Default Point” as short term debt + 1/2 long term debt.**

**After you do the calculations above, answer the following:**

**(a) What was the e↵ect of the bailout announcement on the probability of default? Discuss.**
**(b) How does your answer to point (a) changes if you keep the volatility of assets \(\sigma\) constant to the value estimated on 10/10/2008 when you recompute the asset value at time 10/14/2008? (it is a simple change in the solver: only change assets but not volatility) Provide an intuition for the di↵erence with (a).**
**(c) What was the credit spread before and after the announcement (choose what you think is most reasonable of your answers in (a) or (b), if you find any di↵erence).**
**(d) The Paulson’s Plan promised Citigroup a cash infusion of 25 billion from the US Treasury. Consider your calculated asset and equity values on 10/10/2008, and assume Citi suddenly gets the 25 bil cash infusion. What is the transfer to bond holders, if any? Discuss.**

### Solution to Problem 2: Citigroup’s Default Probability using KMV

**• We can start by computing the number of shares using the market capitalization and the stock price on Feb 13 2009. We get (in billions)**

$$
N={\frac{M C a p}{S}}={\frac{19.02}{3.49}}=5.450
$$

**• To compute the value of assets and volatility of assets we follow the procedure described at the end of the directions. It is worth it though to quickly describe the theoretical framework that we follow. In a nutshell we solve a system of two equations in two unknowns. Since this system is a bit more complicated than the classical systems we have seen, we need to use a solver.**

**What are the two equations and the two unknowns? We need to find the value of assets \(V_{A}\) and the volatility of assets \(\sigma_{A}\). These are our unknowns. What are the equations? The Merton Model says that we can consider the equity of a firm as a call option on its assets, with strike price equal to the face value of the debt. If we make reasonable assumptions and we assume that assets returns are log-normally distributed, we can use the Black and Scholes formula to price the option. So we can already write**

$$
V_{E}=B S C
$$

**where \(B S C\) means “Black-Scholes-Merton Call”. This is one of our two equations.**

**What are the inputs that we need to apply the Black and Scholes (and Merton) formula? We need the value of the underlying (\(V_{A}\)), the strike price (\(K\)), the risk free rate \((r)\), the annualized volatility of the returns of the underlying (\(O_{A}\)) and the maturity of the option (\(T\)). So \(^{2}\) we can write**

$$
V_{E}=B S C\left (V_{A}, K, r,\sigma_{A}, T\right)
$$

**indeed the two unknowns \(V_{A}\) and \(\sigma_{A}\) appear in equation (2).**

**What is the second equation? The idea is if equity is a call option on a firms’ assets, then the volatility of equity (that is the volatility of the call) is related to the volatility of the underlying (that is the volatility of the assets) according to some determined equation. Under the assumptions above, the volatility of equity is:**

$$
\sigma_{E}=\left (\frac{V_{A}\cdot N (d_{1})}{V_{A}\cdot N (d_{1})-K\cdot e^{-r\cdot T}\cdot N (d_{2})}\right)\cdot\sigma_{A}
$$

**which is our second equation.**

**Where do we get the other parameters? Some of them are easy to get (like \(V_{E}\), that is the market capitalization, or \(\sigma_{E}\) which can be computed using historical data), but for some others we need to make assumptions.**

**For example what’s the strike price of the option? This should be “the face value of the Debt.” But the Debt is not a zero coupon bond, since it pays coupons! We just pick a value assuming that it is a zero coupon bond...”. A similar reasoning is followed for the other parameters.**

**Let’s get back to Citi case. We use the Excel file to compute both \(V_{A}\) and \(\sigma_{A}\). Let’s start with the inputs: for the strike price (cell B 6), what value do we use? We have information on deposits, short term debt, long term debt and other liabilities. The directions tells us to assume that the short term debt is paid out immediately. Why so? Simply because we are making adjustments that will let equity resemble a call option as much as possible in the case of a bank. The idea is that with banks deposits and short-term debt will flee the bank when trouble approaches so that they will be repaid in full no matter what. For example these will be repaid by cash and other short-term securities on the balance sheet. What’s left? We still have long term debt, other liabilities and the equity. Equity is still a call option, but it is a call option on a smaller firm; the underlying security for the option is the residual (after short term debt has been paid) assets of the firm, that we can denote by \(V_{R A}\). We can still use our system of equations, but we have to be careful with the parameters**

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c}{V_{E}=B S C\left (V_{R A}, K, r,\sigma_{R A}, T\right)}\ {\mathrm{~}}\ {\sigma_{E}=\left (\frac{V_{A}\cdot N\left (d_{1}\right)}{V_{R A}\cdot N\left (d_{1}\right)-K\cdot e^{-r\cdot T}\cdot N\left (d_{2}\right)}\right)\cdot\sigma_{R A}}\end{array}\right.
$$

**We assume that the volatility of assets remains the same after having paid the short term debt, so we can safely write \(\sigma_{R A}=\sigma_{A}\). Now that we don’t have the short term debt any more it’s easier to think about Citi equity as an option. What’s the strike? We need to make an assumption. We can assume for instance that the residual debt (that is long term debt + other liabilities) is a zero coupon bond, with face value equal to \(K=L T+O L=791.79\). And the maturity? Let’s assume \(T=7\). Below is a table showing how the results would have changed for di↵erent values of \(T\)). What about the risk free rate? We get it from the Excel file (I assume that it is annually compounded. Note that we have two interest rates, one for each date, that are r 110 \(r_{1}^{10/10}=3.27\%\) and \(r_{1}^{10/14}=3.48\%\)). Same for the volatility of equity, we have \(\sigma 1 E 0/10 = 1.7551\) and \(\sigma 1 E 0 /14 = 1.8947\). We are now ready to use the solver. Here are the steps (for Oct 10 only. You can do the same for Oct 14 and check the results):**

**– Strike price: Cell B 6 equal to 791.79**
**– Maturity: Cell B 7 equal to 7**
**– Continuously compounded risk free rate: Cell B 8 equal to \(l n (1+0.0327)=0.0322\)**
**– Dividend yield: Cell B 9 equal to 0**
**– Call Price: this is the market value (that is the market capitalization) of equity. We get \(M C a p^{10/10}=S^{10/10}\cdot N=75.75\), so Cell B 10 equal to 75.75**
**– Vol Call: this is the volatility of the call option, that is the volatility of equity. Cell B 11 equal to 1.7551**
**– Adj. Vol Call: this cell, as explained, allows us to adjust the formula for the volatility of assets. You need to plug the short term debt (that is short term borrowings + deposits). Cell B 12 equal to 1,132.617**
**– Call the solver: (Excel 2003 shortcut ALT + T, V)**

**– Setup the solver: Target Cell is B 26 (simply write “TargetCall”); “By changing cells”: write “S 2, sig 2 c”. Note: you don’t need to be an Excel genius to do this, since everything was written in the cells highlighted in purple.**

**– Run the solver: press Enter**

**We can read the results in cells E 5 and E 6. We find that the value of the residual assets is \(V_{R A}^{10/10}=583.75\) and that the volatility of residual assets (that is the same, by assumption as the volatility of assets) is**

$$
\sigma_{R A}^{10/10}=\sigma_{A}^{10/10}=0.1539
$$

**We need one last step, that is computing the value of assets V A 10 \(V_{A}^{10/10}\). Since \(V_{R A}=V_{A}-S-D\), then**

$$
V_{A}^{10/10}=V_{R A}^{10/10}+S+D=583.75+1,132.62=1,716.37
$$

**Applying this same procedure for Oct 14 2008 we get**

$$
\sigma_{R A}^{10/14}=\sigma_{A}^{10/14}=0.2098
$$

$$
V_{A}^{10/14}=1,692.51
$$

**• According to KMV model, the default probability in \(T_{d}\) years (or expected default frequency) is given by**

$$
P_{T_{d}}=N\left (-d_{2}^{d}\right)
$$

**with \(d_{2}^{d}\) being the distance to default defined as**

$$
D_{2}^{d}=\frac{l n\left (\frac{V_{A_{0}}}{F}\right)+\left (\mu-\frac{\sigma_{A}^{2}}{2}\right)\cdot T d}{\sigma_{A}\cdot\sqrt{T_{d}}}
$$

**where \(V_{A_{0}}\) is the value of assets, \(F\) is the default point, \(\mu\) is the expected risk natural return of assets and \(\sigma_{A}\) is the volatility of assets. We have computed \(V_{A_{0}}\) and \(\sigma_{A}\). In addition we know that according to KMV**

$$
F=S T D+\frac{1}{2}\cdot L T D
$$

**we just need to make an assumption about \(\mu\). It is reasonable to assume \(\mu=0.15\) (same as the value used in the Teaching Notes for Enron). We can thus compute \(d_{2}^{d}\) and \(N\left (d_{2}^{d}\right)\) for both days. We find (I will simplify the notation taking out the \(d\) superscript)**

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c} {{d_{2}^{10/10}=1.6509}} \ {{}} \ {{N\left(-d_{2}^{10/10}\right)=0.0494}} \end{array}\right.
$$

**and**

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c} {{d_{2}^{10/14}=1.096}} \ {{{}} }\ {{N\left(-d_{2}^{10/14}\right)=0.1365}} \end{array}\right.
$$

**(a) Effect of the bailout announcement:**

    Print ("  This indicates that after the bailout announcement, market–implied default risk decreased.\n")
```

**The computed default probability falls from 4.94% on 10/10/2008 to 13.65% on 10/14/2008.**
**This indicates that after the bailout announcement, market–implied default risk increased.**

**(b) Now, suppose we hold sigma_V constant at the 10/10/2008 value when re-solving for V on 10/14/2008.**

## 2 Part 2: Citigroup’s Default Probability during the Credit Crisis

**(a) What was the e↵ect of the bailout announcement on the probability of default? Discuss.**
**(b) How does your answer to point (a) changes if you keep the volatility of assets \(\sigma\) constant to the value estimated on 10/10/2008 when you recompute the asset value at time 10/14/2008? (it is a simple change in the solver: only change assets but not volatility) Provide an intuition for the di↵erence with (a).**
**(c) What was the credit spread before and after the announcement (choose what you think is most reasonable of your answers in (a) or (b), if you find any di↵erence).**
**(d) The Paulson’s Plan promised Citigroup a cash infusion of 25 billion from the US Treasury. Consider your calculated asset and equity values on 10/10/2008, and assume Citi suddenly gets the 25 bil cash infusion. What is the transfer to bond holders, if any? Discuss.**

### Solution to Problem 2: Citigroup’s Default Probability using KMV

**(a) Effect of the bailout announcement:**
**(The computed default probability falls from 4.94% on 10/10/2008 to 13.65% on 10/14/2008.**
**This indicates that after the bailout announcement, market–implied default risk increased.)**

**(b) Now, suppose we hold sigma_V constant at the 10/10/2008 value when re-solving for V on 10/14/2008.**
**(That is, we force sigma_V = sigma_V1 and re-solve for V only.)**

**(2b) With sigma_V held constant at the 10/10/2008 value:**
**New implied asset value on 10/14/2008: V = 1760.8902 billion USD**
**d2 = 1.9275, so default probability PD = 2.70%**
**Compared to the unconstrained case, forcing sigma_V constant yields a different default probability.**
**Intuition: Holding asset volatility fixed ignores any improvement in risk perception reflected in sigma_E.**

**(c) Credit Spread: A rough approximation (in continuous time) is:**
**Spread ≈ -ln(1-PD). Compute for the two cases.**

**(2c) Credit Spreads (approximate):**
**Before the announcement (10/10/2008): 5.06%**
**After the announcement (10/14/2008):  14.69%**
**(Here, a lower default probability implies a lower credit spread.)**

**(d) Effect of a \$25 billion cash infusion on 10/10/2008 balance sheet.**

**(2d) Suppose that on 10/10/2008, Citigroup receives a \$25 billion cash infusion.**
**New asset value V_new = 1741.3700 billion USD**
**New d2 = 1.8050, so new default probability PD = 3.55%**
**Increase in bondholders' claim = 25.0000 billion USD**
**Thus, the cash infusion transfers approximately \$25 billion in asset value to bondholders, reducing Citigroup's default probability further.**
