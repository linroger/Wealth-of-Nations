The Auto callable Barrier Notes with Step-up Premium (each a ‚ÄúNote‚Äù and collectively the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù) offered hereunder will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of the Notes or passed upon the accuracy or the adequacy of this document,  the accompanying prospectus,  prospectus supplement or Equity Index Underlying Supplement. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

We have appointed HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.,  an affiliate of ours,  as the agent for the sale of the Notes. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Will purchase the Notes from us for distribution to other registered broker-dealers or will offer the Notes directly to investors. In addition,  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Or another of its affiliates or agents may use the pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates in market-making transactions in any Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent inform you otherwise in the confirmation of sale,  the pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates is being used in a market-making transaction. See ‚ÄúSupplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)‚Äù on page FWP-17 of this document.

The Estimated Initial Value of the Notes on the Pricing Date is expected to be between $\S850.00$ and $\S950.00$ per Note,  which will be less than the price to public. The market value of the Notes at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted with accuracy. See ‚ÄúEstimated Initial Value‚Äù on page FWP-5 and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù beginning on page FWP-9 of this document for additional information.

# The Notes

The Notes may be suitable for investors who believe that the value of the Underlying s will not decrease significantly over the term of the Notes.

If the Official Closing Level of each Underlying is at or above its Call Threshold on any Call Observation Date beginning on December 29,  2021,  your Notes will be automatically called and you will receive a payment equal to $100\%$ of the Principal Amount,  together with the applicable Call Premium on the corresponding Call Payment Date. If the Notes are not called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value,  you will receive a Payment at Maturity equal to $100\%$ of the Principal Amount. If the Notes are not called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value,  you not receive the Call Premium and will lose $1\%$ of your principal for every $1\%$ decline of that Least Performing Underlying from its Initial Value. In that case,  you will lose up to $100\%$ of the Principal Amount at maturity.

# Illustration of Payment Scenarios

Your payment on the Notes will depend on whether the Notes have been called,  including on the Final Valuation Date,  and whether the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value. If your Notes are not called,  you will lose some or all of your Principal Amount at maturity if the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value.

# RISK FACTORS

We urge you to read the section ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù beginning on page S-1 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and page S-1 of the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement. You should understand the risks of investing in the Notes and should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration,  with your advisors,  of the suitability of the Notes in light of your particular financial circumstances and the information set forth in this document and the accompanying prospectus,  prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement. In addition to the risks discussed below,  you should review ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in the accompanying prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement including the explanation of risks relating to the Notes described in the following sections:

\` ‚Äú‚ÄîRisks Relating to All Note Issuances‚Äù in the prospectus supplement; and

 \` ‚Äú‚ÄîGeneral Risks Related to Indices‚Äù in the Equity Index Underlying Supplement.

You will be subject to significant risks not associated with conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt securities.

Risks Relating to the Structure or Features of the Notes

The Notes do not guarantee any return of principal and you may lose all of your Principal Amount.

The Notes do not guarantee any return of principal. The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that we will not pay you $100\%$ of the Principal Amount of your Notes if the Notes are not called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value. In this case,  the Payment at Maturity you will be entitled to receive will be less than the Principal Amount and you will lose $1\%$ for each $1\%$ that the Reference Return of the Least Performing Underlying is less than $0.00\%$ . You may lose up to $100\%$ of your investment at maturity.

You may not receive the Call Premium.

The Notes may not be called,  and in such a case you will not receive the Call Premium. If the Official Closing Level of the Least Performing Underlying on the Final Valuation Date is less than its Barrier Level,  we will not pay you the Call Premium at maturity,  you will not receive a positive return on the Notes,  and you will lose some or all of your principal amount.

Your return on the Notes is limited to the Principal Amount plus the Call Premium,  if any,  regardless of any appreciation in the value of any Underlying.

If the Notes are called,  for each $\mathbb{S}1{, }000$ Principal Amount,  you will receive $\mathbb{\S}1{, }000$ the plus the applicable Call Premium,  regardless of any appreciation in the value of any Underlying,  which may be significant. Accordingly,  the return on the Notes may be significantly less than the return on a direct investment in the stocks included in the Underlying s during the term of the Notes.

Since the Notes are linked to the performance of more than one Underlying,  you will be fully exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the value of each Underlying.

Since the Notes are linked to the performance of more than one Underlying,  the Notes will be linked to the individual performance of each Underlying. Because the Notes are not linked to a basket,  in which the risk is mitigated and diversified among all of the components of a basket,  you will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the value of each Underlying. For example,  in the case of notes linked to a basket,  the return would depend on the aggregate performance of the basket components reflected as the basket return. Thus,  the depreciation of any basket component could be mitigated by the appreciation of another basket component. However,  in the case of these Notes,  the individual performance of each of the Underlying s would not be combined to calculate your return and the depreciation of either Underlying would not be mitigated by the appreciation of the other Underlying. Instead,  your return would depend on the Least Performing Underlying.

Because the Notes are linked to the performance of the Least Performing Underlying,  you are exposed to greater risks of not receiving the Call Premium and sustaining a significant loss on your investment than if the Notes were linked to just one Underlying.

The risk that you will not receive the Call Premium,  or that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment,  is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of just one Underlying. With multiple Underlying s,  it is more likely that one of the Underlying s will close below its respective Call Threshold on any of the Call Observation Dates (including the Final Valuation Date) and below its respective Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date,  than if the Notes were linked to only one Underlying. In addition,  because each Underlying must close above its Call Threshold on a Call Observation Date in order for the Notes to be called,  the Notes are less likely to be called than if the Notes were linked to just one Underlying. Therefore,  it is more likely that you will not receive the Call Premium,  and that you will suffer a significant loss on your investment.

# If the Notes are not called,  your return will be based on the Reference Return of the Least Performing Underlying

If the Notes are not called,  your return will be based on the Reference Return of the Least Performing Underlying without regard to the performance of any other Underlying. As a result,  you could lose all or some of your initial investment if the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value,  even if there is an increase in the value of any other Underlying. This could be the case even if any other Underlying increased by an amount greater than the decrease in the Least Performing Underlying.

# Higher Call Premiums or lower Barrier Values are generally associated with Underlying s with greater expected volatility and therefore can indicate a greater risk of loss

"Volatility" refers to the frequency and magnitude of changes in the value of an Underlying. The greater the expected volatility with respect to an Underlying on the Pricing Date,  the higher the expectation as of the Pricing Date that the value of that Underlying could close below its Call Threshold on a Call Observation Date or its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date,  indicating a higher expected risk of non-payment of Call Premiums or loss on the Notes. This greater expected risk will generally be reflected in a higher Call Premium than the yield payable on our conventional debt securities with a similar maturity,  or in more favorable terms (such as a lower Barrier Value or a higher Call Premium ) than for similar securities linked to the performance of an Underlying with a lower expected volatility as of the Pricing Date. You should therefore understand that a relatively higher Call Premium may indicate an increased risk of loss. Further,  a relatively lower Barrier Value may not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihood of a repayment of principal at maturity. The volatility of an Underlying can change significantly over the term of the Notes. The value of an Underlying for your Notes could fall sharply,  which could result in a significant loss of principal. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of the Least Performing Underlying,  including the potential of not receiving a Call Premium and losing some or all of your principal at maturity.

# The amount payable on the Notes is not linked to the values of the Underlying s at any time other than the Call Observation Dates,  including the Final Valuation Date

The payments on the Notes will be based on the Official Closing Levels of the Underlying s on the Call Observation Dates,  including the Final Valuation Date,  subject to postponement for non-trading days and certain Market Disruption Events. Even if the value of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Call Threshold during the term of the Notes other than on a Call Observation Date but then decreases on a Call Observation Date to a value that is less than its Call Threshold,  the Call Premium will not be payable for the relevant Call Payment Date. Similarly,  if the Notes are not called,  even if the value of the Least Performing Underlying is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value during the term of the Notes other than on the Final Valuation Date but then decreases on the Final Valuation Date to a value that is less than its Barrier Value,  the Payment at Maturity will be less,  possibly significantly less,  than it would have been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the value of the Least Performing Underlying prior to such decrease. Although the actual values of the Underlying s on the Maturity Date or at other times during the term of the Notes may be higher than their respective values on the Call Observation Dates,  whether a Call Premium will be payable and the Payment at Maturity will be based solely on the Official Closing Levels of the Underlying s on the applicable Call Observation Dates.

# Risks Relating to the Reference Asset

Changes that affect an Underlying may affect the value of an Underlying and the market value of the Notes and the amount you will receive on the Notes and the amount you will receive at maturity.

The policies of the reference sponsor of an Underlying concerning additions,  deletions and substitutions of the stocks included in an Underlying,  and the manner in which the reference sponsor takes account of certain changes affecting those stocks,  may affect the value of an Underlying. The policies of the reference sponsor with respect to the calculation of an Underlying could also affect the value of an Underlying. The reference sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or dissemination of an Underlying. Any such actions could affect the value of an Underlying and the value of and the return on the Notes.

# Small-capitalization risk

The RTY tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization. These companies often have greater stock price volatility,  lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies and therefore the level of the RTY may be more volatile than an investment in stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments,  and the stocks of small-capitalization companies may be thinly traded,  making it difficult for the RTY to track them. In addition,  small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel,  making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early,  and less predictable,  periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues,  less diverse product lines,  smaller shares of their product or service markets,  fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

# General Risk Factors

# The Notes are subject to the credit risk of HSBC USA Inc

The Notes are senior unsecured debt obligations of the Issuer,  HSBC,  and are not,  either directly or indirectly,  an obligation of any third party. As further described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus,  the Notes will rank on par with all of the other unsecured and un subordinated debt obligations of HSBC,  except such obligations as may be preferred by operation of law. Any payment to be made on the Notes,  including any return of principal at maturity,  depends on the ability of HSBC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a result,  the actual and perceived credit worthiness of HSBC may affect the market value of the Notes and,  in the event HSBC were to default on its obligations,  you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

# The Notes are not insured or guaranteed by any governmental agency of the United States or any other jurisdiction

The Notes are not deposit liabilities or other obligations of a bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or program of the United States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the Notes is subject to the credit risk of HSBC,  and in the event that HSBC is unable to pay its obligations as they become due,  you may not receive the full payments due on the Notes.

The Estimated Initial Value of the Notes,  which will be determined by us on the Pricing Date,  is expected to be less than the price to public and may differ from the market value of the Notes in the secondary market,  if any.

The Estimated Initial Value of the Notes will be calculated by us on the Pricing Date and is expected to be less than the price to public. The Estimated Initial Value will reflect our internal funding rate,  which is the borrowing rate we pay to issue market-linked securities,  as well as the mid-market value of the embedded derivatives in the Notes. This internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities. As a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities,  the Estimated Initial Value of the Notes may be lower if it were based on the prices at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market. In addition,  if we were to use the rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances,  we would expect the economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you. We will determine the value of the embedded derivatives in the Notes by reference to our or our affiliates‚Äô internal pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables,  which can include volatility and interest rates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the Notes that are different from our Estimated Initial Value. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events,  which may prove to be incorrect. The Estimated Initial Value does not represent a minimum price at which we or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase your Notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time.

# The price of your Notes in the secondary market,  if any,  immediately after the Pricing Date is expected to be less than the price to public

The price to public takes into account certain costs. These costs,  which will be used or retained by us or one of our affiliates,  include the underwriting discount,  our affiliates‚Äô projected hedging profits (which may or may not be realized) for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations under the Notes,  and the costs associated with structuring and hedging our obligations under the Notes. If you were to sell your Notes in the secondary market,  if any,  the price you would receive for your Notes may be less than the price you paid for them because secondary market prices will not take into account these costs. The price of your Notes in the secondary market,  if any,  at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors,  including the values of the Underlying s and changes in market conditions,  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments,  and you should,  therefore,  be able and willing to hold the Notes to maturity. Any sale of the Notes prior to maturity could result in a loss to you.

# If we were to repurchase your Notes immediately after the Original Issue Date,  the price you receive may be higher than the Estimated Initial Value of the Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Original Issue Date,  the price at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. May initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market,  if any,  and the value that may initially be used for customer account statements,  if any,  may exceed the Estimated Initial Value on the Pricing Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 6 months after the Original Issue Date. This temporary price difference may exist because,  in our discretion,  we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We will make such discretionary election and determine this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors,  including the tenor of the Notes and any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period,  and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Original Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

# You will not have any ownership interest in the stocks included in an Underlying

As a holder of the Notes,  you will not have any ownership interest in the stocks included in an Underlying,  such as rights to vote,  dividend payments or other distributions. Because the return on the Notes will not reflect any dividends on those stocks,  the Notes may under perform an investment in the stocks included in an Underlying.

# The Notes lack liquidity

The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Is not required to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market,  if any exists. Even if there is a secondary market,  it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes,  the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price,  if any,  at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Is willing to buy the Notes.

# Potential conflicts of interest may exist

An affiliate of HSBC has a minority equity interest in the owner of an electronic platform,  through which we may make available certain structured investments offering materials. HSBC and its affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes,  including acting as calculation agent and hedging our obligations under the Notes. In performing these duties,  the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes. We will not have any obligation to consider your interests as a holder of the Notes in taking any action that might affect the value of your Notes.

# Uncertain tax treatment

For a discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in a Note,  please see the discussion under ‚ÄúU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations‚Äù herein and the discussion under ‚ÄúU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations‚Äù in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

# ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES

The following table and examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are hypothetical. They do not purport to be representative of every possible scenario concerning increases or decreases in the value of any Underlying relative to its Initial Value. We cannot predict the Official Closing Level of an Underlying on any Call Observation Date,  including the Final Valuation Date. The assumptions we have made in connection with the illustrations set forth below may not reflect actual events. You should not take this illustration or these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Underlying s or the return on the Notes .

The table and examples below illustrate how the Call Premium and the Payment at Maturity would be calculated with respect to a $\mathbb{S}1{, }000$ investment in the Notes,  given a range of hypothetical performances of any Underlying. The hypothetical returns on the Notes below are numbers,  expressed as percentages,  that result from comparing the Payment at Maturity per $\mathbb{S}1{, }000$ Principal Amount to $\mathbb{S}1{, }000$ . The numbers appearing in the following table and examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis. The following table and examples assume the following:

\* The hypothetical Initial Value of 1, 000.00 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual Initial Value of any Underlying. The actual Initial Value of each Underlying will be determined on the Pricing Date and set forth in the final pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates.

Example 1‚ÄîThe Official Closing Level of each Underlying on the first Call Observation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Threshold.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e69955829282e40fc75c782e31d34214f32489f7c9ae910e4e45accbd6697300.jpg)

Because the Official Closing Level of each Underlying on the first Call Observation Date is at or above its Call Threshold,  the Notes will be called and you will receive $\S1{, }075.00$ per Note,  reflecting the Principal Amount plus the applicable Call Premium,  resulting in a $7.50\%$ return on the Notes. No extra payment will be made on account of each Underlying closing above its respective Initial Value.

Example 2‚ÄîThe Official Closing Level of each Underlying on the Final Valuation Date is greater than or equal to its Call Threshold.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/9986841f1a945e7a09b4042fa3a99b9d9bc1469ad3d5a1e4ed7132c044ef2e3e.jpg)

Because the Official Closing Level of each Underlying on the Final Valuation Date is at or above its Call Threshold,  the Notes will be called and you will receive $\$ 1{, }225.00\$ per Note,  reflecting the Principal Amount plus the applicable Call Premium,  resulting in a $22.50\%$ return on the Notes. No extra payment will be made on account of each Underlying closing above its respective Initial Value.

Example 3‚Äî The Notes are not called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is greater than or equal to its Barrier Value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/dd74503089221322cc5035d26bf570a8f714efb24d4e4ddc2abb14bf88cbd65a.jpg)

RTY is the Least Performing Underlying.

Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less its Call Threshold but greater than or equal to the Barrier Value,  you will receive $\S1{, }000{.}00$ per Note,  reflecting the Principal Amount,  resulting in a $0.00\%$ return on the Notes,  even though the value of the Least Performing Underlying has declined.

Example 4 ‚Äî The Notes are not called,  and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f2fc278f1fe03c6a30c4edc9921e1aaeb2ccb45909308b874c19e6c628f68759.jpg)

RTY is the Least Performing Underlying.

Because the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value,  you will receive $\S420.00$ per $\mathbb{S}1{, }000$ Principal Amount,  calculated as follows:

You will not receive a Call Premium,  resulting in a $-58.00\%$ return on the Notes.

If the Notes are not called and the Final Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Barrier Value,  you will be exposed to any decrease in the value of the Least Performing Underlying on a 1:1 basis and could lose up to $100\%$ of your principal at maturity.

# EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND ACCELERATION

If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an Event of Default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) with respect to the Notes,  the calculation agent will determine the accelerated payment due and payable in the same general manner as described in this document except that in such a case,  the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the date of acceleration will be used as the Final Valuation Date for purposes of determining the Reference Return of an Underlying,  and the accelerated Maturity Date will be three business days after the accelerated Final Valuation Date. If a Market Disruption Event exists with respect to an Underlying on that scheduled trading day,  then the accelerated Final Valuation Date for that Underlying will be postponed for up to five scheduled trading days (in the same manner used for postponing the originally scheduled Final Valuation Date). The accelerated Maturity Date will also be postponed by an equal number of business days following the postponed accelerated Final Valuation Date. For the avoidance of doubt,  if no Market Disruption Event exists with respect to an Underlying on the scheduled trading day preceding the date of acceleration,  the determination of such Underlying‚Äôs Final Value will be made on such date,  irrespective of the existence of a Market Disruption Event with respect to any other Underlying occurring on such date.

If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an Event of Default,  you will not be entitled to any additional payments with respect to the Notes. For more information,  see ‚ÄúDescription of Debt Securities ‚Äî Senior Debt Securities ‚Äî Events of Default‚Äù in the accompanying prospectus.

# SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)

We have appointed HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.,  an affiliate of HSBC,  as the agent for the sale of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement,  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Will purchase the Notes from HSBC at the price to public less the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page of the pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates,  for distribution to other registered broker-dealers or will offer the Notes directly to investors. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Proposes to offer the Notes at the price to public set forth on the cover page of this document. HSBC USA Inc. Or one of our affiliates may pay varying underwriting discounts of up to $2.45\%$ per $\mathbb{\S}1{, }000$ Principal Amount in connection with the distribution of the Notes to other registered broker-dealers.

An affiliate of HSBC has paid or may pay in the future an amount to broker-dealers in connection with the costs of the continuing implementation of systems to support the Notes.

In addition,  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Or another of its affiliates or agents may use the pricing supplement to which this free writing prospectus relates in market-making transactions after the initial sale of the Notes,  but is under no obligation to make a market in the Notes and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice.

See ‚ÄúSupplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)‚Äù on page S-61 in the prospectus supplement.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about the Original Issue Date set forth on the inside cover page of this document,  which is more than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15 c 6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days,  unless the parties to that trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the Original Issue Date will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement,  and should consult their own advisors.

# U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS

There is no direct legal authority as to the proper tax treatment of the Notes,  and therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the Notes. Under one approach,  a Note should be treated as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the Underlying s. We intend to treat the Notes consistent with this approach. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes,  you agree to treat the Notes under this approach for all U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the limitations described therein,  and based on certain factual representations received from us,  in the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel,  Mayer Brown LLP,  it is reasonable to treat a Note as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the Underlying s. Pursuant to this approach,  we do not intend to report any income or gain with respect to the Notes prior to their maturity or an earlier sale,  call or exchange and we intend to treat any gain or loss upon maturity or an earlier sale,  call or exchange as long-term capital gain or loss,  provided you have held the Note for more than one year at such time for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are held by the same United States holder until maturity,  that holder‚Äôs holding period will generally include the maturity date.

We will not attempt to ascertain whether any of the entities whose stock is included in the Underlying s would be treated as a passive foreign investment company (‚ÄúPFIC‚Äù) or United States real property holding corporation (‚ÄúUSRPHC‚Äù),  both as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If one or more of the entities whose stock is included in the Underlying s were so treated,  certain adverse U.S.

Federal income tax consequences might apply. You should refer to information filed with the SEC and other authorities by the entities whose stock is included in the Underlying s and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you if one or more of the entities whose stock is included in the Underlying s is or becomes a PFIC or a USRPHC.

Under current law,  while the matter is not entirely clear,  individual non-U.S. holders,  and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals‚Äô gross estates for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example,  a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual has retained certain interests or powers),  should note that,  absent an applicable treaty benefit,  the Notes are likely to be treated as U.S. situs property,  subject to U.S. federal estate tax. These individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of investing in the Notes.

A ‚Äúdividend equivalent‚Äù payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States and such payments generally would be subject to a $30\%$ U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations,  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (‚ÄúELIs‚Äù) that are ‚Äúspecified ELIs‚Äù may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference an interest in an ‚Äúunderlying security, ‚Äù which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However,  Internal Revenue Service guidance provides that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1,  2023. Based on the Issuer‚Äôs determination that the Notes are not ‚Äúdeltaone‚Äù instruments,  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments,  if any,  under the Notes. However,  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting an Underlying or the Notes,  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter,  or have entered,  into other transactions in respect of an Underlying or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding,  we (or the applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.
