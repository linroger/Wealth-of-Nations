Swap Pricing: Discounted Cashflows  
# Common Swap Structures  
- Basis swap (i.e. floating/floating) is one of the basic building block in fixed/fixed and fixed/floating CCS. - A basis swap in this context is defined as the exchange of LIBORs in two different currencies with both initial and final exchange of principal. - Cost of a basis swap is quoted against USD LIBOR flat (e.g. USD LIBOR vs YEN LIBOR 17 bps) and is driven by demand and supply of - ABC company has 3 year funding in JPY and is required to hedge exchange rate exposure created by this foreign currency debt.

- Compared to a full cross currency swap, a Principal-Only Swap (POS) costs less because a POS does not provide a hedge against exchange rate risks on coupon payments.   
Consider a 3-year USD/JPY sw wit - At maturity, company receives JPY principal and pays USD principal at current spot rate (in fact can be any agreed exchange rate).   
- Same as a long-dated forward contract of the company buying JPY and selling USD at current spot rate.   
Due to the interest rate differential between JPY and USD, forward USD/JPY exchange rate is lower than spot rate (i.e. JPY at premium).   
The contract to buy JPY/sell USD forward at current spot rate has a positive value to the Company.   
- As a compensation to Citibank (i.e. to make NPV = 0), the Company will need to pay a periodic coupon (either in USD or JPY) to Citibank.

- Consider a 3-year USD/JPY swap with only coupon exchanges.  
There are no principal exchanges. If the USD fixed rate is known, we can solve

- A Long-Dated Foreign Exchange (LTFX) contract is a Zero Coupon Currency & Interest Rate Swap - Instead of exchanging coupons, at the time of dealing, the Principal amount on one set of cashflows is set so that the NPV = 0.
