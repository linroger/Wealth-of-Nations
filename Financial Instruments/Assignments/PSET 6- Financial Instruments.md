## 1 IMPLIED VOLATILITY

Replicate the Implied Volatility of Teaching Note 6,  using current options data on S&P 500 maturing in June (3 months or one quarter from now). Please state the assumptions you make,  if any,  to compute the time to maturity of the options,  that is the value of T that you use in your formulas. (No need to use many options. Choose just a few ITM,  OTM and ATM. Note that the current SP 500 index value is on the top right corner of the table.) The spreadsheet "Options. Xls" provides an example of the implied volatility calculation. See the worksheet "Implied Volatility."

ˆ Current Options Data can be found at CBOE. The ticker is SPX.

http://www.cboe.com/DelayedQuote/QuoteTable.aspx

NOTE: I have downloaded all of this data for you! Please see the file "Quote-Data 2024. Xls."

ˆ You can use federal reserve website (link below) to retrieve the value of the risk Free rate. Use the Treasury Constant Maturity rate that most closely matches the Maturity of the options. Note that TCM are compounded annually,  so be sure to Make the relevant adjustments. Please report the value of the rate that you use. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/Current/

ˆ The dividend yield can be estimated using the data collected by Robert Shiller which are available at the link below. You can estimate the dividend yield as the average dividend yield over the last available 12 months. Be sure to make the relevant compounding adjustments and report the dividend yield that you use.

http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm You should use the data in the "Excel file" used in his book. This gives monthly prices,  dividends,  earnings and other information.

> [!NOTE]
> Risk free rate: Interest rate on 3 month Treasury constant maturities as of 12 February,  2024 = 0.0543,  annually compounded
> - We chose this Treasury because it's maturity closely matches the maturity of the options expiring on June 21 and June 28,  2024.
> - The risk-free rate,  continuously compounded,  is$$e^{r=}1.0543$$
> - $$r=\ln(1.0543)=0.05288$$Average monthly dividend yield on SP 500 from Feb 28,  2023 to Jan 31,  2024 is 0.01621075
> 	- The continuously compounded dividend yield = 0.01608

## 2 VALUING AND ANALYZING A STRUCTURED SECURITY

- (1) A wealthy investor hires you to help her evaluate a recent security issued by Morgan Stanley,  called PLUS (see prospectus: The security was issued by Morgan Stanely in April 2008. Assume the same security is issued today and has one-year to Maturity,  but it is otherwise identical). To assess its fair value,  you decide to use the appropriate implied volatility from the options markets as in Exercise (1).
	- (a) How can you decompose the PLUS into more basic securities? (Tip: The Solution to the Mock Midterm might be helpful…)

| Start Date | Feb 12th,    2024 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Maturity Date | Feb 12th,    2025 |
| T | 1 |
| Risk Free Rate | 4.87% (1 yearconstant maturity  Treausry Rate as of Feb,    12th,    2024) |
| Dividend Yield | 1.608% (average dividend yield on SPX over 2023.) |
| Implied Volatility | 16.18% |

| Stock Index Price | B0 | normalized index price |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1329.51 | 0.00752 | 9.997915 |
| 1417 | 0.00752 | 10.65584 |

> [!NOTE]
> - We can decompose the PLUS security into
> 	- a zero coupon bond with face value of 10
> 			-$$B_{Z}= 10 e^{-0.0487*1}$$
> 	- 3 Long At the Money Call Options with Strike Price of 10
> 	- 3 Short Out of the Money Call Options with Strike of 10.65584
> 	- 1 Short At the Money Put Option with Strike Price of 10

- (b) Use the decomposition obtained in point (2.1. A) and the information obtained In exercise (1) to value the PLUS.

> [!NOTE]
> - a zero coupon bond with face value of 10$$B_{Z}= 10 e^{-0.0487*1}=9.52467$$
> 	- 3 Long At the Money Call Options with Strike Price of 10
$$\text{BSCall}(S,   K,   \sigma,   r,   T,   \delta)$$
> $$3 \times \text{BSCall}(10,   10,   16.18\%,   4.87\%,   1.60\%) \approx 0.8 \times 3 = 2.4$$3 Short Out of the Money Call Options with Strike of 10.65584$$3 \times \text{BSCall}(10.65,   10,   16.18\%4.87\%,    1.608\%) \approx -0.17975 \times 3 = -0.539251$$- 2 Short At the Money Put Option with Strike Price of 10
> - $$BSPUT(10,   10,   16.18\%,    4.87\%,    1.60\%)=-0.48$$
> - Total Value of Replicating Portfolio = 9.52467+2.4-0.539-0.48=10.899032

- (c) If the value you obtain is not at par,  what might you modify to make sure the value of the security is par as of today? (Words only,  but for a bonus,  see if you can actually set the value to par by changing one of the terms.)

> [!NOTE]
> I would change the cap on the maximum return. since this would affect the out of the money call option's value. We cannot change the risk free rate,  volatility,  dividend yield,  or stock price,  so our best option is to change the strike price on the out of the money call option which forms the cap of the maximum returns we can earn.

- (2) What is the sensitivity of this security to changes in the underlying stock price? How can you compute its market "beta",  namely,  the **percentage** sensitivity of the security to **percentage** changes in the underlying? Compute the "beta" of the PLUS for several stock prices "S" as of
	- Option elasticity is computed by the percentage change in the option price relative to the percentage change in the stock price. The percentage change in the stock price is change in stock price,  dS divided by$S$. The percentage change in the options price is given by the dollar change in the price of the option,  divided by the option price,  $C$,  or$\frac{dS*\Delta}{C}$The option elasticity is then the percentage change in option price over the percentage change in stock price,  which simplifes to$\frac{S\Delta}{C}$

	- (b) m now,
	-  ![500](attachment/a8921e8205d813706483563730cd7f9b.png)
	- (c) 1 year from now. Discuss your findings.
		- As the PLUS note approaches maturity,  the beta increases,  meaning that it becomes more sensitive to changes in the price of the underlying stock
