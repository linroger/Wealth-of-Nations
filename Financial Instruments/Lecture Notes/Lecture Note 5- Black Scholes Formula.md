- Black,  Scholes and Merton show that (under certain conditions) there exists a trading strategy
involving only stocks and bonds that *replicate* the payoff at$T$of a call or a put option.
- Assume a stock$S_{t}$has constant expected (log) return$µ$and constant volatility σ.
- That is,  if the log return during a small time interval$h$be${} R_t = log\left(\frac{S_{t+h}}{S_t} \right) {}$,  assume
$$E[R_{t}]=\mu\times h;\;\;E[R_{t}^{2}]=\sigma^{2}\times h$$
- (µ and σ are the annualized expected log return and volatility)
- Consider now a put option with strike price K and maturity T.
- The following trading strategy **replicates** the final payoff $max(K − S_T,           0)$.
## OPTION PREMIUM BY DYNAMIC REPLICATION
1. At time 0:
(a) Short$∆0 = −N(−d_{1,          0})$of stocks
- Here$N(x)$is the standard normal cumulative density function,  and$d_{1,          t}$is$$d_{1,          t}=\frac{\ln\left(S_{t}/K\right)+\left(r+\sigma^{2}/2\right)\left(T-t\right)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}$$
- $r$is the continuously compounded risk free rate;$\sigma$is the volatility of stock returns.
(b) Buy an amount$B_0 = K × e^{−r×T} × N(−d_{2,          0})$of Treasury Zero Coupon bonds.
- Here$d_{2,          0} = d1,          t − σ × \sqrt{T}$.
- The portfolio so constructed has value at time 0
$$P_{0}=B_{0}+\Delta_{0}S_{0}$$
- (it can be shown P0 > 0).
1. From now on,  *rebalance* the portfolio,  to make sure that at every t,  the portfolio has a position in stocks given by$$∆t = −N(−d_{1,          t})$$
- E.g. if$S_{t}$↓ ⇒$∆t$↓⇒ short more stocks and put proceeds into bonds ⇒$B_{t}$↑.
- Or if$S_{t}$↑ ⇒$∆t ↑$⇒ buy back stocks by liquidating some bonds ⇒$B_{t}$↓.
## OPTION PREMIUM BY DYNAMIC REPLICATION
- For instance,  let$S$= K = 100,  T = 1,  r = 5%,  σ = 20%. Then,
d1 =; d2 =; N(−d1) = 0.3632; N(−d2) = 0.4404 =⇒ ∆0 = −N(−d1) = −0.3632
- Initial short position in stocks:$$∆ × 100 = −N(d_1) × 100 = −0.3632 × 100 = −36.32$$.
- Initial bond position:$$B_0 = Ke^{-rT}N(−d_2) =41.89$$.
- Initial value of the portfolio:$$P_0 = B_0 + ∆_0S_0 =41.89 −36.32 =5.57$$
- One day later (h = 1/252 = 1 day) the stock is$S_h = 99$=⇒$∆h = −N(−d1,          h)$= −0.3821
- Need to short more,  and thus sell$|∆_h − ∆_0| = | −0.3821 − (−0.3632)| = 0.0189$shares.
- Obtain cash =$0.0189 × 99 =1.879$,  and put it in bonds:
New Bond Position =$$B_h = B_0 × e_{r×h} +1.879 =41.89 −1.879 =43.777$$New Portfolio Position =$$P_h = B_h + ∆_h × S_h =43.777 − × 99 =5.941$$
## OPTION PREMIUM BY DYNAMIC REPLICATION
- **Fact:** The portfolio Pt = ∆t$S_{t}$+$B_{t}$obtained from the above trading strategy *replicates* the put option payoff.
- That is,  at maturity$$P_{T}=\Delta_{T}S_{T}+B_{T}=\max(K-S_{T})$$
- *Proof by simulation:* Next two figures shows that the strategy works,  even when portfolio rebalancing is at daily interval ($h=1/252$).
- I simulate stock price paths. And then performed the above trading strategy.

OPTION PREMIUM BY DYNAMIC REPLICATION

### BLACK AND SCHOLES FORMULA
- Since portfolio Pt replicates the payoff of the put option,  the value of the portfolio at any time must equal the value of the put option.
- Why? - Arbitrage: "Buy Cheap / Sell Dear".
- For instance,  if Pt < Put Option Premium =⇒
1. Sell option and set up the replicating portfolio (which costs$P_t$)
1. Today make$(\text{Put Option Premium} −P_t) > 0$.
1. At maturity T the replicating portfolio provides the payoff,  exactly.
- In particular,  at time 0,  the value of the option mu$S_{t}$be
Put Premium at 0,  $p_{0}\ =\ P_{0}=B_{0}+\Delta_{0}\times S_{0}$
$$=\ K\times e^{-rT}\times N(-d_{2,          0})-S_{0}\times N(-d_{1,          0})$$
- This is the celebrated "Black and Scholes" formula for option pricing.
- Similarly,  a call option formula is given by
$$\mathrm{Call~Premium~at~0,          ~}c_{0}=S_{0}\times N(d_{1,          0})-K\times e^{-r T}\times N(d_{2,          0})$$
## DELTA HEDGING AND DYNAMIC REPLICATION
- Why does the dynamic replication strategy work?
- Suppose you sold a put option and decide to hedge using the replicating portfolio P.
- Let Π be the portfolio short the put (−p) and long the replicating portfolio
$$\begin{array}{r c l}{{\Pi}}&{{=}}&{{-p+P}}\\ {{}}&{{=}}&{{-p+\Delta S+B}}\end{array}$$
- What is the sensitivity of Π to *small* variations in stocks?
$$\frac{d\;\Pi}{d\;S}=-\frac{d\;p}{d\;S}+\Delta\times1+0$$
- The portfolio Π is delta hedged$(d Π^*/d S* = 0)$if
$$\Delta={\frac{d\ p}{d\ S}}$$
- It can be shown that indeed$∆ = −N(−d_1)$is exactly$d p/d S$
- This implies that for every *small* variation in stock S,  the portfolio and the option move exactly by the same amount.
- =⇒ the dynamic replication works.
## DELTA HEDGING AND DYNAMIC REPLICATION
- The next figure shows the dynamic replication at work in a graph:

## BLACK AND SCHOLES FORMULA
- Example: Consider an at-the-money option.
- The stock price is$S$= 100,  the strike price is K = 100,  the (continuously compounded)
interest rate is r = 5%,  maturity is T = 1,  and the return volatility σ = 30%.
- We then have
$$d_{1}=\frac{\log\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)+(r-\delta+\sigma^{2}/2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}=\frac{\log\left(\frac{100}{100}\right)+(+(0.30)^{2}/2)\times1}{0.30\sqrt{1}}=0.3167;$$
$$d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T}=0.3167-\sqrt{1}=0.0167$$
$\bullet$Therefore$N(d_{1})=0.62425$and$N(d_{2})=0.50665$.
- The value of the call option is
$$c_{0}=SN(d_{1})-Ke^{-rT}N(d_{2})=100\times0.62425-100\times e^{\times1}\times0.50665=14.2312$$
- The value of a put option can be computed from these data by recalling that
$$N(-d_{1})=1-N(d_{1})=0.37575;\quad N(-d_{2})=1-N(d_{2})=0.49335$$
- so that
$$p_0 = −SN(−d1) + Ke^{-rT}N(−d2) = −100 × 0.37575 + 100 × e^{1 × 0.49335} = 9.3542$$
- To interpret the Black and Scholes formula it is convenient to go back to binomial trees discussed in TN 4.
- Black and Scholes model assumes continuous trading
- That is,  traders can trade at any instant$t$
- Moreover,  stock prices can take on any value,  and not only the values on a tree.
- Both conditions are approximately met as we let the time interval$h = T/n$in the binomial tree go to zero.
- Indeed,  as we have seen,  recall that we have the following:
	- **Fact:** As n goes to infinity,  the Binomial Tree price converges to Black and Scholes price
	- To see the similarity of Black and Scholes formula with the one stemming from a binomial tree,  consider the following example.
![]d9eae26af9a0ff47259210.png)
- Consider i = 0 and i = 1 with$S_{1,          u} = S_0 × u$and$S_{1,          d} = S_0 × d$.
- Assume the price of the option has S1,  u *> K > S*1,  d,  so that the payoffs from the tree above result.
- Let$q^∗$be the risk neutral probability of going up in the tree.
- The price of the option at time 0 according to risk neutral pricing is the
$$c_{0}=e^{-r\times T}E^{*}\left[\max(S_{1}-K)\right]$$$$=e^{-r\times T}\times\left[q^{*}\times\max(S_{1,          u}-K)+(1-q^{*})\times\max(S_{1,          d}-K)\right]$$$$=e^{-r\times T}\times q^{*}\times(S_{1,          u}-K)$$$$=S_{0}\times e^{-r\times T}\times q^{*}\times u-e^{-r\times T}\times K\times q^{*}$$$$=S_{0}\times N_{1}-e^{-r\times T}\times K\times N_{2}$$
- where,  defining by$u_{vc}$the annualized c.c. return from an up movement$S_{1,  u}/S_{0}=e^{u_{vc}\times T}=u$$$N_{1}=e^{-r\times T}\times q^{*}\times u=e^{(u_{vc}-r)\times T}\times q^{*}\quad\text{and}\quad N_{2}=q^{*}$$
- The similarity with Black and Scholes formula is not coincidential
$$\mathrm{Call}=S\times N(d_{1})-K\times e^{-r T}\times N(d_{2})$$
- Interpretation:
- $N_2 = N(d_2)$risk neutral probability to be in the money at maturity;
- $N_1 = N(d_1)$risk neutral expected excess return *conditional* on exercise at T.
- Indeed,  recall we obtained the following formula in TN 4 for a large number of steps n:
$$c_0\:=\:e^{-rT}E^*\left[\max(S_T-K)\right]$$
$$=\left.e^{-r\times T}\sum_{j=0}^n\left(\frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}\right)\max(S_{T,          j}-K)\right.$$
· where $S_{T,          j}=S_0\times u^{(n-j)}\times d^j.$ · Let $a$ be the smallest integer for which $S_{T,          j}>K$ for $j\geq a,          $ and $S_{T,           j}< K$for$j<a$
 · Putting all together:
$$\begin{aligned}c_0&=&e^{-r\times T}\sum_{j=a}^n\left(\frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}\right)(S_{T,          j}-K)\\&=&S_0\times N_1-K\times e^{-r\times T}\times N_2\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}\text{h}\quad N_1~=~\left(e^{-r\times T}\sum_{j=a}^n\left(\frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}\right)\times u^{(n-j)}\times d^j\right)\quad\text{and}\quad N_2=\sum_{j=a}^n\left(\frac{n!}{j!(n-j)!}\right)\end{aligned}$$
- It can be shown that$N_1\to N(d_1)$and$N_2\to N(d_2)$as$n\to\infty$·The interpretation,  though,  is the same as in the simple 2-period model.
## DOES THE DYNAMIC REPLICATION STRATEGY WORK IN REALITY?
- Black and Scholes formula relies on dynamic replication. Does it actually work in reality?
- Sometimes yes: e.g. Jan - Dec 2000
	- Replication of S&P500 option with T = 1 year. σ = standard deviation of returns in 1999.
![](a0a066b36c5ace6a32d6593d8b113d31.png)
## DOES THE DYNAMIC REPLICATION STRATEGY WORK IN REALITY?
- Sometimes no: e.g. Jan - Dec 1987
- ![](310cd3852c2b02cfa09c96b2ce307c53.png)
- We will return on the empirical performance of Black and Scholes model in the next TNs.
## BLACK AND SCHOLES PRICING FORMULA
- Like futures,  simple modifications to the option specification can still be treated within the Black and Scholes framework.
 1. OPTIONS WITH *KNOWN* DIVIDEND
- Define$S^∗ =S− PV (D)$where$PV (D)$= Present Value of Dividends before expiration.
- Use Black and Scholes formula with$S^∗$instead of$S$.
 1. OPTIONS WITH *KNOWN* DIVIDEND YIELD Q
- Define S∗ =$S$× e−q×T and use Black and Scholes formula as usual.
$$\begin{array}{l l}{{c\ =\$S$e^{-q T}N(d_{1})-K e^{-r T}N(d_{2});}}&{{\ p=K e^{-r T}N(-d_{2})-S e^{-q T}N(-d_{1});}}\\ {{}}\\ {{d_{1}\ =\ \frac{\ln(S/K)+(r-q+\sigma^{2}/2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}};}}&{{d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T}}}\end{array}$$
 1. OPTIONS ON CURRENCIES
- When you buy foreign currency,  you would invest in foreign Treasuries. Thus,  $r_{foreign}$is a dividend yield. Apply previous formula with$q = r_{foreign}$.
1. FUTURES OPTIONS
- Entering into a futures position does not co$S_{t}$anything. Thus,  compared to the dynamic replication with stocks,  a trader would *save* the riskless rate.
- The option pricing formula is then Black and Scholes formula in which the futures price$F$is used instead of$S$,  but the "dividend yield" equals the risk free rate$q = r$.
- Substituting this in the previous formula:
$$c~=~e^{-r T}[F N(d_{1})-K N(d_{2})];~~~~p=e^{-r T}[K N(-d_{2})-F N(-d_{1})]$$
$$d_{1}~=~\frac{\ln(F/K)+(\sigma^{2}/2)T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}};~~~~d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma\sqrt{T}$$
## RISKS IN OPTIONS AND THE GREEKS
- Risk managers and traders need to control the sensitivity of options to changes in the underlying. - Terminology:
1. **Delta**: Sensitivity of option to changes in underlying
$$\Delta=\frac{d\;\mathrm{Option\;Price}}{d\;S}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{N(d_{1})}}&{{\mathrm{~for\;Calls}}}\\ {{-N(-d_{1})}}&{{\mathrm{~for\;Puts}}}\end{array}\right.$$
1. **Gamma**: Sensitivity of Delta ∆ to changes in the underlying. For both calls and puts:
$$\Gamma=\frac{d\ \Delta}{d\ S}=\frac{N^{\prime}(d_{1})}{S\sigma\sqrt{T}}\quad\mathrm{~with~}\ N^{\prime}(x)=\frac{e^{-x^{2}}2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$$
- =⇒$\Gamma$= curvature of option price with respect to stock S;

![](23e937f63b7eaacf68f8e4fd36e33850.png)
- Why for a put option Θ > 0 for low$S$and Θ < 0 for high S?
- For$S$high,  payoff is zero,  but put price is positive.
	- =⇒ As time passes (but keeping$S$fixed),  the put price mu$S_{t}$decline.
- For$S$low,  why is Θ > 0?
	- Simple example: the firm goes bankrupt =⇒$S$= 0.
		- =⇒ Put payoff at T = K.
	- Value at time *t < T* is$p = e^{−r(T−t)}K$,  which increases with t.
- What about call options?
	- For non-dividend paying stock,  Θ < 0 for call options.
		- If$S$is very very high,  option holder will receive$S−$K at maturity (with high probability)
		- This is the payoff of a long forward,  so present value at$t < T$is$c =S−Ke^{-rT} >S−K$
			- Intuition: for calls,  we will pay K,  whose present value today is smaller than K,  pushing up the price of the call.
- If the stock pays (a lot of) dividends,  then Θ > 0 for high S,  as the option holder misses the dividend payouts during the life of the option (compared to a stock holder).
![](44e2c18c4c0158811c7968e5b0c8b6bc.png)
- In Black and Scholes model,  the volatility σ and the interest rate r are constant.
- However,  it is interesting how does a change in σ and r change the value of the option.
1. **Rho**: Change in option price due to a change in interest rate r
$$\mathrm{Rho}={\frac{d~\mathrm{Option~Price}}{d~r}}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{{K T e^{-r T}N(d_{2})>0}}&{{\mathrm{~for~Calls}}}\\ {{-K T e^{-r T}N(-d_{2})<0}}&{{\mathrm{~for~Puts}}}\end{array}\right.$$
- Intuition: it all depends on whether the option holder will pay K (call) or receive K (put).
The PV of K declines as r increases,  yielding the result.
1. **VEGA**: CHANGE IN OPTION PRICE DUE TO A CHANGE IN VOLATILITY Σ EXAMPLE OF RISK MANAGEMENT PROBLEM$$\text{Vega}=\frac{d\text{ Option Price}}{ d \mathrm{~}\sigma}=S\sqrt{T}N^{\prime}(d_1)>0$$
![](49bb935ac04b3456b51a6767b5f39c3b.png)
- Assume today is Feb 22,  2008 and you sold the following Capital Protected Note:1
- Maturity: February 20,  2015
- Issue Price:$10 - Principal:$10
- Interest: 0
- Principal Protection: 100% - Payoff at maturity: Principal plus Supplemental Redemption Amount (SRA),  if positive.
- Index: S&P 500,  renormalized to have Initial Index Value =$10.
- If you sell this security,  then you mu$S_{t}$protect your position again$S_{t}$increases in the stock price.
- =⇒ Delta-hedge =⇒ need to set up the replicating portfolio.
## THE CAPITAL PROTECTED NOTE'S PAYOFF

![](bbbbf486ab7cc6cdfc53831bfd3fd43b.png)

- The Capital Protected Note's payoff can be decomposed into
1. A zero coupon bond with principal$10 and maturity T = 7.
1. 1.16 at-the-money call options on the (normalized) S&P 500 with maturity T = 7.
- The reference index is normalized so that$S_0$= β × S&P500 =$10.
- On Feb 28,  2008,  we had S&P 500 = 1353.1. =⇒ β = 10/1353.1.
- Other data on Feb 28,  2008,  are as follows
- The 7-year (c.c.) interest rate was r = 3.23%.
- The dividend yield of SP500 is δ = 2%.
- Let the volatility foreca$S_{t}$over 7-year be σ = 15% - The value of the security is
$$\begin{array}{l l}{{V a l u e\ =\ e^{-r T}\$10+1.16\times C a l l(10,          10,          r,          \delta,          \sigma,          T)}}\\ {{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ \$7.9764+1.16\times\$1.7}}\\ {{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ =\ \$9.9483}}\end{array}$$
- Close to$10 - Note that an investor in CPN trades off coupons for 1.16 call options.
## DELTA HEDGING AT TIME 0
- How can we hedge the short CPN? - Theoretically,  we ju$S_{t}$need a position in the replicating portfolio:
1. Buy a zero coupon bond today for$7.9764 (to hedge the "bond" component)
1. Purchase 1.16 units of the replicating portfolio for the (embedded) call option.
- The replicating portfolio *for each call* is as follows:
- Given the call ∆ = e−δTN(d1) = 0.5747,  we have:
Position in (normalized) S&P500 = 0.5747;
$$\begin{array}{lll}\text{Bond Position}&=&Call(10,          10,          r,          \delta,          \sigma,          T)-\Delta\times S_0\\ &=&1.7-\Delta\times10=-4.047\end{array}$$
- That is,  for each call option,  invest\$0.5747 × \$10 = 5.747 in stock and borrow$4.047.
VALUE OF REPLICATING PORTFOLIO =$0.5747 \times10-4.047=1.7$
.
- Multiply the positions above by 1.16 and we obtain the replicating portfolio for a CPN.
## DYNAMIC DELTA HEDGING
- Theoretically,  if we rebalance frequently the position in stocks,  the portfolio will replicate exactly
the payoff the structured derivative.
- If$S_{t}$increases,  ∆ increases and we mu$S_{t}$borrow more to inve$S_{t}$more in stocks (how much?);
- If$S_{t}$decreases,  ∆ decreases and we sell some stocks and use the proceeds to repay some of
the loan.
## DELTA-GAMMA HEDGING
- There are some issues with delta-hedging
1. For any small variation in stock price we need to rebalance the portfolio
- =⇒ with transaction costs this is expensive.
1. Large variations in the stock price imply the hedge does not work too well.
- We can alleviate somewhat these problems by "Delta-Gamma" hedging:
- In addition to stocks,  we need a position in a security with positive Gamma,  such as a
short-term traded option.
- Consider a portfolio$\Pi$which is short the$T-$dated call$Call(S,          T)$(as the one implicit in the CPN),  long$N$stock and long also$N^{c}$of$T_{1}-$date calls$Call(S,  T_{1})$$$\Pi=-Call(S,  T)+N\times S+N^{c}\times Call(S,  T_{1})$$
- We want to hedge both the sensitivity of Π to changes in the stock (dΠ
dS = 0) and the change in
such sensitivity to changes in the stock,  that is,  the convexity
$$d\,          \frac{\left(\frac{d\Pi}{d S}\right)}{d S}=\frac{d\Pi^{2}}{d S^{2}}=0$$
![](76ace2442a76b1b506b98c54cdafddfc.png)
## DELTA-GAMMA HEDGING
- The Delta-Gamma hedge then requires:
$$\frac{d\Pi}{dS}=0\Longrightarrow-\frac{dCall(S,          T)}{dS}+N+N^{c}\times\frac{dCall(S,          T_{1})}{dS}=0\qquad\mbox{(Delta Hedging)}$$$$\frac{d^{2}\Pi}{dS^{2}}=0\Longrightarrow-\frac{d^{2}Call(S,          T)}{dS^{2}}+N^{c}\times\frac{d^{2}Call(S,          T_{1})}{dS^{2}}=0\qquad\mbox{(Gamma Hedging)}$$
- Using the notation ∆(*S,  T*) and Γ(*S,  T*) to indicate the Delta and Gamma of the option with
maturity T,  solving the two equations in two unknowns we obtain:
$$N^{c}=\frac{\Gamma(S,          T)}{\Gamma(S,          T_{1})};\quad N=\Delta(S,          T)-N^{c}\times\Delta(S,          T_{1})$$
- Note that the position in stocks is smaller (if N c > 0) than in the case of only Delta-hedging,
as we now have to also hedge the position in the short-term call option,  which is used to hedge again$S_{t}$Gamma.
## DELTA-GAMMA HEDGING: THE CAPITAL PROTECTED NOTE
- For instance,  using a 1−year option to hedge the CPN,  we have
$$\begin{array}{r l r l}{{C a l l(S,          T)=1.7;}}&{{\Gamma(S,          T)=0.08016;}}&{{\Delta(S,          T)=0.5747}}\\ {{C a l l(S,          T_{1})=0.6443;}}&{{\Gamma(S,          T_{1})=0.2575;}}&{{\Delta(S,          T_{1})=0.5512}}\end{array}$$
- we obtain
Position in short-term call = N c = 0.3113;
Position in stock = N = 0.4031;
Position in bonds = 1.7 − N ×$S$− N_c × Call(*S,  T*1) = −2.5315

## DELTA-GAMMA HEDGING: THE CAPITAL PROTECTED NOTE
- The Delta-Gamma hedging strategy allows for larger swings in the stock price before calling for
a rebalancing.
- For instance,  under Delta hedging,  we need rebalance to when *S <* 9 or *S >* 11,  as the
dashed line starts diverging from solid line.
- Instead,  Delta-Gamma requires rebalancing only when *S <* 8 or *S >* 13,  as the dotted line
is very close to the solid line for a much wider range of prices.
- Less frequent rebalancing implies lower transaction costs.
- Of course,  now we have more transaction costs because we have to rebalance also the
T1−option positions.
- We need to use very liquid,  exchange traded securities to minimize transaction costs on
options.
- Note that the additional benefit of the strategy is that large sudden changes in the stock price
(plus/minus 20%) are hedged.
- A curiosity: From the figure,  the CPN is valued at \$8 for$S$low. In what sense this is a "capital
protected note"? If the investor sells the security when$S$is low,  he/she would not recover$10.
- We know that ∆ = N(d1) is the sensitivity of a call option price to changes in the stock price
- What is the *percentage* sensitivity of the call price to *percentage* change in the stock price?
- =⇒ In percentage,  call options move more than the underlying stock
- What is the risk premium on an option? - Recall that a call option is given by a portfolio of stocks and bonds
$$\mathrm{Call}=\Delta\times S+B$$
- As for any portfolio,
Return on a portfolio = weighted average of the returns of the individual assets
- where the weights are given by relative positions in the assets.
- That is,  let RC be the return on the call,  RS the return on stock,  and RB the return on bonds
over a small interval of time
$$R_{C}=w\times R_{S}+(1-w)\times R_{B}$$
- where the weight on stock is
$$w={\frac{\mathrm{Position~in~Stock}}{\mathrm{Value~of~Portfolio}}}={\frac{\Delta\times S}{\mathrm{Call}}}={\frac{\%{\mathrm{age~Change~in~Call}}}{\%{\mathrm{age~Change~in~Stock}}}}$$
- If$S$is the aggregate market (e.g. S&P500),  then we can think of w as the Call Option's Beta.
- Developing the return equation and using also the notation w = β,  we obtain
$$
(R_C-R_B)=\beta\times(R_S-R_B)
$$

- Given such large β,  the excess return on a call option is much larger than the one on the stock.
- A call option is effectively a Leveraged Investment
- We borrow (B) to purchase (∆) stock with minimum equity investment (*Call*)
	- =⇒ Expected Excess Return is very high:$E [R_C − R_B] = β × E [R_S − R_B]$
- Note that β depends on S,  so it is not constant.
- Clearly,  the risk is also very high. What is the variance of call option returns?
- It is$β^2 \times$variance of stock returns:$σ_{c}^2=β^2 × σ_{s}^2$

- The volatility of the call option,  computed as the 22-day standard deviation of returns,  is much higher than the one of the SP500 index.
## THE RISK / RETURN CHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIONS

,  The Risk / Return characteristics of an investment is often measured by the Sharpe Ratio
$$\text{Sharpe Ratio}=\frac{\text{Expected Excess Return}}{\text{Volatility}}$$
· The Sharpe Ratio of a Call option is therefore
$$\text{Sharpe Ratio of Call}=\frac{\text{Expected Excess Return Call}}{\text{Volatility Call}}$$
$$=\frac{E[R_C-R_B]}{\sigma_C}$$
$$=\frac{\beta E[R_S-R_B]}{\beta\sigma_S}$$
$$=\text{Sharpe Ratio of Stock}$$
·The Sharpe Ratio is the same as the one of stocks (theoretically,  at least)
