Observations About CDS

## TYPES OF CDS,  QUANTITIES TYPES

- Single-name CDS: single reference entity such as a corporation or sovereign
- Multi-name CDS: cover defaults in a reference portfolio such as a basic credit default swap or a CDS index (typically an index of commonly negotiated single-name CDS)

## QUANTITIES
- From BIS (2021):$8.5 trillion notional at end of 2020. 1.5\% of notional of all global derivatives.
- GFC likely reduced size we see even today
- 62\% now with central counterparties that act like exchanges.
- Increased size of sovereign CDS since GFC: 4\% of total notional in 2007 to 14\% in 2020.

That said,  the credit default swap market is still small relative to the overall global derivatives market: Notional amounts outstanding in credit default swaps accounted for

A default by an index constituent would also trigger a payment from the protection seller in the index position to the protection buyer,  just as it would be the case in a single-name CDS. Suppose the recovery rate associated with the defaulted reference entity is 45 percent. Assuming that the position is cash settled,  the protection seller would have to pay$44, 000 to the protection buyer,  or (1-) x 80, 000. The newly re-
