[Carry Trade 1](Carry%20Trade%201.md)

Futures contracts are similar to forward contracts,  as they are agreements between two counterparties to exchange a pre-specified amount of good (e.g.,  corn,  or Euros) at a pre-specified time for a predetermined price.

- The three notable differences between forwards and futures:
  1. The contracts are traded on an exchange (e.g.,  CME);
  1. The contracts are standardized (size,  maturity);
  1. Profits and losses are mark to market.

Standardization is important to improve liquidity

- but it introduces basis risk: Mismatch between futures contract size and maturity versus actual corporate needs.

Mark to market is important: decreases probability of default

- At the end of each trading day,  profits and losses accrue to the account of the trader.
- If trading losses become too large,  exchange issues a margin call: the trader must post additional collateral or the position is immediately closed.

# Teaching Note 2-Futures Contracts

Consider earlier example: The US firm could hedge with futures contracts instead of forwards.

- CME Euro FX Futures have size of 125,  000 Euro and expire on Mar,  Jun,  Sep,  and Dec.
- Suppose that$T =$Mar 2007 and$F_{0,     T} = 1.28$.
- US firm can short 5 mil/125,  \d$\approx$40 futures contracts.
- Every day$t$,  $$P/L_t = k \times 125,     000 \times (F_{1,     T} - F_{t,     T}) =5,     000,     000\times (F_{1,     T} - F_{t,     T})$$
- At maturity$T$: Payoff at$T = (P/L)_t + (P/L)_2 + … + (P/L)_T$
  - $=5,     000,     000\times (F_{0,     T} - F_{T,     T})$
  - $=5,     000,     000\times (F_{0,     T} - M_T)$
  - $=$Payoff of Forward Contract at$T$if$F_{0,     T} = F_{T,     T}$

**Caveat**: The total payoff from using a constant number of contracts $k$ every period is actually not exactly equivalent to the one of a forward contract.

- Because of mark to market,  trading profits and losses accrue **over time** to the hedger.
- The correct statement of the payoff at$T$is in fact:
  - Payoff at$T$=$$(P/L)_1 \times e^{-r(T-t)} + (P/L)_2 \times e^{-r(T-t2)} + … + (P/L)_T \times e^{-r(T-T)}$$
  - where$dt = 1/365 = 1$day (in annual units)

To obtain the forward contract's payoff,  we must **tail the hedge** and choose the number of contracts $k$ per period as $$k = 40 \times e^{-r(T-t1)}$,      \newline
$k = 40 \times e^{-r(T-t2)}$,      …,     $k = 40 \times e^{-r(T-t_{T-1})}$,     $k_{T-1} = 40$$

- which yields the payoff sequence at$T =5,     000,     000\times (F_{0,     T} - F_{1,     T}) \times e^{r(T-t1)} + 5,     000,     000\times (F_{1,     T} - F_{2,     T}) \times e^{r(T-t2)} + … + 5,     000,     000\times (F_{T-1,     T} - F_{T,     T}) \times e^{r(T-T)}$
  - $=5,     000,     000\times (F_{0,     T} - M_T)$

# SPECULATING WITH FUTURES

Futures are also excellent vehicles to speculate on a view about the variation in the underlying.

- Example: Let today be Friday Jan 1,  2010. The Euro/Dollar exchange rate is$S_T = 1.4326$.
- A speculator believes that the Euro/Dollar rate will increase over the weekend.
- Consider two strategies:
  1. Funded Speculative Position:
	  - Buy 125,  000 Euros for$179,  075 = 125,  000 x 1.4326.
  1. Unfunded Speculative Position through Futures
	  - Go long 1 Futures contract at the CME. E.g.,  The March 10 Futures price on Jan 1,  2010 was$F_{T,     T} = 1.4334$
	  - First,  initial margin$2,  995.

On Monday,  Jan 4,  2010,  $ (t)$,  the exchange rate was ${} S_T = 1.4413$ and the Mar 10 Futures was $F_{T,     T} = 1.441$.

- Funded Speculative Position: The position is$180162.5 = 125,  000 x 1.441. Thus
  - Profit =$180162.5 -$179,  075 =$1087.5
  - Return on Investment${} \frac{1087.5}{179,     075} = 0.607\%$
- Unfunded Speculative Position through Futures:
  - Profit = 125,  000 x$(1.441 - 1.4334)$=$950
  - Return on Investment$\frac{950}{2,     995} = 31.72\%$

# THE FUTURES PRICE VS THE FORWARD PRICE

**Fact**: If interest rates are constant,  the futures price equals the forward price: $F_{T,     T} = F_{T}$
**Why?**

- Hedging with futures or with forwards costs nothing at inception$t$and provide the same payoff at$T$.
- The delivery price has to be the same using either contract.
**Why this condition only holds if interest rates are constant?**
  - Because the "tailing of the hedge" works exactly only when interest rates are constant.
  - If interest rates move over time,  the payoff at$T$of a Futures contract is only approximately$F_{0,     T} - M_T$,  as there is some cumulated interest rate determined by the sequence of$(P/L)_t$over time.
### HEDGING WITH FUTURES

Let:

- $N$= number of futures contracts
- $S$= size of one futures contract
- $F_{0,     T}$ = initial futures price for delivery at time $T$
- $F_{t,     T}$ = futures price at time $t$ for delivery at time $T$
- $M_T$ = spot price at maturity $T$
- $V$= total value hedged
- $r$= risk-free interest rate
- $t_i$ = specific point in time $i$ before maturity $T$
- $P/L_t$ = profit or loss at time $t$

1. Number of futures contracts:$N = \frac{V}{S}$
1. Daily profit/loss:$P/L_t = N \times S \times (F_{1,     T} - F_{t,     T})$
1. Payoff at maturity$T$:
	- $\text{Payoff at } T = \sum_{t=1}^{T} P/L_t$$= V \times (F_{0,     T} - M_T)$

Caveat about the total payoff:

$$\text{Payoff at } T = \sum_{i=1}^{T} (P/L_{t_i}) \times e^{-r(T-t_i)}$$

To obtain the forward contract's payoff:
$$k_{t_i} = N \times e^{-r(T-t_i)}$$
$$\text{Payoff sequence at } T = V \times \sum_{i=1}^{T} (F_{0,     T} - F_{t_i,     T}) \times e^{r(T-t_i)}$$
$$= V \times (F_{0,     T} - M_T)$$

### SPECULATING WITH FUTURES

Let:

- $S_T$= spot rate at time$T$
- $F_{T,     T}$= futures price for delivery at time$T$
- $I$= initial investment
- $R$= return on investment

General equations for speculative strategies:

1. Funded Speculative Position:
$$\text{Profit} = N \times S \times (S_{T+1} - S_T) - I$$
$$R = \frac{\text{Profit}}{I}$$

1. Unfunded Speculative Position through Futures:
$$\text{Profit} = N \times S \times (F_{T+1,     T} - F_{T,     T})$$
$$R = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Initial Margin}}$$
