## Black and Scholes Model: Does it Work?
- Does the Black and Scholes model yield option prices similar to the market price of traded options?
  - On October 31:
	- The S&P 500 index was $S = 3871.98$.
	- The one-month risk-free rate was $r = 3.75\%$ (c.c).
	- The dividend yield on the S&P 500 is about $q = 1.69\%$.
	- Observed options prices with maturity end of November $T = 1/12$.

#### Moneyness
- Moneyness is defined as the ratio of the strike price to the current stock price $K/S$:
  - $K/S < 1$:
	- $K < S$: **Puts are OTM,  calls are ITM**.
  - $K/S > 1$:
	- $K > S$: **Puts are ITM,  calls are OTM**.

#### Comparison to Black-Scholes Using Historical Volatility
- Historical volatility used: $22.2\%$.

## Black and Scholes: What is Wrong?
- **Assumption**: Black-Scholes assumes log-normal returns.
  - That is:
	$$r_{S} = \log\left(\frac{S_{t+h} + \text{dividends}}{S_{t}}\right)$$
  - $S_{t}$ is normally distributed.
  - **Issue**: Fat tails in empirical distribution indicate extreme observations are more likely than implied by the normal distribution.
- **Figure 1**: Empirical distribution of monthly returns versus the normal distribution.
  ![Fat Tails](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fCW7gnggTIgpgwmoys9Eya0SSI0Umi7Kg)

- **Assumption**: The Black-Scholes model assumes that volatility of stock returns is constant.
  - **Issue**: Volatility is stochastic—it moves unpredictably over time.
  ![Stochastic Volatility](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fGysIz0gqllwhIFfks5Ye3qmc5TnMsgGa)

- **Assumption**: Black-Scholes assumes continuous trading and no jumps.
  - **Issue**: Prices sometimes jump discretely.
  ![Price Jumps](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fTdGfgvNuQHW4d8ZGf43A6vRup6Hxzywm)

## Black and Scholes Implied Volatility
- **Definition**: Implied Volatility is the level of volatility $\sigma$ that,  when used in the Black-Scholes formula,  matches the value of a traded option.
  - For instance,  given:
	$$put^{mkt}(3870,  1/12) = 98.50$$
	- The implied volatility for this option was $23.1\%$.
- **Note**: Every option has a potentially different implied volatility $\sigma_{\text{Imp}}$.

### Uses of Implied Volatility
- **Gauge Market Uncertainty**: Higher uncertainty leads to higher implied volatility.
  - Implied volatility augments return volatility as it is forward-looking.
- **Relative Pricing of Options**:
  - Options with different strike prices and maturities can be compared using implied volatility.

#### VIX
- The **VIX** uses the concept of "Volatility Swaps, " where a portfolio of options is created that is hedged against index-level moves,  exposing only volatility changes.
  - **Note**: Technically,  it is not the same as "implied volatility" in the BSM model.

#### Implied Volatility Surface
- Represents implied volatilities across different strikes and maturities.
  ![Implied Volatility Surface](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fyBmkHCKoTHgnXQsLMBY0WzvXAEsVUkg3)

## Black and Scholes Model: Shall We Throw It Away?
- **No**: Black-Scholes is still a useful benchmark.
- It works reasonably well for **hedging against changes** in stock prices.
- New models address BSM's shortcomings:
  - **Deterministic and Stochastic Volatility Models**: Account for time-varying volatility.
  - **Models with Price Jumps**: Account for discrete jumps in prices.
  - **Implied Tree Models**: Find trees that actually price options.
- These models often imply that put prices are overpriced due to investors paying a premium for downside protection.

### Deterministic Volatility Models
- **Assumption**: Volatility depends on the stock price itself.
  - E.g.,  **Constant Elasticity of Variance Model**:
	$$\sigma(S) = \Sigma \times S^{\alpha}$$
	$$\log\left(\frac{S_{t, t+h}}{S_t}\right) = \mu \times h + S_t^{\alpha} \times \Sigma \times \epsilon_t$$
  - If $\alpha < 0$,  lower $S_{t}$ implies higher volatility,  leading to an implied volatility smirk.

![Deterministic Volatility](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fw04zv9rGYaYzT0zVMvAG6YVVVR8eptSI)

#### Stochastic Volatility Models
- **Assumption**: Volatility $\sigma_{t}$ changes over time.
  - E.g.,  let $\sigma_{t} = \sqrt{v_{t}}$:
	$$R_{t, t+h} = \mu \times h + \sqrt{v_t} \times \epsilon_{1, t}$$
	$$(v_{t+h} - v_t) = k \times (\overline{v} - v_t) \times h + \Sigma \times \sqrt{v_t} \times \epsilon_{2, t}$$
Result: if volatility is negatively correlated with stock returns,  OTM put options become relatively more expensive.
- **Intuition**: A decline in price $\Rightarrow$ higher volatility $\Rightarrow$ higher probability of even larger declines $\Rightarrow$ higher price of insurance against downturns.
  - If volatility is negatively correlated with stock returns,  OTM put options become relatively more expensive.

#### Jump Models

Assume that sometimes big changes in stock prices occur (e.g.,  October 1987).
$$R_{t, t+h} = \mu \times h + \sigma \times \epsilon_t + \omega \times Q_t$$

- Where $Q_{t} = 0$ most of the time,  but sometimes $Q_{t} = 1$ (with small probability).
- $\omega$ can be a random variable (e.g.,  normal) or a constant.
Result: If $\omega < 0$,  then OTM put options are relatively more expensive.
- Investors are willing to pay a higher premium to insure against negative outcomes.
**Pricing with jumps is particularly complicated**.
- The pricing formulas are not as "nice" as the Black-Scholes formula.
  - Result: If $\omega < 0$,  OTM put options are more expensive.
- The idea is reasonably simple.
- In Teaching Note 4,  we learnt how to go from a tree to option prices
- The “implied tree” methodology does the opposite: Uses (some) option prices to obtain a tree
- For instance,  consider the binomial tree model in Teaching Note 4.
- Given $S_0=1502.39, \sigma=12.36\%, r=4.713\%, \delta=1.91\%$ and $T=0.\1$,  we fnd $u=$ $exp(\sigma\sqrt T)=1.043746137$ and $d=1/u=0.958087378.$ Thus,  the risk neutral probability
$$q^*=\frac{e^{(r-\delta)T}-d}{u-d}=0.528631113$$
- The price of the $K=1500$ put option come out to be $p_0=\$28.394$,  higher than the tradeci
$\bar{\text{market price }p^{mkt}(1500, 0.\1)}=\bar{\$20.35}.$

![Implied Tree Logic](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fwGGRatMlqKAhywFVsAy9CZUEPb0iO4hh)
An implied tree has the same logic as implied volatility: Since the model is not working using the correct inputs,  we look for an alternative specification that makes it work.

- In the above example,  we can **choose $S_{1, u}$** to price the option correctly.
- To avoid too many parameters,  define $u = S_{1, u}/S_{0}$ and define $S_{1, d} = S_{0}/u$.


We obtain the following:

\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
    box/.style = {draw,  rounded corners,  minimum width=4cm,  minimum height=2cm,  align=left}, 
    node distance=3cm
]

% Level i = 0
\node[box] (i0) {
    $S_0 = 1502.39$\\
    $q^*_0 = 0.528631113$\\
    $p_0 = e^{-r \times 0.12} \times (1 - q^*_0) \times p_{1, d} = 28.394$
};

% Level i = 1,  upper branch
\node[box,  right=of i0,  yshift=1.5cm] (i1u) {
    $S_{1, u} = 1568.114$\\
    $p_{1, u} = 0$
};

% Level i = 1,  lower branch
\node[box,  right=of i0,  yshift=-1.5cm] (i1d) {
    $S_{1, d} = 1439.421$\\
    $p_{1, d} = 60.579$
};

### Implied Tree Models
- **Idea**: Use some option prices to obtain a pricing tree.
  - Example: Binomial Tree Model.
- What do we use an implied tree for?
	- To price other options. For instance,  if $K=1490$,  the put price from the binomial tree $\bar{\text{is }\$15.82184291, \text{ closer to the market value of }p^{mkt}(1490, 0.\1)}=\$17.05$,  compared to the original case (which would be $23.707)
	- With more elaborated trees,  one can also price more elaborated derivatives,  which have path dependencies,  or American features.
	- Given:
	  $$S_{0} = 1502.39,  \sigma = 12.36\%,  r = 4.713\%,  \delta = 1.91\%,  T = 0.12$$
	  - $u = \exp(\sigma\sqrt{T}) = 1.043746137$,  $d = 1/u = 0.958087378$
	  - Risk-neutral probability:
		$$q^* = \frac{e^{(r-\delta)T} - d}{u - d} = 0.528631113$$
	  - Price of $K = 1500$ put option is $p_{0} = 28.394$,  higher than the market price $p^{mkt}(1500,  0.12) = 20.35$.
- **Two-Step Implied Tree**: After solving the first step,  extend to a two-step tree to fit additional market options.
- Once we solved for the first step,  we can proceed to obtain a two step tree
	- We need to keep the frst step fixed though
- What do we choose?
$$-\:S_{2, uu}, \:S_{2, ud}=S_{2, du}\mathrm{~and~}\:S_{2, dd}.$$
- It is desirable to keep the tree somewhat balanced around the starting value $S_0.$
$$-\Longrightarrow\text{choose }S_{2, ud}=S_{2, du}=S_0$$
- Since we have two price levels to choose,  we need two options.
,  The following example has $p^mkt(1450, 0.\1)=\$14.65$ and $p^{mkt}(1550, 0.\1)=\$50.2$

### Conclusions
- The **Black-Scholes formula** does not price options consistently,  either in cross-section (different strike prices) or over time.
  - Issues:
  - **Stochastic Volatility**,
  - **Jumps**,
  - **Fat Tails**.
- Despite these issues,  BSM is still a useful benchmark,  especially for first-order pricing and hedging.
- **More Complicated Models** fit the data better and can be used for arbitrage strategies,  but gains are often limited.
- Black-Scholes has become the industry standard for quoting options.
  - **Implied Volatility Surfaces** provide a convenient way to gauge the relative value of options.
