Currency Swaps

A currency swap, in the simplest sense, is an agreement between two parties to exchange a given amount of one currency for another and to pay back with interest these currencies in the future1 Frequently, one counterparty—such as a corporation, bank, sovereign, or supranational—borrows under specific terms and conditions in one currency while the other counterparty borrows under different terms and conditions in a second currency. The two counterparties then exchange the net receipts from the capital markets issues and agree to service each other's debt. For example, a U.S. company that has issued deutsche mark (DM) bonds with an annual all-in DM cost of 8% enters into a foreign currency swap directly with a German company that has issued US$bonds with an annual all-in US$cost of 11%. The companies exchange the initial receipts from their respective bonds. At the same time, the U.S. company agrees to pay the interest and principal on the US$bonds issued by the German company, and the German company agrees to pay the interest and principal on the DM bonds issued by the U.S. company.

From the viewpoint of the U.S. company, such an agreement is beneficial if the German company has been able to borrow dollars at a lower rate than the rate the U.S. company would have been able to obtain. Likewise, the German company will find the swap attractive if the U.S. company was able to borrow DM at a lower rate than the German company would have been able to obtain. This could happen if (1) there was an overabundance of DM debt issued by the German company compared to the relative "scarcity" of U.S. corporate names in that market, and/or (2) U.S. investors perceived the German company to be a better credit risk than the U.S. company. Thus, in this currency swap, the U.S. company's DM debt service is completely covered and the net cost is represented by the US$flows it must pay to service the German company's US$debt. From the standpoint of the German company, its US$debt service is completely covered and the net cost is the DM flows it must pay to service the U.S. company's debt. Both companies, therefore, know precisely their all-in financing cost in the desired currency. The all-in costs of the cash flows associated with the debt issues and the related currency swaps are shown in a typical currency swap diagram in Exhibit 1.

An alternative method for the U.S. company to lock in the dollar cost of servicing its DM debt (or the German company to lock in the DM cost of servicing its US$debt) would have been to use the bank forward foreign exchange market. However, long-dated forward exchange rates are priced conservatively by banks and the bid-offer spreads tend to be quite wide. Banks are usually not eager to take on the risk of changes in the future level of spot exchange rates, and it is difficult for them to "square" their long-dated forward positions with offsetting future cash flows from other natural businesses or other forward trades in the market. In contrast, a currency swap typically results in an immediate matching of two counterparties with opposite hedging needs. The all-in costs of the cash flows in the desired currency using currency swaps arranged directly between two counterparties is usually less than using bank forward exchange contracts because there is no need to build in an extra margin to cover uncertainty from the standpoint of the bank. Nonetheless, for borrowers considering a swap, the forward foreign exchange market and the possibility of a direct swap with another borrowing counterparty represent competitive alternatives, each of which may be examined from the standpoint of cost, availability, and counterparty risk and relationships.

One of the first well-publicized currency swaps was in August 1981 between the World Bank and IBM.1 IBM had outstanding DM and Swiss franc (Sfr) bond issues that it wanted to hedge into a dollar liability given the appreciation of the dollar in the summer of 1981. Essentially, the World Bank agreed to pay each year to IBM the necessary DM and Sfr to cover IBM's debt service on these bonds. In return, IBM paid US$to cover the World Bank's debt service on a Eurodollar bond. The market for currency swaps grew tremendously following this first swap in 1981. It is estimated that$860 billion of notional principal was swapped in currency swaps. Moreover, this huge volume is spread over a wide diversity of currencies as evidenced by Exhibit 2. In recent years, as much as 50% to 70% of the new issue volume in the Eurobond markets has been associated with foreign currency or interest rate swaps. Finding swap counterparties and arranging the deals has become a major source of profits for international investment and merchant banks.

# THE MECHANICS OF CURRENCY SWAPS WITH BANK CREDIT INTERMEDIATION

Shortly after its first swap, the World Bank (WB) executed a more typical currency swap that required both counterparties to simultaneously issue two capital markets issues and agree to exchange the initial proceeds and the liabilities for future payments using a bank as an intermediary. In the Swiss market, however, the risk premium for the Company was considerably less than what it faced in the dollar market. Since the Company was well known and it products were considered to be high quality, Swiss investors were willing to accept five-year Sfr bonds with a coupon of 7.35%. Front-end fees of 2.5% resulted in an annual all-in Sfr cost of 7.98%. The WB, however, borrowed heavily in the Sfr markets and most Swiss investment portfolios were wellstocked with WB paper. The WB estimated it would have had to pay a Sfr coupon of 7.75% and fees of 2.5%, resulting in an annual all-in Sfr cost of 8.38%. The WB's target borrowing rate was Sfr 8.10% or less.

One alternative was for both borrowers to launch debt issues in the markets where their respective credits were well received and hedge the future interest and principal payments through the bank forward market into the desired currency. Exhibit 3 shows the Company's Sfr bond flows in column (C) and the fully hedged US$bond flows in column (E), using the appropriate foreign exchange forwards to convert Sfr to US\$. The annual all-in US$cost (the internal rate of return of the flows) in column (E) was 16.8%. This represented a savings of 79 basis points (bp) compared to directly tapping the US$market, but was still above the target borrowing rate in US \$. The flows from the WB's US$bond are shown in column (F). In this case, the WB's fully hedged US$bond resulted in an annual all-in Sfr cost of 8.4% in column (H), or 2 bp more expensive than issuing Sfr bonds directly.

Instead of using the bank forward markets, the two parties issued the bonds and executed foreign currency swaps with a bank intermediary (bank). To demonstrate that the objectives of all the parties can be met, we will assume that the bank offered a swap to the WB such that its annual all-in Sfr cost was 8.10%, and a swap to the Company such that its annual all-in US$cost was 16.7%. Because of the credit disparity between the WB and the Company, the WB preferred to accept the credit of the bank. Therefore, the bank acted as the direct counterparty to both the WB and the Company, intermediating the swap cash flows between them. In this case, there was substantial arbitrage potential arising from the difference in borrowing costs:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||US$Rates|Sfr Rates|
|Available to Company  <br>Available to WB  <br>Absolute difference|17.59%  <br>16.58%  <br>1.01%|7.98%  <br>8.38%  <br>0.40%|

These arbitrage profits of 141 bps were split among the three parties—the WB, the Company, and the bank—based upon the target borrowing rates announced by the WB and the Company, the required profits for the bank, and the negotiating strength of each party.

The cash flows from the bond issue and the related swap for the WB are shown in Exhibit 4. Column (A) shows the WB's cash flows from its US$bond. The US$swap flows for the WB are shown in column (B). Note that the WB surrendered to the bank the entire net US$proceeds in exchange for future US$receipts that exactly matched its debt service requirements. Also, the WB agreed to pay to the bank in years one through five the exact amount of Sfr required to service the Company's Sfr bonds. The WB's initial Sfr receipt of Sfr 97.013 million paid by the bank is the present value of the require future Sfr outflows discounted at 8.10%. Thus, the internal rate of return on the flows in column (C), and, hence, the WB's AIC is 8.10%.

The Company's cash flows from its Sfr bond are shown in Exhibit 5 in column (A). The Sfr swap flows are shown in column (C). The Company surrendered to the bank the entire net Sfr proceeds in exchange for future Sfr receipts which exactly matched its debt service requirements. Also, as shown in column (B), the Company agreed to pay to the bank in years one through five the exact amount of US$required to service the WB's US$debt. The initial receipt of US$48.872 million paid by the bank is the present value of the required future US$outflows discounted at 16.70%. Therefore, the internal rate of return on the flows in column (B), and hence, the company's AIC, is 16.70%.

The bank's cash flows are shown in Exhibit 6. Its swap flows with the WB, shown in columns (A) and (B), are equal and opposite to the flows shown in columns (B) and (C) in Exhibit 4. Likewise, the bank's swap flows with the Company shown in columns (C) and (D) in Exhibit 6 are equal and opposite to the flows shown in columns (B) and (C) in Exhibit 5. The net US$and Sfr cash flows are shown in columns (E) and (F). Note that in years one through five the cash flows are perfectly matched and the bank acts merely as a conduit. However, in the initial exchange, the bank nets US$190,000 and Sfr 487,000 (about US$243,000) for a total profit of about US$433,000. This profit is compensation for brokering the swap, bring together the counterparties, arranging the deal, and acting as credit intermediary. In currency swaps, the bank faces credit exposure which is a function of both interest rate and foreign exchange risk. If, for example, US$interest rates fell, and the Company defaulted, the bank would be unlikely to find another counterparty who would pay similar rates, while the bank would remain obligated to make all contractual payments to the WB. Note that if the Company defaulted on its swap payments to the bank, the bank would stop making swap payments in return to the Company (the right of offset). The annual all-in costs associated with the flows from the bond issues and the swaps are shown in Exhibit 7.

It is easy to see from the diagram in Exhibit 7 how the total arbitrage was finally split among the three parties. The following table summarizes these savings:

![[image3 3.png|image3 3.png]]

Note: The initial flow of$433,000 that the bank recognizes is the present value of the 24 bps of the 141 bps of total arbitrage profits it has appropriated.

# THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAP MARKETS

> With the introduction of interest rate swaps in the spring of 1982, fixed-rate US$obligations could be converted into floating rate US$obligations. The development of this market resulted from the needs of major European, Canadian, and Japanese banks to acquire competitively priced longer term floating rate US$funding for their growing volume of floating-rate US$assets. They had typically paid slightly higher spreads over LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate) for Eurodollar bank borrowings than their U.S. counterparts. However, these banks had not been very active in the fixedrate Eurodollar bond market and enjoyed, for a while, a "scarcity" value in that market, which resulted in relatively low fixed-rate all-in US$costs. On the other hand, many large, lower-credit U.S. companies were seeking fixed-rate US$financing but were forced to use floating-rate loans with rates calculated as spreads over LIBOR because fixed-rate bonds were prohibitively expensive. Some European and Japanese banks began issuing fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds and entering into interest rate swaps whereby they made floating-rate US$LIBOR swap payments to the U.S. companies. In return, these companies made fixed-rate US$swap payments to the banks that covered the debt service on their Eurodollar bonds. These arrangements reduced the cost of floating-rate US$for the banks to LIBOR, and reduced the cost of fixed-rate US$for the U.S. companies to a level close to the more favorable US$rates paid by the European and Japanese banks.3 In late 1982 and 1983, the tremendous volume of foreign-bank, fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds that were swapped into floatingrate dollars put pressure on these markets, and the savings resulting from this strategy were substantially reduced.
>
> As the fixed-rate Eurodollar market became less hospitable to the European, Canadian, and Japanese banks, they sought fixed-rate funding in other currencies, such as DM or Sfr, and swapped these liabilities for fixed-rate dollars. The fixed-rate US$flows were then swapped into floating-rate dollars. Over time, US$interest-rate swaps became commodities that were aggressively offered by the banks to their customers. An estimated US$3,851 billion of notional principal amount of interestrate swaps were arranged in 1992. Major international banks made a market in interest-rate swaps by quoting bid-offer rates for various maturities and holding trading positions. The bid rate was the fixed US$rate that banks were willing to pay against receiving six-month US$LIBOR, and the offer rate was the fixed US$rate that they were willing to receive against paying six-month US$LIBOR.4The fixed-rates were typically quoted as spreads over benchmark Treasuries (see Exhibit 8). Thus, borrowers could easily exchange fixed foreign-currency obligations into US$LIBOR obligations by a combination of fixed-rate currency swaps and US$interest-rate swaps. The practice of swapping fixed-rate, foreign-currency flows for US$LIBOR was also attractive for sovereigns and foreign state agencies who wanted fixed-rate, foreign-currency liabilities, but, because of the size of their needs or their lower credit, were forced to issue Eurodollar floating-rate notes (FRNs). These borrowers were natural payers of fixed-rate foreign currency because they often wanted to establish liabilities in these currencies to hedge official reserves or match future foreign-currency trade inflows.
>
> Currency swaps are now frequently quoted as either the annual or semiannual fixed rate on the foreign currency flows against six-month US$LIBOR. By relating any two quotes to US$LIBOR, banks can easily determine the fixed swap rate in one currency against the fixed swap rate in another currency. Major international banks now make markets in foreign-currency swaps, and quotes are generally available in several currencies for various maturities (see Exhibit 9).

# CURRENCY SWAPS USING MARKET SWAP RATES

> In order to illustrate the mechanics of intermediated currency swaps that are structured using quoted market swap rates, we will return to the WB-Company swap described previously in which both parties agreed to make swap payments that exactly covered the required future debt service of the counterparty (see Exhibits 4 through 7). Assume the same basic terms:
>
> ![[image4 3.png|image4 3.png]]
>
> By relating US$LIBOR, the bank offered to pay to the WB annual US$16.25% against receiving annual Sfr 7.8%. In this case, there are market swap rates for both the US$and Sfr payments. Note, therefore, that the quoted annual US$16.25% swap rate that would be paid by the bank to the WB was not the same as the 16.58% annual all-in cost on the bond. As for the cash flows, the bank agreed to pay to the WB in years one through five the exact amount of US$needed to cover the annual interest and final principal payments on its bond. Also, the WB agreed to pay Sfr equal to the future required debt service on the Company's bond. Therefore, the size of both initial swap exchanges in US$and Sfr between the WB and the bank were adjusted to achieve the quoted swap rates.
>
> The calculation of the WB's flows from the US$bond and the swap with the bank are shown in Exhibit 10. Column (A) contains the flows from the US$bond. In column (B), the WB's US$swap receipts from the bank in years one through five exactly match its debt service. The amount of the initial US$payment that the WB must make to the bank is US$49.593 million—the present value of the required annual US$flows from years one through five discounted at the 16.25% quoted US$swap rate. Similarly, column (C) shows the Sfr swap flows. The size of the WB's initial Sfr receipt is Sfr 98.194 million—the present value of the required annual Sfr swap flows from years one through five discounted at the 7.8% quoted swap rate.
>
> Note that the US$49.593 million initial payment by the WB to the bank exceeds the US$49.063 million net proceeds from its bond issue. The US$0.531 million shortfall, shown in column (D), is purchased by the WB in the spot foreign exchange market out of the initial Sfr proceeds received from the bank. Thus, the Sfr initial swap inflow calculated above is effectively reduced by Sfr 1.062 million—the amount of Sfr necessary to purchase US$0.531 million at the spot offer rate. Column (F) shows the WB's effective Sfr cash flows after subtracting the amount of Sfr used to purchase US$and cover the shortfall. The effective annual all-in Sfr cost to the WB is 8.07%—the internal rate of return of the Sfr flows in column (F). The quoted swap rates for the WB enabled it to reduce its annual all-in Sfr borrowing cost below its target rate of 8.10% by 3 bp.
>
> For the Company, the bank related US$LIBOR for the market swap rates and offered to pay annual Sfr 7.7% against receiving annual US$16.35%. The cash flows between the bank and the Company, calculated similarly to those between the bank and the WB, are shown in Exhibit 11. The cash flows to the bank from the swap, ignoring the foreign exchange transactions, appear in Exhibit 12.

# BASIS POINTS CONVERSION

> In practice, banks often use another technique to structure the swap flows, although the resulting all-in cost to the counterparty is usually quite close to the one calculated in the method described previously. For the sake of brevity, only the swap between the bank and the WB will be discussed, although the principles described are the same for the swap between the bank and the Company. Since the quoted swap rate paid to the WB was US$16.25% compared to the US$16.58% annual all-in cost of the bonds, there was a shortfall of US$33 bp. The bank converted the swap terms such that the US$swap rate paid to WB would equal the US$16.58% annual all-in cost of the bonds by adding US$33 bp. With a higher US$swap rate paid to the WB, the Sfr swap rate that the bank received also had to be increased. However, US$33 bp, paid annually over five years, was not equal to Sfr 33 bp. As the Sfr was at a forward premium to the US$, the amount of equivalent annual Sfr bp was smaller. The calculation of the conversion of US$33 bp to Sfr bp using the forward foreign exchange market is shown in Exhibit 13.
>
> The easiest way to think about this computation is to first imagine issuing a hypothetical US$100 par bond with annual coupons of US$33 bp as shown in column (A). It is evident that the internal rate of return (IRR) on flows in column (A) is US$33 bp. Now imagine constructing a similar Sfr bond whose coupon payments will be equal to the Sfr equivalent of the US$33 bp converted at forward rates from columns (B) and (C). Since in the actual swap the bank will have to pay these extra US$33 bp to the WB, it will buy US$forward against Sfr.5 Therefore, we will use the forward offer rates shown in column (D) to calculate the size of the coupons in years one through five on our imaginary Sfr bond. Because the forward rates are not level, the coupons are not equal. For any bond, there is an amount of initial proceeds and the repayment of principal at maturity. In order to scale the size of the imaginary Sfr bond, we will use for convenience Sfr 2 per US$—the average of the spot bid-offer rates. Thus, the initial Sfr inflow on our imaginary par bond issue is Sfr 200 (Sfr 2 x US$100) as shown in column (E). In years one through five, there are unequal Sfr coupon payments. In year five, the Sfr 200 principal is repaid at par along with the coupon of Sfr 0.458 for a total disbursement of Sfr 200.458. The internal rate of return of the Sfr flows in column (E) is.27%, which means that US$33 bp are equal to Sfr 27 bp.
>
> The effective swap rates, after converting excess US$bp for Sfr bp, are calculated in Exhibit 14. The quoted US$swap rate of 16.25% was increased by US$33 bp to US$16.58%, and the quoted Sfr swap rate of 7.8% was increased by Sfr 27 bp to Sfr 8.07%. These effective rates were used in Exhibit 15 to discount the required flows in years one through five in order to determine the initial swap amounts. In column (B), the required swap receipts of US$8 million for interest in years one through four, and the US$58 million for interest and principal in year five, were discounted at the effective US$swap rate of 16.58%, resulting in an initial swap payment of US$49.063 million. By converting the quoted swap rate to the effective rate, the initial US$swap payment exactly matched the net proceeds from the US$bond because the internal rates of return for the two identical future flows were the same. For the Sfr swap flows shown in column (C), the required Sfr 7.35 million interest payments in years one through four, and the Sfr 107.35 million interest and principal payment in year five, were discounted at the effective Sfr swap rate of 8.07%, resulting in an initial receipt of Sfr 97.132 million. Since there was no shortfall (or excess) of US$that would reduce (or increase) the Sfr initial swap proceeds, the all-in Sfr cost of the swap was merely 8.07%—the internal rate of return of the Sfr flows in column (C). Note that this is exactly the effective all-in Sfr cost shown in Exhibit 10, where we used the quoted swap rates as discount rates and covered the US$initial swap payment shortfall with spot purchases from the Sfr initial swap proceeds. This had to be true because, in this case, the forward premium on Sfr was close to the interest rate differentials between US$and Sfr. 7 Although the all-in costs associated with the cash flows were identical, the actual cash flows were not the same. The actual structure of cash flows is generally negotiable provided the appropriate all-in costs are achieved. For this reason, most swap diagrams show the allin costs associated with flows rather than absolute levels of flows or annual coupon rates. The swap diagram, showing the effective swap rates calculated earlier for the WB and those for the Company (not calculated), appears in Exhibit 16.

![[image5 3.png|image5 3.png]]

> There is a quicker but less precise method than setting up the forward conversion table using an imaginary bond as shown in Exhibit 13 that bankers often use to roughly calculate the bp conversion rate between two currencies. In this shorthand method, the excess bp in one currency are discounted at the appropriate term interest rate in that currency and then are reannualized using the appropriate term interest rate in the second currency. In the WB example, the following calculations were made:

1. The US$33 bp were discounted for five years at 16.25%, the quoted US$swap rate received by WB. This resulted in a present value of 107.425.
2. The 107.425 present value calculated in step 1 was then reannualized at 7.80%, the quoted Sfr swap rate that the WB paid. This equaled Sfr 27 bp.

> The results from this shorthand calculation will always be close to those obtained using forward foreign exchange rates when the forward premium or discount for the period approximates the difference in interest rates.

## COMBINATION CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS

> Because of the large number of FRN issuers and borrowers using floating-rate syndicated loans, many swaps are structured where one counterparty receives US$LIBOR against paying a fixed annual rate on a foreign currency. Often, the other counterparty wants to pay a fixed rate on US$against receiving a fixed rate on a foreign currency. The bank must adjust the swap flows using both currency and interest rate swaps.
>
> In order to illustrate a combination currency and interest rate swap, let's assume that a U.S. company (Company) wanted to raise US$100 million, 7-year, fixed-rate financing and, at the same time, a German bank wanted to raise DM 225.230 million (roughly the equivalent of US$100 million), seven-year, fixed-rate financing. Because of substantial US$borrowings, the Company would have paid a semiannual all-in cost of 70 bp over seven-year U.S. Treasuries. With the Treasuries at 9.03%, the semiannual all-in cost on direct US$borrowings would have been 9.73% or 9.97% on an annual basis. However, the Company had scarcity value in the Euro DM market and could issue DM bonds at an annual all-in cost of DM 6.50%. The German bank was a frequent borrower in DM and would have been forced to pay an annual all-in DM cost of 7.25%. On the other hand, it could issue a Eurodollar FRN at US$LIBOR flat. One strategy would have been for each borrower to issue in the market in which it was relatively well received and hedge the debt with bank forwards into the desired currency. The result for the Company's DM bond hedged into US$was an annual all-in cost of US$10.23% (see Exhibit 17), which was higher than the direct US$borrowing cost. On the other hand, the German bank could have converted its semiannual US$LIBOR payments into annual fixed US$at 9.86% with an interest-rate swap (see Exhibit 8) and hedged these flows into an annual all-in cost of DM 6.97% (see Exhibit 18). However, because contracting for the currency forwards would have used up valuable credit lines with other banks, the German bank preferred to explore the costs of a swap.

1. The German bank issued an FRN at US$LIBOR6 and entered into a swap agreement with the bank at the quoted swap rates in which it received US$LIBOR against paying DM 7%.
2. The Company issued a DM bond at an annual all-in cost of DM 6.5%, and the bank agreed to swap terms quoted as annual DM 6.7% against annual US$9.86%. However, the bank adjusted the swap terms so that it only paid DM 6.5% to cover the Company's debt service.
3. The bank contracted with a foreign exchange dealer (FX) to sell forward the extra DM 50 bp (the excess of the DM 7% received from the German bank over the DM 6.5% paid to the Company) against US$bp (see Exhibit 19). The internal rate of return of the US$flows indicated that annual DM 50 bp was equal to annual US$56 bp. The shorthand conversion method confirmed this result.
4. The bank reduced the US$swap terms for the Company on a pro rata basis. The extra annual DM 20 bp (DM 6.7% quoted swap terms less DM 6.50% actually paid) were equal to annual US$22 bp (DM 20 bp/DM 50 bp x US$56 bp). Therefore, the Company paid annual US$9.64% to the bank (US$9.86% quoted swap rate less US$0.22%).
5. The bank booked an interest-rate swap in which it exchanged annual US$9.86% against receiving US$LIBOR. The US$9.86% consisted of annual US$9.64% paid by the Company and US$0.22 from the US$56 bp received from FX. The US$LIBOR was paid to the German bank as described above in the first transaction.

> In this deal, the bank was left with a profit of annual US$34 bp (US$56 bp received from FX less US$22 bp used to subsidize the Company's US$swap payment). Note that in this example, we did not even need to discuss actual cash flows to determine the all-in costs to either borrower. The annual all-in costs from the cash flows of the debt issues and the swaps are shown in Exhibit 20.

## SUMMARY

> Currency swaps can provide an attractive alternative to the use of bank forward foreign exchange contracts for long-dated currency cover. The primary use of currency swaps has been to hedge foreign currency debt. Many US$-based borrowers have issued foreign currency debt to (1) expand their investor base, (2) avoid ratings revisions that are often triggered with new U.S. debt, or (3) exploit arbitrage opportunities where it is less costly to issue debt denominated in foreign currencies and swap back into dollars. These arbitrage opportunities can persist in an age of modern financial markets because of several factors. Markets often become saturated with the paper from one borrower. This is often the case with supranationals, sovereigns, and state agencies seeking to issue debt in low-coupon currencies such as Sfr and DM. In this case, lower all-in costs can be achieved by issuing in the US$market, finding a surrogate foreign currency borrower—such as a U.S. company— and swapping liabilities. Opportunities are also created when investors in certain countries use different techniques of credit assessment, such as emphasizing name recognition and other qualitative factors. For example, Swiss investors have been attracted to well-known corporate names, especially those that market consumer products, and are willing to pay a premium on bonds from these issuers. In many foreign capital markets, there is much less emphasis on quantitative analysis and credit ratings than in the US$markets. Also, foreign markets typically demand lower spread differentials for lower credits. In response, many of these companies issued bonds in the yen market, where their debt ratios were well accepted, and swapped into US$liabilities. Regulations can also make borrowing in one currency more attractive than another. The limitations on purchases by Japanese life insurance companies of foreign-issued bonds, for example, has led to tremendous demand for US$-denominated debt of Japanese resident companies that is excluded from this regulation (Sushi bonds). Because of this demand, Japanese resident borrowers issued US$debt at lower-than-market rates and swapped back into yen at attractive all-in yen costs.
>
> Currency swaps have also enabled borrowers to indirectly access debt markets that might have otherwise been difficult to tap. For example, the World Bank can indirectly increase its Sfr and DM liabilities by issuing dollars and swapping into these currencies. At this time, such swaps also allow the World Bank to preserve its access to these markets in the future. Other borrowers have used swaps to quickly incur liabilities in currencies where there is a long queue of borrowers waiting to be given permission by the monetary authorities to do capital markets issues.
>
> Currency swaps have proven to be very flexible tools that do not need to be tied to capital markets issues. Companies have used these swaps to quickly transform the currency denomination of existing liabilities. The World Bank pursues a swap program to "fine-tune" its liability structure by actively swapping into and out of different currencies in order to achieve the lowest possible debt costs. Swaps can also be used to hedge anticipated future cash flows. This has led to "asset swaps" used by investors to transform the income on investments into different currencies.
>
> Major international banks are now aggressively offering currency swaps and are often arranging deals before a matching counterparty has been located. Therefore, just as interest-rate swaps became a commodity, so will currency swaps. Banks are often willing to take currency swap positions onto their books until a matching counterparty can be found. While these positions are on their books, banks prefer to hedge their exposure by buying government bonds in the currencies in which they are contracted to pay fixed rates, or shorting government bonds in currencies in which they are contracted to receive fixed rates. It is relatively easy to hedge swaps in US$, Can$, sterling, and DM in this manner. In Sfr, where there are not adequate government bonds that can be used for hedging, banks have occasionally taken on unhedged positions because of the relative stability of Sfr interest rates and currency values. However, even when a counterparty is found, it is rare that the timing or the amount of future swap flows will exactly match. Therefore, the bank usually has future cash flow mismatches that also must be hedged. As these hedging techniques are perfected, one major impediment to continued strong growth of the foreign currency swap market—the ability to find a matching counterparty—will be overcome.
