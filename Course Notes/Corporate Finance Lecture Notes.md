# Grading  

•   Mid-term exam 30%   

 •   Final Exam 30%

 •   Class Participation 5%  
# Assets and Investment Decisions  

•   Real Assets  

o   Physical – land, plant and equipment, computer hardware    o   Intellectual – software, patents, knowhow  

•   Financial Asset  

o   A financial claim, including unrestricted ownership, on real  assets, or on other financial assets  

§   Securities are a subset of financial assets  •   Not all financial assets are securities  •   Despite what the text says!  
# Assets and Investment Decisions  

•   Investment Decision  

o   Purchase decision regarding real or financial assets    o   D is investment or exit decision – sale of some all of an  investment  

•   Financing Decision  

o   Sale of financial assets to fund an investment decision  §   Securities e.g., stocks or bonds  §   Loans  
# Assets and Investment Decisions  

•   Capital Budget/Capital Expenditure  

o   Amount to be spent for investment purposes in the year    o   Separate from Operating Budget/Operating Expenses  

•   Capital Structure  

o   Set of liabilities which fund an investment     o   Usually used in reference to a corporation or trust  
# Business Organizations  

•   Cost and ability to obtain those forms may vary widely  

•   Focus on corporate form of organization  

o   Widely available and relatively inexpensive to create in  most developed countries  
# Business Organizations  

•   Organization types available in the United States  

o   Sole Proprietorship s    o   Partnerships  o   Limited Liability Corporations  o   Subchapter C and S Corporations  o   Not-for-Profit Corporations  

•   Property rights and liability limitations vary  
# Sole Proprietorship s  

•   Typically small businesses   

 •   Example:  local retail shop   

 •   Owned by a single individual  o   Few employees   

 •   Owner has unlimited liability  o   Personally liable for liabilities of business  

•   Lenders often require collateral for new or small businesses  
# General Partnerships  

•   General Partnerships allow multiple individuals or other  entities to own a business  

o   Share profits and losses pro rata    o   Share unlimited liability individually for partnership’s risks   o   Ends with death or withdrawal of a partner  

•   Each partner fully liable for all other partners’ decisions  o   Each partner may bind firm – jointly and severally liable  
# General and Limited Partnerships  

•   General Partner  

o   Managing Partner  

o   Controls decisions of the partnership  

§   Unlimited liability  §   May be a corporation, often a limited liability  corporation (LLC)  

•   LLC as general partner  

o   Provides limited personal liability to each individual GP  
# General and Limited Partnerships  

•   Two types of partnerships  

o   General Partnerships    o   Limited Partnerships  

•   Limited partnerships  

o   Liability limited to capital invested    o   Limited or no role in activities of partnership    o   Death or withdrawal does not dissolve partnership  
# Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs)  

•   Incorporated within a given state of the United States   

 •   Typically Delaware  

o   Long history of corporate legal decisions    o   Viewed as fair or favorable to corporations  

•   May be incorporated in any US state  
# Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs)  

•   Size of LLCs may range from an individual who owns an asset  (say a farm) to companies with \$ 1 billion or more of sales  

o   Often family owned companies or otherwise closely-held    o   Many owners involved as management or directors  

•   Taxed as partnerships  

o   Profits and losses pass through to owners pro rata  Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs)  
•   Used frequently by private equity firms as investment vehicles    o   Advantages of partnership taxation structure    o   Still maintain limited liability  o   Principal Disadvantage:  §   Convert LLC to a C corporation if company goes public  §   Alternative to create C corporation holding company

# Type C Corporation  

•   Named after Subchapter C of the US Internal Revenue Code 

 •   C corporations are taxed as a separate entity from owners 

 •   Most large corporations are C corporations 

 •   Much more flexibility to raise capital – “take public”  

o   Issue shares – interests in the company    o   May issue dividends  
# Type C Corporation  

•   When taken public, known as an Initial Public Offering (IPO)   

 •   May be purchased by any type of investor  o   Individual    o   Mutual or pension fund  o   Foreign investor   

 •   May be private  
# Type C Corporation Advantages  

•   Distinct legal entity with rights similar to an individual in some  respects – “legal person”  

•   Ease in ownership transfer (purchase and sales of shares)  

o   Low transaction costs    o   Corporations have “unlimited” life     o   Limited liability for shareholders  o   Increased regulatory scrutiny, if public  
# Not-for-Profit Corporations 1  

•   US and many other countries allow certain types of  corporations to not pay corporate taxes  

o   Charitable, Religious, and Educational Organizations  (501(c)(3))  o   Social Welfare Organizations (501(c)(4))  

o   Other Nonprofit or Tax-exempt Organizations (501(a-k))  
# Not-for-Profit Requirements  

•   Principal reason for organization is not to make a profit   

 •   Corporate earnings may not go to any owner     o   May earn a salary and bonus   

 •   Need to apply to Internal Revenue Service   

 •   Continuing reporting requirements  
# B Corporations 2  

•   Not a federal designation – no tax advantages  

•   Certified by B Lab a nonprofit  

o   Purpose:  

§   Demonstrate commitment to stakeholders broadly   §   Examples:  environment, local community, employees  

•   Currently over 5000 globally  

•   Governance  must be incorporated in charter  
# Financial Managers  

•   Investment decisions made by line of business heads  

•   Financial Managers  

o   Budgeting, rule setting    o   Financing decisions – capital structure  
# Financial Managers  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/863809ef59bc8e73a615f42e4afd6f89797077c3fc5f4bd594c142017fcc8321.jpg)  
# Maximizing Shareholder Value  

•   Free market capitalism  

•   Friedman doctrine on business and social responsibility  

o   Maximize the company’s value    o   Return money to investors (your employers)    o   “Well-functioning” financial markets    o   Investors act through taxation or philanthropy  

•   Maximizing value is complex enough  
# Maximizing Shareholder Value  

•   Shareholders have diverse goals – impossible to fully satisfy all  

o   Young/Old  

o   Risk Tolerance  o   Environmental, Social, Governance  

•   Investors need to account for above – not company  management  

•   By making investors as rich as possible, management provides  maximum freedom of choice  
# Maximizing Shareholder Value  

•   Assumptions  

o   Managers able to maximize Net Present Value of firm  

o   All companies play by the same rules  

§   Taxes  §   Labor laws  §   Environment, safety and other regulations  

o   Concentrated versus diversified interests behave similarly  
# Agency  

•   Agent – someone acting on behalf of others  

o   Management  for shareholders and bond holders    o   Investment manager for clients  

•   Separation of ownership and control  

o   Benefits and costs

Calculating Present and Future Values  Dave Schabes  

January 5, 2023  
# Future Value 1  

•   The future value of an investment is equal to the initial  amount of the investment multiplied by one plus the interest  rate (or other form of return) earned over the time period  

!"#"\$% '()"% \*+ \$100 (# 7% 1%\$ (22"3 +\*\$ #4\* 5%(\$6,  8  = \$100 ⋅1.07 = \$107,  $C_{2}=\S107\cdot1.07=\S114.49,$  ,    !  $o r\;C_{2}=\S100\cdot1.07^{2}$

•   Not concerned where  \$  comes from for now  

•   Assumes that  \$  will be the interest rate for each period     o   Reinvestment risk  

•   Usually will work with annual rates  
# Compound Interest  

# •   When one reinvests their returns and continues to earn  interest, this is known as  compound interest  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/2f3bfc414a29f7244ac5e96980c510ffa09ceca59bd77cd0f12eae1da34a4d27.jpg)

# Valuation  

# •   What is wrong with the text example?  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/3534b1bcde464a6bef5660895e945b35df81af77a33637c31f1c0657bcf54593.jpg)  
# Valuation  

•   Given risk free rate of 7% and stock market return of 12%  

o   Stock market is risky  

o   Future value of \$700,000   §   At 7%:  \$749,000  §   At 12%:  \$784,000  

•   Office building will be worth \$800,000 in one year for certain  

o   PV = \$747,664 at 7%    o   Pay \$700,000 so net present value is +\$47,664  
# Accounting for Risk  

•   Expected return:  mean return for project  

o   Need to consider all potential outcomes    o   Difficulty in determining outcomes varies  o   Risk determines appropriate discount rate  

•   No risk free investment should earn a positive NPV  

•   Nominal versus real returns  

•   Return to risk in a couple of weeks  
# Net Present Value and Rate of Return Rules  

•   Net Present Value Rule:  invest in projects where the net  present value is greater than 0  

•   Rate of return:  Profit/Investment – invest where project’s  return on capital exceeds opportunity cost of capital  

•   Opportunity Cost of Capital – the rate of return (usually  expressed on an annual basis) appropriate for the investment  

o   Very difficult in practice to get right  o   Many methods to estimate – will discuss a some later  
Calculating Present Values with Multiple Cash Flows  

$$

o   Cash flows:  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/2b5215fb8b403d41d25609732ce3f524cb9f4a6cd97819a2c234e750853d835b.jpg)  

o   Opportunity cost of capital   $15\%$  , solve for PV:  

>? !  = \$432/(1.15),  $P V_{2}=\S137/(1.15)^{2},P V_{3}=\S797/(1.15)$  5) & ,   $P V_{1}=375.65,P V_{2}=103.59,P V_{3}$   $P V_{3}=525.04,$  ,    ${}^{P}V_{P r o j e c t}=375.65+103.59+525.04=$   = 375.65 + 103.59 + 525.04 = 1004.28;   F2'%6# \$1200,    O%#   $\ P r e s e n t\,V a l u e\ =-\S1200+\S1004.28$  = −195.73  
# Opportunity Cost of Capital  

•   Opportunity cost must reflect the risk of the opportunity  

o   Not necessarily (often unlikely) to equal the cost at which  the company investing in the opportunity may borrow    o   Should always be compared to a similarly risky opportunity  
# Perpetuities and Annuities  

•   Perpetuities – investments that pay a fixed amount per  period, “forever” (in perpetuity)  

o   Consols  

•   Annuities – investments that pay a fixed amount per period,  for a fixed time period (or an actuarily determined one)  

o   Installment loan payments    o   Life annuities  
# Valuing Perpetuities and Annuities  

•   This equation shows the present value of a perpetual stream 2  

$$
\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}\!=\!\frac{C}{1+r}\!+\!\sum_{t=2}^{\infty}\!\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}\!=\!\frac{C}{1+r}
$$  

•   Left side summation an infinite geometric series – solution is:  

$$
P V={\frac{C}{r}}
$$  
# Perpetuities  

•   Intuitive formula:  

$$
P V={\frac{C}{1+r}}+{\frac{P V}{1+r}}
$$  

$$
P V\times(1+r)=C+P V
$$  

$$
1+r={\frac{C}{P V}}+1
$$  

$$
r={\frac{C}{P V}}\ o r\ P V={\frac{C}{r}}
$$  
# Perpetuity Example  

•   How much money do you need to donate to provide an  scholarship of \$50,000 a year in perpetuity, if interest rates  will be 5% forever?  

$$
P V=\frac{C}{r}=\frac{\S50{,}000}{.05}=\S1{,}000{,}000
$$  
# Annuities  

•   Annuities pay a fixed amount each period for a defined  number of periods  

•   The formula is the same for a perpetuity except summing for a  finite number of periods, T  

$$
P V=\sum_{t=1}^{T}{\frac{C}{(1+r)^{t}}}
$$  
# Annuities  

•   Solution derived using formula for finite geometric series 3  

•   Intuitively, consider difference between two perpetuities  starting a t=0 and one at   $\tt t\mathrm{=}\tt t$  , where t  ≥1  

$$
^P V=\frac{C}{r}-\frac{C}{r(1+r)^{t}}=C\times\Big[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r(1+r)}
$$  

•   If need to solve for C:  

$$
C={\cfrac{P V}{{\cfrac{1}{r}}-{\cfrac{1}{(1+r)^{t}}}}}
$$  
# Annuity Example  

•   How much money do you need to have saved to provide an  annual income of \$50,000 by purchasing a 10 year annuity, if  interest rates will be 5% for the next 10 years?  

>? = 8 × Y  $\left[\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{r(1+r)^{t}}\right]=\S50,\!000\times\left[\frac{1}{.\,05}-\frac{1}{.\,05}\right]$  1 Z   . 05(1 + .05) !%   = \$50,000 × (20 −12.27865) = \$386,086.75

# Installment Loan Example  

•   Your business needs to borrow \$10,000,000 for thirty years to  purchase a building   

 •   Repay loan in equal annual installments 

 •   Interest rate:  8% per annum 

 •   Calculate annual payments due:  

8 =  10,000,000/((1/.08) × (1 –  1/(1 + .08) &% )     =  \$888,274.33  
# Installment Loan Example  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e9ec244b0e9321f92fe9f6717ddb58977ac839c2ff2b1fb6837be99956018507.jpg)  
Principal Amortization of Annual Installment Loan  
# Growing Perpetuity  

$$
\frac{C}{+\,r}+\frac{C(1+g)}{(1+r)^{2}}+\frac{C(1+g)^{2}}{(1+r)^{3}}+\cdots+\frac{C(1+g)^{n}}{(1+r)^{n}},
$$  

•   Annual payment, C, grows by g annually after the first period  

•   By similar logic to fixed perpetuity argument, with g now  representing the annual growth:  

$$
P V_{g}={\frac{C}{r-g}}
$$  
# Growing Perpetuity  

•   Scholarship fund:  

o   Want to provide \$40,000 annual scholarship forever which  adjusts for inflation    o   Expect University endowment fund to earn 6% annually  and   $2\%$   annual growth in tuition rates  

>? 1   =  \$40,000/(.06 −.02)     $P V_{g}\:=\:\S1,000,000$  
# Growing Annuity  

$$
P V_{g}=\frac{C}{r-g}\times\left(1-\left(\frac{1+g}{1+r}\right)^{t}\right)
$$  

•   Pension fund contributions:  

o   Contribute \$5,000 per year; grow contribution at 5% p.a.    o   Expect fund to grow at 6% p.a.  

o   How much will you have in 40 years?  
# Growing Annuity  

$$
P V_{g}=\,\left(\frac{\S5,\!000}{.06\,-.05}\right)\times\left(1-(\frac{1.05}{1.06})^{40}\right)
$$  

$$
P V_{g}=\,\S157{,}778{.}45
$$  

•   Future value of any annuity equals the present value  multiplied by 1+ r to the power equal to the last payment  

!? =  157,778.45 × 1.06 2%   !? =  \$1,622,864.61

# Interest Rate Quotes  

•   Interest rate quotes vary in a number of ways  

o   Compounding period    o   Day basis  

•   Annual Percentage Rate (APR)  o   Commonly used in retail loans  

§   Per period rate multiplied by number of periods  §   Example:  1% per month (on a credit card) is quoted as  an APR or 12%  
# Interest Rate Quotes  

•   Effective Annual Rate (EAR) – the effective amount of  interest paid on an annual basis  

•   Converting EAR to APR  

$$
E A R=[1+r/m]^{m}-1,
$$  

+\*\$ %e(31)%:   $A P R\,=10\%$   \*2 ( 3\*2#ℎ)5 )\*(2,   $E A R=[1+.10/12]^{12}-1=10.47\%$  

•   Continuous compounding often used in economic models  

o   Simplifies calculations then converted to appropriate  rate, e.g., semi-annually  
# Continuous Compounding Example  

•   Formula:   !"#"\$% ?()"% = % \*#  

•   Example: Initial investment \$1,000  

o   Continuous interest rate: 5%    o   Number of periods:  3  o   Final value of investment:   \$1,000% .%5⋅&   = 1,161.83   o   Annual interest rate equivalent:  

(\$1161.83/\$1000) !/&   −1 = 5.13%

# Bond Terminology  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e9a331c6bb046a0f9174ceffca62ce1966028b5766e068e969acfb89c7b3cf16.jpg)  
# Bond Terminology  

•   Certificate – evidence of ownership  

•   Indenture – legal documentation containing terms and  conditions 

 •   Maturity Date – Date that the bond repays its principal and  final interest payment     

 •   “Term” or “Tenor” – time remaining until repayment of note 

 •   Coupon Rate – the percentage of face value to be paid 

 •   Face Value or Principal – amount to be repaid at maturity  
# Bond Terminology  

•   Coupon – payments due at each coupon date   o   Cut off and redeemed (hence the term “coupon clippers”)  •   Interest typically paid semi-annually  

•   Coupon  $=$   Coupon Rate X Face Value / Number of Coupon  Payments per Year  

o   \$100  x 11.75% / 2 = \$5.875 per \$100 bond held  
# OAT Text Example Updated for October 2021 Purchase  

•   Five year French bond yield -0.449% in June 2021  

•   Final maturity of OAT issued October 25, 1993 due October  10, 2025

# Bond Terminology  

•   Yield to Maturity (YTM) –   !  in the equation above  

o   Bond’s rate of return based on its current market price    o    “Yield to call” and “yield to worst”  

•   Current Yield  

o   Coupon/Price =  €6.00/€132.69 =  4.52%  
# Calculating YTM  

For a Zero Coupon Bond:  

$$
Y T M=\Big(\frac{F V}{P}\Big)^{\frac{1}{n}}-1,

# Calculating YTM – Examples  

•   Zero coupon bond

# Coupon Bond Terms  

•   Coupon note or bond:  

o   Trading “at par” – price equal to face value (e.g., 100)  

o   Trading “below par” or “at a discount to par” below 100  

§   Current yield is below YTM  §   Creates a capital gain at maturity  

o   Trading “above par” or “at a premium”  

§   Current yield exceeds YTM  §   Creates a capital loss  

•   Pure discount bond, note or bill – no coupon  
# Bond Price Terms  

•   Bid Price – where bond dealer will buy a bond   

 •   Asked (Offered) Price – where bond dealer will sell a bond   

 •   Clean Price – the quoted bond price, without accrued interest    o   This is what is quoted   

 •   Dirty or Invoice Price – the price with accrued interest    o   Amount of cash you actually have to provide  
# Invoice Price vs Clean Price  

•   Five year note issued December 30, 2022.  Clean price:  100.  Pays 5% coupon rate paid semi annually:  June 30 and  December 30  

•   Purchase April 5:  

•   How much do we pay?  

$$
00*{\frac{\left(.05*{\frac{96}{182}}\right)}{2}}=100+1.32=101.3
$$  

•   We pay this because we take ownership of the coupon for the  entire period from December 30, 2022 to June 30, 2023  
# US Government Bond Market  

•   Fixed-income market   

 •   Treasury Bills – mature in one year or less pay no interest 

 •   Treasury Notes – mature in 10 years or less 

 •   Treasury Bonds – mature in more than 10 but less than 30  years  

 •   Notes and bonds pay interest semi annually

# •   Prices move inversely to yields  
# Bond Duration (Interest Rate Sensitivity) 2  

•   Price of any fixed coupon instrument will fall (rise) as interest  rates rise (fall)  

•   Various, slightly different measures of duration – sensitivity of  price to interest rate changes  

$$

# Bond Duration (Interest Rate Sensitivity)  

•   Duration represents the sum of present value proportional  contribution of each cash flow   

 •   Modified duration (price sensitivity to a change in interest  rates)    Modified Duration = Duration/(1 + YTM), with some caveats 

 •   Measures only sensitivity to a parallel shift in yield curve  

o   More complex changes require more sophisticated tools

# Valuing Bonds Using Spot Rates

# The Law of One Price  

•   The law of one price states that, given efficient market  conditions, there are no pure arbitrage opportunities  

o   Any set of future identical cashflows must be priced the  same – have identical present values  

o   Since real world markets do not meet efficient market  assumptions, there are some arbitrage opportunities  available  

§   Only realizable on a statistical basis  §   High cost to access these opportunities

# Term Structure Measurement  

•   Spot rate –discount single payment received on a date  o   Must be inferred in most cases  

§   Limited number of discount (single payment) bills   §   Notes and bonds make multiple coupon payments  

o   STRIPS – Separate Trading of Registered Interest and  Principal of Securities  

§   Separates principal only portion of coupon notes and  bonds which trade regularly  §   Allows creation of zero coupon (spot) yield curve  
# More on Discount Factors  

•   Inverted yield curves  

o   Implied forward rates  

§   One year spot rate:  20%  §   Two year spot rate:    7%  1 1 X' !   = 1.20  = .833, X' .   = 1.07 .  = .873  3<>:314 X' . = 1.0481 A2    !  

7 =1B75391 4.59% 3=512145 2751 6A2 A=1 !172 3= A=1 !172  

•   While this example is obvious, building spot yield curves is  complex and relies on assumptions to exclude arbitrage  opportunities  
# Term Structure and Expectations Theory  

•   Why does the term structure exist?  

o   Liquidity preference    o   Expectations theory  o   Risk  o   Inflation (Deflation) risk  

•   Prices reflect future view of all market participants  
# Real versus Nominal Returns  

•   Real return   $(r_{r e a l})$  :  

$$

# Common Stock Trading  

•   Primary Share Offering  

o   Usually an “Initial Public Offering” (IPO)  

o   Preceded by a “Road Show”  

§   Company management and underwriters (Investment  Banks) tell company’s story to potential investors  §   Determine level of interest – price and quantity of  shares  

o   At offering, underwriters buy shares from company and  sell on to institutional and individual investors  
#  

#  
# Common Stock Trading  

•   Secondary offerings   

 •   Secondary share trading  

o   Buy from other shareholders – not directly from company     o   Vast majority of stock trading on this basis  

•   Ownership passes once trade is confirmed and settled  o   Payment made to seller and shares received by buyer  
# Stock Markets  

•   A stock market is a venue where buyers and sellers “meet”     o   These were once principally physical “trading floors”    §   Individuals shouted or used hand signals to trade    •   “bid” (where I buy)   •   “offer” or “ask” (where I sell)  

•   Effectively been replaced by electronic networks  
# Stock Trading on Traditional Venues  

•   Prior to market reforms a company’s stock:   o   Almost always traded on exchange where “listed”  

o   All trades in Ford Motor Company stock, for example,  would have traded on NYSE  

•   Two largest exchanges were:  o   New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  

o   National Association of Security Dealers Quotation  (NASDAQ) system  
# Post 2005 Market Changes  

•   Exchanges compete for limit orders to show best liquidity   

 •   More bids and offers shown on exchanges     o   Increases comfort of buyer or seller – large mutual fund    o   Creates more “market orders” on that venue   

 •   Institutional fund managers and retail investors are price  takers    

 •   Specialized firms are price makers

Utilities Regulation:  Pacific Gas & Electric 

 •   PG&E provides gas and electric utilities in California  o   Regulated by California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)  o   CPUC originally tasked solely with rate regulation  o   Mandate expanded to include:  

§   Environmental standards  §   Operational safety  

•   PG&E is a public, for profit company  

•   Both management and CPUC made numerous errors  
# Utilities Regulation:  Pacific Gas & Electric  

•   Numerous, inconsistent objectives  

•   Understanding safety issues requires:  

o   Technical competence    o   Leadership  

•   Apparent revolving door between PG&E and CPUC 

 •   PG&E exits bankruptcy on June 20, 2020  o   Pleads guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter  
# Utilities Regulation:  Pacific Gas & Electric  

•   PG&E has amassed \$30 billion in liabilities due to wildfire  damage determined to be caused by its equipment  

•   Does not include “Cal Fire”  and “Zogg Fire” damage which  occurred in 2021  

•   Part of liabilities incurred in previous fires compensated  through shares given to victims  

o   Share price has dropped dramatically since agreed  

•   Is PG&E investible?

•   What’s missing from analysis?   

 •   Discussion of risk     o   Fit with business model  §   Strategy  §   Tactical    o   Competence  o   Competitive response  

•   These determine the appropriate opportunity cost of capital  
# Investment Criteria  

•   Many types of investment decisions  

o   Mutual fund manager determining a portfolio choice    o   Private equity fund assessing a new investment  o   Information technology head deciding on a new  accounting system  o   Head of retail banking division determining where to open  a new branch  

•   All require financial and business analysis

•   Investment in business  

•   Return cash to shareholders – dividends and buybacks  
# Quantitative Investment Criteria  

•   Net Present Value   

 •   Book Rate of Return 

 •   Payback and Discounted Payback 

 •   Internal Rate of Return   

 •   Profitability Index   

 •   Money Multiple  
# Net Present Value  

•   Key points:  

o   Money today is worth more than money in the future  

§   Now true in almost every country after years of  “financial repression”  

o   NPV depends solely on forecasted cash flows and  opportunity cost of capital  

§   Both are uncertain in the real world  o   NPV values can be summed  

§   Allows comparison of projects with different time  horizons  
# Modern Portfolio Theory  

•   Assumptions underlying summing of project NPVs  o   Independence of project outcomes  o   Risk adjusted returns are similar  

o   Based on Harry Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory  §    Will cover later in quarter     $N P V(A+B)=N P V(A)+N P V(B)$  

•   Alternative measures may lack this capability  
# Book Rate of Return  

•   Book Income/Book Assets  

o   Have never seen this used  

•   Accounting terms  

o   Capital investment    o   Operating expenses  

•   Represents average rate of return across business  o   Need to look at marginal return of new activities  
# Payback and Discounted Payback  

•   When do I get my money back?  o   Helps people assess relative risk  

o   Often useful when discussing with people with little  financial background  

•   Limitations  

o   Ignores cash flows after payback date    o   Equally weights all cash flows  §   Less of an issue in low/no inflation countries  
# Payback Period  

•   Discounted payback discounts cash flows as with NPV    o   Only measures through payback date  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/69024cab720fda226cd72945fbc78151998edb42f3526577eb90a61084b7416f.jpg)  

•   Often used in conjunction with IRR and NPV  

•   Have not seen “payback rule” used as discussed in text  
# Discounted Payback Period  

•   Measure NPV of cashflows until end of payback period   o   Have never seen this used – would use NPV and IRR   o   Look at payback period to assess  

§   Potential risks over early part of investment period  §   Time until return on investment  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f02574d5c89e590951f9cb5443065e9e5739343f227eba466b9fe1cddf647a50.jpg)  
# Internal Rate of Return (IRR)  

•   IRR is the rate of return where the NPV equals zero  o   For a single payout this may be calculated directly:  

./(0 %02304 -045, ., 3789 100 ;4 04/ 8/7(, 3(;</9 =0578 95,    @  $R R\left(Y T M\right)=\left({\frac{100}{95}}\right)-1=5.26\%$  

•   For multiple cash flows, IRR must be calculated through  iterating, based on an initial guess  

o   Excel and financial calculators have functions to solve  
# Internal Rate of Return (IRR)  

•   The general formula is:  

$$
N P V=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\frac{C_{t}}{(1+I R R)^{t}}\,=0
$$  

•   IRR calculators start with an initial guess, then raise or lower  the discount rate until NPV goes to zero  

•   The investment rule based on IRR is to choose investments  where the IRR  $>$   Opportunity cost of capital  Investment  

o   With caveats, IRR rule and NPV rule usually agree  
NPV and IRR

•   IRR measures rate of return  

•   NPV may be positive, but de minimis, versus investment  

•   Why did I use two IRR guesses?

IRR and NPV Example 1  

# •   IRR equals 28.08%  
# IRR Issues  

•   IRR contains built-in assumptions:  

o   Interim cashflows are reinvested (or borrowed) at the IRR    o   Cash flows either all negative (positive) followed by all  positive (negative)  

•   If the cashflows cannot be reinvested (borrowed) at IRR,  return will be lower (borrowing cost higher)  

•   If cash flows change sign more than once, may get multiple  IRRs or no IRR  
# IRR Issues  

•   Lending and borrowing  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1255e8298f8ccdfc79f3e26a5e3bfdda29fdc74c2237aeb45e182b2b6c83b518.jpg)  

•   There is nothing wrong with the calculation above  o   Two sides of the same transaction  

•   Transaction unlikely to occur if 10% is the correct cost of  capital for both parties  
# IRR Issues  

•   Multiple IRRs – Helmsley Iron Example

•   NPV is either always positive or negative  

•   One party is providing the other “free” money  
# No IRR Example

Other party willing to hand you NPV regardless of discount  rate  
# Mutually Exclusive Projects  

•   Common problem facing companies and investors  

o   Limited resources – only negotiate one deal  

o   Examples:  

§   New corporate accounting system  •   Buy  •   Build  •   Rent (Software as a Service)    §   Limited number of staff at an investment firm  
# Machine Tool Example  

•   Manual versus computer controlled machine tool – only need  one or the other  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/830235eb44f583d7a7a8f0265b0470a5c063fdf2778361323538337e2458141c.jpg)  

•   E – D shows incremental IRR and NPV from choosing E over D  

o   Same return as D on first \$10,000 and 50% return on  second \$10,000 – well above opportunity cost of capital  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/86bdd7e4ef0ef8a9d1d7380ac2b8813d42798a67c3a9cc09d83b800623d5bfb7.jpg)  
Machine Tool Example  

•   Incremental IRR is 50%, where NPV of the projects are equal  
# Differing Cash Flows Over Time  

•   Projects F and G  

o   Equal investment amounts  

§   Cash flows over different time horizons  §   Impact of discount rate – uncertainty around  

o   Consider how long money is “locked up”  §   Reinvestment risk  §   Uncertainty regarding potential alternatives

# Multiple Opportunity Costs of Capital  

•   There is rarely a single interest rate that covers all relevant  time-periods  

o   A “flat” yield curve  

o   Unlikely to find the perfect discount rate or rates  

•   Focus on:  

o   Getting the cash flows right and  

o   Understanding the qualitative risks and quantifying  sensitivities to various changes in model inputs  
# IRR Summary  

•   IRR focuses on rate of return versus alternatives  

•   NPV focuses on net  present value dollars earned over the life  

•   Easier for many managers to think in terms of rate of return  than evaluate NPV dollars  

•   Many other qualitative factors in decision process:  

o   Example:  Risk Aversion – no one remembers if you made  an extra \$1,000 NPV but everyone remembers if your  project was significantly late or over budget  Choosing Investments With Limited Resources  
•   Acceptance of every positive NPV project ensures maximizing  shareholder wealth  

o   No firm has the resources to assess every potential project    o   Leads to capital rationing  

•   Often other critical resources effectively limit available capital  

o   People – e.g. research scientists, developers    o   Corporate competence  
# Profitability Index  

•   Assumptions:  

o   Current year capital expenditure limited to \$10 mm  

o   Three potential projects, requiring \$20 mm investment

Making Investment Decisions with the NPV Rule  Dave Schabes  

January 24, 2023  
# Five General Rules  

•   Discount cash flows, not profits   

 •   Discount incremental cash flows   

 •   Treat inflation consistently   

 •   Separate investment and financing decisions   

 •   Forecast and deduct taxes  
# Cash Flows Not Profits  

•   Always working from Financial Statements  

o   Not designed to represent cash flow    o   Represents business as a “going concern”  

•   Need to make adjustments to convert from financial  statements to cash flow  

o   Examples:  

§   Capital Expenses   §   Working Capital  
# Capital Expenses  

•   Current expenses versus capital expenses  o   Current expenses:  payroll, printer paper  

o   Capital expense:  purchase of land, equipment, a  competitor  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1f1507b9b30be0fd924beef556db6d5486c3333ecfe875010d8a95efce090cfd.jpg)  
# Working Capital  

•   Working capital is the amount of cash and equivalents needed  to keep the business going (checkbook or debitcard balance)  

o   Profits recorded when a product is contractually sold  

§   Companies often provide customers short-term  financing – accounts receivable  §   Cash paid 15 to 90 or more days later  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/3801b9f2f80aa2e952538546307f5f22abd71ed852b2bf09596bc560a4cccb28.jpg)

•   Simplified accounting view over time  
# Working Capital  

•   Errors regarding working capital  o   Omission of working capital effects  

§   Particularly smaller companies with limited access to  short-term loans  

o   Working capital needs change  

§   Increasing/decreasing sales  §   Changes in input prices (recently lumber, copper)  

o   Omission of recovery of working capital  §   Positive cash flow at project’s end  
# Discount Incremental Cash Flows  

•   Don’t fall into “sunk cost” fallacy – “We’ve invested too much  to stop now.”   

 •   Examples of sunk costs:    o   Employees hired and paid to develop prototype products    o   Marketing studies    o   Research and development cost  

•   Allocated overhead, e.g. management, rent, shared software  
Opportunity Costs and Additional Revenue and Expense  •   Add-on products and services  

o   Service and maintenance contracts    o   Additional products, e.g., computers:  bluetooth keyboard,  cables  

•   Cannibal iz ation of existing products and services  

o   Existing offering may experience faster price reductions  and/or decline in sales    o   May require increased marketing expense  
Opportunity Costs and Additional Revenue and Expense  

o   Example:  unused but rentable office space to be used in  project should be charged at market rental rate  

•   Salvage value  

o   Value of assets used in project and sold or used elsewhere  in firm    o   May be negative due to environmental or other costs  
# Inflation  

•   Many companies simply ignore  

o   Assumes inflation low and affects all inputs and outputs  similarly    o   Most problematic when a specific input increases in cost  or output decreases in price relative to others  

•   Recall nominal versus real distinction  o   Discount real cash flows with real rates  o   Discount nominal cash flows with nominal rates  
Separate Investment and Financing Decisions, and  Deduct Taxes  

•   Present theoretical basis for Separation Principle later  

o   Investment’s discount rate based on its risk    o   Financing structure is an independent decision  

•   Taxes are a business expense  

o   Companies often have many means to reduce taxes    o   Typically use marginal tax rate firm pays  
# Corporate Income Taxes  

•   Corporate tax rates vary by country  o   Focus on US tax structure  

o   Much lobbying work goes into:  §   Corporate deductions  §   Territorial versus global taxation  

•   Individual taxes vary widely  

o   Income and sales taxes    o   Value-added tax  
# Key Corporate Tax Policy Areas  

•   The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) passed in December 2017   

 •   Decreased corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%  

•   Depreciation – reduction in the value of an asset for financial  and tax accounting purposes (unrelated to market value)  intended to equate renting with owning  

o   Prior 2018 bonus depreciation – 50% immediate  

§   Remainder on MACRS schedule (accelerated  depreciation)  §   TCJA provides 100% bonus depreciation  •   To expire in 2025  
# Key Corporate Tax Policy Areas  

•   Amortization of Research and Development (R&D) Expenses  

o   Must be amortized over 5 years beginning 2022  §   Contrary to approach on plant and equipment  

•   Tax Loss Carry-Forwards  

o   Prior to TCJA, 2 years losses may be used to offset up to  80% of current years taxable income    o   Tax Loss carry-backs eliminated  
# Key Corporate Tax Policy Areas  

•   Limits on Interest Deductions  

o   Debt creates a tax shield – will discuss later in quarter  

§   Motivates companies to take on more debt  

o   TCJA limits interest deductions to 30% of EBITDA  

§   Applies 2018-2022  §   Unused deductions may be carried forward  

o   Beginning 2022 interest deductions limited to 30% of EBIT  

•   Will force companies (relatively few) with interest deductions  exceeding 30% to rethink capital structure  
# Key Corporate Tax Policy Areas  

•   CARES Act changes 1  

o   Net Operating Losses  

§   Reestablished carry back period  §   80% taxable income limitation suspended pre-2021  •   Allows refunds for prior tax years  

o   Business Expense Deductions  

§   Adjusted Taxable Income limitation on interest  expense 30% raised to 50%  §   May use 2019 ATI instead of 2020  

o   Alternative Minimum Tax credit accelerated  
# Key Corporate Tax Policy Areas  

•   Territorial Versus Worldwide Taxation  o   Majority of countries implement territorial taxation  §   Tax income earned only in their country  o   Until 2018 US taxed worldwide income of US corporations  

§   TCJA changed to territorial system  §   Non-US income untaxed until “repatriated” – brought  back to a company account in the US  §   Led to tax regime arbitrage  

o   Territorial approach also created M&A opportunities  

§   So called “inversions”  
# International Mulch And Compost Company  

•   Investment cash flow has three components:  

o   Capital Investment    o   Operating  o   Changes in working capital  

•   Capital Investment  

o   Initial negative cash flow:  plant and equipment, R&D    o   Positive cash flow at end:  salvage value or reuse  International Mulch And Compost Company  
•   Operating Cash Flow  

o   Revenues – Expenses – Taxes  

o   Expense and tax reduction projects contribute to cash  flow  

•   Investment in Working Capital  

o   Inventories + Accounts Receivable – Accounts Payable  (A/R – A/P is known as “trade credit”)    o   Negative cash flow (when sales are stable or increasing)  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e0471bc78fd90e17abc8f8bf1ac00e0e4b382fa6e6c9e681177291a3dfa8b4f0.jpg)  
# IM&C Guano Project  

•   Cash Flow Forecasting  

o   Capital Investment  

§   Purchase \$12 mm P&E; salvage value \$1.949 mm  §   Difference between salvage value and depreciation is a  (taxable) capital gain at 21%  

o   Operating Cash Flow  

§   Start with Pre-tax Profits – subtract Taxes (21% of Pretax Profit) to obtain After-tax Profits  §   Operating Cash Flow equals After-tax Profits +  Depreciation  
# IM&C Guano Project  

•   Cash Flow Forecasting  

o   Working Capital  

§   Increases and then decreases over project life.  Why?  •   Increase in Inventory  •   Increase in A/R  •   Increase in A/P partially offsets first two  §   Increase in working capital  $=$   increase in A/R + increase  in inventory – increase in A/P  

•   Total Project Cash Flow equals Operating Cash Flow plus  Investment in Working Capital + Cash Flow from Capital  Investments  
# Valuing the Project  

•   Net present value of the cash flows is the project’s value    o   Discount rate is 20% per annum    o   Sum of discounted cash flows is \$3.806 mm    o   Assuming our modelling is correct IM&C should proceed  §   Used straight-line depreciation which does not  conform with tax law  

•   Now add tax rules  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/593ff15684082a97b1171532c8710c40a6d3a646cc36dfc272b6b87e4e37a99f.jpg)

Expensing of Capital Investment and Accelerated  Depreciation  

•   To properly calculate project’s NPV must use depreciation  according to tax code  

o   Expensing of capital costs increases NPV to \$4.929 mm  

§   Increases Year 0 cash flow by \$15,160 – \$12640 =  \$2,520   §   Offset by decrease in ongoing discounted cashflows  due to loss of tax savings from depreciation of \$1,397  §   Net increase in NPV is \$1,123  

o   Double declining balance method provides \$212 less in  savings  
# Choosing Among Projects  

•   Projects usually mutually exclusive  

o   General rule:  choose one with highest NPV  

o   Assumes no impact on future decisions  

o   Four typical issues  

§   Timing issues  §   Choosing between short-lived versus long-lived  §   Replacement of capital  §   Excess capacity costs  
# Timing Issues  

# •   Delayed Investment  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/4fac305123c913baf0b1aaa80e254be78c4f4754cbe74838d12a20784773f2eb.jpg)  

# •   Should harvest in year 4 to maximize NPV  

o   Growth rate of cash flow falls below discount rate  
# Short-lived Versus Long-lived Investments  

•   Choice between a long-live versus short-lived machine  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/31ef4cccde6fec19387e333ca0cbb0ecc0378e0511476729431efcbddaecafdf.jpg)  

•   Larger NPV is bad since this is an expense – so would choose B  o   But this is incorrect since utilization periods are different  

o   Need to convert into annualize cost (rent equivalent) and  choose A  
# Replacement of Capital  

•   Previous example looked at life of machinery as fixed  

o   Real machinery is maintained until uneconomic  §   Known as maintenance capital  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/422f325c5ef833b070f404e4abe404ac7d8fc982b737a2c4e3d80b3e90f1f8fa.jpg)  

Continue with old machine unless cost of new machine  declines or its benefits increase, or cost of maintenance of old  machine increases  
# Excess Capacity Costs  

# •   Centralized Resources – data centers, staff  

o   Need to maintain some level of excess capacity  §   Surge demand  

o   Charged out (or not if deemed legacy cost)  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/480fceb645a8286d04e0100f4fbb50514c74567721ba9f13d50da7cb9497fa12.jpg)

Introduction to Risk and Return  Dave Schabes  

January 26, 2023  
# Thinking about Risk and Value  

•   Among other things, value is determined by:  o   Time until expected returns are realized  

o   Range of price changes over investment horizon  §   Volatility  §   Liquidity    o   Me a sur ability of potential price changes    o   Availability of mitigants  
# Financial Decision Making  

•   All of these factors are inherently tied together  o   Apple Computer stock price – January 20,2023  

§   Average 81 million shares per day   §   \$137.00 per share  

o   Price of a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa Factory Prototype  

§   Last trade at \$39.8 million in 2014  §   Prior trade \$16.39 million in 2011  §   No sales since

# Return Calculations  

•   Nominal versus Real  

o   Nominal – without accounting for inflation  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\quad}&{{}\circ\mathsf{R e a l}\ =\frac{1+r}{1+i}-1}\end{array}
$$  

•   Risk premium – historical difference between nominal stock  market return and risk free rate  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b0ed5496c5564d9dad105c84d2cbd5009db7aeca30eb41db6af2291fb92d77c0.jpg)  
# Return Calculations  

•   Arithmetic returns  

o   Simple average of annual returns – not weighted by value    o   What to expect for an “average” year based on history  

•   Average Compound Annual Return  o   Identical to geometric mean 

 •   Relationship between Arithmetic and Geometric  o   Depends on distribution of returns  
Geometric versus Arithmetic Returns  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/23fe14985824a56877242d6118a57b2e4df338480bd611c5229274e05ef1519a.jpg)  

•   Second row is text example  

Only when all outcomes are identical will geometric mean  equal Arithmetic  

•   Always use arithmetic mean for cost of capital calculation  
Returns Over Time

•   Need to look at the effect weighted by dollars at risk 

 •   Simply averaging returns gives incorrect result  o   Overstates or understates real returns on investment  
# Risk Premiums  

•   Expected market return equals risk free rate return plus  average (really expected) risk premium.  Equity market for  example:  

# %  = # &  + &'()\*+ #)-. /#&0)(0  

 •   Historical risk premiums and expected risk premiums  o   Historical US premium 7.7% annually based on 1900-2017 

 •   Expected risk premium may be lower – two possible reasons

# Variance and Standard Deviation  

•   Returns for many asset classes are assumed to be  approximately normally distributed  

o   Not accurate for many    o   Traders and investors “kludge” as needed  o   Reason:  calculations of risk and return mathematically  simply with this assumption  

•   Implies asset prices themselves are log normally distributed

# Modern Portfolio Theory (1952)  

•   Harry Markowitz postulated as follows, if financial assets have  the following price distribution:  

o   Returns of financial asset i, r i , are normally distributed    o   Each r i  has a standard deviation, σ i,  which is constant and   o   A covariance, σ ij , between all other financial assets, j, also  assumed constant  

•   If above assumptions were above correct and transaction  costs were zero:  
# Modern Portfolio Theory (1952)  

•   A portfolio of such assets has the following properties:  

o   Expected return, r p,  equals the sum of the proportion of  each asset’s return     o   Portfolio variance,   ${\upsigma}_{\uprho}{}^{2}.$  , a determined by the variance of  each asset’s return and that return’s with all other assets  

•   If all financial assets had these properties:  

o   One could construct a minimum variance portfolio     o   At any desired risk level  
# Diversification and Risk Reduction  

•   Markowitz’s insights led to research demonstrating that  despite some of the assumptions being violated:  

o   Diversification substantially reduced risk without reducing  return  

o   As few as 30 securities track the overall market closely

General Formula for Portfolio Diversification  •   General formula for computing variance of a portfolio is:  

$$
\mathit{V a r i a n c e}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{i}\,x_{j}\sigma_{i j},
$$

•   Typically not calculated precisely for all available stocks  

•   Investors buy index funds  

o   “Smart” beta funds  
# Contribution of Risk  

•   The market risk of the securities in a portfolio determines the  degree of portfolio diversification  

•   Standard measure of market risk,  $\beta$  , equal 1 for “market”  

o   Investments with:  

§      $0<\beta<1$   move same direction but less than market  §      $1<\beta$   move same direction but more than market   §    $\beta<0$   move in the opposite direction of the market  

o   Example:  JP Morgan,  $\beta=1.14$  

§   On average, expect JPM increase 11.4% if stock market  increases 10%  
# Specific Risk and Market Risk  

•   Investors are not compensated for divers if i able risks  

•   Market risk is non-divers if i able so is compensated

Portfolio Theory and the Capital Asset Pricing Model  (CAPM)  Dave Schabes  

January 31, 2023  
# Markowitz and the CAPM  

•   Markowitz provided a model for risk and return, if:  

o   Assets’ returns were normally distributed    o   Variance of asset returns were constant over time  o   There were no transaction or other trading costs  

•   Not literally true, but close for many assets  

o   Distributions generally lept okur tic & skewed    o   Costs exist, but approach zero for large investors

# Efficient Portfolios  

•   The two-stock portfolio above can be extended to any  number of stocks (and other financial and real assets):  

o   As long as the returns of new assets added to the  portfolio are not perfectly correlated with existing  ones, there will be a reduction in overall risk    o   The lower the correlation  among portfolio assets the  greater the risk reduction  
# Efficient Portfolios  

•   Markowitz demonstrated that one can determine a minimum  variance portfolio for each return level   

 •   Conversely, one can create a maximum return portfolio for  each level of risk (measured by standard deviation)  

o   These are Efficient Portfolios    o   Relies on assumptions stated above

# The Capital Asset Pricing Model  

•   Sharpe, Lintner and Treynor introduced the CAPM

•   Investor A borrows from Investor B  

o   Additional  $3\%$   return requires borrowing \$500,000 at 2%  and investing it at 8% -- net additional  
# Creating Leverage:  Example

•   Very difficult to separate skill from luck  
# Implications of the CAPM  

•   Strictly applied, the CAPM states that the risk premium varies  proportionately with   $\beta$  :  

$$
r-r_{f}=\beta(r_{m}-r_{f})
$$  

•   That is, there is a linear relationship between incremental  un divers if i able risk and return  

o   A number studies of stock prices have shown this to be  approximately correct but with many anomalies  o   A company’s appropriate discount rate is its weighted  average cost of capital – not solely equity cost

Stock Prices and the Securities Market Line  

•   Stocks A and B are said to be overpriced or overvalued  

•   A stock above the Market Line is under priced or undervalued  
# Expected Returns  

•   CAPM assumes that investors choose their portfolio’s risk level    o   No value to company’s diversifying to reduce risk    o   Market will not compensate investors for divers if i able risk    o   Conglomerate craze of the 1960’s  

•   Many of CAPM’s assumptions are violated to some degree  

•   Many studies demonstrate that CAPM does not fully describe  stock return behavior

# Risk Premiums

o   Il liquidity and idiosyncratic risks  

•   High versus low book-to-market  

o   Value versus growth  

•   Anomalies tend to disappear once discovered  
# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)  

•   CAPM assumes investors concerned solely with level and  uncertainty of wealth  

o   Other factors may weigh in  

•   Factor-based models  

o   APT assumes there are underlying macroeconomic factors  that determine a stock’s return    o   Plus a random “noise” component  

$\iota=a+b_{1}(r_{f a c t o r\;1})+b_{2}(r_{f a c t o r\;2})+\cdots$  
# Arbitrage Pricing Theory  

•   Equity market return may be only one of several factors  

•   APT assumes:  

o   Investors consider many economic factors, potentially:  

§   Commodity prices  §   Interest rates  §   Currency exchange rates  §   Among others  

o   Any stock has two sources of risk:  

§   Economic factors  §   Specific (idiosyncratic) factors  
# Arbitrage Pricing Theory  

•   Risk due to economic factors is non-divers if i able (market risk)    •   Risk due to specific factors is potentially fully divers if i able    •   Leads to the following:    BC+-D1-E ").F +"-\*)0\* =  " −" !  =   @ (" ) + @ (" ) + ⋯+ @ (" )  

6 !07/5\$ 6  −" ! 8 !07/5\$ 8  −" ! 1 !07/5\$ 1  −" !  
# Arbitrage Pricing Theory  

o   Diversified portfolio with zero sensitivity to all factors must  earn the risk free rate  

§   If offered a higher return, investors would buy the  portfolio and borrow at   $r_{f}$  , earning an arbitrage profit  §   If offered a lower return investors would sell the  portfolio and lend at  $r_{f}$  , earning an arbitrage profit  

o   Diversified portfolio with sensitivity to one factor will earn  a risk premium varying in direct proportion to its  sensitivity to that factor, e.g., market risk  
# Comparing CAPM to APT  

•   Same result if:  

o   Expected risk premium on each portfolio is proportional to  market   $\beta$  

•   APT does not require a market portfolio to price assets  o   Does not face same measurement problems as CAPM  o   However, must determine appropriate underlying factors  
# Fama-French Three-factor Model  

•   Three-factors:

§   Market:  7.0%  §   Size: 3.2%  §   Book-Market 4.9%  

o   Market positive for all industries

Risk and the Cost of Capital  Dave Schabes  

February 7, 2023  
# Company and Projects’ Costs of Capital  

•   Company Cost of Capital (or Weighted Average Cost of Capital  – WACC) is the expected return on all the company’s  outstanding debt and equity  

•   Project Cost of Capital is a function of the relative riskiness of  the project  

•   Market value of firm must be the sum of all its projects  

o   If a firm has two assets (projects), A and B, its value must  equal  

$$
m\;V a l u e=P V(A B)=\;P V(A)+P V(B)
$$  
# Company and Projects Costs of Capital  

•   Each asset is valued using its appropriate discount rate  

o   “Sum-of-parts” analysis for large multi-line of business  companies    o   Discount each project (or asset) at rate at which the  market would project it could be purchased independently  

•   There is no exact science to this  

o   Do not focus on getting numbers exactly right    •   Understand key risks and ability to mitigate  
# Double Entry Accounting 1  

One entry records what is taken in (revenue) or owned  (assets), known as a  debit  

•   A second, offsetting entry records what is given out (e.g.  wheat) or owed (e.g. debt), known as a  credit  

•   Nobel laureate in economics, Thomas Shelling, called double  entry bookkeeping “the greatest advance in business  management” 2

o   Analysts rely on historical return relationships  

§   Values for   $\beta$   change over time  §    $R^{2}$   demonstrates there are many other factors  •   Much of the risk is divers if i able

The lower the   $R^{2}$   of   $\beta$   the greater the variance of  divers if i able returns – adding X to a portfolio in the 2013- 2017 period would have had relatively more market risk  variance than in the 2008-2012 period

# CSX Debt to Market Value Ratio  

•   To calculate debt to market value ratio need a definition of  debt  

o   Authors used Long-term debt plus Current Liabilities  

o   Calculation:  

§   Long-term debt plus Current Liabilities:   11,790mm + 1894mm  $=$   13,684mm  §   Total Liabilities:  21,018mm  §   Shares outstanding:  911 mm  §   Share price December 31, 2017:  \$55.01  

o   13,684mm/((55.01\*911mm) + 21,018mm) = .192  
# CSX WACC Calculation and Asset Beta  

•   Projects are considered in terms of their own risk,  independent of how they are financed  

o   Example of the “separation principle”  

o   Known as the asset beta – since represents the riskiness  of the corporate assets versus the market  o   Debt beta may be difficult to calculate, assumed .15  

•   Calculate asset beta,  $\beta_{A}$  , as follows:  G '  = (</&) = .15 × .192 + 1.25 × .808 = 1.04  
# Analyzing Project Risk

•   Now relate revenue beta to fixed and variable cost betas and  asset beta  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\beta_{r e v e n u e}=\beta_{f i x e d\;c o s t}\left(\frac{P V(f i x e d\;c o s t)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right)+}\\ &{_{c o s t}\left(\frac{P V(v a r i a b l e\;c o s t)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right)+\beta_{a s s e t s}\left(\frac{P V(a s s e t)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right.}\end{array}
$$  
# Asset Betas  

•   Note that:  

o   Fixed cost beta close to zero  

o   Revenue and variable cost betas should be about the same  §   Both function of output  

•   Set   $\beta_{f i x e d\;c o s t}=0$    and substitute  G 1\*2\*34\*  for  G 251(567\* -./0  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{r e v e n u e}=0\times\left(\frac{P V(f i x e d~c o s t)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right)+}\\ {\it{e v e n u e}\left(\frac{P V(v a r i a b l e~c o s t)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right)+\beta_{a s s e t s}\left(\frac{P V(a s s e t s)}{P V(r e v e n u e)}\right)}\end{array}

# Asset Betas  

•   Other issues  

o   Incorrect discount rate  §   Project duration  

o   Execution  §   Experience  §   Competence  

•   Divers if i able risks do not change the cost of capital  
# Allowing for Poor Outcomes  

•   No one remembers relatively small changes in NPV  

•   Everyone remembers:  

o   Major cost overruns (1.5X or more)  

o   Failure to complete the project on time (or at all)  

•   Text Example:  

o   Project Z forecast to create \$1 mm of cash flow in one  year and discount rate is 10%  
# Allowing for Poor Outcomes  

•   Project Z PV equals:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V_{z}=\frac{\S1,000,000}{1+0.1}=\S909{,}101}\end{array}$  

•   Risk technology will not work, making the project worthless

•   With technological uncertainty you do not alter discount rate  but add additional possibility,  

PV equals:    $\begin{array}{r}{P V_{z}=\frac{\S900,000}{1+0.1}=\S818{,}000}\end{array}$

# Planning Process  

•   Capital and Operating Budgets   o   Set in context  

§   Strategic Plan  §   Annual Operating Plan  

•   Corporate and Line of Business  

o   Goals and Objectives  o   Strategy and Tactics  
# Planning Process  

•   Annual plans set goals for each division  

 •   Typically done “bottom up” with “top down” guidance   o   Company management sets rules  

 •   Projects are proposed within this process  o   Must “fit” within company’s budget  
# Planning Process  

•   Examples:  

o   Total expense may not increase more than five percent    o   Grow revenues in battery division by 12%  

•   Iterative process  

•   Generally reviewed quarterly  
# Sensitivity and Scenario Analysis  

•   All businesses and projects are analyzed under multiple  scenarios  

•   Text Example: Otobai Company electric scooter  

o   Given assumptions:  

§   20% cost of capital  §   Initial investment:  ¥15 billion; salvage value ¥0  §   Sales increase through year 6 then decline – increase  in working capital followed by decrease  §   COGS:  50% of sales  §   Taxes:  40% taxable income (straight-line depreciation)  
# Assumptions  

•   Numerous implicit assumptions  

o   No legal or regulatory issues (intellectual property)    o   Minimal liability issues  o   Additional investment requirements (charging stations)  o   Competitive threats  §   Margin compression – mitigate through supplier prices  §   Rate of unit or price declines  o   Market acceptance  
# Sensitivity Analysis  

•   Only certainty:  initial forecast will be wrong    o   Knightian Uncertainty    o   Analyze other potential outcomes; create action plans   

 •   Sensitivity to changes in key variables

# Changing Multiple Variables (Scenarios)  

•   Need to determine reasonable number of scenarios  

o   Base on experience in own country and others    o   Consider “worst” case  

•   Check your work  

o   Compare my spreadsheet to text    o   Why are they different?  Who’s likely correct?  
# Computing Breakeven Values  

•   On an NPV basis  

o   Use Goal Seek function in Excel  

§   Data/What if Analysis/Goal Seek  §   Finds input level for a given goal (e.g., zero NPV)  §   Need to reset values after each use  

•   On an annual Accounting basis  

o   Need to alter the variable of interest each year to achieve  zero pretax profit    o   Goal Seek works, but one year at a time

# Capital Budgets  

•   Recall, capital budgets are set in the context of a company’s    o   Strategy and goals    o   Strengths and weaknesses  

•   Often difficult to think “one-level up” in organization  

•   Forecast biases  

o   Managers tend to be optimistic:   §   Overestimate returns, underestimate risk  
# Capital Budgets  

•   Much of capital budget dedicated to maintenance   o   Limited resources for discretionary projects 

 •   Top management may carry biases too  

o   Supporting businesses they understand; viewing other  businesses as riskier  

•   Question cash flow components:  revenues, expenses, capital  investments  

•   Audit projects and businesses regularly, e.g., quarterly  
# Market Values and Planning  

•   Use market values where available  

•   Department Store example  

o   Businesses frequently do not know where they make  and lose money  

o   Relative value of an asset may differ  

§   Location  §   Reproduction difficulty  
# Department Store Assumptions  

•   \$100 mm investment; 10% discount rate  

•   \$8 mm cash flow annually for 10 years  

•   Real estate prices expected to increase 3% per annum  
# Business Analysis  

•    PV contribution of Business and Real Estate separately  

•   Approximately ½ the value is coming from the business and ½  from the building  

•   Housing the business in this building only makes sense if  cannot collect at least \$8 mm (net) in rent annually  
# Business Analysis  

•   Most department stores rent real estate  

o   Look for lowest annual cost  §   Considering location which drives desired sales  

o   Some have real estate subsidiary which manages owned  properties  

•   Assume you could rent out the building in perpetuity and  rents grow at the same rate as real estate values, then:   $P V={\frac{\S7\ m m}{.\,10-.3}}=\S100\ m m$

o   Production one million troy ounces of gold per annum  

o   Cost of production:  \$1150.00 per troy ounce

# Gold Mine—Financial Analysis  

•   Today’s price should be slightly below future expected prices  due to:  

o   Opportunity cost (interest rates)  

o   Storage costs  

•   Solomon’s initial analysis is incorrect – futures or forward  market are better indicators  

$$
N P V=-500+\sum_{t=1}^{10}\cdot\frac{1(P_{t}-C_{t})}{(1+.1)^{t}}=-\S35
$$  
# Gold Mine—Financial Analysis  

•   The market says that the price of gold does not need to be  discounted    

 •   It is likely that Solomon could use futures or forward contracts  to hedge the production of the first few years of gold  

o   Text effectively assumes this price is today’s price

$$  

•   This implies that the current price of the asset (e.g. gold) is the  discounted future price to any future date  

•   There are real costs:  warehouse space, insurance, assaying  costs – but these are small – covered by convenience yield  
# Economic Rents and Comparative Advantage  

•   Economists assume perfectly competitive markets  

•   Competitive Advantage, e.g., differentiated products and  other factors allow creation of economic rents

 •   Why should margins be sustainable?  
# Polyzone  

•   A US company is considering modifying an existing plant to  produce Polyzone

Gargle Blasters Demand Curve  

•   Each \$1 of price reduction is expected to increase demand by  80 million units  
# Industry Cost Size and Cost Structure  

•   Market price at \$7 implies two different profit structures  

o   Old technology : marginal gross profitability \$1.50    o   New technology: marginal gross profitability \$3.50  

•   Marvin possesses new technology which will lower costs  further  

o   If Marvin introduces the new technology:  

§   What is the impact on Marvin?  §   On the industry?  
# Marvin Assumptions  

•   Investment: \$1 billion  

o   Add annual capacity of 100 mm units within 12 months  

§   Manufacturing cost \$3.00 per unit  §   Production facilities indefinite life  •   Implies economically-driven decision  

o   Cost of competing technologies unchanging  §   No new technology foreseeable  

•   Cost of capital:  20%; no corporate income taxes  

•   Demand Curve not expected to change

 •   Demand curve implies price of:  340 66 = 80 × (10 −"J>LA), "J>LA = \$5.75  

Assuming this situation continues in perpetuity, what should  competitors with old technology do?  
# Gargle Blaster Prices and Market Impact  

•   Salvage values contain the assumption that the Gargle Blaster  technology is useful for manufacturing other products

•   At \$5.00 per unit, all 2029 technology will be forced out of the  market – 2037 technology will still be NPV positive  

•   Value to Marvin  

o   Unit prices expected to drop to \$6 then, five years later to  \$5 per unit; unit costs remain \$3 throughout  

o   Annual net cash flow for 100 mm units:  

$\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle a r v i n=-1000+\sum_{t=1}^{5}\frac{300}{(1.20)^{t}}+\frac{1}{(1.20)^{5}}\Big(}\\ {\displaystyle\quad-1000+897+402=\S299\:m m.}\end{array}$  200 . 2  / = XO6FB? 70% FS ?ℎA VCODA LF6AB >G S>JB? 5 QACJB.   Market Implications and Value of Marvin’s Expansion  
•   Consider all incremental cash flow changes due to decision  

o   Marvin’s decision to introduce third generation technology  in 2043 immediately reduces the market price of Gargle  Blasters to \$6  

§   If Marvin held off five years, the current equipment  would retain its value  

o   Marvin produces 24 mm units annually with second  generation technology. The value lost equals:  
# Alternative Expansion Plans  

•   Marvin may choose a plant with greater or lesser capacity  

•   How do we determine Marvin’s optimal choice?    o   Estimate impact of additional capacity on prices    o   Calculate NPV of new plant  o   Calculate NPV existing plant (will be zero or negative)    o   Sum these  NPVs  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/97a5ae344bd62a2b3aa7257167823f5514ceff5a05289cfcc3f14c094bb1b0bc.jpg)  
# Alternative Expansion Plans  

•   Why does NPV drop at new production above 200 mm?  o   Market size increases; price decreases  

§   Not enough of a reduction to take out second  generation capacity  

o   Loss from price reduction greater than gain from  incremental volume  

§   Loss on existing plant increases as well  

§   Marvin drives out all first generation competitors and  maintains a price at just under \$6.00

February 16, 2023  
# Different Investor Constituencies  

•   Management and Directors have primary duty to shareholders   

 •   Creditors (banks and bond holders) also have contractual rights  

o   Creates tension between different investor classes  

§   Risk/return tradeoff differs for debt holders versus  shareholders  §   May differ between different classes of debt holders  

o   Management and Board emphasis regarding different  investor classes says a great deal about company  

§   Emphasizing ensuring debt holders are secure versus  maximizing stock price today  
# Sources of Funds  

•   Three broad categories:  o   Internally generated  

§   Dividend policy  §   Growth opportunities  

o   Debt (borrow money)  o   Shareholders – secondary issuance 

 •   Pecking Order Hypothesis (Stewart Myers)  
# Sources of Funds  

•   Key decisions:    o   Ratio of funds used in business versus returned to  shareholders    o   Ratio of Debt to Equity   

 •   In recent years, Equity issuance is negative   

 •   Debt issuance growing since Financial Crisis   

 •   Less investment in business

Sources of Funds:  US Non financial Corporations  

Net equity issuance has been negative for more than two  decades due principally to corporate stock repurchase s  Sources of Funds:  US Non financial Corporations  
•   Share repurchase s have exceeded new issuance of stock in the  market  

o   Many large companies have repurchased their shares  

§   Using profits  §   Borrowing money through bond issuance  

o   Why have they done this?  

•   Text raises concern regarding over reliance on internal funds  

•   Concerns about growth prospects  

o   Lack of positive NPV projects?  
# Internal versus External Financing  

•   Some argue large corporations do not return enough to  shareholders  

o   Changed in recent years:  

§   Share repurchase s  §   Increased debt issuance (low interest rates)  

•   Financial structure varies by industry  

o   Large international bank    o   Technology startup

•   Corporate debt as a percentage of total financing has  increased since the Financial Crisis  
# Corporate Debt Levels  

# •   Debt levels have increased in the US and other countries  

o   Example:  China  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/6218665c49de65f6434e538e9e562ae98292f15176e0003799e71a2f3e5ba9b6.jpg)

#   Debt markets differ substantially among these countries  

Nature of businesses differ as well  
# Corporate Ownership  

•   Ownership versus Control  

o   Ownership in a small or medium sized company comes  with a measure of control over the company’s plans    o   Ownership in a large corporation usually implies little or  no control – delegated to Board of Directors  

•   In large corporations, shareholders technically have right of  control, but severely limited in practice  
# Ownership of US Corporations  

•   Individual Shareholders   

 •   Institutional Shareholders    o   Mutual Funds    o Pension Funds o   Insurance Companies   

 •   Non-US investors

# Ownership Rights and Issues  

•   Shareholder rights without debt  

o   Cash-flow Rights    o   Control Rights  

•   Shareholder rights with debt  

o   Cash-flow rights contingent on meeting creditors’  contractual rights    o   Shareholders have a residual claim on company’s assets  
# Ownership Rights and Issues  

•   Financial Distress and Bankruptcy  

o   Owners may be forced to forego dividend payments  or put more money into company    o   Bankruptcy places company under “protection” of  court of law – creditors “estopped”  

•   Small and medium sized companies have only one or a  few shareholders; large companies may have millions  

•   Large company shareholders effectively limited to voting  for Board members and limited other matters  
# Ownership Rights and Issues  

# •   Free-rider problem  

o   Lack of shareholder-interest enables management to  be more self-serving  

§   Real world less clear-cut  §   Large shareholders; activist investors  •   Own 5% or more of company  •   See this currently regarding ESG issues  §   Large shareholders allow small ones to be freeriders  

o   Ability for large shareholders to profit at the expense  of small in some cases  
# Voting Rights  

•   In theory, any shareholder may bring a matter concerning the  company to a shareholder vote  

o   Required to obtain enough additional shareholders to  place the matter on the ballot    o   May be difficult or impossible with dual-class structure  o   Some companies have been making it increasingly difficult  to place measures on ballot  

•   ESG and compensation issues often raised  
# ExxonMobil and Engine No 1 1  

•   Exxon is among the largest oil producers 

 •   Engine No 1 is a small, activist hedge fund  o   Bought \$50 mm of Exxon stock (.03% of shares)  

o   Intention to change four board members and revise  strategy to move more quickly away from hydrocarbons  

o   Convinced major shareholders to vote for its position  
# ExxonMobil and Engine No 1  

•   Key issue:  “… no credible program to protect value in an  energy transition”  

•   Exxon vigorously fought Engine No 1’s claims  

•   ISS, a major proxy advisor, advised its clients, who include  many large investment funds to support Engine 1’s nominees  

•   Several major Exxon shareholders announced they support  Engine No 1’s proposals  

•   Three of the four Engine No 1 nominees were elected  
# Other Shareholder Issues  

•   Staggered Boards  

o   Only a portion of the Board is up for approval each year    o   Makes changing Board’s members more difficult  

•   Super majority requirements  

o   More than 50% (e.g. 75%) of shareholders required to  approve a measure  

•   Proxy Contests – Engine No 1/Exxon example above  
# Dual-class Shares and Private Benefits  

•   Dual-class shares – one class provides different benefits than  others, such as greater voting rights and specific control  features  

o   Facebook – Mark Zuckerberg owns approximately 14.8%  economic interest, but 53.8% of voting rights  

§    Recently allowing him to turn down several ESG  initiatives  

o   WeWork – founder’s spouse, in event of founder’s death,  had right to pick successor CEO  

•   Tunneling  Partnerships and Other Organizational Structures  
•   Partnerships  

o   General    o   Limited  

•   Trusts – legal structures designed to hold specific assets    o   Real Estate Investment Trusts    o   Special Purpose Entities  
# Preferred versus Common Stock  

•   Public and private companies may issue preferred stock  

o   Publicly issued preferred stock receives a preference in  receiving dividend payments  

§   Fixed payment to investors – no voting rights  §   If preferred dividends unpaid, no common dividends  paid – typically “cumulative”   §   Limited voting rights may be granted to preferred  shareholders if dividend payments missed  

o   Private companies issue preferred stock to give certain  investors, e.g. venture capital, preference in receipt of  proceeds ahead of founders  
# Debt Instruments  

•   Major issues for CFO  

o   Debt maturity    o   Fixed or floating rate  o   Currency choice  o   Covenants and collateral    o   Straight or convertible bonds    o   Lease versus buy  Debt Maturity and Fixed versus Floating Rates  
•   Long-term debt generally “more expensive” than short-term  

o   However, reduces risk of cash crunch – think Covid    o   Match maturity of liabilities with assets  

•   Fixed versus floating  

o   Do the company’s earnings change with interest rate  levels?    o   Short-term rates generally below long-term  
# Currency, Collateral and Covenants  

•   Try to match expenditures in country with borrowings  

o   Eurozone plant selling into Europe financed in Euros    o   Risk of being unable to obtain the currency borrowed  

•   Collateral – banks and other lenders often granted a lien on  plant, accounts receivable and other assets of the company  

•   Covenants – promises made by the company to its creditors  

o   Seniority of debt, rights and remedies;  stricter covenants  generally imply lower interest rate  
# Convertible Bonds  

•   Bonds have the right, at the holder’s option, to be converted  into a fixed number of common shares at a certain price  

o   Coupon is below the coupon required on a straight bond  by the same company    o   Difference represents the implicit option premium paid for  the option to convert into stock  o   Example:  ABC Corporation can issue a 10 year fixed rate  note at yield of 6% with \$1000 face value  §   Alternatively issue 10 year convertible at 2% yield with  right to purchase 20 shares of ABC stock at \$50/sh.  
# Leasing and Supplier Finance  

•   Leasing – rental of equipment, office space  

o   Advantages depend on implied interest rate, tax treatment    o   Capital (long-term) lease versus operating lease  §   Capital leases – effectively long-term debt obligations  

•   Supplier Finance – provides cash to sellers of goods and  services internationally  

o   May be abused to hide debt    o   Greensill Capital  
# Financial Markets and Intermediaries

# IPO Process  

•   Steps (continued)  

o   Sell shares  

§   Underwriter commitment: 900,000 shares  §   Greenshoe:  135,000  

o   Underwriters sell 1,035,000 shares  

§   Exercise greenshoe option  §   If market appeared weak underwriters:  •   Would not have exercised  •   Would buy shares to stabilize market  §   Stock trades to \$105/sh. on first day  §   40 day quiet period post IPO  
# Underwriters  

•   Underwriting risk  

o   Almost all issues underwritten – may be “best efforts”  

o   Issues:  

Reputation al – failed IPOs  •   Due diligence  •   Allocation process – “spinning”  

Financial –  HBOS 2008 rights issue  •   Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort  •   Only 8.3% of the shares sold – failed underwriting  •   Underwriters hold the remainder – ultimately  acquired by Lloyds TSB early 2009  
# Underwriting Costs and Pricing  

•   Costs  

o   Spread – difference between underwriting price and  offering price; typically 7% for smaller issuers  

o   Additional fees – registration, legal, printing among others  

•   Pricing  

o   New issues often “under priced”    o   IPOs averaged 16.8% gain on few day based on one study  
# Updated First-day Returns

#   Bars show number of IPOs; Chart in text shows proceeds  

Long-run (three year holding period) investors lose 18.7% –    passive index funds “must “ invest  
# Alternative Issuing Procedures  

•   US IPOs typically employ book building process  

o   Institutional buyers indicate where they would buy IPO    o   Underwriters may give preference to certain potential  buyers  

•   Recently companies have engaged in primary direct offerings  

o   Only sales from existing shareholders – no new money     o   Lower fees but greater uncertainty of price level  
# Auctions  

•   Primary direct sales are an example   

 •   Sovereign bond sales   

 •   IPOs were replaced by auctions in some countries historically   

 •   Auction types:  

o   Discriminatory – each buyer pays price bid  o   Uniform-price – all buyers pay the lowest winning price 

 •   Economists argue uniform-price should maximize proceeds  
# Security Sales by Public Companies  

•   General Cash Offer – Debt or Equity  

o   Issue registered with SEC; sold to underwriters    o   Similar process as IPO  

o   SEC Rule 415 – shelf registration requirements 3  

•   At least one class of securities SEC registered  •   At least 12 months subject to reporting  requirements  •   No missed dividends or defaults since last  financial statements issued  •   First time issuance has additional requirements  
# General Cash Offer Costs

# Some costs are fixed; others vary with size  
# Market Reaction to Stock Issues  

•   Public companies’ stock issuance announcements generally  cause 2% to 4% price decline  

•   What is the explanation for this?  

o   Should be a function of the expected use of funds  

o   Text explanation  

§   Companies issue stock when the price is relatively high  (overvalued) in minds of management  §   Investors react by selling the stock, reducing its price,  and reducing the value of new issuance to company   §   Most economists support this view  
# Rights Issues  

•   Rights Issue or Privileged Subscription – company offers the  right to buy stock to existing investors first  

o   Typically offered by non-US companies  

o   Often company is troubled and having difficulty raising  additional capital  

§   Price is below current market price  

•   Underwriters commit to buying any stock not sold to existing  investors  
# Deutsche Bank Example  

•   2017 – Deutsche below minimum capital threshold   o   Needs to raise €8 bn; current share price €18.00  o   Offers right to buy 1 sh. for every 2 shs. held at €11.65  o   Implies post offer price will be €15.88:  

§   If owned 2 shs., value  $=$   €36, buy one share @ €11.65  §   Now own 3 shs. =€47.65 invested  $=$   €47.65=3×€15.88  §   €15.88 known as ex-rights price  

•   Investors had a choice of putting in new money and maintain  value or have the value of their existing shares reduced 11.8%  
# Private Placements 4  

•   May only be sold to Accredited Investors or Qualified  Institutional Buyers (QIBs) as defined in Regulation D under  the Securities Act of 1933  

o   Accredited Investor -- net worth of \$1 mm or annual  income of \$200,000 for an individual (\$300,000 for a  couple); trust or certain other entities with assets of \$5  mm; certain designated financial professionals  

o   QIB – Certain institutional investors with unaffiliated  assets of \$100 mm; banks and thrifts \$25 mm; brokerdealers \$10 mm  
# Private Placements  

•   Often specific types of debt or equity targeted at certain types  of buyers  

o   Commercial mortgage bonds places with an insurance  company    o   Preferred equity for a small company  

•   Transactions are far more customized than public bond or  equity offerings  

o   Buyer is typically expected to hold the security to maturity  
# What Could Go Wrong?  FTX 5  

•   On November 11, 2022 FTX Trading LTD., et al. (“FTX”) filed for  bankruptcy in the United States bankruptcy court for the  district of Delaware  

•   FTX was founded in 2019 as a crypto currency exchange 

 •   Numerous related companies were founded as well  o   Most importantly, Alameda Research LLC 

 •   FTX created its own crypto currency, FTT

#  

Does Debt Policy Matter?  Dave Schabes  

February 23, 2023  
# Modigliani and Miller Debt Theorems  

•   Grew out of payout policy debate 

 •   In the 1950s finance community divided into two camps:  o   Companies achieve higher valuations if pay high dividends  

o   Companies achieve higher valuations if pay little or no  dividends and reinvest in company  

•   In 1961 Miller and Modigliani show that dividend policy does  not matter  

•   All that matters is the market value of the company’s assets  
# Modigliani and Miller Debt Theorems  

•   As we have discussed the market value of the company’s  assets must equal the present value of its future cash flows  

•   The Capital Structure of a company is its chosen mix of debt,  equity and other liabilities  

o   Financial Leverage (gearing) refers to the relative amount  of debt to equity a company employs  

o   If a firm’s value is based solely on the value of its assets  then capital structure should not matter – why are  investment bankers paid so much?  
# Modigliani and Miller Debt Theorems  

•   If MM are correct, then investment decisions may be  separated from capital raising decisions  

o   We never considered how we would finance the projects  in Chapters 5 through 12    o   The Separation Principle implied by MM allowed us to do  so  

•   Now look more closely at the MM propositions  
# Capital Structure  

•   Commercial and investment banking revolve around:  

o   Capital raising   o   Risk management  o   Mergers, acquisitions and divest it ure s  

•   Capital structure choices irrelevant in simple (perfect) markets  

•   Real world – regulations, taxes and other factors – strays  significantly from perfect capital markets assumptions  
# Capital Structure  

•   Understanding which factors create:  

o   Benefits to altering capital structure     o   Potentially unnecessary risks  

•   Critical to successful corporate financial management  

•   Critical choice CFO faces:  

o   Amount of leverage (borrowing) to take on    §   Debt always appears less expensive than equity in the  short-term  
# Wapshot Mining Company  

•   Issues 1000 shares at \$50 each   

 •   Borrows \$25,000   

 •   What is the Enterprise Value of the company after these  transactions?  

o   Enterprise Value is the total market value of the company  

!"#\$% = '(\$)\*+ + -%.\* = 50,000 + 25,000 = \$75,000.   7ℎ)9 :\$9\* .% \*ℎ% :";<%\*′9 "99%9:%>\*    ?@ \*ℎ% A"#\$% ?@ B"C9ℎ?\*′9 "99%\*9  
# Wapshot Mining Company  

•   The equity issued is called levered equity as there is debt  ahead of it in the capital structure  

•    Wapshot borrows an additional \$10,000 and pays a special  (one time) dividend to shareholders  

o   What is Wapshot’s value now?  

!"#\$% \$>Dℎ">E%F "\* \$75,000,    $D=\S25{,}000+\S10{,}000=\S35{,}000$   \$75,000 = ' + \$35,000, 9?   $E=\S40$  ,000  

•   Changes in the firm’s value accrue to the shareholders  
# Wapshot Mining Company  

•   MM I would tell the CFO not to alter the financial structure –  changing it will not increase the firm’s value  

o   Assumptions:  

§   Debt value remains the same even though amount of  debt is larger  §   Interest rate on (New or Old) Debt unchanged  §   No corporate or individual taxes to consider  

o   Consider two identical firms:  

§   U and L differ only in capital structure:  •   U financed entirely with equity   •   L financed with \$1 of debt for each \$1 of equity  
# Firms U and L  

•   Assume you buy 1% of the profits of each firm  o   Which firm is the riskier equity investment?  o   What is your expected return if you buy:  

§   1% of the equity of U?  §   1% of the debt and equity of L?  

•   Recall:  

$$
V_{U}=E_{U}
$$  

$$
V_{L}=E_{L}+D_{L}
$$  
# Firms U and L  
# Firms U and L  

•   Buying 1% of the equity in U or 1% of the debt and equity in L  earn identical returns  

o   By the Law of One Price, each investment must have the  same value:  1% of the company’s profits    o   Each must also have the same expected return  

•   Now assume you are willing to take more risk  

o   Buy 1% of the equity of L  
# Firms U and L

•   Alternatively, buy   $1\%$   of the equity of U and sell short 1% of  the debt of L – same expected return

# Modigliani and Miller I  

•   “The market value of any firm is independent of its capital  structure.”  

o   Key assumptions  

§   No taxes or transaction costs  §   Ability to go long or short any security  §   Single borrowing/lending rate  

•   Earlier saw version of this: value additivity  

o   Splitting firm cash flows does not alter firm’s value    o   Law of Conservation of Value

# Shareholders Borrow and Increase Investment  

Financial manager points out that shareholders have ability to  create this outcome for themselves by buying two shares and  borrowing the funds to purchase one of the shares at 10%

# Financial Risk and Expected Return  

•   Recall, Harry Markowitz’s modern portfolio theory  

o   Applying it to the securities of a single firm, we obtain:  

$\dot{\mathbf{\omega}}_{A}=\left(\frac{D}{D+E}\right)\times\boldsymbol{r}_{D}+\left(\frac{E}{D+E}\right)\times\boldsymbol{r}_{E},i n\,w d$  

•   This is the company’s weighted cost of capital (WACC)  
# Financial Risk and Expected Return  

•   To find the return on levered equity we solve for r E  

$$
r_{E}=r_{A}+(r_{A}-r_{D})\times\left({\frac{D}{E}}\right)
$$  

•   This leads to MM II:

#  

How Much Should a Firm Borrow? Part I  Dave Schabes  

February 28, 2023  
Real World Departures from MM Assumptions  

•   MM understood that the real world departed from their  assumptions  

•   Major departures  

o   Taxes    o   Transaction Costs  o   Financial Distress and Bankruptcy  o   Conflicts between creditors and shareholders  
# Taxes  

•   In the US and most other countries, interest paid by firms is a  deductible expense from taxable income  

•   Individuals and institutions that receive dividends and capital  gains are taxed (albeit at a lower rate than interest received)  and they are paid from after-tax corporate income  

o   So-called “double taxation”  

o   Some institutions, e.g., endowments and pension funds, are  tax exempt  
# Taxes  

•   Limits were placed on the deduct i bil it y of interest at 30% of  income (defined as EBITDA) in 2017  

o   This has been repealed as part of the CARES act legislation     o   With interest rates currently low, few companies would  have hit this constraint  §   Due to the Corona virus, poor earnings may have made  this constraint “bite” more quickly for some companies

# Tax Shield Valuation  

•   Firm U and L are identical except  

o   L has \$1,000 of debt at 8% per annum    o   U is capitalized entirely with equity  

•   Firm L pays \$16.80 less in corporate taxes  

o   Allows that amount to be distributed to shareholders    o   However firm pays \$80 of interest to bond holders  
# Tax Shield Valuation  

•   MM III states that a firm is worth its asset value plus the  present value of the tax shield  

•   Assume L intends to borrow \$1,000 in perpetuity  o   Interest payments in perpetuity are worth:  

!" !"#\$%&'()  = \$16.80/8% = \$210,   ./ 123 .ℎ5678 59:;62.6. <5;= >27?6 @A 2.1%  

•   MM III states that when a corporation maintains a permanent  constant amount of debt outstanding, the interest rate paid is  irrelevant to the value of the tax shield  
# Present Value of Tax Shield  

•   Assuming fixed amount of debt, D  

B916;6.1 !2A=691 = ;  $n e n t=r_{D}\times D,P V_{T a x S h i e l d}=T_{C}\times\frac{r_{D}\times r_{S}}{r_{D}}$   × D ,

•   Additional Assumptions  

o   Corporate tax rate is constant; no other taxes or  transaction costs    o   Adequate taxable income to fully utilize tax shield  
# Firms U and L  

•   Above calculated value of L’s tax shield at \$210  

o   Using this, L is worth \$10,210; U worth \$10,000  §   \$210 increase due solely to tax shield  

o   Since L borrowed \$1,000, needs only 902 shares  outstanding at a price of \$10.21 each  

o   Earnings per share increase to \$.81 from \$.79  

§   Due to reduction of issuance (or decrease share count  through a buyback) to 902 shares from 1,000   §   Shares are now slightly riskier due to debt load  
# Johnson & Johnson Example  

•   J&J adds \$10 billion of debt and buys back \$10 billion of stock  

•   Since nothing else regarding expectations for J&J’s future cash  flow has changed, MM III states:  

$$
\Delta P V_{J\&J}=T_{C}\times D=.21\times\S10\;b n=\S2.1
$$  

o   Add \$10 bn debt and \$2.1 bn to total value  

•   Market value of equity decreases \$7.9 bn, so shareholders  gain \$2.1 bn  

•   Book Value Balance Sheet “Total Value” line is unchanged

# Johnson & Johnson Example  

•   How do we obtain market values?  

o   Utilize Financial Statement values for working capital,  long-term debt and other liabilities  

o   Add estimated PV of tax shield to Assets  

o   Utilize market value of equity to value assets not included  in book value on the balance sheet, e.g., brand name,  customer relationships, and research and development

# Financial Distress Costs  

•   Financial distress and bankruptcy are extremely costly  

•   Distress alone can force companies to deal with harsh terms  from suppliers and constant monitoring by creditors  

o   Banks    o   Bond holders  
# Financial Distress Costs  

•   Additional costs of distress include:  

o   Customer loss – fear that products will no longer be  supported or warranties honored    o   Supplier loss – fear of non-payment  o   Employee loss – best employees often first to leave    o   Inability to collect on receivable s    o   Forced asset sales – by banks or suppliers  
# Financial Distress Costs  

•   Creditors often face additional costs as well:  

o   Increased monitoring costs – asset valuations     o   Increased personnel costs at company – financial  consultants    o   More favorable loan terms – lower interest rate, deferral  of repayment of principal    o   Legal review – options if situation worsens, lender liability  
# Bankruptcy Costs  

•   Bankruptcy rules vary widely among countries  o   One of the key issues for European banks  

§   Bankruptcy proceedings can last as long as seven years  in Italy, where it is called  sofferenze  

o   US or UK – bankruptcy proceedings typically less than 18  months  
# Bankruptcy Costs  

•   In the US there are two principal chapters of the bankruptcy  code that affect corporations  

o   Chapter 11 – Reorganization    o   Chapter 7 – Liquidation  

•   Many “repeat offenders” in reorganization process  o   These are known as Chapter 22, 33, …  

o   Recent examples:  A&P, Payless Shoes, Radio Shack, and  Tuesday Morning  
# Chapter 11 – Reorganization  

•   Most commonly used  

•   Based on belief that company has value as a “going concern”  

•   (Almost) all creditors are “estopped”  

o   Prohibited from taking action against company to obtain  moneys owed ahead of other creditors  

•   Allows for “Debtor-In-Possession” (DIP) financing,  

o   DIP lender obtains a “super-lien”, allowing for improved  liquidity during the bankruptcy process  
# Chapter 11 – Reorganization  

•   Management develops a “reorganization plan” – usually a 120  day exclusive right   

 •   Other creditors or equity holders may submit a plan as well  after 120 day period  

•   Taken to bankruptcy court for  

o   Approval     o   Modification  o   Rejection  
# Chapter 11 – Reorganization  

•   Specialized judge who only hears bankruptcy cases  

•   Court of equity – not of law  

o   Vote on plan by “interested parties” – impaired creditors  §   At risk of losing money – not fully secured    o   Usually restructuring or turnaround specialists hired to  execute    o   If creditors agree, restructuring plan is put in place.  If not,  judge may impose a plan, known as a “cram down”  
# Chapter 7 – Liquidation  

•   Often begin as Chapter 11  

o   Company determined no longer viable as a going concern  o   Liquidation value greater than going concern value  

•   Trustee appointed to oversee liquidation  o   Typically accounting or law firm  
# Chapter 7 – Liquidation  

•   Assets sold  

o   Creditors paid off as proceeds received  

o   Generally in order of their priority in the capital structure  

§   Secured creditors  §   Un (under) secured creditors  §   Other creditors  

o   Such sales may be conducted, under Chapter 11 as well  

§   Section 363 sale – applicable section of IRS Code  §   May be sale of entire company or individual assets   §   “Courthouse Steps” sale – Age Refining example

# Age Refining 1  

•   Public record information available  

•   We placed Age in bankruptcy when owner refused to put in  additional equity  

•   Became  de facto  equity owner – protracted, ultimately  fruitless, negotiations with owner ensued  

o   Resulted in substantial mark down  

o   Then the trouble started  
# Age Refining 2  

•   Fuel truck driver caused massive explosion and fire  

•   Plant unusable for several months  

•   Kept Chase Capital from selling at a distressed price – no  buyers  

•   Ultimately Age Refining Inc. sold to NuStar Energy LP in court  administered 363 sale  

•   Received all interest and principal, including penalty interest  Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value  
•   Costs of financial distress are an important departure from  perfect capital markets  

•   Example above demonstrates  

o   Substantial direct and indirect costs related to proceedings  

o   Negotiations with owners went on for many months:  

§   Attempted to reach a solution outside of bankruptcy   §   Known as a “workout”  
# Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value  

•   Direct Costs include:  

o   Attorneys’ fees  

o   Outside experts  

§   Financial (turnaround)  §   Strategic  §   Accounting  §   Appraisers and Auctioneers  

•   Studies have shown that such costs average 3 to 4% of the  company’s value and as much as 10%  
# Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value  

•   Company’s majority creditors and shareholders may agree to  a prepackaged bankruptcy – a “prepack”  

o   Reorganization plan agreed prior to filing Chapter 11    o   Approved relatively quickly  o   Less expensive  

•   Minimizes costs and forces acceptance by minority creditors  or shareholders  Back to the Theory:  Shareholder and Creditor Rights  
•   Shareholders have the right to put their company into  bankruptcy  

o   Not an all or nothing proposition  

o   Creditors may also place company in bankruptcy  §   Must consider Lender Liability  

•   Loss of business value typically occurs prior to formal notice of  financial distress or bankruptcy filing  

o   Costs of distress or bankruptcy limited to the incremental  costs they impose on the business

# Ace Limited versus Ace Unlimited  

•   From MM propositions we know Ace’s asset value is \$1000    

 •   With Ace Unlimited, creditors know they can obtain potential  recovery from owners  

o   Results in lower interest rate, less restrictive covenants 

 •   With Ace Limited, no recourse to shareholders  

o   Creditors will charge a higher rate and require more  restrictive covenants    o   Greater likelihood of bankruptcy and restructuring  
# Ace Limited versus Ace Unlimited  

# •   Assuming Ace is sold for the value of the bonds  

o   Creditors receive the remaining value after bankruptcy  costs are paid

# Indirect Costs of Bankruptcy  

•   Consent of the Bankruptcy Court is required for all financial  decisions  

o   At risk of each judge’s priorities  o   May end up on the wrong side of a cram-down 

 •   Maintain going concern vs. value preservation for creditors  

o   Eastern Airlines example:  substantial value destroyed  during bankruptcy process  §   Eastern ultimately administratively insolvent:  unable  to repay creditors  
# Debt and Incentives  

•   Creditor and shareholder interests generally aligned when  company is performing as expected  

o   Interests often diverge during financial stress  

o   If firm is not in bankruptcy, owners (management) often  effectively in control of decisions  

•   Shareholders in centi viz ed to “go for broke” or to ensure that  creditors do not benefit from capital contributions if company  in financial distress

o   Assumptions:  

§   Bonds not due for one year   §   No ability for bond holders to call a technical default  §   Circular has \$10 cash  
# Risk Shifting  

•   The project has an NPV = -\$2   o   Stock likely worthless in one year without the project   o   Shareholders use the creditors’ money to invest 

 •   Market value of Circular falls to \$28

•   \$10 of cash replaced by risky \$8 asset; stock value increases  Refusal to Contribute Equity Capital (Debt Overhang)  
•   Circular now has opportunity to invest in +\$5 NPV project  o   Circular should issue \$10 new stock to fund project  o   Firm value increases by \$15

Refusal to Contribute Equity Capital (Debt Overhang)  

•   Stockholders may refuse to contribute capital to an NPV  positive project if value goes to creditors  

o   In real situations a sharing of risk and reward may be  negotiated  

•   This situation is known as Debt Overhang  

o   Company has so much debt that new equity investment  cannot be obtained  
# Additional Shareholder Strategies  

•   Cash in and Run (Tunneling)  

o   Owners always know more than creditors and may take  advantage of that knowledge    o   Allegedly took place in FTX case through misappropriating  customer funds and defrauding bank lenders  

•   Playing for Time  

o   Disguising fraud – company purposely misleads creditors,  customers and investors  §   FTX example coming up  
# Additional Shareholder Strategies  

•   Bait and Switch  

o   May lead to financial distress as well as use in distress  

o   Begin to add debt after long time policy of conservative  capital structure  

§   Often facilitated by banks and bond investors  §   Low rates in recent years have led to increasing  leverage and decreasing credit premiums  •   “Covenant-lite” structures  

o   Increases risk of pre-existing debt  §   Lowers existing bond prices – raises equity value  
# Agency Costs of Borrowing  

•   Lenders try to limit leverage, but  o   Competition makes this difficult  o   Ms. Ketchup:  two potential projects

•   What can the bank do?  
# Ms. Ketchup Example  

•   What can the bank do?  

o   Only fund Project 1 (purpose of loan)    o   Require substantially larger equity contribution from Ms. K  to lend against Project 2  o   Place milestones and other restrictions on the company if  Project 2 is undertaken – before loan proceeds disbursed  o   Increase monitoring requirements

# Trade-off Theory  

•   Leverage based on  

o   Degree and volatility of profits    o   Perceived liquidity of assets  

•   Substantial costs to change capital structure  o   Companies’ target specific ratios or debt rating 

 •   Debt also viewed as disciplinary tool 

 •   Companies rarely base leverage on optimal tax structure  
# Pecking Order and Information Asymmetry  

•   Executive management and Board (“insiders”) know more  about company’s condition than others – including creditors  

•   Smith v Jones – volatile industry  

o   Identical opportunity for each company  

o   Current share price \$100

# Smith v Jones  

•   Make different financing choices  

o   Smith announces issuance of 1.2 mm shares of stock    o   Jones announce issuance of \$120 million five year note  

•   Investors would perceive issuance of shares as pessimistic  

o   Smith selling stock @ \$100/sh. – stock must be worth less    o   Jones issuing debt – stock must be worth more  

•   Result:  both companies will issue debt regardless of their view  
# Financial Slack  

•   Cash, short-term investments and unutilized credit lines  

o   Valuable when opportunities require quick action   o   Drag on financial returns since earning well-below WACC  

•   May encourage management to spend on poor earning assets  

o   “Empire” building    o   Executive perks   o   More debt may be the “cure”  
# Theory of Optimal Capital Structure  

•   Financial world is too complex to accommodate a single  theory that explains capital structure  

•   With the potential exception of banks (deposits), value comes  from the firm’s assets  

•   Mature, more stable companies tend to borrow more  

•   Growth companies tend to borrow little  

o   Higher risk  

o   Less opportunity to use interest tax shield  
# FTX Bankruptcy  

•   We have seen that bankruptcy is expensive  

o   Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?  o   Why did management oppose filing?  o   What can bankruptcy achieve?  o   What open issues remain?  
# Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?  

•   Why were Alameda’s holdings of FTT such a shock?  

o   On November 2, 2022 Coindesk reported that Alameda held   more than \$5.0 billion of FTT representing more than 192  million of the 328 million FTT outstanding 4  

o   Market assumption to this point would have been that  unaffiliated entities owned nearly all the unlocked FTT  

o   Once it was clear that a large portion of FTT was controlled  by an affiliate the price began to fall  
# Should FTX have been placed into bankruptcy?  

On November 6, Binance announces intention to sell its holdings  of FTT, estimated at 95.5 million FTT, worth approximately \$2.1  billion 5  

o   Alameda proposes purchase of Binance’s holdings at \$22/FTT   §   Other FTT holders withdraw and sell \$5 billion of FTT  

By November 8, FTT drops to \$8 and FTX attempts to find up to  \$6 billion in new investment

# What can bankruptcy achieve?  

•   Order – the bankruptcy process allows for professionals to  come in and assess what happened, find customer, creditor  and investor funds  

•   Fairness – the process cannot rewind the clock but can fairly  distribute whatever value remains  

•   Closure – the bankruptcy process and federal court cases will  bring closure on the many remaining open issues and  determine the true extent of the fraud  
# What Open Issues Remain?  

•   Understanding the extent of the fraud  

o   Determining the amount of money actually lost by  investors     o   Proving who participated in the creation and perpetuation  of the  fraud and bringing those individuals to justice  

•   Determining the role of the venture capital and other  investors  

•   Establishing what changes the US and other jurisdictions  should make regarding trading in digital assets
