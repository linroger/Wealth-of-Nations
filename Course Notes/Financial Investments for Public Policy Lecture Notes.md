# Prof. Carolin Pflueger  

# University of Chicago - Harris School of Public Policy  

# Autumn 2023  

Revision:9/26/2023  
# Roadmap  

Class outline/organization Review questions Financial Markets and the Macro economy  
# CLASS OUTLINE/ORGANIZATION  
# Course Objective  

Financial markets play an important role in public policy  

Examples?  

This class will cover the standard tools of an introductory investments class  

These are great tools for understanding risk and return, whether you are contemplating a career at a Treasury department or in muni c ipa finance, at a central bank, at a pension fund, or in finance industry Understanding investments is also important for personal finance decisions Stats is important,not just in this class but also in the professionalworld whenever you need to think about risk and return  
# Course Objective  

By the end of this class you should have the foundations to  

Make informed investment decisions either on your own behalf or a pension fund,foundation,etc.. Understand how to assess risk and return of bonds,stocks,andother securities Interpret macroeconomic information incorporated in financial markets  

This course has significant overlap with BUS 3500 ("Investments") and PPHA 42510 ("Applied Financial Management"), but focuses more on hands-on Excel applications  
# Applied Focus  

You will be expected to find and access real-world investment materials and use these as your sources  

You will learn to find and download real-time financial data  

Use investment theory to analyze the data an inform relevant public policy questions  

Student market updates on Wednesdays based on JP Morgan Weekly Market Recap  
# Public Policy Focus  

How is the Fed reflected in financial markets?  

How should a national sovereign wealth fund, such as the Norges Bank Investment Management, allocate its investments between bonds and stocks?  

How should a public pension fund invest in stocks, bonds, and alternatives?  
# Course Format  

You are responsible for slides, and Excel exercises posted on Canvas  

Attendance and in-class participation will be factored into your participation grade I plan to post basic course recordings on Canvas with subtitles,but this is not a substitute for coming to class! In-class polls will be used to help you engage with the class and count for a small part of your participation grade  Sign up for online office hours!  

OAsk and answer questions via Ed Discussions  

TA sessions wi be on Fridays 10:3 am roughly 2/23 Pflueger(UChicago -Harris) 8/43  
# Group Assignments Using Excel  

Classes and group homework structured around Excel exercises  

Access data and financial reports Manipulate and summarize data Analyze data using financial theory  

Homework and class Excel exercises are also your practice exam questions  

Exams may use Excel screenshots ：Exams may ask to perform similar,butsimpler,computations by hand ;Exams will also ask you to apply concepts to a new context  

Excel is ubiquitous for analyzing financial data  

I expect you be familiar with Excel/google spreadsheets and to acquire new Excel skills independently This will be a big plus for your next internship or research assistant position  
# Textbook  

Bodie, Kane, Marcus "Investments" (my page references are for 13th Edition,other editions alsofine)  

Harvard Business School cases ("Cook County Pension Fund", about \$9)  

I will not simply teach to the textbook. Not all topics in book will be covered.  

Applied materials (real-time data sets, actual government and corporate reports) are messy and more challenging  

You are responsible for the material in the class slides, assignments, and spreadsheets.  
# Recipe for Success  

Come to class and ask questions - often your classmates will have the same question and will be grateful!  

Review slides, Excel exercises, and market updates prior to class Start assignments well in advance · Review any questions after class, ideally with a friend  

The best answers don't just get the numbers right, but also have insightful answers to the qualitative questions  

Consider the classroom opportunity to prepare for your professional career

# Key Financial Instruments  

What is money? What are government bond markets? What are stocks?

 : What are derivatives?

  Which financial instruments protect against inflation? Reading: Chapter 2 of BKM, Chapter 14 (pp 431-432)  
# Money  

Early currencies were backed by commodities (e.g. gold)  

More recent“fiat”" currencies have no intrinsic value  

Fiat currencies only derive value because you know that everyone accepts them as money  

Governments can avoid unwanted shocks to the supply of money and adjust the money supply to manage macroeconomic fluctuations  
# Money Market (Chapter 2.1)  

Very short-term debt securities Highly liquid and easily bought and sold US government uses Treasury bills toborrow Payout1o0 dollars at a specified date in thefuture Sell at auction at a priceless than 100 ● Issued with 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months to maturity  

If issued by a company, this is called “commercial paper"  
# Federal Funds Rate  

Just as you have deposits at a bank, many banks in the US have deposits at the Federal Reserve bank ("Fed")  

Banks need to maintain a minimum balance with the Fed, that increases with their amount of customer deposits  

The rate at which banks lend to each other over night is the "Federal Fundsrate"  

The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy by changing the Fed Fundsrate  

Until 2008,theFederal Reserve used“OpenMarket Operations", effectively buying and selling Fed Funds to drive the rate towards the desired target Now, the Federal Reserve pays interest on Fed Funds  
# Bonds  

Federal government also uses Treasury notes and bonds to borrow. ● Notes and bonds are just like T-bills, but they have longer maturities. They also pay interest. Noteshave maturities between2 and 10 years.Bondshave maturities up to 30 years. US Treasury bonds typically pay a fixed coupon twice a year. Corporations also issuebonds,that get traded in secondary markets. Banks borrow from each other at the London Interbank Borrowing Rate(LIBOR)rate.  
# Euro dollars  

Euro dollars aredollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks.  

Euro dollars are dollar-denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks.  

Veryliquid and therefore tracked around FOMC announcements  

While T-bill rates, Fed funds rate, Eurodollar, commercial paper etc may differ because of liquidity and counter party risk, different short-term interest rates should all be very similar.  

If they were very different one could borrow at the lower rate and invest at the higher. This is called the "Law of One Price" (LOOP)  
# Eurodollar Example Calculation  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/15ff1945d1d2e6aaedf6f8b821edfe1dd9855bc167aa9d44c5f58f14afbd80b1.jpg)  
# Equity Securities  

Stocks (or equities or equity securities) represent ownership shares in a corporation

 ● In contrast to bonds or money market instruments, they do not promise a fixed payment

 · Stock owners receive dividends, that go up and down depending on the firm's profitability Common stocks entitle their owners to one vote at the corporate annual meeting (e.g. executive compensation) · Stocks are fairly liquid, though not as liquid as US Treasury T-bills They are traded daily on stock exchanges, such as the NYSE Nasdaq, London Stock Exchange etc.  
# Market Indexes (Chapter 2 of BKM)  

Dow Jones index covers 30 blue chip corporations and has been reported since 1896. Price-weighted average, i.e. it assigns higher weight to stocks with a higher price. · S&P 500 covers approximately the 500 largest U.S. corporations. It will drop some of the top 5 o 0 companies and add others to maintain even industry representation. ● Value-weighted average, i.e. companies with greater market value receive higher weight Both are price indexes, i.e. they reflect changes in stock prices but not dividends, which also contribute to returns  
# Dow Jones Industrials Index

Source: BKM.Table 2.4 Pflueger (UChicago - Harris)  
# Data Question  

How much did the US stock market change on “taper tantrum" date June 19, 2013 (in %)? How much did emerging market stocks change on June 19, 2013? How much did developed market stocks change on June 29, 2013?  

Hint: Use data from the MSCl Indexes , use gross returns to include dividends  
# Derivatives  

Derivatives are contracts between two parties  

Derivatives arebased on the prices of other financial market instruments, such as bond or stock prices  

Example: A call option that pays out if the Apple stock price reaches \$250on11/1/2019.  
# Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) (Chapter 14)  

The US Federal government also borrows using TIPS  

Payments on TIPS are tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPl). Both principal and coupon payments increase with the C PI  

Therefore, the interest rate on these bonds is a real risk-free rate  

Break even inflation is defined as the difference between a nominal Treasury and TiPS rate with the same time to maturity  

It is the inflation rate that would make an investor break even (i.e. earn the same return) on both bonds ex post.  

Nominal return Realreturn = = yield Inflation  
# TIPS Cash Flows  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/3a1cf1b2d3752538d364c0dd5be8b94a03ab666e4ae38ffb327a34f075b20b30.jpg)  

Question: If you are a pension fund with inflation-indexed liabilities, do youprefer to receive or pay T lPS?  
# Maturity of Outstanding TIPS 1997-2008

# 10-year TiPS most common and data most reliable  
# Constant-Maturity Bond Yields  

Often, we want to know what is the rate on a "typical" 10-year Treasury  

But there may not be any Treasury bond with exactly 10 years remaining to maturity  

Two approaches: ① The Federal Reserve official statistical release uses the most recently issued10-yearnote Fit a smooth function to yields of notes and bonds with different maturities (also fromFed researchers) Gurkaynak, Sack, and Wright (2006)

# What are Options?  

：Options are a form of "derivative” - their prices derive from other securities prices  

They give the holder the option but not the obligation to buy or sel astock  

The VIX is a measure of market participants' expected volatility based on options prices  

Even if you never trade options directly, their properties are important for understanding applications  

Index-linked certificate of deposit (CD) Corporate debt has option-like features Government guarantees are effectively options written by government

# Call Options  

· A call option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a security at the exercise price X at a given dateT in the future(the exercise date)  

The payoff of the call option at expiration equals  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathsf{t o\c a l l\ h o l d e r}}&{=}&{\left\{\begin{array}{c l}{S_{T}-X}&{\mathsf{i f}\quad S_{T}>}\\ {0}&{\mathsf{i f}\quad S_{T}\le}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$  

Option property: Payoff cannot go negative

# BKM Figure 20.2  
# Put Options  

A put option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sella security at the exercise priceX at exercise timeT  

The payoff of a put option at expiry is  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathsf{t o\ p u t\ h o l d e r}}&{=}&{\left\{\begin{array}{c l}{0}&{\mathsf{i f}\ \ S_{T}>}\\ {X-S_{T}}&{\mathsf{i f}\ \ S_{T}\le}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$  

Writing (naked) far out-of-the-money puts is a risky strategy, that generates steady fees income most of the time but can lead to large losses in market downturn (October 1987 crash)

# Put-Call Parity  

Note that  

payoff on call - payoff on put = ST -X  

Obtain identical payoff by purchasing one unit of stock and borrowing  $X/(1+r_{f})^{T}$  T-bills at time O  

No-arbitrage: Strategies with the same payoff must have same initial price  

$$
\mathsf{C a l l}(X)-\mathsf{P u t}(X)=S_{0}-X/(1+r_{f})^{T}

# Two-State Option Pricing  

: Assume stock can only take two values at expiration  

Current stock price: So = \$100. Price will either increase to \$120 or fallto\$90  Call option with exercise price \$110 Interest rate equals 10%  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/853277c5ccc00e99752a174288c63514ca336cbb9f49218e70c491264f1f6484.jpg)  
# Replicating Portfolio  

Buy one stock, and borrow \$81.82 at 10% interest rate  

Cost of establishing position is \$100 - \$81.82 = \$18.18  

If stock goes down to \$90, portfolio worth after one year is  $90-81.82\times1.10=0$  

If stock goes up to \$120, portfolio payoff is 120 - 81.82 × 1.10 = 30 Portfolio payoff equals  $3\times$   option payoff in every possible state By no-arbitrage, call option price must satisfy

：Governments worldwide will invest tens of trillions of dollars in new investments over the next decade.Which of the many candidate projects should be undertaken? Is entering a public private partnership(P3)cost effective?  

Hypothetical toll road with expected annual revenue  

· Suppose government guarantees private partner annual revenue of at least \$15 million for 20 years. How much is this worth? The government effectively write a string of (naked) put options (onefor everyyear). According to Black-Scholes formula, value of this guarantee can be up to \$40.5 million and flip the cost-benefit analysis of the project  
# Summary Learning Objectives of "Options"  

Options give holder the right but not the obligation to buy (cal option) or sell (put option) a stock at a given price  

Options can be priced using binomial trees  

In certain simplified conditions, they can be priced using the Black-Scholes formula Option-pricing matters even if you never trade an option: Index-linked CD, corporate debt, government (credit) guarantees

Increasingly,individual investors choose not to trade individual securities for their own accounts.  

Instead,obtain diversification by investing in"mutual funds"  

Accessible to small and large individual investors.

How would you pick a mutual fund for your investments?  

Use information from past returns.  

Looking at total past returns ignores risk  

We will adjust for risk.  

Good past returns can also be due to a good market rather than super i our skill,  

We will evaluate returns relative to benchmarks.

Total fund risk is the sum of market risk and idiosyncratic risk (also called residual variance or tracking error)  
# Estimating Components of Risk  

$$
\boldsymbol{r}_{i,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f,t}=\boldsymbol{a}_{i}+\boldsymbol{b}_{i}^{m}\times\left(\boldsymbol{r}_{m,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f,t}\right)+\boldsymbol{e}_{i,t}
$$  

The total risk can be estimated as  

$$
\sigma(r_{i,t}-r_{f,t})
$$  

The systematic risk can be estimated as  

$$
\sigma(b_{i}^{m}\times(r_{m,t}-r_{f,t}))
$$  

The idiosyncratic risk can be estimated as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\rho}}_{t})}&{=}&{\sigma\big(\boldsymbol{r}_{i,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f,t}-\boldsymbol{a}_{i}-\boldsymbol{b}_{i}^{m}\times\big(\boldsymbol{r}_{m,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f}\big)\big)}\\ &{=}&{\sqrt{\sigma\big(\boldsymbol{r}_{i,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f,t}\big)^{2}-\sigma\big(\boldsymbol{b}_{i}^{m}\times\big(\boldsymbol{r}_{m,t}-\boldsymbol{r}_{f}\big)\big)}}\end{array}
$$  
# Estimating Performance Measures  

Sharpe ratio: Average excess return per unit of total risk  

$$
\frac{\overline{{{r_{i,t}}-{r_{f,t}}}}}{\sigma({r_{i,t}}-{r_{f,t}})}
$$  

Treynor ratio: Average excess return per unit of systematic risk  

$$
\frac{\overline{{r_{i,t}-r_{f,t}}}}{b_{i}^{m}}
$$  

Information ratio: Measures abnormal return per unit of tracking error.Measures informative ness of fund's out performance.  

$$
\frac{\alpha_{i}}{\sigma(e_{i,t})}
$$  
# Performance Measure Depends on Investor's Sophistication  

Mean-variance investor maximizes the Sharpe ratio of the complete portfolio of risky assets.  

Performance measures correspond to three types of investors.  

●Investor considering to place all assets with fund:Sharpe ratio Well-diversified investor with a fixed and given complementary portfolio:Trey nor ratio. Investor who cangolong and short index funds tracking the benchmarks:Information ratio.  

All performance measures closely related to fund's CAPM α.  
# Fund performance declines with expense ratio  

"Annual excess return'" denotes CAPM α

# Multi-Factor Analysis  

·In practice, no single factor accounts for all correlations between stock returns.  

Many sources of common variation.  

Industry effects ·Leveraged firms move with interest rates ·Small firms move together Any CAP M assumption that does not hold in practice:labor income, future investment opportunities,..  

It matters for performance analysis if investors may already have access to a large range of indexes  

A fund is only attractive to investors if it can outperform the existing fund universe. Estimate α relative to multiple benchmark stock portfolios.  
# No-Arbitrage Assumption  

Arbitrage opportunity:  

Definition: Riskless profit without making net investment  

Widespread arbitrage opportunities would represent the grossest form or market irrationality  

If arbitrage was possible, it would be easy to get rich  

Implies"Law Of One Price": Two assets with same payoffs will have sameprice  
# Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)  

Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) of Ross (1976) argues that a small number of factors should explain individual stock co-movement and performance.  

Intuitively, a few assets may be mispriced.  

But if too many assets were mispriced, there would be an arbitrage opportunity by grouping them together into a portfolio.  

The mean-variance optimal frontier can be constructed from K factor portfolios,where  $K$  issmall.  

Fund loadings onto factors determine expected return.  

CAPM is a special case with the market return as single factor  
# Multi-Factor APT Predictions  

In a multi-factor model, expected returns are determined by  

$$
E[r_{i}-r_{f}]=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_{i}^{k}\times R P_{k}
$$  

Thereare  $K$  factors,  $k=1,...,K$  Examplesof factors aremarket portfolio, interest rates, GNP growth, rate of inflation, .  

$R P_{k}$  is the risk premium of factor k:  $E[r_{k}-r_{f}]$   $\beta_{i}^{k}$  is the factor loading of asseti onfactor k

# Overview: Capital Asset Pricing Model  

:So far we have computed averages and standard deviations from historical data and asked how investors should behave in this world  

But how should different stocks behave in comparison with one another?

# Learning Goals  

Assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model Predictions for expected returns on individual securities Application: Estimating the CAPM  
# CAPM Assumptions  

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relies on two groups of assumptions  

All investors optimize their portfolios a la Markowitz  

Financial markets are well-functioning:All assets are traded and investors can borrow and lend at the risk-freerate  

Of course, all of these assumptions are not true in the real world.  

: Nonetheless, the CAPM provides powerful intuition, it remains widely used, and it can be extended in multiple directions.  
# CAPM Assumptions  

Individual behavior  

1 Investors are rational, mean-variance optimizers. 2 Their common planning horizon is a single period. 3 Investors all use identical input lists, an assumption often termed homogeneous expectations.Homogeneous expectations are consistent with the assumption that all relevant information is publicly available.  

Market structure  

0All assets are publicly held and trade on public exchanges 2 Investors can borrow orlen data common risk-freerate,andtheycan take short positions on traded securities. 3 Notaxes. 4 No transaction costs.  
# CAPM Equilibrium Intuition  

All investors agree on efficient frontier of risky assets  

Because all investors face the same risk-free rate(Assumption 2. b) they draw the same tangent CAL and arrive at the same risky tang en cy portfolio  

By the mutual fund theorem,all investors hence hold the same mix of risky assets  

Equilibrium insight: Portfolios must add up  

Becauseall investors hold the same risky weights,we can conclude that everyone holds a risky portfolio proportional to the market portfolio. CAL= Capital Market Line

Application: Estimating the CAPM  
# Expected Return-Beta Relationship  

In equilibrium,GE must be priced so that investors are in different whether to buy or sell a small amount  

GE should therefore offer the samerisk-return trade-off as the market itself  

·How much does GE contribute to risk premium on market? If the weight on GEin the market portfolio is  $w_{G E}$  ,thisis  

$$
w_{G E}\mathbb{E}\left(r_{G E}-r^{f}\right)
$$  

How much does GE contribute to the risk of the overall market portfolio?This depends on co variance  

$$
w_{G E}C o v\left(r_{G E},r_{M}\right)
$$  
# Expected Return-Beta Relationship  

Reward-to-risk ratio for GE and the market must be equal  

$$
\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(r_{G E}-r^{f}\right)}{C o v\left(r_{G E},r_{M}\right)}\;\;=\;\;\frac{\mathbb{E}r_{M}-r^{f}}{\sigma_{M}^{2}}
$$  

This leads to the most famous relationship of the CAPM  

Here, i can now be any asset, such as GE, Apple,.  
# Formal Argument  

Know that tangency portfolio maximizes overall Sharpe ratio and tangency portfolio equals market.  

● Consider increasing the allocation to GE by a small amount w. We musthave  $\frac{d S h a r p e}{d\omega}\bar{=}0$  or else we could increase our Sharpe ratio. This is not possible because market=tangency.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\textdollar{\upsilon}e}&{=}&{\displaystyle\frac{\omega\mathbb{E}\left(r_{G E}-r^{f}\right)+\mathbb{E}\left(r_{M}-r^{f}\right)}{\sqrt{\omega^{2}\sigma_{G E}^{2}+2\omega C o v\left(r_{G E},r_{M}\right)+\sigma}}}\\ &{=}&{\displaystyle\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(r_{G E}-r^{f}\right)}{\sigma_{M}}-C o v\big(r_{G E},r_{M}\big)\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(\
$$  

dSharpe Setting = 0 gives do 10=0  $\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(r_{G E}-r^{f}\right)}{C o v\left(r_{G E},r_{M}\right)}\;\;=\;\;\frac{\mathbb{E}\left(r_{M}-r^{f}\right)}{\sigma_{M}^{2}}$

\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathbb{E}\left(\boldsymbol{r}_{i}-\boldsymbol{r}^{f}\right)}&{{}=}&{\beta_{i}\mathbb{E}\left(\boldsymbol{r}_{M}-\boldsymbol{r}^{f}\right)}\end{array}
$$  

Expected return on any asset increases with its comovement with the market.  

Note that the total volatility of asset i does not enter.  

: In a well-functioning market, investors receive return only if they are willing to bear risk

# Summary Learning Objectives for “"Capital Asset Pricing Model'  

The Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)assumes that all investors trade off risk and return, and every asset must be held by someone  

It predicts that the expected return on a stock/mutual fund/nontraded financial asset is proportional to its beta with the market  

Under priced assets have positive alpha, while overpriced assets have negative alpha  

We can estimate alpha and beta from a simple regression of historical returns onto the market

# Overview: Portfolio Choice  

How should you split your investments between different stocks, bonds, real estate etc.?  

Portfolio allocation is one of the most important investment decisions for pension funds and individual investors  

We will derive portfolio rules for the two main steps in top-down asset allocation:  

Decide on how much to invest in each asset class (e.g. stocks vs. bonds?) Decide on asset allocation within each class (e.g- which portfolio of Stocks?)

$$  

The set of combinations for   $\mathbb{E}\left(r_{P}\right)$  and  $\sigma_{P}$   available to investors is the investment opportunity set  
# Optimal Investment Proportions  

Substitute expressions for expectation and variance into utility  

$$

$$  

Take the derivative with respect to  $w_{D}$   and setting it to zero  $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{d U}{d w_{D}}=0}\end{array}$

# Overview: Portfolio Choice  

How should you split your investments between different stocks, bonds, real estate etc.?  

Portfolio allocation is one of the most important investment decisions for pension funds and individual investors  

We will derive portfolio rules for the two main steps in top-down asset allocation:  

Decide on how much to invest in each asset class (e.g. stocks vs. bonds?) Decide on asset allocation within each class (e.g- which portfolio of Stocks?)  

● Main framework: Mean-variance analysis (Markowitz) Reading:B KM Chapters 6 and 7

# Famous Quotes on Market Efficiency  

Michael Jensen (1978): "There is no other proposition in economics which has more solid evidence supporting it than the Efficient Markets Hypothesis".  

RobertS hiller(1984):"Returns on speculative assets are nearly un forecast able; this fact is the basis of the most important argument in the oral tradition against a role for mass psychology in speculative markets. One form of this argument claims that because real returns are nearly un forecast able,the real price of stocks is close to the intrinsic value, that is, the present value with constant discount rate of optimally forecasted future real dividends. This argument... is one of the most remarkable errors in the history of economic thought".  
# Three Types of Market Efficiency  

Which information is incorporated into prices and hence be unable to forecast future returns?  

Weakform efficiency.Past returns. ● Semi-strong form efficiency. Past publicly available information, e.g., stock splits, dividends, earnings. Strong form efficiency. Past information, even if only available to insiders. Empirically, it may be possible to attain abnormal returns using only private information. ·But this is also illegal.  
# Why Should Market Efficiency Hold?  

Idea is based on competition  

If prices did not reflect all available information, someone could trade onthis  

Investors would bid up price until it reflects information  

Financial markets are competitive, full of smart investors. Don't underestimate your competition!

# Definition: Log Return  

For computing returns over time, it is sometimes useful to work with logreturns  

$$
r_{t+1}~~=~~\log\left(1+R_{t+1}\right)
$$  

here  $R_{t+1}$  is the level return (i.e. the return we have worked with so far)  

Log return has the desirable feature that  

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{r_{t\rightarrow t+2}}&{=}&{\log\left(\left(1+R_{t+1}\right)\left(1+R_{t+2}\right)\right)}\\ &{=}&{r_{t+1}+r_{t+2}}\end{array}
$$  

Log return approximately equals level return  $r_{t+1}\approx R_{t+1}\ \mathrm{\sfif}\ R_{t+1}$  small

# Linking Dividend-Price Ratio to Stock Returns  

So far, we have used only lagged returns to predict future stock returns. There are good reasons to think that the dividend-price ratio (or dividend yield  $\frac{D_{t}}{P_{t}}$  predicts stock returns  
# Dividend Discount Model of  

Consider the Dividend Discount Model(Gordon Growth Model) with constant expected dividend growth G and constant expected return  $R$  (Chapter18.3,BKM)  

Dividends grow at constant rate G and investors require constant return  $R$  ,used for discounting  

Price=Present Value of Expected Future Cash Flows  

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{P_{t}}&{=}&{\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\mathsf{E}_{t}D_{t+1}\frac{(1+G)^{i}}{(1+R)^{i+1}}}\\ &{=}&{\displaystyle\frac{\mathsf{E}_{t}[D_{t+1}]}{R-G}}\\ &{=}&{\displaystyle\frac{(1+G)D_{t}}{R-G}}\end{array}
$$  
# Example 18.2 (BKM)  

Preferred stock that pays a fixed dividend can be valued using constant growth dividend discount model  

The constant growth rate is simply zero  

Value a preferred stock paying a fixed dividend of \$2 per share when the discount rate is 8%  
# Dividend Yield  

This can be rewritten in terms of the dividend yield  

$$
D Y_{t}={\frac{D_{t}}{P_{t}}}={\frac{R-G}{1+G}}
$$  

This implies that dividend yields are high if ·R is high ●G is low

# Why are Dividend Yields Time-Varying?

The only way for the dividend yield to change is if ·Rchanges ·G changes

# Excess Returns  

· If you knew that the stock market offers the same return on average as the bond market, but with a greater standard deviation, would you investin it?  

Excess return is the return on a risky asset above and beyond what could have been earned on the"safe"asset  

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{{X R_{t+1}}}&{{=}}&{{R_{t+1}-R_{t+1}^{r f}}}\end{array}
$$  

It measures how much investors have earned on average for bearing risk  

The average excess return is also called the"risk premium’  

·A perfectly safe asset does not exist,however in practice we usually use the rate of return on aT-bill to measure the safe rate of return from time to time t+1,  $R_{t+1}^{r f}$

What is the return that you have earned over the full year? Answer:  $R_{t\rightarrow t+12}=\left(1+R_{t+1}\right)\times\left(1+R_{t+2}\right)\times\ldots,1$  ×(1+Rt+12)-1  
# Arithmetic Average  

Suppose you want to know what is the typical return earned on the S&P 500 over one year  

In that case, you may want to regard each year as an equally likely 'scenario'  

·If we have T annual returns  $R_{t}$  ,the expected return is then estimated by the average of the sample rates of return  

$$
E\left(R_{t}\right)\ \ =\ \ {\frac{1}{T}}\sum_{t=1}^{T}R_{t}
$$  

The standard deviation of returns is a measure of risk and is esimatedas  

$$
\sigma\left(R\right)\,\,\,=\,\,\,\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\left(R_{t}-E\left(R_{t}\right)\right)^{2}}
$$  
# Geometric (Time-Weighted) Average  

Suppose, on the other hand, you want to know the constant rate of return that you would have had to earn to have the same T-year performance  

That is,we want the rate  $g$  suchthat  

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{(1+g)^{T}}&{=}&{(1+R_{1})\times\ldots\times(1+R_{T})}\end{array}
$$  

This is the geometric or (time-weighted) average return  

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{g}&{=}&{\left(\left(1+R_{1}\right)\times\ldots\times\left(1+R_{T}\right)\right)^{1/T}-1}\end{array}
$$  

Geometric and arithmetic average will be close if returns are small, but can be very different for large returns  

Example: $R_{t}=100\%$ ， $R_{t+1}=-100\%$  
# Effective Annual Returns (BKM, p.121)  

The investment in a 25-year bond grows by its maturity by a factor of4.2918 The effective annualrate(EAR)is the annual rate of return that would compound to the same value as the actual investment What is the EAR?  
# Comparing Returns with Different Holding Periods  

Not surprisingly, returns over longer holding periods will be larger than returns over shorter holding periods  

It is commonto express returns in annual i zed units,i.e.theannual rate at which the investment would have to grow to generate the actually experience holding-period return  

Example 1:If  $R_{t}$  is a monthly return, the annualized effective return (EAR) is  

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{E A R}&{=}&{\left(1+R_{t}\right)^{12}-1}\end{array}
$$  

Example2:If  $R_{t}$  is a 25-year return, the annualized effective return (EAR)  

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{E A R}&{=}&{\left(1+R_{t}\right)^{1/25}-1}\end{array}

# Bond Yields and Prices  
# Present Value  

Let's say you know own an asset that promises to pay   $D_{t+1}$   $D_{t+2},\ldots$  

How much should you be willing to pay for it?  

Price should increase in all future payments,but be less sensitive to payments further in the future  

Let's say the return you require to hold this asset each period is r  

The price is then given by the present value  

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{\mathcal{P}_{t}}&{=}&{E\left[\displaystyle\frac{D_{t+1}}{1+r}+\frac{D_{t+2}}{\left(1+r\right)^{2}}+\frac{D_{t+3}}{\left(1+r\right)^{3}}+\right.}\end{array}

# Bond Prices and Yields  

But what is a bond yield?  

In its simplest form, bond yields move inversely with prices  

For simplicity, consider a zero-coupon bond (i.e. a bond that pays no coupon)trading at time  $t$  and with time to maturity n The bond pays1\$ at time  $t+\eta$  The yield to maturity  $Y_{n t}$  is defined by  

$$
P_{n t}\;\;=\;\;\frac{1}{(1+Y_{n t})^{n}}
$$  

The yield is the annualized return if the bond is held to maturity  

The yield is also the discount rate that equates the price to the present value of the final payoff.  
# The Yield Curve  

The yield curve compares the yields of bonds paying out at different points in the future  

The term spread is the difference between a long-term yield and a short-termyield  

$$
\begin{array}{c c l}{S_{n t}}&{=}&{Y_{n t}-Y_{1t}}\end{array}
$$  

A negative term spread (or "inverted yield curve") is often thought to be apredictor of recessions

# Bond Duration  
# Coupon Bonds  

Many bonds pay a stream of coupons at rate C up to and including the maturity date.  

The yield to maturity on a coupon bond is defined implicitly by  

$$
P_{c n t}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{C}{(1+Y_{c n t})^{i}}+\frac{1}{(1+Y_{c n t})^{n}}.
$$  
# Macaulay's Duration  

A measure of the average length of time for which money is invested.  

Use present values of each payment to construct average.  

$$
D_{c n t}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{i C}{(1+Y_{c n t})^{i}}+\frac{n}{(1+Y_{c n t})^{n}}}{P_{c n t}}.
$$  

Properties of Macaulay's duration:  

Always less than maturity. Equals maturity for zero coupon bond. For positive C, declining in yield.  

Many bonds sell close to par (i.e.  $P_{c n t}\approx1)$  .For such bonds, a useful approximation is  

$$
)_{c n t}\approx(1-(1+Y_{c n t})^{-n})/(1-(1+Y_{c n t})^{-n}
$$

# Use Duration to Approximate Bond Returns  

Duration tells you how much the bond price changes when yields change  

Compute approximate return on coupon bond  

$$
{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}\approx-D\times\Delta y.
