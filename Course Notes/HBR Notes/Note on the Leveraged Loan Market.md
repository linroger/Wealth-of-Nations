**Note on the Leveraged Loan Market**

[[Course Notes/HBR Notes/Note on the Leveraged Loan Market|Leveraged Loans]]

A leveraged loan is a senior secured syndicated credit that has a non-investment-grade rating or is priced like a non-investment-grade loan (which means that it carries a similar risk). Typically,  data providers classify loans as leveraged based on the spread: If the spread exceeds a certain threshold,  the loan is considered leveraged. This cutoff point is a moving target,  as spreads tend to compress in periods of credit expansion and expand in economic downturns.a As will be discussed later in this note,  leveraged loans are primarily held by institutional investors. It is due to the wide investor base that leveraged loans—as distinct from other [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]]—are treated as a separate asset class and receive a lot of coverage from financial analysts.

Starting in the late 1990s,  leveraged loans were the main form of financing for highly levered corporate transactions. Over 90% of all [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] worldwide were backed by a leveraged loan. In contrast,  only 7% of all [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] had a senior bond and 22% had a subordinated bond as part of debt financing. Not considering revolving credit,  leveraged loans on average accounted for 75% of the debt financing of [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]],  while bonds accounted for less than 12%. (See **Exhibit 1** for the funding structure of a typical LBO. Of the leveraged loans issued in 2017,  almost 45% were used to finance sponsored transactions.

The leveraged loan market experienced a severe contraction during the 2007–2009 financial crisis,  hitting its lowest point in the fourth quarter of 2008. However,  the overall syndicated loan market and leveraged loan market,  in particular,  had been on the rise since. According to Bloomberg,  the total volume of U.S. [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]] was roughly $2.4 trillion in 2017,  an 18.97% increase from the previous year. U.S. leveraged loan volume in 2017 was about $1.5 trillion,  up 48.43% from the previous year0.\1

(See **Exhibit 2** for the evolution of annual leveraged loan issuance in the global market.)

The goal of this note is to introduce key concepts related to the leveraged loan market and to outline the primary factors that influence leveraged loan issuance. In particular,  the note explains the roles that banks and institutional investors play in this segment of the loan market.

## **1. LOAN SYNDICATION**

Leveraged loans are [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]]; they are originated (or “arranged”) by one lender but funded by a group of lenders0.\1 The arrangers market is dominated by banks and is highly concentrated. As can be seen from **Exhibit 3**,  the top 10 lead lenders by volume arrange over 65% of all [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]],  with the top 3 syndicating one third of all loans. The numbers are very similar for the leveraged segment of the market.

The basic rationale for loan syndication—and syndication more broadly—is risk sharing. Between 2000 and 2006,  the average syndicated loan to a U.S. borrower was $467 million,  the median was $185 million,  and 90% of the loans were larger than $20 million. Due to capital requirements and regulatory restrictions on sole-borrower exposure,  banks would not be able to originate loans of a similar size on a large scale in the absence of syndication0.\1 Thus,  understanding the process of syndication is central to understanding the conditions of bank credit supply to medium-sized and large firms and to understanding the financing available for merger and acquisition transactions.

## _INFORMATION ASYMMETRY_

Bank lending—including leveraged lending—builds on proprietary information. A large body of academic research shows that banks play a special role in information collection and processing (that is,  the screening and monitoring of borrowers). This is one of the key differences between bank debt and public debt.e A typical loan agreement requires the borrower to disclose _material_ information— financial statements and projections,  information on covenant compliance,  waiver requests,  plans for acquisitions,  and so on—in a timely manner to its lenders. (This information exchange is covered by confidentiality agreements,  and the borrower is not required to simultaneously disclose it to the public.) The ability to access and act on private information often makes banks the cheapest form of financing,  especially in those cases where there is a lot of uncertainty about a firm’s cash flows.

Collecting and assessing information about a borrower is costly,  so the lead bank acts as the delegated manager for the syndicated loan,  with primary responsibility for ex ante due diligence on and ex-post monitoring of the borrower. This reduces the cost of the borrower’s screening and monitoring. Put simply,  borrowing from a syndicate of five lenders is cheaper than getting a standalone loan from each of these lenders. However,  this also makes syndicate participants dependent on the accuracy of the information collected and presented by the lead bank while holding a direct pro rata claim against the borrower. Unless it can be proven in court that the information was misrepresented,  participants have no claim against the lead bank.

Loan syndication is a form of the so-called “originate-to-distribute” model of lending and,  as such,  is sensitive to information asymmetry due to imperfect alignment of incentives between the originating lender and the syndicate participants. For example,  the lead lender could have an incentive to originate a high-risk loan in order to build a relationship with a particular borrower or in order to collect the underwriting fees charged directly to the borrower at the origination of the loan.

In view of the above,  while a traditional bank loan spread is determined by borrower characteristics and the nature of the collateral,  in a syndication loan the private content of the information collected by the lead bank induces an additional premium driven by the degree of information asymmetry between the lead and participant banks0.\1 The lead’s reputation and the implicit requirement that it retains a share of the loan on its balance sheet (the so-called “skin in the game”) help to mitigate this cost. This is one explanation for why the arrangers market is so concentrated and is dominated by very large banks. (See **Exhibit 3**.) More broadly,  due to information asymmetry,  a bank’s ability to originate [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]] is closely connected to its reputation,  the strength of its balance sheet,  and its capacity to retain a share of the loan on its balance.

There is significant time variation in the average share of loans retained by lead banks. **Exhibit 4** illustrates that the lead share falls in periods of large capital inflow,  when credit standards are generally weakening. In particular,  the share retained by the lead bank fell dramatically in the four years leading to the financial crisis of 2007–2008,  a period of large credit expansion0.\1 The _pro rata_ share of the leveraged loan—the total fraction of the loan syndicated to banks—follows a very similar pattern. In the first half of 2007 (the peak of the 2003–2007 credit cycle),  banks as a whole were retaining only 34% of the primary; in the last quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 (the bottom of the credit cycle),  this number rose to 69%.

So,  although much of the attention paid to leveraged loan origination has been focused on institutional investors (more on this below),  this section points out that banks—and their ability to hold part of the loans on their balance sheets—are an intrinsic part of the origination of leveraged loans.

## _COST OF DISTRESS_

Another important aspect of loan syndication is that all tranches (or “facilities”) of the loan6— including second-lien facilities—are bound by the same contract. This means that,  although the claims held by each lender are against the borrower,  syndicate members cannot renegotiate the loan terms with the borrower independently in or out of court. This mechanism forces the syndicate members to coordinate. There cannot be the holdout problem typical in a bond exchange,  because a lending syndicate can only vote one way. For the same reason,  borrowers historically were unable to coerce lenders into a material amendment by creating favorable incentives for a fraction of the lenders. This makes the interdependence of lenders in a syndicated loan an important feature that reduces the cost of distress0.\1

A typical loan contract would specify the number of votes required to pass certain amendments. Most loans require 50.1% of the votes by loan volume. However,  material amendments—those that affect the interest rate,  amount,  or term of the loan—require a unanimous lenders agreement.

## **2. INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND LEVERAGED LOANS**

Given that the arranging bank acts as an agent for the lending syndicate in collecting and processing information about the borrower,  other syndicate participants—the “passive” lenders—no longer need to be banks; that is,  they do not need to be able to screen and monitor the borrower to the same extent. Other than funding revolving and delay-draw lines,  which require [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity management]],  there is nothing that makes the participating (passive) banks any more special than a non-bank institutional investor0.\1 Indeed,  while banks have risk-based capital requirements,  most institutional investors do not. A loan is not a security under the Securities Act of 1933,  so loan investors would need to be reasonably sophisticated financial investors,  but that still includes a wide range of institutional investors.

## _THE PROS AND CONS OF LOAN INVESTING_

The ability to attract a diverse investor base was central to the expansion of credit—to the expansion of leveraged loans,  in particular—starting in the late 1990s. Initially,  however,  there were several barriers for institutional investors’ entry into the loan market,  including illiquidity and a lack of standardization in risk assessment and procedures. Banks do not actively trade loans,  so although the market was dominated by banks,  it remained highly illiquid. To facilitate institutional investors’ entry into the loan market,  starting in the late 1990s the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) implemented several improvements,  including the introduction of loan credit ratings and the standardization of settlement procedures. The latest improvement in the market was the introduction of loan-specific credit derivatives swaps and the corresponding index (LCDX),  which facilitated risk hedging.

These changes led to the entry of institutional investors. As **Exhibit 5** illustrates,  the number of managing groups investing in the primary leveraged market grew from 74 in 2000 to 307—with nearly 900 different investment vehicles—in 2007. The growth of the investor base led,  in turn,  to improved liquidity. According to LSTA,  U.S. secondary loan trading volume totaled a record $635 billion,  up 7% from the prior year0.\1 This might seem low and relatively illiquid compared to the equity market,  but it is a significant improvement for the asset class.

There are some other structural characteristics of loans that respond to borrowers’ needs and are therefore unlikely to change,  although they are typically unattractive for an institutional investor. Loans are typically callable,  meaning that they are subject to being redeemed at the demand of the issuer and often at no additional premium. This feature fits well with a bank’s business model. For institutional investors,  however,  callability is an unattractive feature,  as it exposes investors to risk associated with reinvestment. As mentioned earlier,  institutional investors tend to stay away from commitments that might remain undrawn—especially revolving lines—due to [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity management]] cost and the fact that banks can do it in a more cost-efficient way.

Another distinctive feature of loans (as compared to bonds) is that they are often renegotiated. Given that (a) loans are arranged by banks,  (b) loan syndication is done through a private placement,  and (c) buying a loan even on the secondary market often requires the arranger’s approval,  lead banks tend to hold a lot of bargaining power against institutional investors. Wide syndication and misalignment of incentives between the arranging banks and the rest of the syndicate can make renegotiations an unattractive feature for institutional investors0.\1

Although there are some obstacles for institutional investment in the loan markets,  there are also reasons for institutional investors to find loans an attractive asset class. First,  loans are variable rate,  which reduces an investor’s exposure to duration risk caused by interest-rate fluctuations. Second,  loans are senior secured debt,  so they benefit from a much safer position in the capital structure. Historically,  the loan market had low default rates and higher recoveries than [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]]. Based on Moody’s data,  loans had a recovery rate of over 80 cents on the dollar between 1988 and May 2013. For the same period,  senior unsecured bonds recovered less than 50 cents on the dollar. Before the 2007–2008 financial crisis,  leveraged loans had an average annual return of 6.40% with a standard deviation of 2.34%. High-yield bonds,  on the other hand,  had an average annual return of 8.50% but a standard deviation of 5.73%. Following the financial crisis,  however,  the risk-return profile of leveraged loans was less attractive than that of high-yield bonds0.\1

## _INSTITUTIONAL PARTICIPANTS_

Institutional investors play a crucial role in the syndicated loan market,  particularly in the risky leveraged segment of the market where bank participation is very small. Since 2010,  about 85% of leveraged loans in the primary market have been funded by institutional investors0.\1 This number has increased since the 2007–2009 financial crisis,  arguably due to greater regulatory pressure on banks,  which traditionally retained a fraction of the leveraged loans.

Institutional investors that actively participate in the syndicate include collateralized loan obligations (Close),  mutual funds,  hedge funds,  pension funds,  and insurance companies,  among others. **Exhibit 6** shows leveraged loan holdings by investor type. The central point to notice is that over the past 20 years,  the leveraged loan market has gradually become dominated by an investor group made up of Close,  prime rate funds (funds investing in senior secured debt),  hedge funds,  and high-yield mutual funds (high-yield investors). A widespread shutdown in securitization in late 2007,  which also brought CLO issuance to a halt,  was a primary driver of the severe contraction in leveraged loan issuance in 2007:Q3,  which lasted through 2009. Since then,  the issuance volume has returned to its pre-crisis levels,  and high-yield investors’ share of the primary leveraged loan market has increased to nearly 81% (its highest point).

## _COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS_

Close were the largest investors in—and arguably the largest driving force behind—the credit boom in leveraged loans preceding the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Close differ from other institutions that participate in the high-yield loan market in several ways,  giving CLO managers different incentives from those of other syndicate participants.

**Exhibit 7** illustrates the structure of a typical CLO. To structure a CLO,  a collateral manager— typically an investment management company11—sets up a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle (SPV). The collateral manager then assembles a collateral portfolio by acquiring pieces of syndicated corporate loans,  engages with the underwriter and credit rating agency to structure and rate the deal,  and issues securities to investors backed by the principal and interest payments from the loans. A CLO manager’s compensation is only weakly tied to deal performance. CLO managers used to receive a base fee on the order of 40–50 basis points per year,  typically senior to all notes,  but this is likely to change with the risk retention for securitized products,  required by the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act. CLO managers are not required to hold equity in the deal,  but most often do own a share of the equity,  receive an incentive fee that is subordinate to equity,  or have a partial claim on the residual interest. CLO decisions are made by the CLO managers,  so the fact that their incentives are tied to the equity tranche and not to the whole overall structure—as they would be for any other lender—is important.

To put together a collateral pool,  a CLO usually participates in over 100 syndications. An average CLO is roughly $500 million in size (in 2007,  it was $571 million,  and in 2012,  it was $486 million). The average size of an individual loan holding in a CLO portfolio is $2 to $3 million. (While the average size of a high-yield syndicated loan is $522 million,  each participant in the syndicate finances only a fraction of the loan,  hence,  the small size of individual loan holdings in a CLO portfolio.)

Syndication before securitization is a key difference between corporate loan securitization and other types of securitization. For example,  after origination,  a subprime mortgage ($150, 000–$190, 000 on average) is typically sold by the originating lender—as part of a pool—to other investors. In the case of a securitization,  this mortgage pool would be used as part of the collateral held by the SPV. At no point are any of the individual mortgages split into parts; in other words,  there is only one direct claim against the borrower of the original mortgage. However,  the fact that securitized leveraged loans are syndicated implies that there are other non-CLO lenders in the syndicate. Although securitization has been shown to suffer from multiple agency problems,  in the corporate segment,  the presence of other lenders creates a mechanism that counterweights these effects0.\1

### **3. IMPLICATIONS FOR MARKET CONDITIONS**

To summarize some of the points raised in this note,  the inflow of institutional,  non-bank money into the syndicated loan market—and specifically the securitization boom—is central for understanding the evolution of the leveraged loan market and the syndicated loan market more broadly.

After an explosive rise,  CLO issuance—like other types of securitization—came to a halt in 2008 and 2009. The market seemed to have missed the fact that securitization of corporate loans differed in an important way from securitization of other asset classes. Leveraged loan performance through 2008– 2010 was not nearly as bad as expected. In 2010 alone,  Moody’s upgraded the ratings of more than 280 tranches in 75 deals (8.5% of Moody’s rated CLO universe)0.\1 CLO issuance has since recovered,  enjoying a slow and steady rise. (See **Exhibit 8**.)

Loan mutual funds,  the other major player in the market,  have blossomed only after the financial crisis,  their assets under management nearly tripling from 2010:Q4 through 2013:Q4. (See **Exhibit 9**.) The combined assets under management of U.S. Close and loan mutual funds was around $400 billion at the beginning of 2013,  and it was roughly $660 billion as of January 2018.5

The rise and fall in the supply of leveraged credit influences not only the availability but also the term of the leveraged financing. The Loan-to-EBITDA ratio (a common way of measuring leverage) had been steadily rising from 2003 through 2007,  which coincides with the CLO expansion. At the peak of the securitization boom,  the average Loan-to-EBITDA ratio for large LBO transactions was 4.8 (**Exhibit 10**). After a fall in 2008–2009,  tolerance for leverage was back to the pre-crisis level,  with an even bigger fraction of second-lien tranches. Indeed,  in the first three quarters of 2018,  issuance of covenant-lite loans totaled $305 billion in volume (on-track to surpass 2017’s total volume of $375 billion),  compared to a pre-financial crisis high of $97 billion (**Exhibit 11**)0.\1 But easing had been selective and,  despite signs of leveraged loan recovery (and perhaps even of market hitting),  loan spreads remained substantially above the 2006–2007 levels. (**Exhibit 12** presents average spreads to maturity.)
