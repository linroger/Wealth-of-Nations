# Debt Without Monitoring

 Optimal contract is a debt contract with face value f, and liquidation if less is paid.

 What is the optimal face value, f? We saw last time that f=1.3125 when the borrower must default 20% of the time and liquidation gives a recovery of zero.

Costly Ex-post Information Used to renegotiate loans For example, sometimes a lender should take less than is promised because that is all that a borrower must pay. 

However, the lender should not accept less than the borrower has available to pay.

 If ability to pay is costly to monitor, then without monitoring, the lender must demand a constant payment and liquidate if less is paid.

bank?

# Monitoring, Delegation And

Incentives Loan Monitoring by a banker To avoid duplication of effort or a free rider problem, loan monitoring must be delegated to one agent, who turns out to use (debt deposit) contracts that make him a banker.

# Optimal Contract Without Monitoring Is Debt

 Liquidate as a sanction. Borrower, lender risk neutral and the borrower has no other assets or collateral.

 Optimal state contingent contract based on observable payment to lender is to impose the sanction for low payments and not for those greater than or equal to f.

 f is interpreted as the face value of one period debt.

# Two State Example From Last Class

 Borrower has cash of V, with realizations 1 or 1.4.

 Probability that 1.4 is 0.8.

 Realized cash flow, V, is observed only by borrower Borrower can steal or retain any cash not paid to lender.

 Lender requires expected repayment of 1+r=1.05 to make the loan.

Monitoring needed due to uncertainty about the cash known only by borrower Actual cash flow not observed by lenders, who observe only the amount repaid.


Impose Liquidation Monitoring to renegotiate and avoid liquidation can do much better Actual cash flow not observed by lenders, who observe only the amount repaid.

| Impose Liquidation (this rarely happens)                        |                 |

Face=1.09375

# Loan Monitoring

 If a lender incurs a cost k, the lender can monitor the borrower's cash flow.

 The simplest interpretation is that the lender can observe the realized cash flow, V, and if V=1 the lender can unilaterally reduce the face value of debt down to f=1 (this requires the lender to have all the bargaining power to make concessions)

# Costly Monitoring

 Without monitoring, the best contract has value destroyed with probability 0.2.

 Monitoring costs k>0.

 If monitoring costs, k, are less than 0.2 
(assuming the cost must be paid in advance, by establishing a relationship, for example), it will be better to monitor.

With many lenders (N in number), the cost of monitoring is too high (=Nk)

the best contract has no 
monitoring

# Many Small Lenders

 Suppose the loan requires 10,000 lenders (who have $100 and loan amount is in units of $1 Million) due to project scale and monitoring costs  each, monitoring does not pay (total is 
$2 M).

 Want to delegate it to one lender.

 But others will not freely observe what was monitored by the monitor.

# Don'T Monitor The Monitor…

 To avoid duplication of effort, other lenders do not monitor the monitor As a result monitor and borrower might get together, and collude so that the other lenders do not benefit from the monitoring.

 Need to provide incentives for delegated monitoring.

Intermediation Avoids Duplicated Outside Monitoring and Control

Incentives for delegated monitoring: Bank Issues debt with face value B, per loan Liquidate the bank for zero (all get 0) if bank pays out less than B (per loan).

 Monitor/bank has no assets of its own. 

 Gets cash by collecting and negotiating the loan to borrower, with face f.

 When borrower has 1 bank can pay at most 1 then.

 **Monitor be liquidated in same** 
situations as the borrower with unmonitored debt.

# The One Loan Bank Can'T Survive

 A monitor who is liquidated in exactly the same sitiuations (and at the same cost) 
as the borrower who borrowed directly can't survive.

 The costs of liquidation are the same as borrowing direct, and a monitoring cost in incurred.

 But a diversified monitor can implement delegated monitoring.

# The Two Loan Bank

Each investor owed 2B/20,000 = B/10,000

# Diversification: Bank Contracts As Financial Engineering

 Example of "two loan bank." Makes and monitors two loans, to 2 borrowers with independent and identically distributed projects Collects 1+f when only one loan defaults (2f when none default, and 2 when both default).

 Bank fails only when both loans default (with probability (0.2)2=0.04. Reduces chance of penalty or inefficient liquidation

2.1875.

 Collects f when V=1.4, and 1 when V=1.

 1+f=2.19>2B=2.1875. Bank fails only if both default (Prob==0.04).

# All Are Weakly Better Off

 Bank charges 19% (vs 31.25 % for unmonitored)
 Pays 9.375% on deposits (gives depositors a 5% expected rate of return)
 Banker gets (2f-2B) + (1+f-2B)=
 =(2.38-2.1875) + (2.19-2.1875) 
=0.124 > cost of monitoring 
=(2()=0.0004)

# Further Diversification

 As bank becomes well diversified (N∞), it converges to a bank where 80% of loans pay f and 20% pay 1. It (almost) never fails. It just needs to cover its cost of capital (5%) and of monitoring (%).

 Let 1 + 0.05 +  = f +  (1), or f= 1.06275. This allows bank to break even.

 The well diversified bank can make loans at 6.275% and pay 5% on deposits and earn zero profits.

 Can out compete less diversified banks. Can earn profits if not fully competitive.

# Role Of Diversification:

 Diversified banks as original form of 
"Financial Engineering."
 Transform loans that need monitoring into deposits that do not Used in securitization today 
 ("pooling" (diversification) and 
"tranching" (selling off only senior claims)
