- (D) Bankruptcy. Borrower or any Subsidiary shall admit in writing its inability to,  or shall fail generally or be generally unable to,  pay its debts (including its payrolls) as such debts become due,  or shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or Borrower or any Subsidiar y shall file a voluntary petition in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or a petition or answer seeking reorganization,  to effect a plan or other arrangement with creditors or any other relief under the Bankruptcy Code or under any other state or federal law relating to [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or reorganization granting relief to debtors,  whether now or hereafter in effect,  or shall file an answer admitting the jurisdiction of the court and the material allegations of any involuntary petition filed against Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code or any such other state or federal law; or Borrower or any Subsidiary shall be adjudicated a bankrupt,  or shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,  or shall apply for or consent to the appointment of any custodian,  receiver or trustee for all or any substantial part of Borrower's or such Subsidiary's property,  or shall take any action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this subsection; or an involuntary petition seeking any of the relief specified in this subsection shall be filed against Borrower or any Subsidiary and shall not be dismissed within 30 days; or any order for relief shall be entered against Borrower or any Subsidiary in any involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any such other state or federal law.

	 	- (2) fail to perform or observe any term,  covenant or condition on its part to be performed or observed under any agreement or instrument relating to any such Indebtedness,  when required to be performed or observed,  and such failure shall continue after the applicable grace period,  if any,  specified in such agreement or instrument,  if the effect of such failure to perform or observe is to accelerate,  or to permit the acceleration of,  the maturity of such Indebtedness; or any such Indebtedness shall be declared to be due and payable,  or required to be prepaid (other than by a regularly scheduled required prepayment),  prior to the stated maturity thereof.
- (F) Material Adverse Change. A material adverse change in the business,  results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of Borrower shall have occurred which gives reasonable grounds to conclude,  in the reasonable judgment of the Bank,  that Borrower may not,  or will be unable to,  perform or observe in the normal course of its obligations under the Loan Documents.

Any of the Loan Documents,  after delivery thereof,  shall for any reason be revoked or invalidated,  or otherwise cease to be in full force and effect,  or Borrower,  any Subsidiary or any other Person shall contest in any manner the validity or enforceability thereof,  or Borrower,  any Subsidiary or any other Person shall deny that it has any further liability or obligation thereunder.

- (C) exercise any or all of the Bank's rights and remedies under the Loan Documents,  and
- (D) proceed to enforce all other rights and remedies available to the Bank under applicable law. All of the Bank's rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.
