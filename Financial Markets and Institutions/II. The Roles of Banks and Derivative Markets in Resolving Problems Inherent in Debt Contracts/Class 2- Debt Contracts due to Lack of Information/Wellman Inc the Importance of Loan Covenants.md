Wellman Inc.

The Importance of Loan Covenants
Purpose: To understand how banks manage conflicts of interest with management through the use of covenants,  especially when credit quality deteriorates.
 Background Information
Borrower: Wellman Inc.
Business (from 2002 10-K filings) We are principally engaged in the manufacture and marketing of PermaClear® and EcoClear® brand PET resins and high-quality polyester products,  including Fortrel® brand polyester fibers. We believe we are the world's largest PET plastics recycler,  utilizing a significant amount of recycled raw materials in our manufacturing operations. At December 31,  2002,  we had annual operating capacity to manufacture approximately 1.4 billion pounds of PET resins and 0.9 billion pounds of polyester staple fiber at five major production facilities in the United States and Europe. See Item 1. "Business-Recent Developments" for information concerning businesses discontinued in the first quarter of 2002,  and see "Outlook" below for information on our ability to convert certain fiber capacity to PET packaging resins. Our operations are classified into two reportable operating segments: the Packaging Products Group (or PPG) and the Fibers and Recycled Products Group (or FRPG). Our PermaClear® PET and HP® resins are produced by the PPG from purified terephtalic acid (PTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) and EcoClear® PET resins are produced from a combination of chemical and post-consumer recycled raw materials. These resins are primarily used in the manufacture of plastic soft drink bottles and other food and beverage packaging. The FRPG produces Fortrel® fibers,  which are primarily used in apparel,  non-wovens,  home products,  and industrial products. These fibers are also produced from PTA and MEG. In addition,  Fortrel® polyester and nylon for use primarily in furniture,  pillows,  comforters,  industrial products,  carpets and rugs,  are manufactured from recycled PET raw materials,  including post-consumer containers and post-industrial materials.

## Rating Downgrade (From January 2003,  8-K Filing)

On January 8,  2003 Moody's Investor Services (*"Moody's"*) announced that it downgraded its ratings of Wellman,  Inc. (the *"Company"*). The Company's ratings were changed as follows: senior unsecured shelf rating to (P)Ba2 from (P)Baa3 and subordinated shelf rating to (P)Ba3 from (P)Ba1. Moody's announcement further stated that the Company's rating outlook is stable. As a result of this downgrade,  the Company is no longer rated as investment grade by either Moody's or Standards & Poor's. Although the failure to be investment grade will increase our cost of funds and may reduce our access to certain capital markets,  the Company believes that it will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position,  cash flows or results of operations.
