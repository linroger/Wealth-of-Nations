[[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Restructuring Debt]]

# Class Note 4 [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Restructuring Debt]] Outside Bankruptcy
**Course:** [[Financial Markets and Institutions/Financial Markets and Institutions.md|Financial Markets and Institutions]]
**Professor:** Douglas W. Diamond
**Class Note 4:** [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Restructuring Debt]] Outside Bankruptcy

We have seen that because public bondholders cannot make informed concessions outside bankruptcy,  a structure of all public debt will get into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court too often. The reasons are the individual bondholders' lack of information and the U.S. Federal trust indenture act. In practice,  there is almost never a successful vote on these issues on public bond issues in the United States.

All private placement debt with a single lender would avoid this problem. However,  the single bank lender solution is sometimes too expensive because of bank operating costs and reserve requirement type taxes on intermediation. In addition,  for large borrowers,  the single bank lender solution cannot be used because individual banks have a lending limit of 100% (or less) of their capital to a single borrower.

Further,  with only one lender,  that lender may have too much power,  from the borrower's point of view. In practice,  large borrowers have both public and bank debt. We now examine how the inability to renegotiate public debt outside [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] influences the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] decision for borrowers with public and bank debt. There are two lenders: one bank,  one public.

## 1. No Public Debt Concessions At All

The easiest case is when the public can never make a concession. This implies the use of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court and possibly liquidation whenever there is a default. The only party who can make concessions outside [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] is the bank lender. In practice,  the bank loans are short term and senior,  the public is long term and junior to the bank. Later in the course,  we will examine why this is the structure that is commonly used. For now,  we will just look at the structure's implications for [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Restructuring Debt]] outside bankruptcy. If the public never makes a concession,  the bank decides whether to make a concession of its own to stay out of bankruptcy,  or instead to force the borrower into bankruptcy. If the bank forces bankruptcy,  then it is paid from the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeds by its specified priority (it is senior). The bank debt is maturing today and needs to be refinanced. The public debt is long-term,  and matures in the future.

The future ("date 2") value of the firm is 2,  1,  or 0,  with probability $q_2$,  $q_1$,  and $q_0$ respectively. The current going concern value of the firm is then $2q_2 + q_1$.
Let $q_2=0.2$,  $q_1=0.6$,  and $q_0=0.2$. The going concern value $V_{GO}$ is:

$$V_{GO} = 2(0.2) + 0.6(1) = 1.0$$

If the firm gets into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court,  some going-concern value is destroyed. Let $L$ be the value if the firm gets into bankruptcy. This can be interpreted as the value that the firm will sell for if liquidated,  or the value under current management net of direct and indirect costs of bankruptcy.

The face value of maturing bank debt is $B$,  and the face value of public debt (which matures in the future,  on date 2) is $P$.

## Example 1: Going Concern Value May Be Lost

Let the value in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] be $L = 0.4$ (this example holds for all $L$ exceeding 0.26).

The going concern value,  $V_{GO}$,  is 1,  but this can be achieved only if the bank does not force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] now. There are *two ways the firm can avoid bankruptcy*: it can fully repay the bank,  or it can convince the bank to make a concession.

- The bank is owed $B = 0.3$,  and the loan matures today.
- The public is owed $P = 1.6$,  maturing on date 2.
- There is no current interest payment owed to the public (it has already been paid).

If the firm gets into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court,  the firm will be worth only $L = 0.4$. The difference $V_{GO} - L = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$ is the going concern value at risk if no agreement can be reached outside bankruptcy.

- Suppose that the bank extends the maturity of its loan to date 2 and keeps the face value equal to $0.3$.
  - It is senior and gets paid $0.3$ when the firm is worth $1$ or $2$.
  - Therefore,  it will get $0.3$ with a probability of $0.8$,  and the claim is worth $0.8(0.3) = 0.24$.

However,  the bank would not accept this because it can get paid in full by forcing bankruptcy (it is senior,  and $L$ exceeds $B$). There is a third option: to extend maturity and increase the face value of the debt (increase the interest rate). However,  the existence of the public debt limits how much the bank can obtain by increasing the face value. The public debt has a covenant that prohibits issuing future debt that is senior to it (sometimes called a "me first" rule). Although the bank debt is senior to the public debt,  the me first rule limits the part of the future cash that can go to the bank.

- The bank has a senior claim of $B = 0.3$,  and the public has a claim on $P = 1.6$.
- Any new claims that the borrower issues (to the bank or to other lenders) must be junior to the public.
  - This implies that the most the bank can receive from the borrower at date 2 is $0.4$.
  - It can get $0.3$ by extending the maturity of the senior claim that it already has.
  - Any other claim would be junior to the public.

The public's claim of $1.6$,  plus the bank's senior claim of $0.3$,  adds up to $1.9$. The maximum value of the firm is $2$,  implying that at most an additional $2 - 1.9 = 0.1$ can be paid to the bank. This $0.1$,  plus the $0.3$ senior claim,  adds up to $0.4$.

If the bank took this junior claim on $0.1$ in addition to its senior claim on $0.3$,  its payoff would be as follows:

- If the firm is worth $1$,  it would get $0.3$ (because its junior claim would be worthless).
- If the firm is worth $2$,  it would get $0.4$. The expected value of its claim is then:

$$0.2(0.4) + 0.6(0.3) = 0.26$$

Because the bank can get $B = 0.3$ (which is more than $0.26$) from forcing bankruptcy,  it will force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and destroy the going concern value.

The public can make no concessions. Therefore,  the public cannot prevent the bank from forcing bankruptcy,  and the going concern value will be destroyed.

## Example 2: Maybe Going Concern Value Will Be Preserved

### Example 2a: Even More Going Concern Value at Risk

Keep everything from the first example,  except make [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] even more inefficient. Let the value of the firm in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] be $L = 0.2$. Now the bank will not force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] because the value of extending maturity and taking the junior claim of $0.1$ is worth $0.26$ (see above),  which is worth more than $0.2$.

Suppose [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] is even more inefficient,  and $L = 0$. Then the bank would never force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] when making a concession gives it something in the future.

### Example 2b: Less Public Debt,  but Same Total Debt (This Puts the Bank at Sufficient Risk)

Keep everything from example 1,  except let the amount of bank debt be $B = 0.5$ and the amount of public debt be $P = 1.4$. Note that $L = 0.4$. The amount of total debt is still $1.9$,  but less of it is public debt. The public makes no concessions.

- The bank can force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and get $L = 0.4$ (because the bank is senior).
- Alternatively,  it can extend maturity on its senior claim on $0.5$ to date 2 and take an additional claim junior to the public. This junior claim is worth at most $0.1$ ($2 - 1.9$),  as in example 1.
- The value of the bank's claim if it does not force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] is as follows:
  - If the firm is worth $1$,  it receives $0.5$.
  - If the firm is worth $2$,  it receives $0.6$ ($0.5 + 0.1$).
  - The expected value of the bank's claim is:

$$0.2(0.6) + 0.6(0.5) = 0.42$$

This exceeds the $0.4$ that the bank gets in bankruptcy.

What matters is the value at risk from going into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] relative to the amount of public debt. It is not just the size of the value at risk. If the amount of public debt is large relative to the value at risk,  then the value at risk will be destroyed.

In the next class note,  we examine [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] of one public debt issue for another as a way of forcing concessions by the public.
