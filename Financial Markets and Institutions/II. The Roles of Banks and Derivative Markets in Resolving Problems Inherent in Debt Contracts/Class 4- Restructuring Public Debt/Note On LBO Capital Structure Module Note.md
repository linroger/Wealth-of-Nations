# Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note

[[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts]] ([[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]]) are characterized by a high degree of debt ("leverage"). **Exhibit 1** and Exhibit 2 show that over the past decade LBO debt was between 50-70% of total funding sources,  and debt-to-EBITDA was between 3.2x–6.3x.

The specifics of each capital structure vary case by case; however,  in any given year,  there is a great deal of similarity in the buyouts capital structure. These similarities exist because debt structure is mainly determined by the deal size and market conditions.a While smaller buyouts typically have simple capital structures and are primarily funded by banks,  larger amounts of debt are typically financed by pooling multiple sources of institutional capital. (**Exhibit 3** summarizes the mapping between sources of capital and the layers of capital structure.)

This note focuses on the debt structure of larger buyouts at the deal closing.b However,  apart from debt,  every LBO includes common equity and often equity-like facilities such as preferred equity. Equity holds the most junior position in the capital structure and has the residual claim on all of the firm's cash flows.

## Types Of Debt

For a typical LBO,  debt can be divided in two broad layers:

- senior secured debt and
- junior debt.
Senior secured debt holds the first claim in case of a liquidation of the company,  before junior debt.

As shown in **Exhibit** 2,  senior debt-to-EBITDA levels range between 2.4x–5.6x and junior debt-toEBITDA levels are between 0.2x–2.1x for large and middle-market [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] over time.c Within each of these debt layers there are notable sub-categories that are discussed below.

## 1. Asset-Backed Loans

Asset-backed loans (ABLs) and leveraged loans are the most senior claims in the capital structure.

They are both senior secured debt,  the difference between these loans is the type of collateral. Assetbacked lending is focused on the liquidation value of the collateral and in that sense they are similar to a mortgage or car loan. The most frequent users of ABLs are manufacturers,  distributers,  and retailers. Firms owning unpledged real estate,  credit cards receivable,  heavy machinery or any other type of relatively liquid assets would typically get an ABL before any other form of financing.

(Similarly,  an individual who wants to finance a small business might get better terms on a homeequity loan than a business loan.) Since ABLs rely on the value and quality of the underlying collateral,  ABL lenders need a dedicated infrastructure to track collateral value and its movement over time. Historically ABLs were predominantly issued by banks and financial companies. For this reason,  ABLs and leveraged loans share several characteristics such as their private nature and floating-rate pricing structure (more on this below). Because of the nature of collateral,  ABLs have simple covenant structure. ABL lenders mainly want to ensure that a safety margin remains,  so ABL [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] tend to include a fixed-charge ratio,  which measures borrower's ability to pay fixed financing expenses.

## 2. [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/Note on the Leveraged Loan Market|Leveraged Loans]]

As an ABL,  a leveraged loan is typically senior secured debt. But contrary to an ABL,  a leveraged loan is cash-flow based,  that is,  its credit quality is primarily determined by the cash-flow generation ability of the company and not by the value of the collateral. While a lien to collateral is frequently added to leveraged loans to make them secured,  the quality and market liquidity of collateral are much harder to assess and therefore are typically less of a focus point than with ABLs.

## Senior Secured Debt

In addition to being senior secured debt,  there are a few other differentiating factors that set leveraged loans apart as a separate asset class. In contrast to most forms of junior debt,  leveraged loans are private and not public debt. Companies issuing leveraged loans,  have a close relationship with at least one leading bank. Private relationships allow for the frequent exchange of confidential information.d Given limited and concentrated ownership of loans,  this information is often used to renegotiate the contract terms. Since loans can be renegotiated,  they typically have a tight covenant structure. (In absence of a renegotiation mechanism,  a tight covenant structure would lead to frequent defaults; whereas,  a breach of a covenant is just a technical default which rarely leads to an actual default.) For example,  leveraged loans often include a set of financial [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] that are required to be maintained over the life of the loan; albeit,  the strictness of the covenant structure and its enforcement tend to be significantly weaker in booming markets.

Another differentiating characteristic of leveraged loans is its pricing. Unlike public bonds,  loans are variable-rate instruments commonly priced at a fixed spread over a floating base rate. The mostfrequently used base rate in the U.S. is the dollar-based London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),

while in Europe it is euro-based EURIBOR. **Exhibit** 4 shows historic values of base rates. Finally,  loans are characterized by being callable (i.e.,  they can be prepaid at any time),  typically at no prepayment penalty.

A leveraged loan package can contain several facilities.e As with capital structure more broadly,  the structure of the loan package depends on the deal size and market conditions. Small and medium-sized leveraged loans,  like the ones backing middle-market transactions,  tend to be funded by one or a few banks. Loan financing backing a large LBO would typically include a revolving line,  an amortizing term loan (together these are called "pro-rata" tranche),  and term facilities syndicated to institutional investors (including collateralized loan obligations (Close),  hedge funds,  mutual funds,  and insurance companies).

## 2.1 Pro-Rata Tranche

The "pro-rata" tranche is comprised of facilities syndicated primarily to banks. This typically includes a revolving credit facility (RCF) and an amortizing term loan (TLa). A term loan is an installment loan,  drawn at issuance for a specific purpose and canceled once it is repaid. An RCF acts like a corporate credit carda company can draw down on its RCF and pay back multiple times based on its needs up until the maturity of the line.f RCF borrowers are charged a commitment fee for amounts not drawn down with the spread on the drawn portion of the line matching the spread on a TLa.g Whereas term loan facilities are the core part of the financing of the buyout,  RCFs are often used for working capital and periodic capital expenditure needs.

Pricing of the pro-rata tranche factors in the broader customer relationship and the associated revenue stream. According to Ivashina and Kovner (2011),  LBO firms' repeated interactions with banks create the opportunity to reduce the borrowing costs and improve the contractual terms more broadly. LBO firms that are roughly in the top 15% of the bank's repeat clients with cross-selling potential have over 17 basis point lower spread and 0.38 point higher maximum debt-to-EBITDA.

From the private equity prospective,  this could translate to a potential increase in equity returns of 4% to 9% (on a non-risk adjusted basis).h

## 2.2 Institutional Tranche

At least in the past ten years,  the largest part of the leverage loan backing an LBO was the institutional tranche. In 2006 and 2007,  the peak of the leveraged loan cycle,  institutional tranche on average was between 75%-80% of the loan package. (**Exhibit 5** shows the breakdown between the different leveraged loan facilities.) The institutional debt tranche can include a term loan (TLb) and a second-lien facility,  which is a term loan with a junior claim on the collateral. Institutional facilities are structured to mimic bonds so they tend to have bullet payments,  without the amortization

 Second-lien loans are part of the senior secured loans,  however they have junior claim to the collateral ("lien") backing the transaction. Being a riskier position,  second-lien loans are priced at a premium to first-lien loans,  see **Exhibit** 6. The spread differential ranges from 200 bps at a minimum to over 1,  000 bps in select cases. Second-lien loans tend to appear in buoyant capital markets (when there is higher tolerance for risk among investors) and disappear again in a downturn. For example,  in the period post-2008 almost no new second-lien loans were issued.

The institutional tranche sometimes also includes a delay-draw special purpose facility such as acquisition lines. A special purpose facility is a credit which can be drawn down over a certain period for a specific purpose—for example to fund an acquisition. In contrast to RCFs,  special purpose facilities are not revolving and once drawn they are equivalent to a traditional term loan.

4 schedule which characterizes TLas.iIn the leveraged loan market boom years before 2008,  as the deals became larger and more levered TLc and even TLd loans were commonly issued. (TLc and TLd loans share the same seniority as TLb loans,  but have a longer maturity which further stretches the capital structure.) However,  this practice has largely disappeared.

Given that all first-lien tranches have the same seniority and claim over the collateral,  the pricing of the institutional tranche is similar to the pricing of the pro-rata tranche. (See **Exhibit** 7.) However,  the spread on the "B" tranche tends to be more volatile than the spread on the pro-rata tranches. Whereas,  given the credit risk of the loan,  the pro-rata spread is mainly driven by long-term regulatory bank requirements,  and TLb terms are driven by market conditions,  compressing when institutional investors' appetite for leveraged loans is high. According to Ivashina and Sun (2011),  at the peak of the leveraged loan boom,  institutional tranches of the same seniority were priced roughly 50 basis points below pro-rata tranches.j

## Junior Debt

Junior debt is a broad layer of the capital structure which is junior to senior secured debt,  but senior to equity. Typically these are unsecured classes,  which means these classes have claim on the assets of the firm that is junior to senior secured classes. Similar to a leveraged loan,  it groups multiple sub-categories of debt. The important difference is that components of the junior debt are typically stand-alone issues: they are completely independent contracts,  with different maturities,  terms and pricing.

## 1. High-Yield Public Bonds And Notes

High-yield bonds form a long-established asset class in the U.S.,  and are becoming increasingly popular in Europe and other markets. As **Exhibit 8** illustrates,  public bonds have been a particularly important source of financing in the U.S. and Europe since the collapse of securitization in 2007,  followed by the severe contraction of the leveraged loan market in 2008. In 2012,  a record $358 billion was raised in the bond market in the U.S.,  corresponding to nearly 3,  000 different bond issues.

Although the scale is significantly smaller,  bond issuance in Europe was following a similar pattern reaching $95 billion and over 350 different issues in 2012.

High-yield bonds—commonly called "junk bonds"—are relatively risky instruments rated as noninvestment grade. Bonds can be placed through a public or private offering. Public placements are mostly used in large buyouts because they require a minimum size to justify the fixed costs,  which in the U.S. includes registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).k. "Notes" and

"bonds" are overall very similar fixed income instruments,  but notes are registered under the SEC Rule 415 ("the shelf registration"),  which means that several notes issues can be offered over time under the same prospectus. Consequently,  individual note issues tend to be smaller than bond issues.

There are several characteristics that are specific to high-yield bonds. First,  bonds historically had a much wider investor base which includes retail investors. In contrast to loans,  all bonds are subject to the Securities Act of 1933. Thus,  firms issuing bonds have to comply with the Regulation Fair Disclosure ("Reg FD"). This means that there can be no private exchange of information between the firm and the bond holders even when the placement was private. The public nature of the bonds impacts their covenant structure. In particular,  bond indentures typically only include incurrence [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] which are only tested when the issuer takes a particular action,  such as issuing new debt,  selling assets or completing a large acquisition. This is largely rooted in the fact that bonds are hard to renegotiate due to the costs of coordination among their investors and lack of additional information about the company.

Bonds typically have longer maturity than leveraged loans,  with the average maturity around 8-10 years (as compared to 5-6 years for leveraged loans). In contrast to leveraged loans,  bonds are usually not callable for up to half of their term. Once they become callable,  the call premiums are levied. In terms of pricing,  high-yield bonds—and especially bonds offered through a public placement—tend to be standardized with a fixed cash coupon rate and bond repayment at the end of the maturity.

l Depending on the market conditions,  some characteristics can change over time. For example,  the fixed cash rate is sometimes (partially) replaced with a non-cash payment-in-kind (PIK) rate. Of course,  the bond yields also depend heavily on the market conditions. (See **Exhibit 9**.)

## 2. Mezzanine

Mezzanine financing is a less well-defined part of the LBO capital structure,  used opportunistically as a residual part of the financing package. As the name suggests,  mezzanine is a layer of financing between senior debt and equity. Historically,  mezzanine was predominantly used in Europe as junior debt because of the less active high-yield bond market. In the U.S.,  it was used as the only available subordinated debt source in smaller transactions,  where high-yield bonds were unavailable.

Typically,  mezzanine financing is privately negotiated and placed,  and as such,  tends to have custom-made terms. The private context allows for tailoring mezzanine terms to specific situations,  which is an attractive feature for private equity transactions. It is standard for mezzanine [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] to be similar to those of leveraged loans. Mezzanine typically has no-call provisions; however,  those provisions are usually less strict than they are for high-yield bonds.

As indicated in **Exhibit 3**,  mezzanine was usually provided by one investor,  often a specialized private debt fund,  which makes mezzanine (and its variants) a non-liquid form of debt. The category of mezzanine has broadened over time as more investors were attracted to this asset class. One important type of a mezzanine financing that emerged was the "unitranche debt". Unitranche is an instrument with blended characteristics of a senior term loan and junior debt. It is meant to serve as a one-size-fits-all-investors solution,  replacing both senior debt and junior debt with one instrument.

## Geographic Differences: U.S. Versus Europe

As illustrated in **Exhibit 8**,  there are important differences between the U.S. and Europe in terms of LBO debt financing. U.S. LBO capital structures rely more on public markets (or quasi-public markets) as sources of capital. European structures rely more on banks for their financing needs,  which has to do with the historical development of the debt markets in each region. This explains several differences between U.S. and European capital structures,  including the higher prevalence of TLb and high-yield bonds in the U.S.,  versus a higher share of TLa,  mezzanine and other private junior debt in Europe.

Reasons for different development of the debt markets in the U.S. and Europe have to do with the legal and regulatory environment and the historic importance of regional commercial banks in Europe. In particular,  the U.S. and Europe have different [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and financial regulations. For example,  Chapter 11 [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] regulation in the U.S. is focused on restructuring companies through a public in-court process,  whereas most bankruptcies in Europe are still focused on either liquidation or an out-of-court private settlement. Because of these differences,  junior debtors typically have a weaker voice in European restructurings,  as restructuring deals are either worked out privately between senior lenders and the debtor or companies are liquidated according to a strict priority rule,  giving the junior public lenders limited control over the process.

As to the historic importance of regional banks in Europe,  factors such as different currencies,  different languages and national regulations in Europe,  made it difficult for pan-European institutional investors to accurately assess risks and directly provide credit to companies across Europe. Instead,  this situation provided regional banks with an advantage over institutional investors,  as regional banks were focused on dealing with regional differences. While several drivers,  including the introduction of the common Euro-currency,  provided a boost to eliminating regional differences,  many remain. However,  the differences between the U.S. and Europe are not static. The convergence between the two regions is facilitated by the globalization of firms and financial sources. Large companies are increasingly able to fund themselves abroad. Also the increasing presence of global banks is a reality which drives convergence of financing markets.

 - a. Other factors beyond deal size and market conditions driving the capital structure composition include: desired speed and certainty of closure (debt is usually slower than equity and requires involvement of third parties),  desired prudence (maximizing leverage levels makes a company vulnerable to downturns),  and post-closure plans (companies which plan to invest heavily are generally less able to support high levels of leverage). So,  while uncommon,  there exist large deals which are entirely equity-financed,  without debt facilities. Apax Partners' 2009 LBO of Bankrate is one example of such deals.
- b. Note that the capital structure changes through the life of the buyout influenced by market conditions,  firm's fundamentals,  and private equity exit strategy.
- c. While no industry-wide definition exists,  small buyouts are defined in this note as having an enterprise value (EV) of USD/EUR < 25 million,  large buyouts as having an EV of USD/EUR > 500 million,  and middle-market transactions lie in between.
 - d. The use of private information and simultaneous syndication to an institutional base is a controversial topic. On the one hand,  any material renegotiation requires a unanimous vote and use of information disclosed under confidentiality agreement. On the other hand,  many of the institutional investors holding loans also trade on the public side. Ivashina,  Victoria,  and Zheng Sun,  2011,  "Institutional Stock Trading on Loan Market Information." *Journal of Financial Economics* 100 (2) provide a detailed investigation of this subject.
- e. Loan facilities are also sometimes called "loan tranches". However,  "tranche" is a generic name and can be used in different contexts (e.g.,  "pro-rata tranche"),  whereas "facility" has a very concrete meaning. Also the word "loan" tends to be used loosely. "Term loan" actually refers to a facility within a loan package; such facility however is not an independent contract and this has several important implications for loan repayment,  renegotiation and restructuring.
- f. RCFs are typically provided by banks because often they remain undrawn. Few investors are able to deal with the cost associated with [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity management]] brought by undrawn RCFs. However,  due to the size of their loan portfolio and deposits,  banks can diversify this liquidity risk.
- g. In general,  any tranche with the same effective seniority would have the same spread. h Ivashina,  Victoria,  and Anna Kovner,  2011,  "The Private Equity Advantage: Leveraged Buyout Firms and Relationship Banking,  " *Review of Financial Studies* 24(7).
- i. "Bullet" means that no repayments of the principal amount occur until maturity. Bullet loans carry higher risk than amortized loans.
- j. Ivashina,  Victoria,  and Zheng Sun,  2011,  "Institutional Demand Pressure and the Cost of Corporate Loans,  " *Journal of Financial* Economics 99(3).
- k. A generally accepted minimum size threshold for high-yield bond issues is $150 million,  but smaller issues do appear sporadically.
- l. Although less popular,  bonds can have a floating cash rate instead of a fixed rate. Such bonds are called floating-rate notes (FRNs) or "floaters".
- Pricing of mezzanine is commonly based on a floating base rate,  plus spread basis. Regularly,  the cash-interest component of mezzanine is supplemented with a PIK component.
- m. Additionally,  the terms of mezzanine debt can be sweetened with warrants,  allowing the mezzanine investors to coshare in a possible equity upside of the private equity investor.
- m. Payment-in-kind (PIK) is the term used for interest which is not paid in cash but rolled-up into an existing debt facility.

# Appendix: Glossary Of Often-Used LBO Capital Structure Terms

 *Amend and Extend (A&E)*: Is a loan amendment that allows a company to extend its debt maturities,  typically in exchange for a fee and an increase in spread. This type of amendment became popular in 2009.

 *Club Deal*: This is a smaller syndicated loan,  which is only distributed among a group of relationship lenders,  usually banks. Club Deals are common forms of financing for debt facilities of $50-$150 million (maximum of up to $300 million) in the U.S. and in Europe.

 *Collateralized loan obligations (Close)*: Close are special-purpose vehicles which are set up to hold and manage pools of leveraged loans.

 *Market Flex*: Depending on the investor demand,  loan spread can be adjusted ("flexed") in the process of the loan syndication within specified limits. When the demand is lower than expected,  more investors can be enticed to invest in the credit if spreads are increased or
"flexed up". If the loan is oversubscribed,  the spread would be automatically "flexed down".

 *Staple Financing*: This is a pre-arranged financing package added ("stapled") to an acquisition target. Typically the M&A advisor of the selling party offers the staple financing to the bidders in an acquisition. Staple financing ensures that the bidders have the financial capacity to complete the deal. It also provides indications for the leverage and pricing terms. Finally,  staple financing also allows the M&A advisors to "double dip" in both advisory fees to the seller and lending fees to the buyer.

 *Structural Subordination*: This is a fundamental concept in debt financing which states that a lender to a parent ("HoldCo" or "BidCo") does not have access to the assets of a subsidiary until after all of the subsidiary's lenders have been reimbursed and the remaining assets have been transferred to the parent as an equity holder. Together with contractual subordination,  the concept where senior lenders have priority over junior lenders in terms of debt issued to the same company,  structural subordination guides the priority of claims of creditors over a parent-with-subsidiaries organization.

 *Toggle*: A toggle is a feature that comes with certain forms of debt and which allows the issuing company to switch off any cash-pay element and convert all interest payments to payment-in-kind (PIK) without consulting the lending group. The PIK interest rate is usually higher than the cash interest rate,  therefore the issuing company is incentivized to pay cash when possible. All deferred payments must be settled by the maturity date of the debt.

 *Yield-to-maturity (YTM)*: This is the rate of return expected on a debt instrument if it is held until maturity. The calculation of YTM takes into account the current market price of the debt instrument (which can be below,  at or above par),  par value (which will be repaid at maturity),  time to maturity and coupon interest. YTM only equals the coupon interest rate when the bond trades at par.
