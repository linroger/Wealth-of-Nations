# Class Note 6-Restructuring public debt out of bankruptcy
### Class Note 6: Restructuring public debt out of bankruptcy

Exchange Offers Includes Note 6A: Coercive exchange offers and exit consents at the end

The primary way that borrowers and banks try to get concessions from the public is to get the public to exchange their bond for one that requires a smaller payment (i.e.,  either a principal,  interest or maturity concession). Although the Federal Trust Indenture Act prohibits such concessions by voting,  it does not prohibit exchange offers.

Because the public consists of many small holders,  each holder may assume that he is so small that his decision to tender his bond for exchange will not influence the outcome of the exchange offer. As a result,  each decides by comparing the value of the new security with the value of the old security that is expected to prevail after the exchange offer. This evaluation of the future value is made by making a forecast of how much of the issue will be exchanged by other holders

### Example 3: Public exchanges for junior securities tend to fail

Keep everything from example 1: going concern value of $V_{\mathrm{GO}}=1$,  bankruptcy value of $L=0.4$.The Bank is owed $B=0.3$ and the Public is owed $P=1.6$ The public is junior and long-term. If the public does not make a concession,  we saw in example 1 that the bank will force bankruptcy,  and the public will then get L- $\mathbf{B}=0.4-0.3=0.1$.Suppose that the public is offered the chance to exchange for a bond with face $P'=1$ and the bank agrees not to force bankruptcy if the exchange succeeds. Suppose that the offer succeeds if $99\%$ of the bonds are exchanged.Let "f" denote the fraction of the total bond issue that you expect to be exchanged by other holders

The key point in this example is to look at the case where the new bonds (with face $P^{\prime}=I$) are junior to the old bonds with face $P=1.6$.The bank's claim of 0.3 remains senior to the public.

Suppose that you own $1\%$ of the old bonds,  with face value 0.016. Your return from tendering of holding out depends on whether you expect the exchange offer to succeed in keeping the firm out of bankruptcy,  1.

Suppose that you expect the offer to succeed,  for example because every other holder tenders,  and $f=0.99$.You choose between tendering and"holding out"by not tendering

A.To determine what you get if you tender,  do the following calculation.If you tender,  then all are tendered. Your new bond is paid ($1\%$ of) 1 when the firm is worth 2,  and worth ($1\%$ of) 1-0.3=0.7 when the firm is worth 1 (this is because the bank has a senior claim on 0.3). The expected value of this claim is ($1\%$ of) 0.2(1)+0.6(0.7)=0.62. $1\%$ of0.62 is 0.0062

B.If,  instead,  you hold out and refuse to tender the bond,  the offer will still succeed (because only $99\%$ is needed).Then your bond is senior to the public bonds that tender: you will get paid before those that tender when the firm is worth 1. The bank is first paid 0.3,  leaving 1-0.3=0.7. This means you are paid the full face value of 0.016 if you hold out instead of exchanging. You receive 0.016 when the firm is worth 1 and when it is worth 2: as a holdout,  you receive 0.016 with probability 0.8,  an expected value of 0.0128. This exceeds the 0.0062 that you get from tendering your bond

Therefore,  if you expect the exchange offer to succeed you will not tender because your claim will be worth more if you hold out!If all bondholders expect the offer to succeed,  none of them will tender. A prophesy that the offer will succeed is not self-fulfilling!

2.Consider the case where you expect the exchange offer to fail (less than $98\%$ of bonds exchanged: f<0.98).If the offer fails,  the bank will force bankruptcy.The firm will then be worth $L=0.4$ After the bank is paid its 0.3,  there remains 0.1 to be divided among the public.

If you hold out,  and so does everyone else,  you get $1\%$ of 0.1. If you hold out and anyone exchanges you get more than $1\%$ of 0.1,  because the holdouts are senior and are paid first. If more than $93.75\%$ exchange (f>0.9375),  the holdouts (who are senior) get paid in full (then 1-f<0.0625,  and $6.25\%$ of 1.6= 0.1).

If you exchange,  you get nothing if less than $93.75\%$ of the others exchange; holding out dominates this. If more than $93.75\%$ exchange,  the holdouts get paid in full,  and if you exchange for a reduced face value you do not,  implying that you prefer to hold out.

No matter what fraction of others you expect to exchange,  you prefer to hold out. One is always worse off with a junior claim with lower face value,  so here you would still not tender.

Exchange offers for junior securities with lower face value will always fail if aimed at small holders The small holders each expect that their decision to exchange will not tip the balance between the offer succeeding (staying out of bankruptcy) and failing (going into bankruptcy). In the example,  you do not influence success unless you expect more than $98\%$ but less than $99\%$ ofothers to exchange.If you do not tip the balance,  you never prefer a new bond with lower face value and lower priority,  because it is. never worth more than the old bond.

If,  instead,  the bonds you exchange for are equal in priority to the original bonds,  the same arguments apply. If the offer succeeds,  or if it does not,  you are better off with an equal priority claim of higher promised payment (which you get by holding out and not tendering),  because when there is equal priority the payment is proportional to the amount promised. You would only tender for a junior security if you though that your bond would tip the balance between the bank forcing bankruptcy and not forcing bankruptcy.

Example 4:Public exchanges for Senior securities are more successful,  if allowed

Keep everything from the last example,  except let the bonds with face $P'=1$ offered to thepublic in exchange for their bonds with face $P=1.6$ be senior to the original 1.6 bonds.This means that if you exchange for the new bond,  you will be paid prior to those who hold out. This added priority is not relevant when the firm is worth 0 (all bonds are worthless) or when the firm is worth 2 (both the bonds with face $P=1.6$ and those with $P'=1$ are paid in full). The added priority is useful when the firm is worth 1.I now examine the relative value of senior bonds with $P'=1$ and junior bonds with face $P=1.6$ when the firm is worth 1.

As before,  suppose that you own $1\%$ of the bonds,  and you expect all of the other bonds to tender (f=0.99) 0.If you tender,  all of the bonds are tendered,  and you get $1\%$ of $1-B=1-0.3=0.7$,  or0.007. Your expected return from tendering is then ($1\%$ of) $\mathbf{q}_{2}\mathbf{P}^{\prime}+\mathbf{q}_{1}(1-\mathbf{B})=(1\%$ of) $0.2(1)+0.6(0.7)=(1\%$ of) 0.62 This is 0.0062

If you hold out,  then those who tender are senior to you. When the firm is worth 1,  the public as a whole gets lB= 1-. 3=. 7.There are bonds with face value of $(99\%$ of) 1,  senior to you,  they are owed 0.99,  but get only 0.7. Therefore,  as a holdout you will get nothing when the firm is worth 1.

By holding out,  you will get $P=1.6$ when the firm is worth 2,  and nothing otherwise. Your expected payment from holding out is then ($1\%$ of) $q_1P=(1\%$ of) 0.2(1.6),  or 0.0032. This is less than the 0.0062 that you obtain from exchanging your bond.Therefore if you expect the offer to succeed,  you exchange.A prophesy that the offer to exchange will succeed is self-fulfilling

When the new security offered in exchange is senior to the old,  there is a lower payment received by the old security whenever the new one is not paid in full. This is in contrast to the case where the new security is junior,  and the old one gets more than the new whenever the new is not paid in full. This makes small holders willing to join in the bond exchange. Exchanging for a senior security can put the bondholders in a rush to exchange to jump ahead of the holdouts. I will later show that rushing to exchange for something senior is very similar to a bank run.

Now consider what happens when the offer is expected to fail (less than $98\%$ of the bonds are tendered: f<0.98). If the exchange offer is expected to fail (leading to bankruptcy),  you will want to exchange. The reason follows.If you exchange you divide L-B (=0.4-0.3=0.1) with the others who exchange (a positive number).For example,  if others representing less than $9\%$ exchange,  and you exchange too (a total of $10\%$ or less exchange),  then those who exchange are paid in full (because those who exchange and are senior are owed less than 0.1). You get $1\%$ of 1=0.01 if you exchange. If you hold out,  those who exchange get paid first,  and you divide LBf$P^{\prime }$=. 1f among the other holdouts (unless f>0.1 and this is a negative number,  and holdouts get nothing). The other holdouts represent a fraction 1-f of the bond issue,  and you represent a fraction 0.01. If you hold out,  you then get a fraction 0.01/(1-f) of LBf$P^{\prime }$=. 1f.If $f=0$,  this is exactly 0.001 ($1\%$ of 0.1),  and it is less than 0.001 for all greater values of f. Therefore,  you will exchange. If you expect that f will exceed 0.1,  you get nothing if you hold out,  and something positive if you exchange. For all values of f,  you are better off exchanging

An exit consent vote is one where a change in covenants is combined with an exchange offerwhere a new bon
dis givenin exchangefor theoldbond if and onlyif onevotes to change the covenants in the old.As a result,  those who are exiting the old bond are the ones choosing to change its covenants. If a holder prefers the new bond given his or her belief that the vote will pass,  any reduction in the value of the old bond will not matter (because he or she will hold the new bond).

Suppose there is an exit consent vote that will pass if $M+1$ bondholders vote yes and tender their bond in exchange for a new one. The deal is structured so that you may only get the new bond if you vote to change the covenants in the old bond to make it drop in value. If fewer than M other holders tender,  $y$ ou can't makeit pass,  if $M+1$ or more tender,  it passes no matter what you do.

Value of bond as it stands=B

Value of new bond that you get if you tender,  vote yes and the vote passes: $B_{\mathrm{n}}$

Value of old bond if the consent vote passes (some covenants are removed): B

Payment for consent vote,  in addition to new bond =p.This is called the consent payment.

If you hold it all the issue,  you compare $p+B_n$ to B.

There are N old bondholders,  it passes if $M+1$ holders accept the new bond and vote to change the covenant.

If you expect less than M to accept,  you expect to have the tender fail,  and even if you tender you get the old bond back. As a result,  you get B no matter what. It does not matter if you tender or not.

If you hold the bond and expect more than $M+1$ to accept and tender their bonds,  you get $B^{\prime}$ if you keep the old bond,  and $p+B_n$ if you take the new one.Call this expecting the consent vote to succeed

If you expect the consent vote to succeed,  you will tender if and only if $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{B} _{\mathrm{n} }> \mathbf{B} ^{\prime }$

This might be coercive,  if the old bond drops in value by more than the cash payment $(\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{B} _{\mathrm{n} }< \mathbf{B})$

You would tenderhere,  even thoughyou would notif you owned the total bond issue.That is if $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{B} _{\mathrm{n} }< \mathbf{B}$ while $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{B} _{\mathrm{n} }> \mathbf{B}$

Example 1. Suppose there was no trust indenture act,  and the exit consent vote was to set the principal and interest of the old bond to zero:that is $B'=0$.Suppose that there is noconsent payment,  $p=0$.And suppose that you expect the consent vote to succeed,  you tender if $\mathbf{p} + \mathbf{B} _{\mathrm{n} }$ $>B^{\prime}$,  which is $B_{\mathrm{n}}>0$.You will take a bond worth a penny if you expect the old bond to be made worthless. Perhaps this is the scenario that made them pass the trust indenture act!

Example 2 If there are no covenant changes in the old bond,  the consent payment is zero,  and the new bond is junior to the old bond and has a lower face value,  as in class note 4.Here the offer will fail because the newbond is worthless than the old bondwillbe worth if others exchange their bonds: $B_{\mathrm{n}}<B^{\prime}$

Example 3If there are no other covenant changes in the old bond,  the consent payment is zero,  and the newbondis senior to the old bond and has a lower face value,  as inclass note 4 then it is possible that the offer will succeed. The reason is that $B_{\mathrm{n}}$ may exceed B'. In the example in note 4,  exchanging the old bond with face $P=1.6$ for a new bond with face value $P^{\prime }$= 1 resulted in success.

Suppose you own 1/100 of the old bond,  with face value 0.016,  you are offered a new senior bond with face value0.01.If you expect everyone else to take the newbond,  we saw that their face value of 0.99 will be senior to you,  and you get zero unless the firm is worth 2 in the future.

The value of the old bond,  B',  drops to 0.2(0.016) +0.8 +0.8 +0.8 (0)=0.0032

The new bond is worth $\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{n}}=0.2(0.01)+0.6(1-B)/100+0.2(0)=0.2(0.1)+0.6(0.007)=$ 0.0062. Thus the newbond is of higher value

If the new seniorbond had a smaller face value of $P^{\prime }$= 0. 5,  the offer would fail,  because it would not reduce the payment to the old junior bond in the case where $V=1$ The new bond with face value $P'=0.5$ is small enough that it will be paid in full when $V=1$ as well as $V=2$,  because there is 0.7 left when $V=1$ after the bank takes 0.3. More importantly,  it allows the old (junior) bond to be fully repaid when $V=1$

Your 1/100part of the new bond hasface value $P^{\prime }$= 0. 005 and would be worth $\mathbf{B}_{\mathrm{n}}=0.2(0.005)+0.6(0.005)+0.2(0)=0.8(0.005)=0.004$

The old bond with face value 0.016would be paid in full when $V=2$ and when $V=1$ because there is 0.7 left after the bank,  and 0.99(0.5)=0.495 of debt is senior to you $99\%$ are assumed to take the 0.5 face value senior bond). This leaves 0.7-0.495=0.205>0.016 to pay your bond,  so the value of the old bond is: B' = 0.2 $B^{\prime }$= 0. 2 $\mathbf{B} ^{\prime }= 0. 2$ (0.016)+0.6(0.016)+0.2(0)=0.0128.The loss of priority does not reduce the value of the old bond here

Think of the extreme case where the new bond had zero face value.A bond with face value zero does not causes pain by coming in senior to you! In that case $B_{\mathrm{n}}=0$ and $B^{\prime}=B$
