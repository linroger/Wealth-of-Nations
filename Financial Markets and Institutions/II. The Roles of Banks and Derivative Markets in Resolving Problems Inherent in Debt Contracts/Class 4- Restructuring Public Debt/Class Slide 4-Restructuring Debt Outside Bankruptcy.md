# Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy

## Bank Debt along with Public Debt

- When public bondholders cannot make concessions outside bankruptcy,  a structure of all public debt will get into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court too often.
 - No public concessions due to the lack of information and the U.s. Federal trust indenture act.
 - What happens when a firm has bank debt that can be renegotiated and public debt which cannot be renegotiated?

There are two lenders: one bank,  one public.

- We now examine how the inability to renegotiate public debt outside [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] influences the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] decision for borrowers with public and bank debt.
- As is true in practice,  bank debt is senior and shorter term,  public (junk) bonds are junior and longer term to maturity.
- Later we will see why this is the structure.

Only the bank can make concessions

- If the public never makes a concession,  the bank decides whether to make a concession of its own to stay out of bankruptcy,  or instead to force the borrower into bankruptcy.
- If the bank forces bankruptcy,  then it is paid from the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeds by its specified priority (it is senior).

Bank can extend maturity and increase the face value of the debt

- This third option (besides [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or extending maturity with face 0.\1) is limited by negative pledge clause in the public debt.
- The negative pledge covenant prohibits issuing future debt that is senior to it.
- The bank has a senior claim of B=. 3,  then the public has a claim on P=1.6. Any new claims that the borrower issues (to the bank or to other lenders) must be junior to the public.

The Example

- The future ("date 2") value of the firm is 2,  1,  or 0,  with probability q 2,  q 1,  and qo respectively. The current going concern value of the firm is then: $2\mathbf{q}_2+\mathbf{q}_1$ - Let $\mathbf{q}_2=0.2$ ,  q 1=0.6 and $\mathbf{q}_0=0.\1$
- The going concern value,  VGO,  is the expected value of all cash flow if the project is not liquidated: VGO = 2 (. 2) + 0.\1(1) = 1.0.

Example 1:

Bank debt $B=0.3$ due today

public junior,  due in the future and face $P=1.6$ L=0.4

The Bank Will Force Bankruptcy/ Liquidation

- The public can make no concessions. Therefore the public cannot prevent the bank from forcing bankruptcy,  and the going concern value will be destroyed.

Example 2: Maybe Going Concern Value will be preserved.

- Example 2 a: Even more going concern value is at risk
- Keep everything from the first example,  except make [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] even more inefficient. Let the value of the firm in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] be L=0.2. Now the bank will not force bankruptcy.
- A “public debt capacity" for bank voluntary concessions.
	- Too much pubic debt deters bank concessions.

- (This puts the bank at sufficient risk)
- Keep everything from example 1 except let the amount of bank debt be B=. 5 and the amount of public debt be P=1.4. Note that $L=0.\1$ . The amount of total debt is still 1.9,  but less of it is public debt. The public makes no concessions.

The bank can get at most 0.42 by extending maturity and raising face value to 0.51. This beats forcing liquidation if $L=0.4$

If no concessions from public,  bank will force inefficient bankruptcy

- When only the bank can make concessions or renegotiate,  but it has a senior claim on the borrower (and cannot "dilute" or steal value from the pre-existing junior public debt),  there can be too much use of bankruptcy.
- This then requires concessions (debt reduction and/or maturity extension) by public bondholders.
- How can we do this? See note 6 on coercive [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]].

How can we get concessions from "small" holders of publicly traded bonds?

- Suppose,  as in class note 4,  the bank will force the borrower into liquidation (or just costly bankruptcy,  more generally).
- If the public can't do anything,  they will lose substantially because they are junior and bear the losses first.
- The firm will be forced into liquidation for L=0.4,  and going concern value will be lost or impaired.
- How can the public be induced to make concessions if majority rule voting is not possible?

The bank can get at most 0.26 by extending maturity and raising the face value There is no way to make the bank whole without concessions from the public

Reducing debt below P=1.6 is in the collective interest of all bondholders

- If a large holder owned all of the bonds,  they would reduce the face value to $\mathsf{P'=1}$ ,  which would allow the bank to do better by extending the loan,  increasing the payment to the bank,  and avoiding liquidation.
- Liquidation yields $L=0.4$ ,  the bank is senior with a claim of 0.3,  and the bondholders get only 0.1!
- A large holder is "pivotal" and takes account that the effect of reducing the debt to $\mathbb{P}^{\prime}=1$ is to induce the bank not to force liquidation.

Can we just ask for voluntary concessions from public holders?

- The way that borrowers and banks get concessions from the public is to get the public to exchange their partial holding of the bond for one that requires a smaller payment (i.e.,  either a principal,  interest or maturity concession).
- Although the Federal Trust Indenture Act prohibits such concessions by voting,  it does not prohibit [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]].

There can be a "holdout" problem with such [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]]

- If there are many small holders,  each may be inclined to not exchange for a smaller bond if almost all other holders will exchange,  because the risk of liquidation or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] by the borrower could be minimal once the other holders have taken a smaller bond.
- Each small holder thinks that their decision is highly unlikely to make the firm switch from not liquidating to liquidating (or vice versa).

A nice way to think about small holders: "non-pivotal holders"

- If you are "non-pivotal" you assume that your decision to exchange the old bond for the new bond will not change the success or failure of the offer (in class note 4,  this would mean not changing the bank's liquidation decision,  more generally,  it might mean not changing the success or failure of the exchange offer itself).

Non-pivotal small holders probably are inclined to holdout (not make concessions).

- Suppose you are non-pivotal and you are given a choice between your old bond with face value 1.6 and new one with face value 1,  when this is the only difference between the bonds.
- It seems pretty clear that you might as well keep the old "bigger" bond.
- The old bond always gets 60% more than the new bond.

Class note 6

- If new bond is junior to the old bond,  it makes the holdout problem even worse (old gets at least 60% more).
- What non-pivotal holder would prefer a junior bond with face 1.0 to a senior bond with face 1.6?
- This can't solve the holdout problem of small nonpivotal holders (see the math in note 6).
- Look at the numbers on your own.

Goal of a Coercive Exchange offer:

Punish the holdouts

- How can we make new bond differ from old bond?
- - How can we "punish" the holdouts?
- Suppose the old bond (but not the new one) came with toxic germs or a personalized "mugging" then you might prefer the new bond with a smaller face value.
- How can we do something like this when we offer the new bond to small,  non-pivotal,  investors?

New bond senior to old bond. "Prime" the old bond.

- It is possible that a senior bond with face value P'=1 is worth more than a junior bond with face value P=1.6.
- The priority matters when there is enough repayment to pay something to both,  but not enough to fully repay the junior bond.
- There is also an effect on the relative payoff of the bonds caused by the fraction of the other bondholders who exchange the old bond for the new bond.

Goal of a successful coercive exchange offer

- If all small non-pivotal bondholders expect the offer to succeed,  then each will prefer to tender for the new bond (instead of holding out and keeping the old bond).
- The standard holdout problem is the reverse: if the offer is expected to succeed,  small holders will prefer to holdout.

Suppose bonds are paid by absolute priority rule. (one class gets <1 o 0% means zero to more junior)

- Old bond has face value $P=1$ 0.\1 (from class note 4)
- New bond has face value $\mathsf{P}^{\prime}=1.0$ in total and is senior to old.

The Priority Stack

- New with face $\mathbb{P}^{\prime}=1$ be senior to the original P=1.6 bonds.
- This means that if you exchange for the new bond,  you will be paid prior to those who hold out.
- This added priority is not relevant when the firm is worth 0 (all bonds are worthless) or when the firm is worth 2 (both the bonds with face P=1.6 and those with $P^{\prime}=1$ are paid in full). - The added priority is useful when the firm is worth 1.

With small holders,  some can holdout and keep the old bond.

- Assume that a fraction "f" of bondholders take the new bond and a fraction 1-f holdout and keep the old bond.
- The priority stack then is as follows:
- Senior new bonds,  total face value of f*p' = f
	- Junior old bond,  total face value (1-f) * p = (1-f) 1.6

New bond has face value of P'=1 and is senior to old bond with face P=1.6 holdouts.

Bringing in the new debt senior to old debt,  "primes" old debt,  Punishes holdouts.

- You own 1% of the old bonds,  and you expect all of the other bonds to tender (f=0.99). If you tender,  all of the bonds are tendered,  and when there is 0.7 left after the bank in paid,  your new bond gets 1% of 0.7,  or 0.007.
- Your expected return from tendering is then (1% of)
- 0.2 P' +0.6 (0.7) = (1% of) 0.2 (1) + 0.6 (0.7) = (1% of) 0.62. This is 0.0062. This beats the 0.0032 from holding out.

Kahan and Tuchman make this clear

- If the exchange offer can punish the holdouts sufficiently,  the small holders will tender for the new bond.
- This decision is not influenced by the collective gain for bondholders as a whole,  because small holders are non-pivotal.
- Corersion can be used for:
- - "good" (exchanges offers in the collective interest of bondholders) or
- - “evil" ([[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] not in the collective interest of bondholders).

Exit Consent Votes

- An exit consent vote changes the [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] in old bond combined with an exchange offer where a new bond is given in exchange for the old bond if and only if one votes to change the [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] in the old.
- As a result,  those who are exiting the old bond are the ones choosing to change its covenants. If a holder prefers the new bond given his or her belief that the vote will pass,  any reduction in the value of the old bond will not matter (because he or she will hold the new bond).

Exit consent votes are almost always contingent on a minimum fraction tendering.

- The exit consent vote that will pass if M+1 bondholders vote yes and tender their bond in exchange for a new one.
- The deal is structured so that you may only get the new bond if you vote to change the [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] in the old bond.
- The covenant change is designed to make old bond drop in value.
- If fewer than M other holders tender,  you can't make it pass,  if M+1 or more tender,  it passes no matter what you do.
- If it does not pass,  the entire offer is null and void (you keep old bond with old covenants).

## Notation from Kahan and Tuckman

- Value of bond as it stands= B
- Value of new bond that you get if you tender,  vote yes and the vote passes: Bn
- - Value of old bond if the consent vote passes (some [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] are removed): B'
- - Payment for consent vote,  in addition to new bond = p. This is called the consent payment.
- - If you hold it all the issue (are pivotal): you compare Bn +p to B.

If you expect the consent vote to succeed,  small non-pivotal will tender if and only if B,  +p ≥ B'.

- This might be coercive,  if the old bond drops in value (B,  +p < B). You would tender here,  even though you would not if you owned the total bond issue.
- - That is if
$$\mathrm{B_n~+p<B~while~B_n~+p>B^{\prime}.}$$
- The offer is coercive because it punishes the holdouts.

In the "Senior Priming of Junior" in note 6

- For a 1% holder of the bond - p=0 (no consent payment) Bn=0.0062 B=0.0032
- - B=0.001 (1% of the 0.\1 payoff from liquidation with B=. 3 of bank senior)
- - B,  >B: The punishment was used for "good,  " not evil.
