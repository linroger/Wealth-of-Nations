# Merrill Coercive Exchange Offers

Prices of U.S. high yield bonds and leveraged loans weakened early on Wednesday following Tuesday's sharp decline in equities.A rebound began later the same day and its continuation on Thursday erased most of the decline. Selected news-sensitive. names such as Elizabeth Arden,  Lyondell Chemical,  and Winn-Dixie Stores dominated trading on the bond side. Demand for loans remained firm. in the context. of skimpy new issue supply,  with collateralized loan obligation rampups adding to the need for paper.

## "Coercive" [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]]

The greatly increased incidence of corporate financial distress over the past two years has produced a corresponding surge in restructuring activity. Through [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]],  a number of issuers are attempting to renegotiate the terms of their bonds to avoid bankruptcy. To high yield market veterans,  the environmen is reminiscent of the early 1990s.

In contrast to that period,  the current downturn in credit conditions has witnessed no widespread allegations of "abusive and "coercive [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]]. The latter term does not refer to literal use of force,  which is the dictionary’s definition Rather,  the finance literature characterizes an exchange offer as coercive if it treats bondholders who reject the offer less favorably than bondholders who accept it.

One likely reason for today's comparative lack of rancor over [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] is that the great wave of early-stage telecom financings of the late Nineties spawned many “airballs,  ” i.e.,  defaulted bonds for which there are no material assets worth fighting over. Additionally,  the architects of some of this cycle's attempted restructuring have begun by acquiring the greater part of companies’ capital structures at steep discounts to face value. With control of the liabilities already in hand,  the restructurers do not need to impose draconian reductions in interest payments on other holders.

Notwithstanding such differences between conditions of ten years ago and today. it may be that calm currently predominates only because the cycle has not yet reached the point at which [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] will inevitably become more contentious.After all,  complex [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] of the sort described below take considerable time to plan and launch. Moreover,  many potential suppliers of fresh equity may not even begin putting out feelers until they perceive that the United States economy has started to emerge from recession

The give-and-take between issuers and investors,  in short,  may heat up considerably during 2002. Under such conditions,  rhetoric is likely to escalate. If past experience is a guide,  loose talk and fuzzy thinking will probably sow confusion about the validity of issuers² tactics. In hopes of helping market participants to evaluate future [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] with clear minds,  let us briefly discuss whether various types of exchanges offers are inherently abusive or coercive.

### Mistaken Sense of Entitlement

To hear some investors talk,  it is inherently abusive for a financial operator to offer to take them out of their investment at a small fraction of face value.A more rational assessment is that a bondholder who considers an offer too low can just say no. Understandably,  emotions sometimes take over when an investment entered into with high confidence loses the bulk of its value. Hard though it may be to admit a mistake,  the most self-benefiting response to the comment,  “I don’t want to insult you with a low bid,  ” is: “Go ahead,  insult me.”One market participant's throwaway bid may be another’s found money.

Even among bondholders who face up to the fact that their loss occurred before anybody came in offering them 50 cents on the dollar,  a deep-discount offer may ruffle some feathers.In a hypothetical case,  the complaint may run along the following lines: “Billionaire Byron Bigwheel is taking advantage of a temporary downturn to scoop up this great company at a fraction of its long-run value,  complains the aggrieved bondholder. “Not content with grabbing these assets at a bargain-basement price,  he expects me to take a haircut on my bonds. I'm the one who has stuck with the company through the fat times and the lean times,  yet Bigwheel is offering me only a five-point premium to the market value of my bonds. His self-serving proposition doesn’t share the benefits fairly."

Again,  the sentiments are understandable,  but in many such cases,  the bondholder’s interpretation of the matter is skewed. If the market's verdict,  prior to the exchange offer,  is that the bonds are worth 45,  then that is what the bondholder is entitled to,  absent Bigwheel’s offer.The risk capitalist is offering a five-point premium only because he must induce bondholders to sell. True,  the bonds may be worth considerably more than 45 after Bigwheel reduces their default risk by injecting several hundred million dollars of new equity into the company. Like any other investor,  though,  he aims to capture the wealth created by his investment,  not to create a windfall for others. The billionaire may sympathize with the plight of a distressed company’s creditors,  but he is under no obligation to compensate them for their loss.

Indeed,  we believe it would be economically inefficient to protect bondholders from the possibility of losing money.If the expected return on an equity injection exceeds the cost of capital,  society benefits from the investment. Placing a tax on equity infusions,  in the form of a requirement that new investors make up losses for which they bear no responsibility,  would reduce the number of companies rescued and thereby impede the efficient deployment of capital.

Certainly,  bondholders can legitimately complain of unfairness if they are put at an informational disadvantage.If the company and Bigwheel collude to present the company’s finances in an unrealistically bad light,  bondholders may be tricked into selling too cheaply. The case is the same if the company borrows from the banks to finance an offer lower than the intrinsic value of the bonds,  while misrepresenting the company's financial position. Either way,  the purchase offer is unfair not because the party making it improperly prevents bondholders from participating in the benefits of new investment,  but because the purchaser unlawfully withholds material information. Bondholders must rely on the securities laws financial disclosure provisions for protection against this sort of abuse.

## Solving the Holdout Problem

In the preceding case of an offer by Byron Bigwheel,  bondholders face a simple choice: Accept or reject. Those who accept the offer depart with 50 cents in hand for each dollar of face value.Bondholders who reject Bigwheel’s offer continue on the same terms as formerly,  collecting interest at the originally contracted rate and enjoying the protection of the original covenants.

Bondholders may reject an offer that is in their interest

Exiting bondholders must consent to evisceration of the covenants

Complaints of “coercion” arise from a more complex decision,  in which rejection entails adverse consequences. By way of illustration,  suppose Walking Wounded Corporations widely owned $10-1/2\%$ debentures are trading at 45. The financially distressed company attempts to lower its fixed charges by offering to exchange the outstanding issue for a like face amount of new $9\%$ debentures maturing in the same year,  and with covenant protection equivalent to that of,  the 10-1/2s. Pro forma analysis indicates that if all bondholders accept the exchange,  the resulting credit quality improvement will more than offset the coupon reduction,  causing the $9\%$ debentures to trade at 50. On the face of it,  bondholders have a collective interest in Walking Wounded’s offer being accepted. If the deal succeeds,  their holdings will rise in market value,  while their risk of default will decline

From the standpoint of a single bondholder,  however,  there is a powerful incentive to reject the company’s offer. Suppose Cagey Fund,  which owns $1\%$ of the outstanding face amount of Walking Wounded 10-1/2s were to hold out,  while owners of the remaining $99\%$ exchanged their bonds for the 9s. The improvement in credit quality resulting from $99\%$ acceptance would not be materially less than the improvement resulting from $100\%$ acceptance. Cagey Fund's $10-1/2s$ would be worth considerably more than 50,  however,  by virtue of having a much higher coupon than the 9s. By opting out,  in short,  Cagey Fund would gain more than the bondholders who accepted the offer and thereby raised Walking Wounded’s credit quality.

Each of the other bondholders has the same incentive as Cagey Fund to hold out. Therefore,  contrary to the outcome just suggested,  in which $99\%$ accept the offer all of the holders,  it turns out,  reject it. One by one,  the bondholders turn down a proposal that would make them collectively better off. To boot,  Walking Wounded’s shareholders fail to achieve their aim of reduced [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] risk. Surely,  these results must be judged to be unfortunate

Fortunately,  there is a solution to the holdout problem,  known as an exit consent. Suppose that in lieu of the exchange offer described above,  Walking Wounded makes the following proposal:

The company exchanges old $10-1/2\%$ debentures for a like face amount of new $9\%$ debentures maturing in the same year,  and with covenant protection equivalent to that of the 10-1/2s. Consummation of the exchange is contingent on acceptance by holders of two-thirds of the face amount of outstanding 10-1/2s To accept the exchange,  the exiting bondholders must consent to a removal of protective [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] from the 10-1/2s. (Note that the effect of this change will be felt not by the exiting bondholders,  but rather by those who reject the offer.)

The significance of the two-thirds threshold is that it is the percentage required. under the indenture of the 10-1/2s,  for amendment (or in this case,  rescinding) of a covenant.If holders of at least two-thirds of the issue accept the exchange offer holdouts will be left with a $10-1/2\%$ debenture stripped of protective covenants. Furthermore,  the issue’s outstanding face amount of the 10-1/2s will decline by two-thirds or more,  resulting in a drastic reduction in secondary market liquidity Credit analysis indicates that holdouts will then own bonds with a market value lower than that of the new 9s and even lower than the previous trading price of the 10-1/2s. The exit consent,  in short,  makes holding out unattractive by ensuring that if the deal succeeds,  holdouts will be worse off,  rather than better off,  than bondholders who accept the exchange offer.*

### Draconian Exchanges: Immoral? Unlawful? Neither?

Is an exit consent coercive? The finance literature has characterized the mechanism in that way"

Consider an analogy from the realm of romance. The recipient of an ultimatum ("Agree to marry me or I will break off our five-year relationship") may consider it coercive,  yet we doubt that many would favor outlawing such tactics.Indeed observers who perceive a social benefit in family formation may applaud the forcing of a decision

In a similar vein,  Chatterjee,  Dhillon,  and Ramirez (1995) argue,  based on empirical analysis of public workouts of [[A Primer on Distressed Investing|distressed debt]],  that the so-called coercion does not hurt bondholders on the whole. These types of offers may even benefit security holders,  they contend,  by increasing the likelihood of companies restructuring their debt outside of court,  rather than through the more costly [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process. If the conclusions of Chatterjee et al. are correct,  it seems to us that the state should proceed cautiously,  rather than leap into intervention in the free contracting of bond indentures and amendments.

Bondholders who have been on the receiving end of exit consents,  however,  have not invariably formed their opinions of the mechanism on purely laissez-faire principles.In the 1986 Delaware Chancery Court case Katz v. Oak Industries Inc.,  a bondholder sought a preliminary injunction against an exchange offer involving an exit consent,  arguing that the offer was coercive and violated the issuer's obligation to act in good faith toward its bondholders. The court rejected the request for an injunction,  on grounds that:

·Implicit fiduciary responsibilities on the corporation’s part should not be read into a contract between the corporation and its debtholders that is contractual in nature. Characterization of an offer as coercive,  if valid,  is of limited analytical value. The important question is whether the coercion is wrongful. The appropriate legal criterion for establishing a breach of the corporation’s obligation to act fairly and in good faith is whether,  at the time of the underwriting,  bondholders would have demanded indenture language prohibiting the type of exchange offer that the issuer made,  had they foreseen such an event. In the case of Oak Industries,  it was not clear that bondholders would have barred an offer to all participating holders that entailed a payment of cash greater than the prevailing market price of the bonds. In approving the exchange offer,  Oak's board of directors may reasonably have concluded that it represented the only remaining means of keeping the company viable.

Buchheit and Gulati (2000) note,  in light of the Delaware court’s rejection of an implicit fiduciary duty on the issuer’s part,  that holdouts to an exit consent might instead argue that the departing bondholders tortiously interfered with their contract rights.The authors see little chance of this argument succeeding however. For one thing,  they say,  the plaintiffs would have to show that the exiting bondholders had breached a contract in the old bond,  which would be difficult to argue in view of a clause expressly permitting amendments of nonpayment terms. Buccheit and Gulati comment

If the black letter of the debt instrument in question gives each lender the right to vote for certain types of amendments or waivers,  only very extraordinary circumstances will justify. disregarding such a vote.Selfishness on the part of the lenders casting such a vote,  their manifest disdain for the Golden Rule their lack of empathy or charity toward other creditors or even profound ignorance as to what might be in their (or anyone else’s) bests interests,  are not adequate grounds for disenfranchisement.

Regardless of existing court decisions and legal arguments,  the use of “coercive [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] remain controversial. Critics contend that bondholders may agree to an offer that does not improve their position,  simply out of fear that two-thirds of holders will accept the proposition and leave those who fail to participate with bonds much reduced in value.Defenders of exit consents counter that bondholders can escape this classic prisoner’s dilemma by communicating with one another before deciding to accept or reject the offer. Kahan and Tuckman (1993) comment:

If bondholders can coordinate their actions,  the analysis of consent solicitations is simple: bondholders will accept an issuer’s proposal if and only if they benefit from the changes. Consequently,  firms will propose only those changes that increase the value of the firm as a whole and share at least some of the increased value with the bondholders.

Clearly,  the feasibility of communication depends on whether the ownership of the bonds is widely dispersed or concentrated within a comparatively small number of institutional holders. For most high yield issues,  we believe,  the latter presumption is not unrealistic.

Defenders of the exit consent also cite empirical evidence that holdouts have not suffered significant loss of value as a result of covenant changes.Kahan and Tuckman (1993) find statistically significant,  positive abnormal returns on bonds involved in "coercive" consent solicitations around the time of announcement “indicating that firms cannot,  or do not,  exploit the coercive nature of their solicitations." Kahan and Tuckman infer that in practice,  communication among bondholders through informal channels prevents coercion.!

### Conclusion

Clear thinking is imperative when assessing the fairness of,  and legitimacy of complaints about,  [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]].Contrary to the grumbling sometimes heard in the marketplace,  bondholders who have lost money through credit deterioratior. have no inherent right to be made whole by risk-takers who are willing to inject new capital into the issuer. Although many market participants characterized exit consents as coercive,  we do not believe they are intrinsically bad or economically undesirable. In fact,  by solving the holdout problem,  the mechanism may cause many cases of corporate distress to be resolved outside the context of bankruptcy,  where administrative costs are lower. To be sure,  this vision may not mollify bondholders hoping to capture a bigger share of the restructuring benefits. As Buchheit and Gulati observe:

At the very least,  it seems impolite to disfigure a debt instrument by amendment once one has made a commercial decision to leave that instrument. The legal question is whether a bondholder staying behind can claim that either the issuer of the bonds or the exiting bondholders have been guilty of something more than bad manners.

Certainly,  bondholders have a valid gripe if they can show that an issuer has stampeded them into consenting by presenting an unrealistically bleak portrait of its financial condition.Similarly,  it is legitimate to squawk if an underwriter makes an exchange offer appear more attractive than it is in reality by driving down the price of the issuer’s thinly traded outstanding bonds.The securities laws,  however,  prohibit both misleading disclosure and price manipulation

After a full year of operating as a combined entity under its belt,  AdvancePCS has proven that it can successfully integrate the acquisition of PCS and more importantly,  can win new contracts to provide a healthy basis for claims growth Furthermore with Merck's recent announcement of its plan to spin off Medco,  we believe the playing field for PBMs has been leveled and competitive pricing pressures might ease. Although the $8.5\%$ senior notes are trading at levels that yield less than $7.5\%$ ,  it still offers a slight premium to Express Scripts and Caremark $Rx$ bonds.As such,  we are reiterating our Overweight recommendation at current levels

AdvancePCS reported a $15.4\%$ increase in revenue to S3.4 billion for its third fiscal quarter ended Dec,  2001 compared to the year ago period. EBITDA grew $29.7\%$ to $\$75.4$ million,    slightly ahead of our estimate of $\$72.7$ million. New contract wins and increased number of lives under management drove revenue and earnings. Since the PCS acquisition,    the company has added 10 million lives and increased the number of claims processed.For the third quarter,    the number of pharmacy network claims processed increased $5.4\%$ and the number of prescriptions filled grew $19.9\%$ With the first nine months running ahead of our expectations,    we are confident that the company should be able to beat our full yearEBITDA estimate of $\$287.5$ million,    perhaps by as much as $\$10$ million

Size proves to provide operational strength.Both gross and EBITDA margins improved on a sequential and year-over-year basis.Gross margin per adjusted claim jumped to $\$0.93$ in the third fiscal 2002 quarter from $\$0.80$ in the same period a year ago. EBITDA per adjusted claim increase $17.4\%$ to $\$0.62$

Although these measures are below that of Express Scripts and Caremark Rx continued benefits from the company's sheer size may provide additional room fon improvement.

Table 3:AdvancePCs-Selected Statistics
 AdvancePCS has maintained a strong credit profile and liquidity. Total debt at quarter end stood at $\$501.2$ million,    essentially unchanged from the previous quarter but $\$308.8$ million lower than a year ago,    resulting in LTM debt/EBITDA of $1.8x$ .With quarterly net interest expense of $\$11.8$ million 813.6 million on a gross basis),    LTM interest coverage was $4.0x$

Strong cash flow generation has provided AdvancePCS with liquidity. During the quarter,  AdvancePCS generated approximately $\$40$ million in cash flow from operations and spent slightly over $\$14$ million in capital expenditure. With cash balance of $\$129.2$ million and full availability under its $\$175$ million revolver facility,  the company has sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations.
