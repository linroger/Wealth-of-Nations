# Greece Faces Bond Swap Holdouts

## Abstract

The foreign-law bond swap is part of Greece's [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] deal that saw more than $\euro$100 billion knocked off its debt burden,  and which aims to reduce the country's debt burden from more than 165% of gross domestic product to a more sustainable 120.5% by 2020.

## Full Text

ATHENS--The overall participation rate in an unprecedented Greek debt-restructuring deal has exceeded Greece's expectations,  a senior finance ministry official said Monday,  despite some holders of Greek foreign-law bonds still refusing to take part in the offer.

The official said 97% of the bonds involved in Greece's [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] agreement,  which cleared the way for its $\euro 130$ billion ($173 billion) bailout,  have been tendered in the swap,  exceeding the 95% target the country was aiming for under the plan.

"We want to achieve a maximum participation from the remaining $\euro6.4$ billion still outstanding,  " the official said.

His comments come after investors holding 16 foreign-laws bonds last week agreed to key changes allowing amendments in bond contracts to force the remaining investors into the plan.

The foreign-law bond swap is part of Greece's [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] deal that saw more than $\euro 100$ billion knocked off its debt burden,  and which aims to reduce the country's debt burden from more than 165% of gross domestic product to a more sustainable 120.5% by 2020.

The deal calls for bondholders to give up 53.5% of the principal by swapping old Greek bonds with new ones worth less than half their value,  carrying lower interest rates and longer maturities.

At issue is the use of so-called collective action clauses,  or CACs. Under those clauses,  the issuer--in this instance,  the Greek government--can force a restructuring on all investors on a given bond if a majority agree to adopt the terms. In the case of Greek law bonds,  those CACs were invoked after a majority of more than 66% signed up to the new terms.

However,  in the majority of the bonds governed by foreign law,  a super majority of 75% is needed to activate these clauses. Those bondholders that refuse to sign up may take legal action against Greece,  which has indicated that it won't pay holdouts.

Last week,  euro-zone finance ministers issued a statement indicating they would strongly back Greece if it didn't make the payments on the foreign law bonds,  which would be an effective default on those bonds. The EU has said this wouldn't trigger a wider default,  as there are no cross-default clauses in Greece's new bonds.

Of the total debt being restructured,  $\euro 177$ billion are government bonds issued under the laws of Greece,  about $\euro 10$ billion are bonds issued by state-owned companies and guaranteed by Greece,  and $\euro 18$ billion are government bonds issued under the laws of foreign jurisdictions.

Bondholders possessing $\euro 199$ billion out of the total $\euro$206 billion being restructured have now approved the debt swap. Even if the remaining holders don't give their consent,  they aren't expected to jeopardize the whole deal.

Earlier,  the Public Debt Management Agency said investors holding 20 of the 36 bonds that haven't yet been included in the swap agreement have either voted down or otherwise failed to approve key changes to the bond contracts. The PDMA statement came after a series of bondholder meetings held between March 27 to 29.

"The Republic accepted the effective amendment of all series where the extraordinary resolutions were approved by the requisite majority and re-opened the consent solicitation for all series where meetings have been adjourned to April 18,  " it said. Apart from the bondholders who postponed meetings,  a previous April 4 deadline for participation in the foreign-law bond swap still applies,  as does a scheduled April 11 settlement date.

The euro-zone ministers said they had been "informed that a failure to make timely payment of Greece's eligible foreign law bonds that are not exchanged does not constitute an event of default under Greece's new bonds issued in the exchange."

ABN Amro,  the nationalized Dutch bank,  is seen as one of the biggest creditors likely to hold out on the bond swap. It holds $\euro 1.3$ billion of Greek government-guaranteed bonds.

A spokesman for the lender confirmed last week that ABN Amro hadn't yet tendered its Greek bonds under the offer and is still considering how it will handle the swap.

On May 15,  Greece must redeem one of those foreign-law notes valued at $\euro 450$ million.
