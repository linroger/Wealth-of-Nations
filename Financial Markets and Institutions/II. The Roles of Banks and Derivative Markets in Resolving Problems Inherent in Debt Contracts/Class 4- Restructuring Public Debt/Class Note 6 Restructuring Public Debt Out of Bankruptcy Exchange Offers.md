# Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers
**Includes Note 6A: Coercive Exchange Offers and Exit Consents at the End**

The primary way that borrowers and banks try to get concessions from the public is to get the public to exchange their bond for one that requires a smaller payment (i.e.,  either a principal,  interest,  or maturity concession). Although the Federal Trust Indenture Act prohibits such concessions by voting,  it does not prohibit exchange offers.

Because the public consists of many small holders,  each holder may assume that he is so small that his decision to tender his bond for exchange will not influence the outcome of the exchange offer. As a result,  each decides by comparing the value of the new security with the value of the old security that is expected to prevail after the exchange offer. This evaluation of the future value is made by making a forecast of how much of the issue will be exchanged by other holders.

## Example 3: Public Exchanges for Junior Securities Tend to Fail

Keep everything from example 1: going concern value of $V_{GO}=1$,  bankruptcy value of $L=0.4$. The bank is owed $B=0.3$,  and the public is owed $P=1.6$. The public is junior and long-term. If the public does not make a concession,  we saw in example 1 that the bank will force bankruptcy,  and the public will then get $L-B=0.4-0.3=0.1$. Suppose that the public is offered the chance to exchange for a bond with face $P'=1$,  and the bank agrees not to force [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] if the exchange succeeds. Suppose that the offer succeeds if 99% of the bonds are exchanged. Let "f" denote the fraction of the total bond issue that you expect to be exchanged by other holders.

The key point in this example is to look at the case where the new bonds (with face $P'=1$) are junior to the old bonds with face $P=1.6$. The bank's claim of 0.3 remains senior to the public.

Suppose that you own 1% of the old bonds,  with face value 0.016. Your return from tendering or holding out depends on whether you expect the exchange offer to succeed in keeping the firm out of bankruptcy.

1. **Suppose that you expect the offer to succeed**,  for example,  because every other holder tenders,  and $f=0.99$. You choose between tendering and "holding out" by not tendering.

   A. To determine what you get if you tender,  do the following calculation. If you tender,  then all are tendered. Your new bond is paid (1% of) 1 when the firm is worth 2,  and worth (1% of) $1-0.3=0.7$ when the firm is worth 1 (this is because the bank has a senior claim on 0.3). The expected value of this claim is $(1\% \,             of) \,             0.2(1) + 0.6(0.7) = 0.62$. 1% of 0.62 is 0.0062.

   B. If,  instead,  you hold out and refuse to tender the bond,  the offer will still succeed (because only 99% is needed). Then your bond is senior to the public bonds that tender: you will get paid before those that tender when the firm is worth 1. The bank is first paid 0.3,  leaving $1-0.3=0.7$. This means you are paid the full face value of 0.016 if you hold out instead of exchanging. You receive 0.016 when the firm is worth 1 and when it is worth 2: as a holdout,  you receive 0.016 with probability 0.8,  an expected value of 0.0128. This exceeds the 0.0062 that you get from tendering your bond.

   Therefore,  if you expect the exchange offer to succeed,  you will not tender because your claim will be worth more if you hold out! If all bondholders expect the offer to succeed,  none of them will tender. A prophecy that the offer will succeed is not self-fulfilling!

1. **Consider the case where you expect the exchange offer to fail** (less than 98% of bonds exchanged: $f < 0.98$). If the offer fails,  the bank will force bankruptcy. The firm will then be worth $L=0.4$. After the bank is paid its 0.3,  there remains 0.1 to be divided among the public.

   If you hold out,  and so does everyone else,  you get 1% of 0.1. If you hold out and anyone exchanges,  you get more than 1% of 0.1,  because the holdouts are senior and are paid first. If more than 93.75% exchange ($f > 0.9375$),  the holdouts (who are senior) get paid in full (then $1-f<0.0625$,  and $6.25\%$ of $1.6 = 0.1$).

   If you exchange,  you get nothing if less than 93.75% of the others exchange; holding out dominates this. If more than 93.75% exchange,  the holdouts get paid in full,  and if you exchange for a reduced face value you do not,  implying that you prefer to hold out.

No matter what fraction of others you expect to exchange,  you prefer to hold out. One is always worse off with a junior claim with lower face value,  so here you would still not tender.

[[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] for junior securities with lower face value will always fail if aimed at small holders. The small holders each expect that their decision to exchange will not tip the balance between the offer succeeding (staying out of bankruptcy) and failing (going into bankruptcy). In the example,  you do not influence success unless you expect more than 98% but less than 99% of others to exchange. If you do not tip the balance,  you never prefer a new bond with lower face value and lower priority,  because it is never worth more than the old bond.

If,  instead,  the bonds you exchange for are equal in priority to the original bonds,  the same arguments apply. If the offer succeeds,  or if it does not,  you are better off with an equal priority claim of higher promised payment (which you get by holding out and not tendering),  because when there is equal priority the payment is proportional to the amount promised. You would only tender for a junior security if you thought that your bond would tip the balance between the bank forcing [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and not forcing bankruptcy.

## Example 4: Public Exchanges for Senior Securities Are More Successful,  If Allowed

Keep everything from the last example,  except let the bonds with face $P'=1$ offered to the public in exchange for their bonds with face $P=1.6$ be senior to the original 1.6 bonds. This means that if you exchange for the new bond,  you will be paid prior to those who hold out. This added priority is not relevant when the firm is worth 0 (all bonds are worthless) or when the firm is worth 2 (both the bonds with face $P=1.6$ and those with $P'=1$ are paid in full). The added priority is useful when the firm is worth 1. I now examine the relative value of senior bonds with $P'=1$ and junior bonds with face $P=1.6$,  when the firm is worth 1.

As before,  suppose that you own 1% of the bonds,  and you expect all of the other bonds to tender ($f=0.99$). If you tender,  all of the bonds are tendered,  and you get 1% of $1-B=1-0.3=0.7$,  or 0.007. Your expected return from tendering is then:

$$ (1\% \,             of) \,             q_2 P' + q_1 (1 - B) = (1\% \,             of) \,             0.2(1) + 0.6(0.7) = (1\% \,             of) \,             0.62 $$

This is 0.0062.

If you hold out,  then those who tender are senior to you. When the firm is worth 1,  the public as a whole gets $1-B=1-0.3=0.7$. There are bonds with face value of (99% of) 1,  senior to you,  they are owed 0.99,  but get only 0.7. Therefore,  as a holdout you will get nothing when the firm is worth 1.

By holding out,  you will get $P=1.6$ when the firm is worth 2,  and nothing otherwise. Your expected payment from holding out is then:

$$ (1\% \,             of) \,             q_1 P = (1\% \,             of) \,             0.2(1.6) $$

or 0.0032. This is less than the 0.0062 that you obtain from exchanging your bond. Therefore if you expect the offer to succeed,  you exchange. A prophecy that the offer to exchange will succeed is self-fulfilling.

By holding out,  you will get P=1.6 when the firm is worth 2,  and nothing otherwise. Your expected payment from holding out is then (1% of) q1P = (1% of) (1.6),  or . This is less than the that you obtain from exchanging your bond.

Therefore if you expect the offer to succeed,  you exchange. A prophesy that the offer to exchange will succeed is self-fulfilling.

When the new security offered in exchange is senior to the old,  there is a lower payment received by the old security whenever the new one is not paid in full. This is in contrast to the case where the new security is junior,  and the old one gets more than the new whenever the new is not paid in full. This makes small holders willing to join in the bond exchange. Exchanging for a senior security can put the bondholders in a rush to exchange to jump ahead of the holdouts. I will later show that rushing to exchange for something senior is very similar to a bank run.
