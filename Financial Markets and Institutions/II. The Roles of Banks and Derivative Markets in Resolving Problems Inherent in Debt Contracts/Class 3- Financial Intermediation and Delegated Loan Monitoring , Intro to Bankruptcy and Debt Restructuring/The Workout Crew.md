# The Workout Crew

# Staff Report: The Wall Street Journal

They are variously known as undertakers,  morticians,  black hats,  or goons. But members of this banking fraternity prefer to think of themselves as **surgeons**.

They are workout specialists,  the bankers who take over when a business loan goes bad. Most companies don't know these specialists exist. Those companies that do wish they didn’t.

"You come to dread them,  " says the treasurer of a Midwestern leisure-products maker when their prospects were still bright. This company had been wooed and won by an eager loan officer from Continental Illinois Bank & Trust Co.

"He brought me to Chicago to meet the president of the bank,  to eat lunch in the executive dining room,  " the treasurer recalls. "He knocked himself out coming to the company and telling me what the bank could do for us. It was nice."

But when business soured,  the solicitous loan officer disappeared. Then "this new banker shows up. And he keeps coming back every day,  wanting to know why this or that employee is needed,  why we had to have those airline tickets,  " says the treasurer.

"Suddenly you've lost control. The bank has become your boss."

## Plenty to Do

Such trauma is becoming more common. Business failures rose nearly **50%** in **1981**,  and what bankers refer to as "nonperforming loans" doubled and tripled at many institutions. Banks' intensive-care wards,  or workout areas (literally,  where problems are "worked out"),  are already crowded and likely to become more so if the economy doesn't improve.

Neither companies nor banks trumpet the arrival of the special forces,  but an announcement of "debt restructuring" is a signal that the workout crew has taken charge. Other signs: news reports that "lenders" forced a "troubled company" to dismiss its president,  sell a division,  or forgo new products. Those mysterious and pushy "lenders" are usually workout people.

Thus,  when the chairman and six other officers or directors of Wickes Co. quit this week,  holders of the company's heavy debt insisted they were just bystanders. But the chief workout officer at one bank,  Richard Daniel of Security Pacific,  did comment that,

“We’ve long been dissatisfied with what was going on at Wickes and let our feelings be known."

### **Implications of Bank Control**

If a bank starts running a business when a creditor should,  the company risks bankruptcy. Workout officers don’t dictate what a company should do; they simply say no to so many things that only one course of action is left—or they hint. Strongly.

"We don't say you've got to hire Joe Smith to be your top financial guy or we're finished with you,  " said Chase Manhattan Bank’s chief workout officer. "We can say,  'You have a void in your present management.' Then we may offer some suggestions. Give them a list of **10** people."

Continental Illinois' workout man rejected the Midwestern leisure-products company's plans to expand its business and then told the company a **15%** sales-force reduction would “be prudent."

Companies listen for one reason: **Knuckling under beats bankruptcy**,  the likely consequence of a loan default. When asked about his worst times since International Harvester began rescheduling its **$4.7 billion** debt last year,  Archie R. McCardell,  its chairman,  recalls "the many nights when several of us would go home knowing we'd have to get up at **2 a.m. or 3 a.m.**" to answer a phone call from an anxious European banker. He never knew,  he adds,  "whether someone would take that final step."

## The Quiet Work of Workout Units

Big workouts,  such as Chrysler and International Harvester,  attract lots of attention. But mostly workout units move quietly,  much to the relief of their patients. Like people who undergo radical surgery,  companies often find workout so painful and embarrassing that they don't want to discuss it,  even after they are back on their feet.

Says Harris Levin,  a New York bankruptcy lawyer: "It's a humiliation and a nightmare."

### **Low Profile**

A bank,  too,  usually is content to keep the spotlight off its workout people; after all,  the busier they are,  the more mistakes the loan department has made. Thus,  workout people operate in relative obscurity in less glorious parts of banks. Plush carpets and original paintings may be needed to attract new customers,  but potential deadbeats don't require such niceties.

At Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles,  the workout department is on the **13th floor**. A long,  bleak corridor leads to Citibank's workout staff in New York. Visitors to Chase's problem loan section in New York step off the elevator onto linoleum.

Workout departments aren't usually listed in bank directories. But a company can guess it has troubles if it is asked to report to **Institutional Recovery Management** (Citibank),  to **Special Assets** (Security Pacific in Los Angeles),  or to **Central Loan Department** (Irving Trust Co. in New York),  or to other departments beginning with "special."

The euphemisms serve a practical purpose. Sometimes ailing companies extricate themselves from workout at one bank by borrowing from another institution. If the new banker,  unaware of the customer's less-than-perfect status,  calls the old one for information and hears “workout,  " he will run the other way.

### **Abrupt Changes**

A company's change in status from master to slave often comes abruptly. At Citibank,  customers are simply told one day to arrive at the **19th floor** of the bank's Park Avenue office.

"It's always interesting to watch them walk down that corridor,  look at that sign (Institutional Recovery Management),  and watch their faces change as it dawns on them they might be in trouble,  ” chuckles Peter Fitts,  Citibank's top workout officer.

Some banks make the transfer more gently. At Chase,  workout officers start showing up at meetings along with the company's regular banker. After a couple of meetings,  the account officer disappears.

Workouts usually last at least a year,  sometimes much longer. The Midwestern leisure-products company was in workout for **five years** before it could get loans again. International Harvester has been struggling with its lenders for more than a year and is far from free of them.

## The Process of Workout

The process is tedious. Bankers negotiate fine points in meeting after meeting with companies and,  in big workouts,  with other bankers. Sometimes they have to go to great lengths to win allies among other bankers whose stake in a company might not be as great but who can still veto decisions.

To keep other lenders informed of the progress of Chrysler's K-cars,  Scott Taylor,  a former Chase workout officer,  produced a film on how the cars were assembled. "If you keep people out in the cold,  they're likely to say no,  " he explains.

In dealing with borrowers,  however,  workout specialists can be a bit more forceful. Citibank's Mr. Fitts,  a big,  tall man,  has his own technique: He states his views,  then puffs quietly on his cigar until everyone else agrees.

## What It Takes

The list of qualities distinguishing a good workout officer varies with who is asked. Practitioners assess themselves as **analytical**,  **patient**,  **perceptive**,  **decisive**,  and **humorous**. Other bankers offer such adjectives as **churlish**,  **sadistic**,  **thick-skinned**,  **single-minded**,  **obnoxious**,  and **insensitive**.

The S.W.A.T. teams naturally have developed their own lingo. Troubled companies are rarely called customers: workout people refer to them as **"clients,  "** **"turkeys,  "** or,  most frequently,  simply as **"names."** As Mr. Taylor,  who dealt with Chrysler,  explains,

"When you spend two weeks locked in a hotel and at the Treasury in Washington and you don't get to see your family because of some company,  you don't think of that company as a customer anymore.”

Linked by work that is often grueling and sometimes thankless,  the specialists tend to stick together. An example came at International Harvester's first meeting with creditors to discuss delaying debt repayment.

Workout officers weren't invited. But those from three banks,  who knew one another from the Chrysler case,  conspired to get themselves invited,  figuring they would end up handling the matter anyway. Each told his superiors the other workout people were going,  and soon all had invitations from their own banks.

## Need for Specialists

There once was a time when workout was a banking backwater,  where bankruptcy specialists kicked the bones of dead customers. It was thought easier to let sick companies go under and bear the loss than to try to find a way to keep them alive.

But then bankruptcy actions arose at such giants as **Penn Central** and **W.T. Grant**: their debts were scattered among many banks,  which had to squabble over the remains. There were huge,  embarrassing write-offs.

Next,  Chrysler and other big borrowers got in trouble with the changing markets and difficult economy. Banks realized they would have to start restructuring debts en masse or face numerous multimillion-dollar write-offs. Most chose to create squads of officers who did nothing but work with customers to change business habits and try to restore profitability. Even smaller banks began adding full-time troubleshooters.

But not all troubled companies are ready to accept a bank as **Big Brother**. William F. (Will) Farah recently took some lenders to court on a complaint that they brought his company close to bankruptcy. He had quit as president of Farah Manufacturing Co. when it went through hard times in the mid-1970s.

As a condition of a loan from State National Bank of El Paso,  Continental Illinois,  and RepublicBank of Dallas,  Mr. Farah had to stay on the sidelines while a turnaround specialist the banks brought in sold millions of dollars of the Texas clothing company's assets to repay loans. In a judgment the banks plan to appeal,  a Texas court awarded Mr. Farah **$19 million** in damages.

Bankers say they have only one concern in these spats: getting their money back. "We have the right to get paid,  and they have an obligation to pay us,  " says Mr. Walker,  the chief workout officer at Chase. "The bank didn't cause the company to make bad investments or whatever it was that caused them to lose money."

## Looking at Errors

Workout specialists often feel they are looking at the errors of others' ways: unwillingness by companies to admit that their projections were off,  or bad judgment by a bank loan officer who acted out of friendship,  pressure to make loans,  or simply ineptitude.

"Loan officers are supposed to get a detailed forecast of where a company is going before they make a loan,  " says Richard Daniel,  the head of Security Pacific's Special Assets division. "But most officers don't watch whether sales are what were projected or whether receivables are turning over like they were supposed to."

Such remarks don't endear workout people to their banker colleagues,  who resent being depicted as financial **Santa Clauses**. Winning a single big account,  loan officers note,  can take two or three years of work. First,  they must come up with a financial package somehow distinguishable from competitors. Then there are the endless lunches,  dinners,  and other mandatory social contacts.

"Your personal relationship with the treasurer can make or break a deal,  " says a Citibank loan officer. "He isn't just looking at the institution— the big banks look alike to him. He's wondering,  'Is this guy like me?'"

Once the deal is made,  the loan officer has to turn to new conquests and thus is often juggling **25** or more big accounts at once. So when one of those loans looks shaky (most banks have regular reviews),  the special team is called for what may be a **seven-day-a-week** job working out the company's problems in repaying.

## Getting the News

This can be a dreadful moment for the officer who arranged the loan. The workout people "just march in and say to the company,  'Your business plan looks crummy: this and this will have to go,  '" says the Citibank loan officer.

"You say to yourself,  'My God. I don't want to give my company up to these goons.’” The dread is also more personal,  he adds: "You also start agonizing about your own reputation. You feel like you've totally lost face."

In fact,  losing an account to workout usually doesn't mean the end of a promising career,  unless the loan officer essentially hoodwinked superiors into accepting the loan—or unless it is the officer's second or third loser. Partly to keep such officers on their toes,  some banks shun the workout system.

Explains John Greathouse,  the top credit officer at Chicago’s Amalgamated Bank Trust Co. “If a loan officer knows he’s going to have to live with those loans,  day and night,  good or bad,  he'll learn to stay away from problems.”

Most workout specialists once were loan officers themselves. They didn't necessarily bring in the most business—they often lacked the **slap and tickle** a good salesman needs—but they were quickest to spot trouble and fix it. They understand balance sheets and business plans.

What they don't understand is why anyone should be so eager for new business as to skim over such details. "It doesn't take a whole lot of skill to lend people money,  " says one workout officer. "Getting money back—that makes you feel like a banker.”
