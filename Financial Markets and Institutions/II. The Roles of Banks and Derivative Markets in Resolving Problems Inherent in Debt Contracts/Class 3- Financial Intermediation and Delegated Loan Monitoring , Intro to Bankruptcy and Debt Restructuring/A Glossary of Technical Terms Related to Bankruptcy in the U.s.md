# A Glossary of Technical Terms Related to Bankruptcy in the U.s

This note briefly describes the most important legal forms of U.S. bankruptcy: Chapter 7 and Chapter 11,  and provides definitions of technical terms related to the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process.

## Legal Forms of Bankruptcy—An Overview

The U.S. Constitution (Article 1,  Section 8) authorized Congress to enact "uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States." The rules of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] are set by Congress through the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U.S. Code). The Code was last updated by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.

The parts of the Code most relevant to corporations are Chapter 7 (liquidation) and Chapter 11
(reorganization).

Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code governs the process of the liquidation of the debtor. In a liquidation,  the company ceases to operate its business. Its assets are sold,  and the proceeds distributed to its creditors.

Chapter 11 governs the reorganization of a company that continues to do business while in bankruptcy. Normally,  in Chapter 11,  the company files a petition for protection from its creditors,  and the case is assigned to a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] judge,  who supervises the process. The current management and board of directors remain in charge,  and they have the sole right to propose a plan of reorganization during the first 120 days after the filing. (This exclusivity period can be extended at the discretion of the judge.)
The company stops paying interest and principal on its debts,  and its assets are subject to a so-called automatic stay. The bankrupt company can also raise new financing that takes priority over its existing debts. Claims against the company are sorted into classes,  and a committee is formed to represent each class. Classes are asked to vote on the plan of reorganization if their claims are "impaired" but not wiped out. By law,  a plan of reorganization must be accepted by at least one. 1. Except in special cases,  interest does not accrue while the company is in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] but stops completely.

Once the judge approves the plan of reorganization,  he or she has the power to discharge the company's former debts. The company then emerges from Chapter 11 as a going concern with a more sustainable capital structure.

## Technical Terms Related to Bankruptcy

363 sale - allows specific assets to be sold as a way to recover value,  leaving other assets in the estate for liquidation or reorganization.

Absolute priority - This basic principle of U.S. bankruptcy law stipulates that a junior claim shouldn't receive a dollar of value until all prior claims are paid in full. The so-called "payment waterfall" is as follows: secured creditors,  unsecured creditors,  preferred stockholders,  and common stockholders. A judge cannot approve a plan of reorganization that violates absolute priority.

Automatic stay - an automatic injunction (i.e.,  court order) that halts actions by creditors. With certain exceptions,  creditors cannot collect interest or seize assets from a debtor who has filed for bankruptcy. However,  some collateral pledged to derivatives contracts is exempt from the automatic stay and is forfeited to counterparties.

Claim - a right to payment from the debtor. Claims include bonds and other debt securities,  accounts payable to suppliers,  unpaid wages to employees,  and payments under contracts (such as union contracts,  pension plans,  and leases) that obligate the debtor to make a series of payments over time.

Cramdown - a feature of the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process that allows a plan of reorganization to be confirmed by the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court despite being rejected by some classes of impaired creditors. Plan confirmation requires the approval of at least one impaired class. Other impaired classes may vote against the plan and still be forced to accept it. Creditor - the owner of a claim. A credit committee is appointed to represent this class of claims. Debtor - the entity (a person or corporation) that has filed for bankruptcy.

Debtor-in-possession (DIP) **financing** - a form of secured financing obtained after a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filing. DIP financing is senior to all pre-existing claims. It generally carries a short maturity and comes with fairly restrictive covenants. DIP financing is often arranged in anticipation of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filing and becomes available as soon as the petition is filed.

2 impaired classes. If some classes agree but others dissent,  the judge can "cram down" the plan,  imposing it on the dissenters. In practice,  however,  cramdowns take place only after a long,  slow process of debate and negotiation.

Discharge of debts - At the end of the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process,  the judge releases the debtor from liability for pre-bankruptcy debts. In a Chapter 11 bankruptcy,  the debtor emerges from [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] with lesser debts as specified by the plan of reorganization. In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy,  the assets of the company have been sold,  and the proceeds distributed to creditors. A discharge of debts must obey the rules of absolute priority.

Exclusivity period - the initial 120-day period immediately following the petition date during which the debtor has the exclusive right to file the plan of reorganization. The period may be extended at the judge's discretion. After the expiration of the exclusivity period,  creditors are free to submit their own plan or plans.

Fraudulent transfer - transfer of assets from the company when the company is insolvent,  makes the company insolvent,  or is not at fair market value.

Impaired claim - A claim that under a given plan of reorganization will return less than 100 cents on the dollar to its owners. Creditors whose claims are impaired but not wiped out have the right to vote on the plan of reorganization. (Owners of claims that are wiped out,  for example,  common stockholders are "deemed to reject" the plan and do not vote.)
Involuntary petition - a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filing submitted by the creditors of a company rather than the company itself. An involuntary petition requires the participation of no fewer than three creditors with *bona fide* claims of at least $10,  000.

Liquidation - In Chapter 7,  the process by which the debtor’s assets are identified and sold,  and the proceeds distributed to creditors. Liquidation is administered by a government-appointed trustee.

Liquidation value is an estimate of the current market value of the assets.

Plan of reorganization - A document that identifies the various classes of claims against a company and how they will be treated in the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process. This document lays out the plan for the company's emergence from [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court. It must be confirmed by at least one impaired class of creditors in order to be put into effect. The plan is generally developed in a negotiated process between the company and its creditors under the oversight of the judge.

Prepackaged Bankruptcy (Prepack) - A method of filing for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in which the debtor negotiates a plan of reorganization with its creditors,  and solicits a vote of the impaired classes in advance of its [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petition. The pre-negotiated plan of reorganization and a description of the solicitation are submitted to the court at the same time as the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petition. Prepackaged [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] can greatly shorten the amount of time a firm spends in bankruptcy.

Secured debt - Debt for which the creditor has the right to pursue specific pledged property upon default. Unsecured claims generally include trade payables to vendors who sold items or services on standard open terms without collateral. Trustee - In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy,  a trustee is appointed to administer the liquidation of assets and the distribution of proceeds to the creditors. In some Chapter 11 situations,  a Trustee is assigned in cases where there has been fraud or serious mismanagement.

Voluntary petition - A [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filing submitted by the company itself. Voluntary petitions are much more prevalent than involuntary ones.

Vote on the plan of reorganization - Creditors with impaired claims have the right to vote by class on any plan of reorganization. A class is deemed to approve a plan if two-thirds in amount and one-half in number of the creditors in that class voted to accept the plan.
