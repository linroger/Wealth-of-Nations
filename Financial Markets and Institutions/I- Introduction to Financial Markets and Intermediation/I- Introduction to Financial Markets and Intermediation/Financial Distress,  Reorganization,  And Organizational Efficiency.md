# Financial Distress,  Reorganization,  And Organizational Efficiency

This paper examines financial distress and its effect on organizational efficiency. Imperfect information and conflicts of interest among the firm's claimholders influence the outcome of financial distress. Methods for resolving distress and controlling conflicts of interest are discussed. New evidence on financial restructuring and distress costs is presented along with evidence on the organizational restructuring that accompanies financial distress. The evidence demonstrates that financial distress has benefits as well as costs,  and that financial and ownership structure affect the net costs.

## 1. Introduction

Financial distress has changed dramatically over the last decade,  in part because of major changes in the law and in financial markets. Since the adoption of the Bankruptcy Reform Act in October 1979,  the number of Chapter 11 petitions has increased greatly. In 1980,  the first full year after the new [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] act,  the number of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petition filings increased 85% to 5,  637,  up from 3,  042 in 1979. In addition,  since October 1979 there have been more than 20 Chapter 11 filings involving over $1 billion in liabilities.' Texaco's Chapter 11 filing in April 1987 was the largest in U.S.

history,  with $21.6 billion in liabilities; Campeau filed the second largest [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petition,      in January 1990,      with $9.9 billion in liabilities. The size of the liabilities and the circumstances surrounding many of the filings - legal judgments,  product-liability claims,  labor problems,  leveraged acquisitions and [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts]] - have stimulated debate and controversy among the press,  investors,  and researchers.

In financial markets over the last decade,  firms began to substitute public original-issue high-yield debt,  so-called junk bonds,  for commercial loans from the banking and insurance sector. The number of new high-yield debt offerings increased from 22 in 1977 to a peak of 217 in 1986,  falling to 111 in 1989.' Through both takeovers and voluntary changes in capital structure,  high-yield debt has facilitated the restructuring of many U.S. corporations. In addition,  the development of a liquid market for high-yield debt focused attention on private workouts and [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] often used by firms to resolve financial distress. The number of investors buying and selling the securities of distressed firms and the capital available for such investments has grown spectacularly. Some of these 'vulture capitalists' accumulate positions and participate directly in negotiations to reorganize the firm.

Financial distress is an emerging field steeped in confusion and complexity.

Some of the confusion can be resolved by understanding the diverse nature of financial distress; it is not synonymous with corporate death. Firms in distress face a variety of situations having very different effects on their values and claimholders. This diversity,  in conjunction 'with conflicts of interest among ciaimholders,  leads to an information problem that makes valuing a distressed firm difficult. The valuation problems exacerbate the conflicts of interest. Section 2 of this paper discusses the nature of financial distress,  conflicts of interest,  and the information problem facing a distressed firm's claimholders. Firms can resolve financial distress privately through a workout or liquidation,  or under the supervision of the Bankruptcy Court.

Section 3 discussed the methods available for resolving distress and evidence on the factors affecting their use.

Until recently,  research on financial distress focused on distress costs and financial restructuring. The possibility that financial distress could result in beneficial outcomes was generally ignored. New empirical evidence demonstrates that financial distress has both benefits and costs,  and that financial and ownership structure affect the net costs. Financial distress is often accompanied by comprehensive organizational changes in management,  governance,  and structure. This organizational restructuring can create value by improving the use of resources. For example,  individual firms in declining industries tend to continue to operate and invest in economic activities even though efficiency dictates a capacity reduction. Financial distress frees resources to move to higher-valued uses by forcing managers and directors to reduce capacity and to rethink operating policies and strategy decisions. This kind of organizational change is unlikely to occur in an all-equity firm,

because without leverage,  poor performance does not lead to financial distress. It is financial distress that gives creditors a legal right to demand restructuring. Section 4 discusses the benefits and costs of financial distress,  and presents evidence on the performance of distressed firms in Japan. Section 5 concludes.

## 2. Financial Distress,  The Information Problem,  And Conflicts Of Interests 2. I. A Definition Of Financial Distress

This paper defines financial distress as a situation where cash flow is insufficient to cover current obligations. These obligations can include unpaid debts to suppliers and employees,  actual or potential damages from litigation,  and missed principal or interest payments under borrowing agreements

(default). Technical default,  the violation of a debt covenant other than one specifying principal and interest payments (e.g.,  minimum-net-worth requirements or working-capital constraints),  can be a warning that distress is imminent. Financial distress generally leads to negotiations with at least one of the firm's creditors. Cross-default provisions are debt [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] in which default on one debt security is a condition for technical default on another.

Such provisions result in much more complicated negotiations to resolve distress.

Some confusion arises because the word insolvent is often used as a synonym for financial distress. Insolvency can be interpreted as pertaining to stocks or flows,  and the two are often confused. For example,  *Webster's New* World Dictionmy (Second College Edition) defines 'insolvent' first as 'not enough to pay all debts' and then as 'unable to pay debts as they become due'. A stock-based definition describes as insolvent a firm with a negative economic net worth: the present value of its cash flows is less that its total obligations.' A firm in financial distress is insolvent on a how basis,  it is unable to meet current cash obligations? Flow-based insolvency gives unpaid creditors the right to demand restructuring because their contract with the fit-m has been breached. If a firm is insolvent on a stock basis,  but solvent on a flow basis,  it creditors have little power,  because their claims are paid to date. Creditors can expect little help from shareholders in such a situation

3This should not be confused with negative net worth in an accounting sense. The accounting balance sheet for a healthy firm can show total assets less than total liabilities. For example,  Sealed Air Corporation,  a New York Stock Exchange firm,  completed a leveraged recapitalization in July 1989 that left it with a negative accountin,  0 net worth of over $160 million. The company has had no problems meeting debt service and is a year ahead of schedule in paying off its debt [Wruck (199OJj.

'Ahman (1983) discusses in detail the different ways insolvency is defined. He Labels the flow definition of insolvency 'technical insolvency' and the stock definition as 'insolvency in a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] sense'.

because their equity claims are still valuable. In the unlikely event that firm value increases dramatically,  shareholders capture the benefits.

Bankruptcy and liquidation are also used as synonyms for financial distress.

In this paper,  bankruptcy refers to the court-supervised process for breaking and rewriting contracts. Liquidation refers to a sale of the firm's assets and distribution of proceeds to claimants.

## 2.2. The Information Problem And Confiicts Of Interest

The information problem faced by a distressed firm's claimholders is how to obtain reliable data to determine whether the firm is insolvent on a stock,  as well as a flow basis. The extreme examples presented in fig. 1 help illustrate the problem. It shows actual cash flows for two firms. At time 1 the firms have identical historical cash flows,  and future cash flows through time 2 are identical. It is only after time 2 that cash flows will differ. At time 1 both firms become distressed. The firm in panel A is insolvent on both a stock and a flow basis - cash flow after time 1 is permanently lower than the level of obligations. The panel B firm is insolvent on a flow basis only. Its cash flow will return to pre-distress levels after time 2.

The information problem boils down to deciding whether a distressed firm's situation is better described by panel A or panel B. It is important because the value-maximizing way to resolve distress differs between panels.

The panel B firm can meet its obligations by persuading claimants to agree to a new payment schedule. Except for the costs of renegotiating,  it suffers no penalty for financial distress. Resolving distress for the panel A firm requires major effort,  including reducing fixed claims or reorganizing (if feasible) in a way that creates enough value to cover the claims.

At the time of financial distress (time 1) investors know the history of actual cash flows,  but must make predictions about future cash flows with incomplete information. This can lead to honest disagreement about the firm's future prospects. Even if all parties could accurately predict future cash flows,  there would still be conflict over the best way to resolve distress,  because different reorganization policies distribute wealth across managers,  creditors,  and shareholders differently. Therefore,  reorganization policies are advocated both out of concern for value maximization and out of self-interest. Where the two differ,  there is potential for value-destroying behavior. As discussed in detail in section 4.4.1,  the rules of the game for reorganization in the U.S. exacerbate these conflicts.

In pursuing their own interests,  claimants have incentives to present biased and inaccurate data as though it were unbiased and accurate. Shareholders have incentives to claim the firm is insolvent only on a flow basis (like the panel B firm) because it increases the likelihood that they will retain their equity stake and therefore preserve the option value of their claim. Creditors have incentives to claim the firm is insolvent on a stock basis (like the panel A firm) because it increases the likelihood that they will be awarded the equity. Managers have an incentive to side with the party less likely to fire them. Resolving these conflicts consumes resources and in the extreme can destroy huge amounts of value. For example,  a panel B firm can be turned into a panel A firm as claimants fight over the distribution of weahh,  or if a value-reducing reorganization policy is chosen because it furthers the interests of a persuasive class of claimants.

 ![500](Preview%202024-09-26%2004.47.13.png)

Panels A and B illustrate actual cash flows for two firms that become flow-based insolvent at time 1. Investors in a distressed firm face an information problem - they cannot tell whether their firm has cash flows more like those in panel A or B. The firm in panel A is insolvent due to a permanent reduction in cash flow,  while the firm in panel B is insolvent due to a temporary reduction in cash flow - at time 2 its cash flow returns to a pre-distress level. Cash flows at the time of financial distress are identical for the two firms. At time 1. no one has both the relevant information about cash flows and the incentive to reveal it to the firm's claimholders. Out of self-interest shareholders will argue that panel B represents the firm's situation,  while creditors will argue that panel A is more realistic. Managers will tend to side with the party less likely fire them.

The most reliable estimate of future cash flows can be obtained when accurate information is shared by managers and claimholders. Managers generally have better information about the firm's internal operations than outside investors,  but they may lack the ability or incentives to make the best use of that information. A management team committed to a poor strategy or to preserving its control over the firm is using its superior information to make poor decisions. Despite their lack of detailed information about the firm's operations,  both creditors and shareholders are often better able to assess the firm's situation. Large creditors have employees who are expert analysts,  and in addition creditors sometimes receive special reports from the firm containing information not available to the public. Active shareholders are often better able to assess industry trends,  the firm's strategy,  and the effectiveness of top management. Unfortunately,  no party has both the information and incentives to reveal that information to others.

Workout specialists,  whose reputation suffers if they mislead claimholders,  could help solve the information problem. As such a specialist,  Drexel Burnham Lambert's ability to execute hundreds of [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] in the high-yield market suggests that its reputation played a role in attenuating information problems. The role of specialists in resolving financial distress quickly and inexpensively has been drastically curtailed with the demise of Drexel and by recent court decisions. In particular,  Judge Lifland's January 1990 decision in the LTV [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] case makes it more costly to resolve distress outside the courtroom. He ruled that LTV's bondholders who participated in out-of-court [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] before the firm's Chapter 11 filing were not entitled to a claim equal to the face value of their old bonds.

Instead their clainis were limited to the market value of their new bonds.

Since this decision only one major private workout has been successfully completed,  and it was structured to circumvent the effect of his ruling should the firm later file Chapter 11.5

jsee 'U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rules in Favor of LTV',  January 31,  1990. Reuters Newswire.

The successful workout referred to above was an exchange offer completed on February 5,  I99O

by SCI TV. The company,  formerly owned by Storer,  went private and was later taken public by UR and George Gillett in 1987. All of SCl's banks and 95% of its publicly traded debt participated in the restructuring. Each creditor class agreed to approximately the same ProPortional reduction in its claims,  so that in the event of Chapter 11 it would suffer the same percentage reduction in its allowable claims. (See 'SC1 TV Completes Exchange Offer Or Notes,  Debentures',  February 5,  1990,  Reuters Newswire.)

## 3. Resolving Financial Distress

Financial distress is resolved in an environment of imperfect information and conflicts of interest. Yet evidence on the frequency distribution of outcomes for firms in distress proves that it is not synonymous with corporate death. Financial distress is often resolved through private workouts or legal reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Only much more rarely are distressed firms liquidated under Chapter 7 of the code. Fig. 2 traces firms in financial distress to their final outcomes based on data from five empirical studies. From left to right the figure presents the sample criteria for each study and follows each set of sample firms to their final outcomes. Gilson (1989,  199O) and Gilson,  John,  and Lang (1990) provide evidence on the fate of firms that experienced extremely poor stock-price performance. Weiss (1990) and Morse and Shaw (1988) provide evidence on outcomes for firms filing Chapter 11.

## 3.1. Outcomes Conditional On Poor Stock-Price Performance

Gilson (1989,  199O) and Gilson,  John,  and Lang (1990) study New York

(NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) firms whose three-year cumulative stock-price performance is in the bottom 5% of all firms listed on the two exchanges between 1978 and 1987. Of these firms 51% become distressed,  either defaulting or restructuring their debt. The remaining 49% do not default or restructure their debt Of the distressed firms with available data,  47% (80) are able to resolve distress through a private workout.

In a workout,  the firm and its creditors renegotiate their contracts privately,  resolving distress without resorting to the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] courts.' The outcome of a workout can range from a one-time waiver of payment to a restructuring of all liabilities and equity claims. With publicly traded debt securities,  the restructuring is often achieved through an exchange offer in which the [[A Primer on Distressed Investing|distressed debt]] securities are exchanged for new debt securities and sometimes preferred or common stock. The remaining 53% (89) of the sample firms file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

## 3.2. Outcomes Conditional On Legal Bankruptcy

'Firms sometimes liquidate privately. Hite,  Owers,  and Rogers' (1987) sample contains 49 NYSE and AMEX firms that liquidated voluntarily and privately between 1963 and 1983. Their study does not provide evidence on the proportion of sample firms in financial distress.

The trees trace the frequency distribution of outcomes for firms in financial distress. The first box in each tree presents authors of the studies and summarizes their sample period. size,  and selection criteria. Gilson (1989. 1990) and Gilson,  John,  and Lang (1990) study a sample of 381 NYSE and AMEX firms with very poor three-year cumulative stock returns during the period 1978-1987. Weiss (1990) and Morse and Shaw (1988) study samples of 37 and 162 firms filing [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petitions in the periods 1980-1986 and 1973-1982,  respectively.

that file Chapter 11 whether or not they had extremely poor stock-price performance. A firm or its creditors can file for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] protection,  which provides a court-supervised setting in which to rewrite contracts with creditors. After a firm files for bankruptcy,  it continues to be run by the incumbent management team,  although if management has committed fraud or is proven incompetent,  the court appoints a trustee to manage the company.

Most firms entering Chapter 11 emerge after debtholders have agreed to exchange their original claims for new debt and/or equity in the company.

The new debt usually has smaller payments spread over more years. Weiss

(1990) studies the reorganization plans of 37 NYSE and AMEX firms that enter Chapter 11. Of the 37 firms,  95% (35) emerged from Chapter 11 under accepted reorganization plans and 5% (2) are eventually liquidated under Chapter 7. Morse and Shaw (1988) study post-Chapter 11 stock-price performance of 162 firms filing between 1973 and 1982. Of their sample firms,  60%

(98) emerge from Chapter 11 under reorganization plans,  7% (11) merge with other companies,  and 15% (25) liquidate under Chapter 7. Morse and Shaw could not determine with certainty the outcome for the remaining 17% *(28)* of their sample firms.

A firm liquidates by converting some or all of its assets to cash and distributing that cash to its claimants. When assets are less valuable to the firm than to a third party,  they can be sold piecemeal or as a productive group,  whichever yields the highest proceeds. Under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,  liquidation is supervised by the court. This means the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court judge oversees the conversion of the firm's assets into cash and the distribution of the proceeds to claimholders in order of their priority.

## 3.3. **The Role Of Organizational Form And Creditors** 3.3.1. Ecidence From The United States

Many previous studies of financial distress focus on estimating the unconditional probability that a firm will file bankruptcy.s These studies generally analyze matched samples of bankrupt and nonbankrupt firms,  using accounting information and other firm characteristics as explanatory variables. Gilson,  John,  and Lang (1990) estimate the probability of Chapter 11 conditional on poor stock-price performance. They study how asset and liability structures help predict whether financial distress is resolved through a private workout or through formal [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] under Chapter 11.

Financial Structure By design,  Gilson,  John,  and Lang's sample contains firms for which a large percentage of the equity value has been destroyed before a default. At the

*See,  for example,  Altman (1968) and Beaver (1966).

median,  firms in their sample that renegotiate their liabilities privately lose 50% of their equity value over the three years before the default,  and firms filing for Chapter 11 lose over 60% of their equity value. Gilson et al. find that private renegotiation is more likely the higher the ratio of bank debt to total liabilities. The more complex the firm's capital structure (as represented by the number of classes of debt),  the less likely private renegotiation is to be successful. These findings confirm some intuitive insights about bargaining and negotiation: more concentrated borrowings are easier to renegotiate,  and it is easier to negotiate with fewer groups. For managers concerned about their firm's ability to reorganize privately,  these results highlight the factors to consider when choosing a financing strategy.

## Asset Structure

Gilson et al. also find that when Tobin's Q (the ratio of market value to replacement cost of assets) is higher,  private renegotiation is more likely.

They interpret their results as evidence that private reorganization is more likely in distressed firms whose economic activities generate substantial [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets. This is true,  they argue,  because the value of [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets is more likely to be destroyed in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] than in a private workout.'

An alternative explanation for their results is that cross-sectional differences in Q reflect variation in the pre-distress capital structure as well as in the nature of firms' assets.

A simple numerical example illustrates how this happens. Consider two firms each worth $100,             with an asset replacement cost of $10 (equal to liquidation value). Firm 1 finances itself with $90 of debt and $10 of equity,  whereas firm 2 finances itself with $10 of debt and $90 of equity. Suppose that for each firm half the equity value is lost and the firm defaults,  entering the Gilson et al. sample. Firm 1 is worth $95 and has a Q of 9.5. Firm 2 is worth $55 and has a Q of 5.5. If firm 1 liquidates,  $85 of value is destroyed and debtholders receive only 11% of their claim. If firm 2 liquidates,             only $45 of value is destroyed and debtholders receive 100% of their claim. Firm l's debt and equityholders have stronger incentives to reorganize quickly,  and probably privately,  once default occurs. This has nothing to do with the nature of the firm's assets,  but rather with the control function of debt."

'Of course. if the value of [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets could be realized through a sale,  this would not be true.

'"This simple example assumes a gradual deterioration of value leading to distress rather than an exogenous shock affecting both firms simultaneously and identically. If,  for example,  a shock instantaneously reduced the value of both firms by S90. they would both be worth SIO at the time of distress and would probably resolve distress similarly.

## 3.3.2. International Finance

Most of the available evidence on financial distress is based on the experience of U.S. firms. Hoshi,  Kashyap,  and Scharfstein (1990) provide evidence on the experience of firms in Japan. They examine the industryadjusted investment and sales performance of 121 Japanese firms approaching financial distress between April 1978 and March 19S5." In selecting their sample,  Hoshi,  Kashyap,  and Scharfstein assume a firm is approaching distress when the ratio of [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Operating Income]] to interest expense (interest coverage) falls below one. Sample firms have one year of healthy coverage followed by two years of poor coverage.

The evidence of Hoshi et al. indicates that cross-sectional differences in financial structure explain differences in sample firms' performance. Strong ties to financial institutions and other firms are associated with higher investment and sales performance during distress. The 49 sample firms that are members of a keiretsu - a group of firms with product-market ties and cross-share ownership that are centered around a set of banks and financial institutions - invest and sell more during periods of financial distress. Highly concentrated bank borrowings are also associated with superior performance.

For Japanese firms,  close bank lending relationships and equity ownership go together. On average,  the largest lender holds 23% of the firm's bank debt and 4% of its equity. The shareholdings of the top lender,  however,  are not statistically significant as an explanatory variable for firm performance.

The implications of the results in Hoshi et al. for U.S. firms are difficult to determine because the financial structures associated with superior performance by Japanese firms in financial distress are illegal in the U.S. The Glass-Steagall Act prevents banks from holding large equity positions in firms. including the firms that borrow from them. Prowse (1990) reports that in Japan,  commercial banks own 20.5% of equity securities. Japanese insurance companies own 17.7% and pension funds 5.3%. In the U.S.,  insurance companies and pension funds own 5.2% and 14.5%,  respectively. For antitrust reasons,  U.S. regulations also discourage cross-share ownership within industries [Roe (1990)].

Following financial distress,  U.S. firms adopt ownership structures that look more like those of Japanese firms. Gilson (1990) finds that the concentration of equity ownership by outsiders (including creditors) increases following financial distress. The holdings of all 5% and greater outside blockholders increase from an average of 12.3% one year before distress to

"A disadvantage of using sales and investment as measures of firm performance is that they are not always positively associated with changes in value. Increased sales are not necessarily more profitable. and increased investment does not necessarily have a positive net present value.

Unless systematically bad decisions are being made by sample firms,  however,  these performance measures should not pose a large problem.

27.9% two years following distress. Creditors obtain an equity interest in the firm as part of the reorganization,  while outsiders assemble blocks of shares through open market trading. Under Glass-Steagall,  a bank working out a loan is granted a temporary exemption from the prohibition against equity ownership,  although it must sell any equity position it receives in exchange for debt forgiveness within two years. In addition,  the priority status of a lender can be reduced if the lender attempts to control decision-making at the borrowing firm. Gilson (1990) shows that banks take advantage of the exemption. Two years after the beginning of financial distress,  banks and insurance companies own 18.7% of sample firms' equity. For 20% of Gilson's sample firms,  banks receive equity as part of a private [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]. In these firms,  banks hold an average of 24% of the firm's equity.

The financial and ownership structures chosen by Japanese firms raise important issues for U.S. firms. If the keiretsu,  as an organizational form,  is superior to organizational forms allowed in the U.S. and if bank equity ownership (common not only in Japan,  but in Europe as well) improves firm performance,  then the U.S. regulatory system imposes large costs on domestic firms and on the economy.

## 4. Benefits And Costs Of Financial Distress

Previous studies of financial distress focus on the costs and ignore the possibility that distress can result in beneficial outcomes. This stems in part from a widely accepted model of the firm's capital-structure decision. For example,  in their textbook,  Brealey and Myers (1988,  p. 421) present the following simple formula for the value of a leveraged firm:

## Vulue Of Firm = Value If All Equity Financed + Pv Tax Shield - Pv Cost Of Financial Distress

where the *PV cost of financial distress* is the probability of financial distress multiplied by the expected costs (out-of-pocket plus indirect costs). According to this formula,  the firm chooses how much to borrow by balancing the tax benefits of leverage against the costs of an increased probability of financial distress. But this analysis is incomplete because it ignores both the nontax benefits of leverage and the benefits of financial distress. Therefore,  it understates the amount a firm should borrow.

## 4.1. Nontax Benefits Of Lecerage

Leverage provides discipline and monitoring not available to an all equity firm. According to free-cash-flow theory it creates value by imposing a discipline on organizations that reduces agency costs \[Jensen (1986)J. The value created by leverage does not necessarily come at the price of an increased probability of financial distress. A more efficiently run firm can carry a higher debt burden with an equal or reduced probability of financial distress.

Evidence on the improved operating performance of leveraged-buyout firms is consistent with this theory. Kaplan (1989b) and Smith (1990) find [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Operating Income]] increases by over 40% during the two to three years following a leveraged buyout. Baker and Wruck (1989) find that The O.M. Scott & Sons Company managed assets differently after its leveraged buyout than it had as an ITT subsidiary. Managers tried to increase value rather than 'make budget'. Production efficiency and working-capital management improved. Kaplan and Stein (1990) find that asset betas fall by 40% following leveraged recapitalizations. Evidence from Wisconsin Central Ltd. Railroad's

(WCL) leveraged buyout indicates that asset-beta reductions result from organizational changes. '* WCL's post-buyout strategy reduced operating leverage in a number of ways,  including reducing the number of yards and cars and running a 'just-in-time' railroad.

When liquidation or reorganization is the firm's highest-valued alternative.

default creates value by providing an event that triggers change. Financial distress gives creditors the right to demand restructuring because their contract with the firm has been breached. They can push the firm to liquidate or reorganize. Leverage can,  therefore,  lead to value maximization by triggering liquidation [Titman (1984)]. The value of a firm likely to liquidate too soon or linger too long is reduced.

Where firm value is deteriorating,  high leverage leads to an earlier default.

and simultaneously accomplishes two objectives. It preserves value when the alternative is a continued erosion of value,  and in doing so increases the likelihood that the firm will reorganize quickly and efficiently. Fig. 3 helps to illustrate this point. It shows two firms in the same business with the same liquidation value. One has chosen a high-leverage capital structure,  while the other has chosen low leverage. Assume the debt [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] are such that the firm defaults when the net present value of the firm's cash flows falls below the face value of its obligations. The value that triggers default is higher for the highly leveraged firm than for the less leveraged firm.

At the time of default the claimholders of the highand low-leverage firms face very different situations. If the high-leverage firm liquidates,  the value represented by area A is destroyed. A much smaller value represented by area B is destroyed if the low-leverage firm liquidates. The larger value at risk in liquidation gives the high-leverage firm's claimholders stronger incentives to reorganize quickly,  and probably privately,  once default occurs.

"See Burkhardt,  Jensen,  and Barry (1990).

 ![500](CleanShot%202024-09-26%20-002886@2x.png)

Fig. 3. Illustration of the incentive for more highly leveraged firms to reorganize privately.

The figure presents capital structures for highand low-leverage firms with identical initial values and liquidation values. Each firm defaults when the net present value of its cash flow falls below the face value of its obligations (firm value at default is denoted by the line labeled 'value that triggers default'). The high-leverage firm defaults at a value that is much higher than that for the low-leverage firm. Areas A and B represent the values that would be destroyed if the highor low-leverage firms,  respectively,  were liquidated after default. Because liquidation and [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] costs can destroy more value in the high-leverage tirm (in other words because area A > area B),  the high-leverage firm's claimholders have stronger incentives to reorganize quickly and outside [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court. In some situations,  however,  private reorganization is not a viable option. When the firm has a large number of independent and widely scattered claimants,  private reorganization is extremely dihicult and costly. For example,  a retailer with thousands of suppliers or a firm with product-liability problems might find private reorganization impossible. Even in this situation the incentives to resolve financial distress quickly are stronger for the high-leverage firm.

Though the high-leverage firm has a higher trigger value,  both firms could have the same value at default if an exogenous shock caused a substantial value reduction. If such exogenous shocks were the primary cause of distress,  the theory that debt preserves value by triggering early default would be suspect. Not all financial distress,  however,  is caused by exogenous shocks. If value declines gradually as the firm's industry deteriorates or as management wastes resources by pursuing a poor strategy,  the high-leverage firm defaults at a higher value and the waste and poor strategy are more likely to be eliminated. These causes of decline in value - exogenous shocks,  gradual deterioration,  and poor management decisionmaking - provide a beginning descriptive taxonomy of the causes of financial distress. The available empirical evidence on both the benefits and costs of distress,  and the importance of each of these causes,  are discussed below.

## 4.2. Benefits Of Financial Distress 4.2. I. Changes In Management And Gocemance

Poor management decisionmaking and weak governance can lead to financial distress. Incumbent managers and directors can also inhibit a firm's ability to recover if new or special skills are required to turn the firm's performance around. Gilson (1989,  199Ol documents changes in top management and boards of directors following financial distress. His sample includes firms whose cumulative three-year stock return is in the bottom 5% of all firms on the NYSE and AMEX. In spite of their poor performance,  over half of his sample firms do not default. These firms have an average three-year stock return of -50.2%,  whereas the three-year stock return for firms experiencing distress is -68.9%. The nondistressed firms have a 19% annual turnover in top management - somewhat higher than the normal turnover rate of 12% for a random sample of NYSE and AMEX firms [Warner,  Watts,  and Wruck (1988)]. On the other hand,  the distressed firms experience a 52% annual turnover of top management. These results are consistent with the idea that leverage acts as a catalyst for organizational change. Poor stock-price performance is not enough to remove incumbent managers,  but financial distress provides a mechanism to initiate top-management changes.

Turnover among directors is also high following distress. Gilson finds that within four years after the onset of financial distress only 47% of old directors still hold their seats. Eight percent of the firms replace their entire board. He also finds that boards of directors are restructured following financial distress; for 60% of his sample firms,  the size of the board shrinks following distress. Consistent with a loss of reputation,  departing directors subsequently serve on fewer boards.

## 4.2.2. Changes In Organizational Strategy And Structure

Some firms in financial distress undergo dramatic organizational changes as part of their recovery,  refocusing their strategy and undertaking restructurings. Often some assets are sold,  while others are reorganized and restaffed.

The U.S. steel industry is an example. Increased international competition in steel during the 1980s forced many U.S. steel firms into financial distress.

Some firms,  such as Wheeling-Pittsburgh,  filed under Chapter 11. Others,  such as Inland Steel,  restructured privately. These firms reduced their fixed obligations and employment,  and refocused operations to produce primarily specialty steel products.

Such reorganizations illustrate how financial structure interacts with investment decisions; financial distress forces a change in the firm's economic activities and the way these activities are organized. These restructurings often create value for the firm's claimholders. The same reorganizations probably would have created value before financial distress,  but the impetus for change provided by distress was absent. Financial distress can,  therefore,  force managers to undertake value-increasing organizational changes they would not have otherwise undertaken. For example,  in its August 1990 Preliminary Report on the Financial Condition of the Donald J. Trump Organization Post Restructwing,  the State of New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety reported that financial distress had forced management to rethink its strategy: financial distress has created a crisis atmosphere wherein debt service payments cannot now be satisfied out of the operating cash flow and has forced the Company to rethink its entire strategy and capital structure.

In this case,  excessive debt has acted as a powerful agent for change and,  ironically,  has served as a brake on management mistakes. It may very well be that the greatest hope for preserving value lies in a quick and efficient reorganization and workout process - a privatized [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of sorts - outside the courtroom.

Without outside intervention,  management often fails to change strategy,  or is unaware that the company's strategy is the wrong one. Examples of situations in which financial distress forced managers to refocus,  or where the absence of distress allowed managers to preside over a deteriorating firm,  illustrate this point. Revco is an example of the former. Shortly after Revco's LBO,  a new CEO was appointed who changed the company's strategy from one of 'everyday low prices' to mini-department stores (a cash-intensive strategy change). Revco's stores began carrying television sets and small appliances. The merchandise didn't sell and the strategy was a failure. Within six months the firm defaulted and another new CEO was appointed to change it strategic direction.

Massey Ferguson exemplifies the management of a deteriorating firm in the absence of financial distress. Baldwin and Mason (1983) report that the market value of the company's equity fell from $505 million to $100 million between 1976 and 1980. During this period management closed facilities,  laid off employees and sold assets,  but made no major change in how the firm was run. Finally,  in March 1979,  the CEO resigned and a new manager was appointed. In late 1980 the firm began restructuring its claims through a private workout.

When firm value deteriorates as a result of poor management or when firm value is highest in liquidation and management refuses to liquidate,  financial distress creates value. But the. process of recovering from distress can create value even if the events leading to distress are out of management's control.

For example,  consider a firm pushed into financial distress by an exogenous shock. The process of recovery provides an opportunity to create value by reassessing the firm's strategy and restructuring its operations. This does not mean that the effects of the shock can be completely reversed,  but rather that management can make decisions that improve the firm's depressed state.

## 4.2.3. Benefits Of Chapter 11

In their analysis,  Gilson et al. assume that Chapter 11 is always a worse outcome than a private renegotiation. In some special situations,  however,  the ability to enter Chapter 11 is a valuable alternative for securityholders.

For example,  trade creditors and claimants in product-liability suits,  are numerous and have heterogenous claims. Reaching a private agreement with all of them is very difficult. Under Chapter 11,  diffuse creditors can be dealt with as a single class,  making negotiation manageable and settling protracted disputes once and for all. For example,  before filing under Chapter 11,  Manville Corporation faced 20,  000 asbestos-related lawsuits and estimated that eventually another 32,  000 would be filed. Under Chapter 11,  all damage suits were stayed,  and present and future asbestos claimants were put in a single class A.H. Robbins filed under Chapter 11 following liability problems with its Dalkon Shield birth-control device. Other companies,  such as Braniff and Eastern Airlines,  have filed under Chapter 11 when faced with labor contracts that management viewed as too costly to allow the firm to survive.

13See Lewin (1990). As part of Manville's reorganization plan,  a trust was established to satisfy the claims of asbestos victims. The recent cash crisis in this trust calls into question the ability of Chapter 11 to resolve continuing litigation permanently,  since the reorganized company might be required to contribute additional funds to the trust.

Chapter 11 also allows for the issuance of new senior credit,  called

'[[Notes on Debtor-in-Possession DIP Financing|debtor-in-possession]] financing',  which can be crucial to the firm,  especially in retail businesses where trade credit is often necessary for survival. PreChapter 11 trade creditors and other unsecured creditors have low priority,  coming just before equityholders. Claims of creditors lending to the firm after it files under Chapter 11 are second in priority only to legal and administrative expenses. Distressed firms that require new credit have incentives to file under Chapter 11,  and potential creditors have incentives to withhold credit until after the filing. Campeau,  for example,  was able to secure new credit quickly after it filed under Chapter 11. In less than a month,  Campeau obtained a $700 million [[Notes on Debtor-in-Possession DIP Financing|debtor-in-possession]] credit facility,             $400 million for Federated from Citibank and $300 million for Allied from Chemical Bank.

## 4.3. Costs Of Financial Distress 4.3.1. Out-Of-Pocket Costs

The out-of-pocket or direct costs of financial distress are the easiest to measure. They include legal,  administrative,  and advisory fees paid by the company. Data on out-of-pocket costs are available for firms that restructure debt through an exchange offer or that file for bankruptcy. Gilson,  John,  and Lang (1990) present the only available evidence on the direct costs of private workouts. With a sample of 18 private [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]s,  they find that the median out-of-pocket cost of [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Restructuring Debt]] through an exchange offer is 0.32% of total assets measured at the fiscal year-end closest to the exchangeoffer date.

A number of studies provide evidence on the direct costs of bankruptcy.

The findings of four of them are summarized in table 1. Warner (1977a),

Altman (1984),  and Weiss (1990) all measure direct costs as a percentage of the market value of the firm one year before bankruptcy. They find that direct costs are quite small,  averaging between 3% and 4.5% of market value.

For firms that liquidate at the end of the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process,  Ang,  Chua,  and McConnell (1982) find that out-of-pocket costs are 7.5% of the liquidated value of the firm. The maximum out-of-pocket costs are 6.6% of market value in Weiss' sample and 9.8% in Warner's sample. Comparing the direct costs of private workouts with direct costs of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] suggests that out-of-pocket costs are almost ten times less when the firm is able to restructure debt privately

"Evidence relating the direct costs of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] to firm size is contradictory. In his sample of railroads,  Warner finds that direct costs as a percentage of market value are inversely related to size. He concludes that there are significant hxed costs of bankruptcy. Ang,  Chua,  and McConnell (1982) test for and find evidence supporting Warner's results in a sample of smaller firms. Weiss,  however,  does not find evidence of significant fixed costs. He argues that changes in

Table 1 Summary of evidence on the direct costs of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] from four studies covering 1933-1986

## 4.3.2. Indirect Costs

Indirect costs are opportunity costs imposed on the firm because financial distress affects its ability to conduct business as usual. A distressed firm is hampered on three fronts. First,  it loses the right to make certain decisions without legal approval. For example,  a firm in Chapter 11 cannot spend money or sell assets without court approval.

Second,  financial distress can reduce demand for the firm's product and increase its production costs. Demand falls if the value of the product to consumers depends on the firm's future performance and financial distress threatens the firm's ability to survive. Production costs increase if financial distress affects the firm's ability to negotiate favorable input prices or credit terms. Worried about the distressed firm's ability to pay its debts,  suppliers often charge a risk premium through increased prices,  tightened credit terms,  or poorer service. In addition,  it may be difficult to negotiate favorable terms,  prices,  and service if suppliers begin to view their relationship with the firm as a short-term one. The time that elapses between the first indication of distress and its resolution - a little over a year for private negotiations and a little under two and a half years for bankruptcies [Gilson,  John,  and Lang

(19901 and Weiss (199011 - indicates these issues can be persistent.

the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] code,  new financing techniques,  and differences in samples probably explain the differing results.

Third,  management spends considerable time resolving financial distress.

The value of this time is generally considered an indirect cost,  but not all the time is lost. When management is engaged in productive restructuring and in implementing strategic change,  it is using its time to increase firm value.

Unless the time could have been spent more productively elsewhere,  its value should not be considered an indirect cost.

Estimating the indirect costs of financial distress is difficult because the costs represent lost opportunities. Available evidence is very mixed. Altman

(1984) estimates the unexpected loss in profits for three years before a Chapter 11 filing for eleven retailing and five industrial firms and uses this loss as a measure of the indirect costs of financial distress. This interpretation is problematic because it is impossible to tell whether the loss in profits is in fact caused by financial distress or whether financial distress is caused by the loss in profits. He finds the sum of direct and indirect costs (loss in profits)

averages 8.7% of market value one year before [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] for the retailing firms and 15.0% for the industrial firms. It is not surprising that the loss in profits should be smaller for retailing firms. Industrial firms are more likely to be selling products for which the future availability of service,  guarantees,  warranties,  parts,  and support is very important. In contrast to AItman,  Kaplan (1989) finds that the Campeau's sales were unharmed by its Chapter 11 filing. He concludes that the indirect costs of distress for this retailer were small.

Cutler and Summers (1988) estimate the indirect costs of Texaco's April 1987 [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filing using bond and stock-price data. Texaco acquired all of Getty Oil's common stock during a period when Getty had agreed to allow Pennzoil to acquire about 43% of its common stock at a lower price. Because Texaco had agreed to indemnify Getty against all lawsuits,  it was liable for damages when Pennzoil sued Getty for breach of contract. The litigation resulted in a court order that Texaco pay Pennzoil $12 billion in damages.

After the damages were upheld in appeals court,  Texaco filed a Chapter 11 petition. The companies attempted to agree on a settlement amount,  but failed until Carl Icahn purchased stock in both companies and helped bring about a final settlement of $3 billion.

The loss in the combined market values of Texaco and Pennzoil across all litigation and settlement events is the sum of the direct and indirect costs of financial distress. Cutler and Summers estimate the abnormal change in market value of debt and equity to be $2.1 billion. (Before Icahn's involvement in the settlement,             combined losses in market value were over $3 billion.) Subtracting total legal costs provides an estimate of the indirect costs of financial distress for Texaco. Cutler and Summers estimate the after-tax legal costs for both firms to be $525 million. Subtracting the direct costs from the total loss in value provides an estimate of $1.575 billion in indirect costs.

Texaco's market value was approximately $17 billion before the litigation

(book value of debt plus market value of equity). Therefore,  the indirect costs implied by stock-price changes amount to about 9% of firm value.

## 4.4. **Enforcement Of Absolute Priority Under Bankruptcy Law**

According to the absolute priority rule,  Chapter 11 reorganization plans must satisfy senior claimants completely before more junior claimants receive anything. The extent to which absolute priority is enforced by [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] courts has implications for the costs of financial distress as well as the pricing of securities; the value of contractually specified priority is negligible if the court does not systematically enforce it. Studies of reorganization plans consistently reveal,  however,  that absolute priority is not enforced. Warner

(1977a,  b) studies a sample of railroad bankruptcies between 1926 and 1955. He finds that absolute priority is not enforced and that this fact is reflected in the market prices of the firm's debt securities. In studying how the court determines whether a creditor's claim is satisfied,  he finds that accounting face values,  not market values,  are the basis for comparing old and new securities.

More recent reorganization plans for industrial companies are studied by Franks and Torous (1989) and Weiss (1990). Franks and Torous (1989) study the reorganization plans of 27 firms emerging from [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] between 1971 and 1986. The Bankruptcy Reform Act went into effect in October 1979,  so some of their sample firms reorganized under the old Chapter 10 and others under the new Chapter 11. They find that of the 27 plans 78% (21) show deviations from priority,  and that in 67% (18) shareholders receive some consideration when more senior claimants are not paid in full.

Evidence on the enforcement of absolute priority under Chapter 11 is presented in Weiss (1990). He studies the reorganization plans of 37 firms filing under Chapter 11 between 1980 and 1986. Each plan states the claims of each creditor class,  what each class receives under the plan,  and whether a class is 'impaired'. A class of creditors is impaired if its claims are not satisfied in full. If a plan describes a class as unimpaired and the class disagrees,  it can protest to the judge who makes the final decision. No rules specify acceptable valuation methods,  but in general accounting and not market values are the standard.

To study the violation of priority,  Weiss divides claimants into three classes - secured creditors,  unsecured creditors,  and equityholders - and studies whether absolute priority is enforced by noting which classes are impaired. If a class of claimants is impaired and a more junior class receives any value on its claims,  priority is violated. Weiss finds that absolute priority is enforced only 22% of the time. Seventy-eight percent of the reorganization plans violate absolute priority,  70% by giving a valuable claim to equityholders when unsecured creditors are impaired and 8% by giving a valuable claim to equityholders when both secured and unsecured creditors are impaired.

The detail on individual firms in Weiss' study shows some surprising outcomes. For example,  he finds that the reorganization plans of Imperial Industries and Richton International allowed equityholders to retain 100% of the firm's common stock even though Imperial Industries' unsecured creditors received only 37% of their claims and Richton International's only 60%.

Weiss demonstrates that absolute priority is violated more frequently for relatively large firms and for firms filing in the Southern District of New York. Among the 18 sample firms filing in New York's Southern District,  in only one case was absolute priority upheld. New York filings partially explain the results for large firms as well. Of the 20 firms in Weiss's sample with assets over $100 million where priority was violated,  14 filed under Chapter 11 in the Southern District of New York.

## 4.5. Why **Deciations From Priority Arise**

The rules governing [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in the U.S. encourage outcomes that deviate from absolute priority. Two factors are especially important in these outcomes: (9 the rights given to the firm's managers after it has filed for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and (ii) the reliance on a consensual voting process,  rather than a market process,  to reorganize the firm.

The U.S. is one of the few countries that leaves incumbent management in charge of a bankrupt firm." Once the firm is in bankruptcy,  not only do managers continue to make operating decisions,  but for 120 days after the Chapter 11 filing the managers have an exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan. The court often grants several extensions of this deadline.

Management has an additional 180 days from the filing date to obtain creditor and shareholder approval. If the firm fails to propose a plan or has had a plan rejected,  creditors can propose their own plan. For creditors to propose a plan,  however,  they must provide proof of values for claims to be issued and assets to be retained or sold. This requires costly appraisals and hearings. Management need only obtain the judge's agreement that the values assigned under its plan are 'fair and reasonable'. The higher cost to creditors of proposing their own plan,  in both time and money,  can lead them to accept a plan that results in a lower firm value,  i.e.,  that is inefficient and violates priority.

U.S. bankruptcy rules allow managers to make trade-offs between firm value and their personal well-being at the expense of the firm's claimholders.

For example,  if liquidation is the highest-valued strategy,  it is hard to imagine managers proposing it,  because they would lose their jobs. In addition,  it

%e 'Bankruptcy Law: A Sticky End',  The Economist,  February 24,  1990,  pp. 77-78.

becomes difficult for claimants to fire managers because the judge must approve the decision. In light of the information and incentive problems mentioned earlier,  it is clear that granting hiring and firing rights to shareholders or creditors is not a solution. A claimant class prefers managers that further its interests over managers that maximize value. It is hard to believe,  however,  that a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] judge is most qualified to make hiring and firing decisions.

Chapter 1 l's consensual reorganization process allows both impaired creditors and shareholders to vote on a plan. Because only impaired creditor classes and shareholders vote,  the plan determines who votes and which claimants vote together. Acceptance of a plan generally requires approval by all impaired creditor classes and shareholders. For each impaired class,  acceptance of a plan requires the approval of two-thirds in amount and a majority in number of the claims voted. For equityholders,  two-thirds of the shares voted must favor the plan. The court can 'cram-down' a reorganization plan,  however,  even if some impaired creditor classes or shareholders refuse to approve it,  if it views the plan as fair and equitable to all impaired classes.

This is generally interpreted as meaning that claimholders receive at least what they would have received in liquidation [Altman (1983,  pp. 13 - 3111.

Granting shareholders the right to vote gives them power to transfer value from creditors. For example,  if the firm is insolvent on a stock basis,  there is no value left for shareholders after creditors are paid. The right to vote and to hold up the process allows shareholders to extract valuable claims. On the other hand,  excluding shareholders from the voting implies that,  if the firm were insolvent on a flow basis only,  creditors would be overcompensated because they would be awarded the entire value of the firm.

Information and incentive problems could be solved if a reliable third-party estimate of firm value could be obtained. Were firm value known,  the court could distribute it to claimants in order of priority. As discussed earlier,  creditor,  shareholder,  and management estimates are unreliable. Easterbrook

(1990) suggests that if the market for distressed corporate assets is not too thin,  auctioning the firm's assets to a third party and distributing the proceeds to claimholders would improve the efficiency of the U.S. bankruptcy process. Holding an auction that allowed the firm's claimholders to bid would quickly eliminate the opportunistic value estimates promoted by the current [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] process; to back up an estimate each group would have to put its own money on the table. The winning bidder would decide whether to keep the incumbent management team. In some countries,  such as Germany,  bankrupt companies are auctioned routinely. The U.S. legal system,  however,  refuses to rely on markets to determine values. Out-of-court workouts can circumvent some of the problems with Chapter 11 but,  as mentioned earlier,  recent court decisions are discouraging this activity.

## 5. Conclusions

Financial distress affects more than the firm's financial structure. It triggers a process of organizational change that has the potential to create value for the firm's claimholders. The costs of financial distress must be weighed against the benefits to determine its net effect on the organization's claimholders. Direct costs of financial distress average 3.5% of market value.

Estimates of indirect costs are less reliable,  but evidence to date indicates they lie in the range of 9% to 15% of market value. Financial distress triggers changes in management and governance. Although the benefits of distress have not yet been quantified,  turnover in top management and changes in governance indicate that corporate insiders are disciplined for poor performance. Evidence from clinical studies and case studies documents changes in strategy and organizational structure following financial distress that are consistent with a process of corporate revitalization.

The legal rules of the game in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] create conflicts of interest among claimholders. The conflicts lead to complex information and inference problems for claimholders trying to value a distressed firm. These problems can be solved by encouraging the development of a liquid market for distressed companies' assets and allowing bankrupt firms to be auctioned.

Other countries,  such as Germany,  have successfully developed such systems. In the absence of the legal system's willingness to rely on markets,  the information and incentive problems associated with Chapter 11 can be attenuated by encouraging private workouts. Creating an environment friendly to workouts helps firms avoid Chapter 11 and allows actors in financial markets to play a role in resolvin g distress. Unfortunately,  recent court decisions suggest the U.S. is moving away from,  rather 'than toward,  this solution. New tax laws further damage distressed companies. The 1990 tax act imposes new taxes on troubled companies by,  among other things,  making it more difficult to structure nontaxable [[Class Note 6 Restructuring Public Debt Out of Bankruptcy Exchange Offers|Exchange Offers]] and making debt forgiveness taxable to the firm. The result will be more [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filings.

Management can affect the difficulty of recontracting through its financing decisions. A financial structure that aligns the interests of various claimholders,  for example strip financing where creditors hold equity,  reduces incentives for claimants to jockey for advantage in the event of distress. Financial structures in which creditors hold equity are common in Japan and Germany,  and in both of these countries financial distress is generally resolved through private workouts.

Finally,  it is important to consider whether there is a value-maximizing way to avoid distress entirely. Arbitrarily reducing leverage will succeed in avoiding distress,  but is unlikely to results in value maximization. Both tax benefits and the organizational and incentive benefits of leverage would be lost.

Rather the solution lies in aligning the interests of management with the interests of the firm's shareholders. The firm's financing policy,  governance structure,  and compensation policies can all be used to bring about this solution.
