# WSJ-Sizing Up the Fed’s Historic Coronavirus Crisis Intervention

The Federal Reserve has calmed crucial parts of the markets,  but other portions of the financial system remain stressed.

The central bank announced aggressive measures over the past month,  pledging to buy assets from Treasurys to corporate-bond funds to municipal debt. It has pumped liquidity into short-term cash markets. It has even arranged to lend directly to companies.

“The amount of measures taken in a short amount of time is surreal and unprecedented, ” said Jean Boivin,  head of the BlackRock Investment Institute.

For now,  according to traders,  market stresses [triggered by the coronavirus pandemic](https://archive.is/o/IsIqk/https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/coronavirus-2020-04-06) have eased. But strains remain. Borrowing cash required for day-to-day operations,  for example,  still costs companies more than it should. Analysts said key details around certain Fed facilities remain unclear,  and some of its actions have yet to begin. And assets that haven’t been backed by the Fed,  including commercial mortgage-backed securities,  are still in distress.

Here are some of the key moves the Fed has announced,  what has happened to date and how markets have reacted:

**Market reaction:** Treasurys rallied after the surprise announcement. Analysts in the bond market said that while the purchases were a good first step,  other assets,  including corporate debt,  needed support. The yield on the U.S. 10-year note fell to 0.724%,  compared with 0.97% in the previous trading session. Yields fall as bond prices rise.

**Market reaction:** S&P 500 futures dropped by their maximum of 5% that evening,  with analysts saying the cut—which investors had expected—signaled the central bank’s alarm about the fallout from the virus.

**Market targeted:** Treasury repurchase agreements.

**Market reaction:** The cost of borrowing short-term in repo markets didn’t fall immediately. Repo rates remained elevated after the Fed committed $1.5 trillion in the days following the announcement,  but funding has since improved over the past few weeks. Overnight and longer-term repo rates are now low and stable,  according to dealers.

**Market targeted:** currencies

**Market reaction:** The effects took time to seep through the market. Demand for dollars against the euro declined,  while Japanese demand for the U.S. currency remained high until last week. Rates on cross-currency basis swaps,  contracts in which one party borrows currency from another and lends its own currency in return,  were deeply negative in mid-March,  signaling a surge in demand for dollars. Use of the Fed’s central-bank swap lines jumped by $349 billion.

**Market targeted:** agency asset-backed securities,  agency commercial mortgage-backed securities,  investment-grade debt

**Market reaction:** This facility has broadly soothed nerves in fixed-income markets,  including agency-backed mortgages,  but analysts remain concerned about other distressed assets. Those include commercial and residential mortgages not guaranteed by the government that hedge funds and real-estate investment trusts are selling. JPMorgan’s Matthew Jozoff estimates that more than $1.9 trillion of securitized products remain in distress.

**Market targeted:** Treasurys,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  certificates of deposit,  municipal bonds

**Market reaction:** Signs of stress are easing,  and investors have put money back into U.S. money-market funds. Most important,  analysts said targeted lending programs have created room for dealers to set prices and match buyers with sellers. In the money markets,  bank commercial deposits and longer-dated [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] have begun to trade again.

The Fed said it would buy investment-grade debt issued by companies such as [Intel](https://archive.is/o/IsIqk/https://quotes.wsj.com/INTC) Corp. and [PepsiCo](https://archive.is/o/IsIqk/https://quotes.wsj.com/PEP) Inc.,  along with exchange-traded funds of highly rated bonds. The Fed also said it would lend money directly to businesses,  bypassing banks with bridge loans of up to four years.

**Market targeted:** investment-grade [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]]

**Market reaction:** Goldman Sachs analysts and others said the actions helped to stabilize the corporate-bond market,  which came under significant stress. But investors and rating firms remain concerned that companies will default or be downgraded as dwindling revenue makes meeting financial obligations a struggle.

**Market targeted:** asset-backed securities

**Market reaction:** Traders and investors remained uncertain about the timing of the facility and which assets are eligible,  limiting its impact. Investment-grade securities have recuperated some losses

Date: March 31st

**Policy:** Main Street lending facility

The Fed said it would launch a facility to help businesses too small to receive aid from the corporate-lending facilities but too large for a separate Small Business Administration program.

**Market targeted:** midsize companies

**Market reaction:** The Fed hasn’t announced any details of this program,  which involves making decisions on who receives loans for businesses other than banks,  something it hasn’t attempted on a wide scale since the Great Depression.

**Market targeted:**Treasurys,  agency mortgage-backed securities

**Market reaction:** Analysts said asset purchases have helped normalize the Treasury market. The Fed has bought more than $900 billion of Treasurys and guaranteed mortgage-backed securities over three weeks. Treasury bill yields are now trading near zero.

**Date:** March 23

**Market targeted:** currencies

**Market reaction:** Priya Misra,  head of interest-rate strategy at TD Securities,  said the facility should help foreign central banks get their hands on U.S. dollars without selling Treasurys. Foreign official accounts sold $110 billion of Treasurys held in custody at the New York Fed over the past month. “By lowering the extent of potential selling,  the Fed is reducing the pressure on Treasurys and dealer balance sheets, ” said Ms. Misra.
