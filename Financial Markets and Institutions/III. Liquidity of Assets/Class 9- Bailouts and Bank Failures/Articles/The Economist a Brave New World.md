## A Brave New World

The transition from banking may make financial services cheaper and fairer. But it will threaten privacy and sovereignty
Nobody likes **banks. Their technology is often primitive. Their** users are hit with unpredictable fees. Their functions matter,  yet their coverage is incomplete. This can relegate swathes of people in rich countries and entire populations of poor ones to the fringes of society. Many of the biggest make most profits from trading and fees,  not providing services to ordinary customers. And worst of all,  their failures can cause catastrophic damage for which they bear only a fraction of the costs.

It would seem rational,  therefore,  to cheer the fierce new competition that is reducing banks' traditional role. As capital markets expand,  it is becoming easier to match assets with liabilities that naturally fund them,  reducing the risk of bank runs or failures. A proliferation of payment technologies is upending how people and firms conduct their lives,  giving millions of underserved customers previously unimaginable access to finance. Data can be used instead of assets to secure loans,  making it possible for people and businesses to borrow money against their character,  not their collateral. The great promise of fi nance can be offered to many more people.

The great costs are diminished. Betterinformed firms should also temper the instability inherent in today's form of credit provision.

But this revolution brings with it new problems. Because they benefit from network effects,  payment platforms will tend to concentrate into just one or two giant intermediaries. As more activity migrates away from banks,  existing monetarypolicy mechanisms may become obsolete. The risk of losing control over the monetary system has lit a fire underneath usually staid central bankers. Projects to accelerate fast payment systems have cropped up worldwide. So have efforts to create centralbank digital currencies,  a digital form of paper cash to compete with the digital payments of private giants. In China,  where payments firms are most advanced,  more than 100,  000 people are already using a digital yuan in pilot projects.

The rollout of what amounts to a new monetary system thus comes with risks. Many of the issues it raises are as tricky as the fi nancial stability and inclusion problems of old. As people move their money into cbdc**s they will pull it out of banks,  threatening**
the system developed to foster loans without overt state interference in credit allocation. The digital involvement of the central bank in everyday transactions would not only increase the risk of such interference but also be a gift to those wishing to snoop on citizens. And the concentration of the economy in digital money,  whether it is run by private firms or by a central bank,  could provide a new route for malicious actors to destabilise systems through cyberwarfare.

Yet there should be ways to minimise each of these problems.

The best defence against the unhealthy spreading of state influence over lending decisions is to keep the current fractional reserve system alive. This may mean constraining the scope of cbdc**s and managing them at arm's length from the central bankâ€”** perhaps through third parties. They should not pay interest and the value of their balances should perhaps be capped. CBDCs may risk empowering authoritarians,  but in democratic countries there is usually adequate separation of powers within government to stop this.

To some observers,  it might seem better if central bankers in democratic,  capitalist countries eschew this thicket of problems altogether. But the problem with abstaining from creating cbdcs is that network effects do not stop at national or currency boundaries. Ant can reach 400m customers outside China through its partners. Imagine a currency crisis in an emerging country a decade from now,  when people and businesses can choose to make and collect payments in yuan instead of in their local currency,  in the time that it takes to generate a qr **code on a phone.**
For small countries,  cbdc**s may seem necessary merely to hang**
onto their monetary sovereignty. The bigger question is what the central bankers behind the world's reserve currencies should do. If they do not issue their own digital money they leave open two possible paths. One is that they become reliant on private firms such as Facebook. The other is that their currencies are sidelined by those with easytouse digital money,  notably China.

This risk may seem quite small for now.

And Chinese capital controls still stand in the way. Moreover global citizens might value privacy more than cheap,  instant,  crossborder payments. But it is still unsettling,  especially since digital money could become a method of social control. China has already experimented with programming digital cash: it issued stimulus payments that expired if they went unused so as to kickstart the economy more effectively. In a world without physical cash,  programmed money could restrict its use to stop it being spent on,  say,  foreign books or newspapers.

Central bankers that run reserve currencies can head off the potential nightmare of leaving Facebook or China's government in charge of global payment systems by issuing digital currencies of their own. If they do it sensibly,  digital money could even become a force for good,  not just a defence against disaster. "There is a parallel with biological evolution,  " said Sir Jon Cunliffe of the Bank of England in March. Evolution is generally slow,  but at times of geological or environmental change it can be rapid. A bewildering number of life forms may appear and many do not survive. This is "a helpful lens through which to look at what's happening now,  " Sir Jon suggested. When people look back at this period they will see banking in a period of very rapid change. The hope is that it may emerge in a better state.
