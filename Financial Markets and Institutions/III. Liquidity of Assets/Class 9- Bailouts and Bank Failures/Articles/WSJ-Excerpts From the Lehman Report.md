# WSJ-Excerpts From the Lehman Report

Thursday,  a U.S. bankruptcy-court examiner investigating the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Released a scathing 2,  200-page report. Here are some highlights. 

#### Criminal Case? -- "Colorable Claims"

The allegations lodged by a bankruptcy-court examiner have raised questions about whether prosecutors could build a case against former Lehman executives.

"Colorable claims exist against the senior officers who were responsible for balance sheet management and financial disclosure,  who signed and certified Lehman's financial statements and who failed to disclose Lehman's use and extent of [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis.md|Repo]] 105 transactions to manage its balance sheet."

"Colorable claims exist that Ernst & Young did not meet professional standards,  both in investigating Lee's allegations and in connection with its audit and review of Lehman's financial statements."

-- [From the report](http://lehmanreport.jenner.com/VOLUME%201.pdf),  executive summary,  page 21

"The Examiner finds colorable claims against JPMorgan Chase ("Chase") and CitiBank in connection with modifications of guaranty agreements and demands for collateral in the final days of Lehman's existence. The demands for collateral by Lehman's Lenders had direct impact on Lehman's [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool; Lehman's available [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] is central to the question of why Lehman failed."

#### Whistleblower Letter -- "On Its Face Pretty Ugly"

Lehman employee Matthew Lee will gain fame as one of whistleblowers who tried to prevent the company's demise. The report says Lehman's auditors refer to Matthew Lee's letter to senior management as a "whistleblower letter" and an "ugly" one at that. No wonder Lehman's senior management and outside auditors,  Ernst & Young,  said they were "stressed." 

"[W]e are also dealing with a whistleblower letter,  that is on its face pretty ugly and will take us a significant amount of time to get through. I am confident from what I have seen it shouldn't result in any significant issues around financial reporting,  but again there is a lot of work to do yet. This combined with some very difficult accounting issues around off balance sheet items is adding stress to everyone." (From a June 8,  2008,  email from William Schlich,  a former lead partner on Ernst & Young's Lehman team)

#### [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis.md|Repo]] 105 -- "Another drug we r on"

The examiner criticized Lehman for the "materially misleading" approach it took to represent its financial condition. He focused on the so-called "[[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis.md|repo]]" market,  in which firms sell assets in exchange for cash to fund operations,  often just overnight or for a few days.

The examiner said that Lehman -- anxious to maintain favorable credit ratings -- engaged in an accounting device known within the firm as "[[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis/Class 7- CP, Repo, and the Crisis.md|Repo]] 105" to essentially park about $50 billion of assets away from Lehman's balance sheet. The move helped Lehman look like it had less debt on its books.

"In this way,  unbeknownst to the investing public,  rating agencies,  Government regulators,  and Lehman's Board of Directors,  Lehman reverse engineered the firm's net [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] for public consumption." 

-- [From the report](http://lehmanreport.jenner.com/VOLUME%203.pdf),  volume 3,  page 739

The Repo 105 strategy sparked debate inside Lehman,  according to the report. In an April 2008 email,  Bart McDade called such accounting maneuvers "another drug we r on." Mr. McDade,  then Lehman's equities chief,  says he sought to limit such maneuvers,  according to the report (page 763..

Numerous internal Lehman e-mails referred to Repo 105 transactions in pejorative terms,  such as "balance sheet window-dressing." 

An illustrative example is found in the following July 2008 e-mail exchange: 

"Vallecillo: "So what's up with repo 105? Why are we doing less next quarter end?"

McGarvey: "It's basically window-dressing. We are calling [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repos]] true sales based on legal technicalities. The exec committee wanted the number cut in half."

Vallecillo: "I see … so it's legally do-able but doesn't look good when we actually do it? Does the rest of the street do it? Also is that why we have so much BS [balance sheet] to Rates Europe?

McGarvey: "Yes,  No and yes. :)"

-- [From the report](http://lehmanreport.jenner.com/VOLUME%203.pdf),  volume 3,  pages 860-866:

Senior management exerted pressure,  particularly at or near quarter-end,  to utilize the Repo 105 mechanism to meet the firm-imposed balance sheet targets:

Four days before the close of Lehman's fiscal year in November 2007,  Mitch King wrote to Marc Silverberg: "Let me know if we have room for any more repo 105. I have some more I can put in over month end." Jerry Rizzieri,  who reported directly to Kaushik Amin,  replied to King: "Can you imagine what this would be like without 105?"

#### J.P. Morgan's Collateral Demands -- "Part Art,  Part Science,  and Part Catch Up"

Several factors helped to tip Lehman over the brink in its final days. Investment banks,  including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.,  made demands for collateral and modified agreements with Lehman that hurt Lehman's liquidity and pushed it into bankruptcy.

On September 11,  J.P. Morgan executives met to discuss significant valuation problems with securities that Lehman had posted as collateral over the summer. J.P. Morgan concluded that the collateral was not worth nearly what Lehman had claimed it was worth,  and decided to request an additional $5 billion in cash collateral from Lehman that day. Discussions between Lehman and J.P. Morgan executives were tense. According to J.P. Morgan witnesses,   Steven Black,   a senior J.P. Morgan executive,   communicated the $5 billion collateral request to Richard Fuld by telephone on September 9. Black stated that he explained that the collateral was intended to cover J.P. Morgan's exposure to Lehman in its entirety. Lehman posted $5 billion in cash to JPMorgan by the afternoon of Friday,  Sept. 12. 

Mr. Black described J.P. Morgan's formulation of the $5 billion amount to the examiner as "part art,  part science,  and part catch up." 

"Black stated that he relayed to Fuld that JPMorgan was not trying to solve JPMorgan's problem by creating new problems for Lehman. He asserted that he told Fuld that,  if Lehman was "near the edge,  " Fuld should say so. According to Black,  Fuld asked whether JPMorgan was interested in making a capital infusion,  but JPMorgan was not. Black stated that he advised Fuld that if Lehman were skating close to the edge,  Lehman should call the Federal Reserve so that the Federal Reserve could "herd the cats" needed to assist Lehman. According to Black,  Fuld said Lehman was not anywhere close to the point of needing such assistance."

#### More on J.P. Morgan's Role -- Good Faith and Fair Dealing?

"Notwithstanding J.P. Morgan's concerns with the quantity and quality of collateral posted by Lehman,  Lehman believed that J.P. Morgan was overcollateralized. There is no evidence,  however,  that Lehman requested in writing the return of the billions of dollars of collateral it had posted in September. Lehman did informally request the return of at least some of its collateral,  and J.P. Morgan returned some securities to Lehman on September 12. J.P. Morgan did not,  however,  release any of the cash collateral that Lehman had posted in response to the September 9 and September 11 requests.

"Finally,  the examiner concludes that the evidence may support the existence of a colorable claim – but not a strong claim – that J.P. Morgan breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by making excessive collateral requests to Lehman in September 2008. A trier of fact would have to consider evidence that the collateral requests were reasonable and that Lehman waived any claims by complying with the requests."

#### 'Hail Mary' to Warren Buffett

New details in the report contain insights on why Buffett passed on Lehman. They open a window on his methods for assessing management and some of the red flags that waved him off. 

"Fuld and Buffett spoke on Friday,  March 28,  2008. They discussed Buffett investing at least $2 billion in Lehman Two items immediately concerned Buffet during his conversation with Fuld First,  Buffett wanted Lehman executives to buy under the same terms as Buffett Fuld explained to the Examiner that he was reluctant to require a significant buy‐in from Lehman executives,  because they already received much of their compensation in stock However,  Buffett took it as a negative that Fuld suggested that Lehman executives were not willing to participate in a significant way Second,  Buffett did not like that Fuld complained about short sellers Buffett thought that blaming short sellers was indicative of a failure to admit one's own problems."

#### How Liquid was Lehman's [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|Liquidity]] Pool?

"[T]he importance of [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] to investment bank holding companies cannot be overstated. Broker-dealers are dependent on short-term financing to fund their daily operations,  and a robust [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool is critical to a broker-dealer's access to such financing."

-- [From the report](http://lehmanreport.jenner.com/VOLUME%204.pdf),  volume 4,  page 1066

"By the second week of September 2008,  Lehman found itself in a [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] crisis; it no longer had sufficient [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] to fund its survival. Thus,  an understanding of Lehman's collateral transfers,  and Lehman's attendant loss of readily available [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]],  is essential to a complete understanding of why Lehman ultimately failed."

-- [From the report](http://lehmanreport.jenner.com/VOLUME%204.pdf),  volume 4,  page 1084 

"Lehman represented in regulatory filings and in public disclosures that it maintained a [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool that was intended to cover expected cash outflows for 12 months in a stressed [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] environment and was available to mitigate the loss of secured funding capacity. After the Bear Stearns crisis in March 2008,  it became acutely apparent to Lehman that any disruption in [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] could be catastrophic; Lehman thus paid careful attention to its [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool and how it was described to the market. Lehman reported the size of its [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool as $34 billion at the end of first quarter 2008,   $45 billion at the end of second quarter,  and $42 billion at the end of the third quarter. Lehman represented that its liquidity pool was unencumbered – that it was composed of assets that could be "monetized at short notice in all market environments."

"The Examiner's investigation of Lehman's transfer of collateral to its lenders in the summer of 2008 revealed a critical connection between the billions of dollars in cash and assets provided as collateral and Lehman's reported liquidity. At first,  Lehman carefully structured certain of its collateral pledges so that the assets would continue to appear to be readily available (i.e.,  the Overnight Account at JPMorgan,  the $2 billion comfort deposit to Citi,   and the three-day notice provision with BofA). Witness interviews and documents confirm that Lehman's clearing banks required this collateral and without it would have ceased providing clearing and settlement services to Lehman or,   at the very least,   would have required Lehman to prefund its trades. The market impact of either of those outcomes could have been catastrophic for Lehman. Lehman also included formally encumbered collateral in its [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool. Lehman included the almost $1 billion posted to HSBC and secured by the U.K. Cash Deeds in its liquidity pool; Lehman included the $500 million in collateral formally pledged to BofA; Lehman included an additional $8 billion in collateral posted to JPMorgan and secured by the September Agreements; and Lehman continued to include the $2 billion at Citi,  even after the Guaranty and DCSA amendments."

"This Section of the Report examines the circumstances surrounding Lehman's provision of approximately $15 to $21 billion in collateral (both in cash and securities) to its clearing banks,  and Lehman's simultaneous inclusion of those funds in its reported [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool."

"Critically,  the collateral posted by Lehman with its various clearing banks was initially structured in a manner that enabled Lehman to claim the collateral as nominally lien-free (at least overnight),  and continue to count it in its reported [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] pool. However,  by September 2008,  much of Lehman's reported [[Financial Markets and Institutions/III. Liquidity of Assets/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization/Class 5- Private Information, Liquidity, and Securitization.md|liquidity]] was locked up with its clearing banks,  and yet this fact remained undisclosed to the market prior to Lehman's bankruptcy."
