## Chapter 1 Introduction

The financial system promotes our economic welfare by helping borrowers obtain funding from savers and by transferring risks. During the World Financial Crisis,  which started in 2007 and seems to have ebbed as we write in 2010,  the financial system struggled to perform these critical tasks.

The resulting turmoil contributed to a sharp decline in economic output and employment around the globe. The extraordinary policy interventions during the Crisis helped stabilize the financial system so that banks and other financial institutions could again support economic growth. Though the Crisis led to a severe downturn,  a repeat of the Great Depression has so far been averted. The interventions by governments around the world have left us,  however,  with enormous sovereign debts that threaten decades of slow growth,  higher taxes,  and the dangers of sovereign default or inflation.

How do we prevent a replay of the World Financial Crisis? This is one of the most important policy questions confronting the world today,  and it remains unanswered.

In this book,  we offer recommendations to strengthen the financial system and thereby reduce the likelihood of such damaging episodes. Though informed by the lessons of the Crisis,  our proposals are guided by long-standing economic principles.

When developing our recommendations,  we think carefully about the incentives of those who will be affected and about unintended consequences. We try to identify the specific problem to be solved and the divergence between private and social benefits behind that problem; we carefully examine the possible unintended effects of our proposed solution; and we consider ways in which individuals or institutions can circumvent the regulation or capture the regulators.

Two central principles support our recommendations.

First,  policymakers must consider how regulations will affect not only individual financial firms but also the financial system as a whole. When setting capital requirements,  for example,  regulators should consider not only the risk of individual banks,  but also the risk of the whole financial system. Second,  regulations should force firms to bear the costs of failure they have been imposing on society. Reducing the conflict between financial firms and society will cause the firms to act more prudently.

In the remainder of this book we present a series of policy proposals,  each of which can be read on its own or in combination with the others. The conclusion summarizes these proposals and shows how they might have helped during the World Financial Crisis.

## What Happened In The World Financial Crisis?

## The Prelude

The first symptoms of the World Financial Crisis appeared in the summer of 2007,  as a result of losses on mortgage backed securities. For example,  in August,  BNP Paribas suspended the redemption of shares in three funds that had invested in these securities,  and American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. Declared bankruptcy. Mortgage related losses continued throughout the fall,  and indicators of stress in the financial system,  including the interest rates that banks charge each other,  were unusually high. Despite huge injections of liquidity by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank,  financial institutions began to hoard cash,  and interbank lending declined. Northern Rock was unable to refinance its maturing debt and the firm collapsed in September 2007,  becoming the first bank failure in the United Kingdom in over 100 years.

The next big problem was in the market for auction rate securities. Although auction rate securities are long-term bonds,  short-term investors found them attractive before the Crisis because sponsoring banks held auctions at regular intervals—typically every 7,  28,  or 35 days—to allow the security holders to sell their bonds. Thousands of the auctions failed in February 2008 when the number of owners who wanted to sell their bonds exceeded the number of bidders who wanted to buy them at the maximum rate allowed by the bond and,  unlike in previous auctions,  the sponsoring banks did not absorb the surplus. After much litigation,  the major sponsoring banks agreed to pay many of their clients' losses. The market for auction rate securities has not revived.

Bear Stearns' failure in March 2008 proved,  in retrospect,  a critical turning point. The firm had funded much of its operations with overnight debt,  and when it lost a lot of money on mortgage backed securities,  its lenders refused to renew that debt. At the same time,  customers ran from its prime brokerage business,  a process we describe in detail below. Over the weekend of March 15,  the U.S. government brokered a rescue by J.P. Morgan that included a generous commitment by the Federal Reserve. Many observers and officials thought that the Crisis was contained at this point and that markets would police credit risks aggressively. That hope proved unfounded.

## The Remarkable Month Of September 2008

The World Financial Crisis moved into an acute phase in September 2008.1 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,  large government-sponsored enterprises that create,  sell,  and speculate on mortgage backed securities,  failed during the first week of September and were placed under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

The peak of the Crisis started on Monday,  September 15,  2008. Lehman Brothers,  a brokerage and investment bank headquartered in New York,  failed with a run by its shortterm creditors and prime brokerage customers that was similar to the run experienced by Bear Stearns. Lehman's bankruptcy was a surprise,  since the government had stepped in to prevent the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns only months before.

Within days,  the U.S. government rescued American International Group. AIG had written hundreds of billions of dollars of credit default swaps,  which are essentially insurance contracts that pay off when a specific borrower,  such as a corporation,  or a specific security,  such as a bond,  defaults. As economic conditions worsened and it became increasingly likely that AIG would have to pay off on at least some of its commitments,  the swap contracts required the firm to post collateral with its counterparties. AIG was unable to make the required payments. Goldman Sachs was AIG's most prominent counterparty,  and Goldman's demands for collateral were an important part of AIG's demise. The cost to taxpayers of government assistance for Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac,  and AIG is now projected at hundreds of billions of dollars. That same week,  Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson announced the first Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP),
asking Congress for $700 billion to buy mortgage backed securities. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and President George W. Bush also gave important speeches warning of grave danger to the financial system. The Securities and Exchange Commission banned the short-selling of several hundred financial stocks,          causing pandemonium in the options market,          which relies on short-selling to hedge positions,          and among hedge funds that employed long-short strategies. 2 The turmoil of the week did not stop there. Interbank lending declined sharply,          the commercial paper market slowed to a crawl,          and there was a run on the Reserve Primary Fund,          a money market mutual fund. Unlike other mutual funds,          money market funds maintain a constant share price,          typically $1,  by using profits in the fund to pay interest rather than to increase share values. Because the share price is fixed at $1,          losses that push a fund's net asset value below $1 per share can trigger a run,  as investors rush to claim their full dollar payments and force the losses onto other investors. The Reserve Primary Fund,  which had more than 1 percent of its assets in commercial paper issued by Lehman,  suffered just such a run on September 16,  2008. After Lehman declared bankruptcy,  the fund's net asset value dropped to $0.97 per share and investors withdrew more than two-thirds of the Reserve Fund's $64 billion in assets before the fund suspended redemptions on September 17. Concern spread to investors in other money market funds,  and they withdrew almost 10 percent of the $3.5 trillion invested in U.S. money market funds over the next ten days. To stabilize the market,  the government took the unprecedented step of offering a guarantee to every U.S. money market fund.

In normal times,  any one of these events would have been the financial story of the year,  yet they all happened in the same week in September 2008. Although much commentary and popular press coverage blames the World Financial Crisis entirely on the government's decision to let Lehman fail,  such an analysis ignores the evident contributions of the many other momentous events that occurred during that week.

## October 2008: The Bank Bailout And Credit Crunch

By early October 2008,  the U.S. government realized that the TARP plan to buy mortgage backed securities on the open market was not feasible. Instead,  the Treasury Department used the appropriated money to purchase preferred stock in large banks,  and to provide credit guarantees and other support. Though now remembered as the "bank bailout,  " the TARP purchases were not simply a transfer to failing institutions. Healthy banks were also forced to accept capital in an attempt to mask the government's opinions about which banks were in more trouble than others. Many policymakers seemed to think that banks were not lending because they had lost too much capital and were not able or willing to raise more. Thus,  the goal seemed to be not to save the banks but to recapitalize them so they would lend again. In the end,  the former result was achieved—none of the large banks that received TARP funds failed—but the latter,  arguably,  was not. We analyze these issues in detail below,  and recommend some alternative structures and policies that we believe would have worked better.

During much of the World Financial Crisis,  the Federal Reserve experimented with a wide range of new facilities beyond its traditional tools of interest rate policy and open market operations. The Fed lent broadly to commercial banks,  investment banks,  and broker-dealers,  and ended up buying commercial paper,  mortgages,  asset backed securities,  and long-term government debt in an effort to lower interest rates in these markets. By December 2008,  excess reserves in the banking system had grown from $6 billion before the Crisis to over $800 billion. These actions are not a focus of our analysis,  but they surely helped prevent the Crisis from turning into another Great Depression. At a minimum,  they eliminated most banks' concerns about sources of cash.

Bank failures in Europe in the fall of 2008 led to more direct bailouts. The Netherlands,  Belgium,  and Luxembourg spent $16 billion to prop up Fortis,          a major European bank with about $1 trillion in assets. The Netherlands spent $13 billion to bail out ING,  a banking and insurance giant.

Germany provided a $50 billion rescue package for Hypo Real Estate Holdings. Switzerland rescued UBS,          one of the ten largest banks in the world,          with a $65 billion package.

Iceland took over its three largest banks,  and its subsequent difficulties highlight what happens when the cost of bailing out a country's banks exceeds the government's resources.

Throughout the fall of 2008,  there was a "flight to quality" in markets around the world. When investors are worried about default,  they demand higher interest rates. Yields on securities with any hint of default risk rose sharply,  especially in the financial sector.

The flight to quality is apparent in the interest rates on commercial paper,  in Figure 1. Commercial paper is shortterm unsecured debt issued by banks and other large corporations and is an important part of their financing. The commercial paper rates for financial institutions and lowercredit quality borrowers jumped in September and October,  but after a small increase,  the rate for large creditwor

thy nonfinancial companies actually declined. The rate on U.S. Treasury bills,  which are viewed as the most secure investment,  also fell; the three-month Treasury bill rate actually dropped to zero for brief periods in November and December 2008.

## The Run On The Shadow Banking System

The panic that struck financial markets in the fall of 2008 has been characterized as a run on the shadow banking system,  and with good reason. Before the Crisis,  many bonds,  mortgage backed securities,  and other credit instruments were held by leveraged non-bank intermediaries,  including hedge funds,  investment banks,  brokerage firms,  and specialpurpose vehicles. Many of these intermediaries were forced to "delever" during October and November,  selling assets to repay their creditors.

Hedge funds and other leveraged intermediaries use the securities in their portfolios as collateral when they borrow money. During the World Financial Crisis,  many wary lenders decided the collateral borrowers had posted before the Crisis was no longer sufficient to guarantee repayment.

When the lenders demanded either more or better collateral,  many borrowers were forced to sell their levered positions and repay their loans. The result was a reduction in the quantity of assets they held and in their leverage. In addition,  hedge funds and other intermediaries suffered large withdrawals by panicky customers,  again forcing them to sell securities on the market. The assets being sold were generally acquired by individual investors,  the federal government,  or commercial banks,  which as a group financed most of their purchases by borrowing from the government. 3 The financing difficulties faced by arbitrageurs and liquidity providers are apparent in a series of fascinating market pathologies. In financial markets,  there are often many different ways to obtain the same outcome. An investor can use many different combinations of securities,  for example,  to risklessly convert dollars today into dollars in six months. The actions of arbitrageurs usually keep the costs of the different approaches closely aligned. During the fall of 2008,  the costs often diverged,  with the approach that required more capital typically costing less. 4 The principle of covered interest parity,  for example,  says that after eliminating exchange rate risk,  risk-free investing should have the same return in every currency. An investor who wants to invest dollars today and receive dollars in the future usually buys a U.S. bond. He could accomplish the same thing by converting his dollars into euros,  investing in a riskless euro bond,  and locking in the conversion of the euro payoff back into dollars with a forward contract. Since both strategies convert dollars today into dollars in the future,  they should have the same return. 5 Suppose instead the return on the U.S. bond is lower. Then an arbitrageur could borrow money in the United States at the lower rate,  invest it in the euro transaction at the higher rate,  and make a profit.

During the Crisis,  covered interest parity violations as large as 20 basis points (0.20 percent) emerged. 6 This may seem trivial,  but in normal times these violations rarely exceed 2 basis points. Moreover,  traders can usually "lever up" transactions like this and make a large profit. But that's the catch—hedge funds,  brokerages,  and investment banks were being forced to delever during the Crisis,  and 20 basis points is not enough to entice many long-only investors to replace the U.S. bond they are currently holding with a foreign bond and some seemingly complicated currency transactions.

Other recent research finds similar disruptions of the normal pricing relations linking (1) Treasury bonds,  corporate bonds,  and credit-default swaps (a Treasury bond should be the same as a corporate bond plus a credit default swap—except for liquidity,  financing,  and CDS counterparty risk); (2) fixed and floating rate investments (a sequence of short-term investments plus a contract swapping a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate should have the same payoff as a fixed rate investment); (3) convertible bonds,  debt,  and equity; (4) newly issued "on-the-run" and recently issued "off-the-run" Treasury bonds,  which have essentially the same payoff but differ in liquidity; and
(5) stock and option prices,  which are linked by what financial economists call the put-call parity relation. 7 The breakdown of these normal pricing relations does little direct harm to the rest of the economy. A 20-basispoint violation of covered interest parity has little effect on a U.S. exporter using currency contracts to lock in the rate at which it can convert future Japanese revenue back into dollars. These violations show,  however,  that markets were not functioning normally. In particular,  they suggest there was not much capital available to provide liquidity to buyers and sellers. Anyone needing to sell securities quickly in such a market—such as a financial institution trying to reduce its risk—was not likely to get a good price.

## Lending,  Banking,  And The Recession

During the fall of 2008,  output and financing activity contracted sharply. Commercial paper,  corporate bond,  and equity issuance all fell dramatically,  as did mortgage originations.

Originations of most types of asset backed securities also slowed to a trickle. Many banks in the United States

And other countries no longer hold much of the credit they issue. They have moved instead to an "originate and sell" model in which they bundle together similar loans,  such as jumbo mortgages,  commercial loans,  student loans,  or credit card debt,  and sell them to investors as asset backed securities. New issues of these securities essentially stopped in October and November 2008. Figure 2 shows that the amount of asset backed securities issued in the United States rose from $28.8 billion in January 2000 to
$385.3 billion in June 2007,  and then plunged to $102.6 billion in September 2007. Issuance in the United States continued to decline over the next year,          eventually falling to only $8.7 billion in October 2008 and $6.6 billion in November—just 2 percent of the volume 18 months earlier. Only mortgages pooled by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,  with an explicit government guarantee and subject to huge Federal Reserve purchases,  continued to flow to the market.

There is plenty of anecdotal and survey evidence that bank lending also dried up during the Crisis. For example,  loan officers surveyed by the Federal Reserve reported that credit conditions progressively tightened during 2008. In a survey about their perceptions of credit conditions and corporate decisions as of late November 2008,  more than half of the chief financial officers of large American firms who responded said that their firms were either "somewhat or very affected by the cost or availability of credit." 8 There is a lively and fundamentally important debate about why the quantity of lending fell. Some financial economists argue that banks wanted to lend more but were unable to do so because they faced binding capital constraints. In this view,  information costs and other frictions in the loan origination process kept customers from moving to less constrained banks.

Others argue that the primary reason banks were unwilling to lend is that their customers had become less creditworthy. These economists point out that the high level of uncertainty about future economic conditions during the Crisis ratcheted up the default risk of even the most reliable clients. This interpretation of the decline in bank lending implies that no amount of capital would have induced banks as a group to lend more because all the good loans were being made.

Figure 3 shows data on the quantity of bank lending

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)

Figure 3: Commercial and Industrial Loans by U.S. Commercial Banks,  2008–9,  in Billions of Dollars. Source: Federal Reserve
in the United States in 2008 and 2009. Starting in October 2008 there was a spike in lending,  followed by a protracted decline. V. V. Chari,  Lawrence Christiano,  and Patrick Kehoe take the spike at face value: in aggregate,  banks lent more. At a minimum,  the banking system as a whole—as opposed to individual banks—was not deleveraging to overcome loss of capital. 9 Victoria Ivashina and David Scharfstein note that much of the increase in bank lending was involuntary on the part of the banks,  the result of drawdowns by borrowers on existing lines of credit. 10 They also show that banks that were more vulnerable to drawdowns because they were in more syndicates with Lehman reduced subsequent lending more,  and conclude that there was indeed a genuine contraction in the effective supply of bank credit.

Economists will argue about the events of the World Financial Crisis for years to come. In fact,  we still argue about the Great Depression. None of the analysis behind our recommendations,  however,  depends on how these debates are settled. For example,  no matter how capital-constrained the banking system really was in the fall of 2008,  our proposals for changes that make such constraints less binding and give policymakers better tools when they fear capital constraints remain valid.

## What Was Wrong With The Financial System During The Crisis?

The Crisis revealed a number of serious problems with our financial system. Some had been in the background all along,  others did not appear until the Crisis. In this book we emphasize four categories of problems: conflicts of interest,  known to economists as agency problems; the difficulty of applying standard bankruptcy procedures to financial institutions; the emergence of a modern form of bank runs; and the inadequacy of the regulatory structure,  which had not kept up with recent financial innovation. (In fact,  much innovation served to escape regulations.)

## Conflicts Of Interest: Agency Problems

Conflicts of interest that cannot be resolved easily by contracts or markets occur throughout the economy,  but they can be particularly harmful in the financial system. There are several reasons. First,  many financial transactions and contracts involve a principal,  such as an investor or shareholder,  asking a trader,  manager,  or other agent to act on his or her behalf. Second,  most financial transactions involve highly uncertain future payoffs,  and in many transactions one party is better informed about the payoffs than the other. Third,  the high volatility of the future payoffs often makes it hard to assess whether the outcome of a financial transaction is due to the agent's efforts or luck. And fourth,  the sums involved can be huge.

Some proprietary traders,  for example,  earn a lot when their trades do well,  but their personal losses are limited when their trades do poorly. Because of the asymmetric nature of their compensation,  these traders can increase their expected income by taking riskier positions. This problem is dramatically illustrated by periodic cases in which "rogue traders" incur losses that are big enough to damage or even destroy large financial institutions. In 1995 Nick Leeson brought down Barings Bank with a $1.3 billion loss,          and in 2008 it was revealed that Jérôme Kerviel had severely damaged Société Générale with a loss of over $7 billion.

Conflicts of interest,  or "agency problems,  " also exist at many other levels within the financial system. Shareholders of financial institutions have a conflict of interest with the bank's senior executives,  especially when those executives are rewarded for good performance but do not have a large fraction of their wealth tied up in the shares of the bank.

Many financial institutions have large quantities of debt,  which creates a conflict of interest between the bank's creditors and its shareholders. Shareholders have an incentive to authorize excessively risky investments,  for example,  especially after a bank has incurred losses that erode the value of the shareholders' claim. The gains on these risky investments will accrue largely to shareholders,  while the losses will mostly be borne by creditors. The conflict with creditors also reduces the incentives for the shareholders of troubled institutions to raise new capital because that would strengthen the position of creditors while diluting the shareholders' position. This "debt overhang" problem was widely cited during the World Financial Crisis,  when many banks that were insolvent,  or close to insolvency,  seemed reluctant either to raise new capital or to reduce their risks by selling distressed securities. 11 At the highest level,  there is a conflict of interest between society as a whole and the private owners of financial institutions. Because robust financial institutions promote economic growth and employment,  during financial crises governments often rescue troubled firms they perceive to be systemically important. The result is privatized gains and socialized losses. If things go well,  the firms' owners and managers claim the profits,  but if things go poorly,  society subsidizes the losses.

The candidates for government bailouts are popularly described as "too big to fail." More precisely,  the argument for government support—which many economists challenge—is about firms that are too systemically important to fail. In its 2004 Annual Report,  the European Central Bank described systemic risk as "The risk that the inability of one institution to meet its obligations when due will cause other institutions to be unable to meet their obligations when due. Such a failure may cause significant liquidity or credit problems and,  as a result,  could threaten the stability of or confidence in markets." Systemically important firms are those whose failure could pose a large threat to the stability of or confidence in markets. These firms are likely to be large,  but they also tend to have complex interconnections with other financial institutions.

Too-big-to-fail policies offer systemically important firms the explicit or implicit promise of a bailout when things go wrong. These policies are destructive,  for several reasons.

First,  because the possibility of a bailout means a firm's stakeholders claim all the profits but only some of the losses,  financial firms that might receive government support have an incentive to take extra risk. The firm's shareholders,  creditors,  employees,  and management all share the temptation. The result is an increase in the risks borne by society as a whole.

Second,  these policies encourage smaller financial institutions to expand or to become more closely interconnected with other firms,  so they move under the too-big-to-fail umbrella. Firms have an incentive to do whatever it takes to make policymakers fear their failure,  creating the very fragility the government wishes to avoid. Belief that a government rescue will protect a financial institution's creditors in a crisis also gives a firm a competitive advantage,  lowering its cost of financing and allowing it to offer better prices to its customers than its fundamental productivity warrants.

Third,  inefficient firms that cannot compete on their own should fail. Otherwise,  firms have less incentive to become and stay efficient. A government policy that props up inefficient firms is wasteful and destructive. Allowing these firms to fail frees up resources and provides opportunities for more efficient and innovative competitors to flourish.

Fourth,  and most generally,  capitalism is undermined by policies that privatize gains but socialize losses. Government guaranteed institutions can become government run institutions,  allocating credit,  for example,  to maximize political gain rather than economic welfare.

The conflict between society and the owners of financial firms becomes more serious during severe crises,  when many financial institutions are close to insolvent. It is the prime motivation for our regulatory proposals,  but several of the lower-level conflicts we have described are relevant because they magnify the risk borne by society as a whole.

The self-serving behavior that many of our recommendations target—whether by traders,  senior management,  or the firm's owners—need not be strategic,  intentionally malicious,  or even conscious. Consider a trader who inadvertently develops an investment strategy with highly probable gains and improbable but large losses. Like a firm that has sold earthquake insurance,  the strategy may produce a long string of impressive returns before one year of losses wipes out many years of profits. 12 If so,  during the good years the trader will be celebrated for his or her brilliance,  rewarded with large bonuses,  and given more resources to manage. Many sophisticated traders and hedge funds were not aware of the "earthquake risks" inherent in many of their strategies. Similarly,  when firms take actions that increase the likelihood of a government bailout in the next financial crisis,  the market rewards them with a lower cost of capital. As firms become too big to fail,  for example,  the implicit government guarantee reduces the riskiness of their debt and lowers the interest rate demanded by their creditors. A CEO working to maximize firm value may not even realize the importance of the government guarantee,  but a Darwinian process will encourage behavior that exploits it.

## Bankruptcy And Resolution Procedures

It is impossible to write a financial contract that specifies every possible contingency. Instead,  contracts rely on bankruptcy to determine outcomes in certain bad and unlikely states of the world. In bankruptcy,  control of a firm is transferred from the shareholders,  who no longer have a stake in losses because their shares are worth little,  to the debtholders. It is in society's interest to develop bankruptcy procedures that maximize the post-bankruptcy value of a firm's assets. In particular,  society should avoid the destruction of value that occurs with disorderly liquidation. Disorderly liquidation of financial institutions is particularly costly. First,  valuable knowledge that the institution has accumulated about its counterparties—borrowers,  trading partners,  and so on—can disappear as the institution loses employees and ceases to operate normally. Financial economists have found that the collapse of a bank has a material adverse impact on many of its borrowers. 13 Second,  the prospect of a disorderly liquidation makes it more likely that a troubled financial institution will suffer a run by creditors who conclude they are better off claiming what money they can today,  rather than waiting through protracted liquidation proceedings. Third,  "fire sales" of specialized assets in a disorderly liquidation can depress prices and thereby spread problems to other holders of the asset class. Fourth,  disorderly liquidation increases the uncertainty about the impact of a financial institution's failure on its counterparties and other claimholders. Because financial firms are tightly interconnected,  this uncertainty can precipitate or intensify a financial crisis. 14 In the United States,  the standard bankruptcy code allows both for liquidation of a firm and the sale of its assets
(Chapter 7),  and for continued operation of a firm under the supervision of a bankruptcy judge who protects the firm from creditors' claims while a reorganization plan is approved (Chapter 11). These procedures appear to work well for nonfinancial corporations but not so well for financial organizations. The Chapter 11 approach of separating a firm's financial affairs from its nonfinancial business activities is infeasible when the business of the firm is financial transactions. Furthermore,  many financial institutions rely heavily on short-term debt,  possibly as a valuable discipline on bank executives who can rapidly change the risks their firms take. This makes financial firms vulnerable to a rapid withdrawal of short-term credit that is likely to occur before any event that would trigger bankruptcy.

We argue below that there is a need for a special resolution procedure that can be applied to large insolvent financial institutions. We also advocate regulatory changes that would push financial firms toward more resilient capital structures.

## Bank Runs

Classic bank runs,  in which depositors race to withdraw their funds before a bank fails,  were one of the central contributors to the Great Depression. Deposit insurance,  which was introduced after the Depression to counter this destructive process,  made demand deposits one of the most stable forms of bank financing during the World Financial Crisis. Many financial institutions,  however,  suffered a modern version of bank runs. Banks,  especially those with investment banking activities,  typically finance a significant fraction of their business with overnight commercial paper,  repos,  and other shortterm instruments. In normal times,  banks roll over this debt as it matures,  taking new loans to pay off the old. In a crisis,  however,  uncertainty about whether a troubled institution would be able to pay off its creditors tomorrow causes lenders to stop extending credit today. Thus,  short-term financing can lead to a run that is similar to a classic run on deposits.

Even some secured creditors participated in runs during the World Financial Crisis. Banks often use repurchase agreements to borrow money,  securing the loan by giving the lender a financial asset,  such as a Treasury bond,  as collateral. Because they are over-collateralized,  with assets worth perhaps $105 guaranteeing every $100 in loans,  lenders view "repos" as a safe way to extend credit. When credit markets froze during the Crisis,  however,  lenders worried that retrieving collateral and selling it would be difficult,  and not worth the small interest on an overnight loan. As a result,  at various times during the Crisis many investment banks had difficulty rolling over even their secured loans. Even relatively healthy financial institutions were hampered by the trouble in the repo market after August 2007. As the market became more and more uncertain about the prices securities would fetch in a forced sale,  these institutions found they could borrow less and less with the same collateral. 15 Prime brokerage accounts also saw a run-like withdrawal by customers. Many large banks have prime brokerage groups that assist hedge funds and other institutional investors by providing financing,  securities lending,  clearing,  custodial services,  and operational support. In exchange,  the funds pay fees and,  critically,  post collateral to secure their loans. With some restrictions that we explain in Chapter 10,  the prime broker can then use the collateral in its own business,  in some cases commingling it with the firm's own assets. During the Crisis,  hedge funds monitored the financial well-being of their prime brokers and,  like depositors in the Depression,  fled with their collateral at the first sign of trouble. Bear Stearns,  for example,  had a large prime brokerage business. According to press accounts,  one of the largest hedge funds that used Bear Stearns as a prime broker,  Renaissance Technologies,  withdrew $5 billion of cash in the week the firm failed. With such outflows,          it is not surprising that Bear Stearns ran out of money even though it had more than $18 billion in cash a week earlier.

Like classic bank runs,  modern bank runs are both destructive and self-fulfilling. Concern that a bank might be in trouble spurs its creditors and counterparties to withdraw or withhold their capital. As a result,  even rumors of a problem may be enough to destroy a viable institution. The importance of modern bank runs during the World Financial Crisis is a recurring theme throughout the book,  and we make several proposals that are intended to reduce the frequency of such events.

## The Inadequacy Of The Regulatory Structure

The World Financial Crisis made it clear that financial innovation had overwhelmed existing financial regulations. Notable examples include AIG's decision to sell an extremely large amount of credit default swaps on subprime debt to banks in the United States and abroad; the holding of Lehman paper by money market funds,  particularly the Reserve Primary Fund; the complexity of the derivative books at Lehman and other investment banks; and the difficulty of simultaneously applying several countries' bankruptcy codes to the subsidiaries of multinational financial institutions. 16 There is a trade-off between financial innovation and stability. Innovation can improve the financial system's ability to allocate resources to their highest valued use,  but it can also reduce the stability of the system. The challenge is to develop regulations that improve stability without stifling innovation. In addition,  regulation often leads to innovations designed to evade the regulations,  which makes the financial system more fragile. For example,  many of the special-purpose vehicles that imploded in the Crisis were created to get around capital requirements.

In many countries,  the response of regulators to the World Financial Crisis was hampered by the fragmented nature of their regulatory systems. Financial regulations are typically designed to ensure the health of individual institutions rather than the financial system as a whole. In this book we argue that systemic regulation is an important function that requires a special mandate,  and that the central bank is particularly well equipped to fulfill this function.

Finally,  effective financial regulation requires that politicians,  and ultimately the public,  have an adequate understanding of the financial system. The political turmoil surrounding the Crisis suggests the importance of disseminating expert knowledge about finance to a broader audience. This is one of our motivations for writing this book.

## What Were The Origins Of The World Financial Crisis?

Like the origins of the First World War,  the causes of the Crisis will be debated by scholars for many years.

In trodu ction - 27 Most observers agree that the strong run-up and subsequent sharp decline in the prices of stocks,  houses,  and other financial assets in developed countries was an important catalyst for the Crisis. There is disagreement,  however,  about whether this pattern in prices is the result of rational investor behavior or "irrational bubbles."
Some argue that the run-up before the Crisis was driven by investors who knowingly accepted unusually low expected returns,  and they offer several possible reasons why.

First,  there was a surge of savings in emerging countries,  driven by a combination of rapid economic growth and demographics. Perhaps because of a desire to accumulate foreign reserves in the aftermath of the Asia crisis of 1997–98,  much of this wealth was invested in developed markets. Second,  financial markets were unusually tranquil during 2003 to 2006. With low volatility,  investors may have settled for a low risk premium. Third,  influenced by fears of a Japanese-style deflation resulting from the market downturn of 2000–2001 and by a belief that they should not try to use monetary policy to counteract rising asset prices,  central bankers in the United States maintained a loose monetary policy throughout the period. 17 And from this rational view of investors,  the plunge in asset prices that accompanied the Crisis was caused by bad news about future cash flows,  unexpected increases in the returns required by investors,  or both.

Others suggest a more direct explanation. The high prices before the Crisis were driven by an irrational belief that prices would continue to rise,  and the collapse of asset prices was the inevitable result of this mistake. Whatever the explanation,  the sharp drop in asset prices both contributed to and was a symptom of the Crisis.

Other commentators argue that the financial system became vulnerable because many market participants assessed risks inaccurately during the period leading up to the World Financial Crisis. Consumers,  banks,  and investors in general underestimated the risk of house price declines,  increasing the prices they were willing to pay for real estate,  the credit they were willing to extend,  and the valuations of banks that extended such credit. Banks put much weight on the recent past when they estimated value at risk,  which led them to conclude that the level of risk was low and that there was little downside to having high leverage. Other market participants did not fully appreciate that high liquidity was suppressing volatility and that the process might reverse,  with liquidity decreasing and volatility increasing.

More generally,  the high level of financial innovation,  driven in part by the declining cost of information technology,  made it hard for risk assessment to keep pace with the evolving financial system. 18 The benign environment of the credit boom exacerbated this problem by tempting financial institutions to underinvest in risk management.

U.S. policymakers also contributed to the severity of the Crisis by pushing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase the availability of mortgage funding to borrowers with questionable ability to repay their mortgages. As a result of this pressure,  both agencies relaxed their standards for the mortgages they purchased and guaranteed. The demand for homes by borrowers who qualified for mortgages because of these lower standards pushed up prices,  and the default by many of them during the recession contributed to the drop in home prices.

The panic and run in the fall of 2008 remain the central distinguishing features of the World Financial Crisis. Asset prices have risen and fallen before,  and the world economy has borne large financial losses many times without such a severe economic outcome. Conversely,  losses from completely different underlying sources—commercial real estate or perhaps sovereign defaults—could cause a similar catastrophe if they again provoke too-big-to-fail chaos or runs.

This book does not seek to provide a complete diagnosis of the World Financial Crisis,  nor does it take a stand on the relative importance of the contributing factors listed above. Rather,  we believe our recommendations will help prevent or mitigate future crises even though we do not fully understand all the causes of the last one.

Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff,  among others,  have pointed out that financial crises have occurred throughout the history of capitalism,  and that these crises share many common patterns. 19 The lesson we draw from this is that no acceptable set of regulations can prevent market participants from making mistakes that create economic instability.

Our purpose in this book is instead to suggest regulatory reforms that will make the system more stable despite the mistakes that are sure to come.

# Chapter 11 Conclusions

The Two Central Principles Underpinning Our Individual Recommenda tions This book should be seen as our collective best answer to the question of how the financial system can be organized to facilitate economic growth without the need for recurring taxpayer support. Our answers are summarized in two broad principles.

The first principle is that,  when developing and enforcing regulations,  government officials must consider the implications not only for individual institutions but also for the financial system as a whole. Financial regulations in almost all countries have been designed to ensure that individual institutions,  principally commercial banks,  will remain sound when they suffer unexpected losses on their assets. This focus on individual firms ignores critical interactions between institutions. Attempts by individual institutions to remain solvent in a crisis,  for example by selling assets,  cutting back on loans to viable borrowers,  or requiring more collateral,  can undermine the stability of the system as a whole. The focus on individual firms can also cause regulators to overlook important changes in the overall financial system. For example,  although the markets for securitized assets and the broader shadow banking system of lightly regulated financial institutions grew dramatically in the years before the current crisis,  existing regulatory structures did not evolve with them.

Chapters 2 and 3 elaborate on this first principle. Chapter 2 argues that in each country,  one regulatory organization—which,  we argue,  on balance,  should be the central bank—should be responsible for overseeing the health and stability of the overall financial system. Chapter 3 argues that this systemic regulator needs a new infrastructure to collect and analyze adequate information from large and systemically important financial institutions. This new information framework would bolster the government's ability to foresee,  contain,  and ideally prevent disruptions to the overall financial services industry.

Chapter 4 suggests that the public may also benefit from the systematic provision of information. We recommend simple and standardized disclosures of risks in financial products,  specifically in mutual funds used in tax-favored retirement accounts. Some commentators argue that weak public understanding of complex financial products contributed to the rapid growth in household debt that preceded the World Financial Crisis. While this claim is unproven,  public trust in and understanding of the financial system are important for the functioning of an advanced economy. We believe that improved risk disclosures can contribute to such trust and understanding.

The early chapters of our book emphasize that regulators must take a broad view of the financial system,  and must gather information that will allow them to do that. The experience of the World Financial Crisis suggests that strict regulation of a narrow portion of the financial system,  such as the commercial banking industry,  encourages migration of financial activities outside the regulated system to a shadow financial system whose risks are then poorly understood and inadequately monitored. Problems in the shadow system can cause financial instability both through connections with regulated institutions and because people come to rely on the shadow system to perform key financial functions such as risk transfer. Moreover,  the successful separation of regulated from unregulated activities requires that the government commit itself in advance not to bail out the unregulated financial system in the event of a crisis,  and that this commitment be credible. We doubt that such a credible commitment can be made.

Our second central principle is that regulators must create conditions that minimize the likelihood of bailouts of financial firms by forcing them to internalize the costs of failure they have been imposing on taxpayers and the broader economy. During the World Financial Crisis,  several governments bailed out ailing financial firms through fiscal transfers and other mechanisms because they feared that these firms were too large or too systemic to fail without catastrophic costs. Many of our recommendations are intended to create a robust financial system in which any troubled financial company is allowed to fail.

Regulators should use many tools to make firms internalize systemic dangers and reduce the chance of a crisis,  but capital requirements are among the most powerful. Financial institutions that create more systemic risk should have higher capital requirements. Capital reduces risk directly,  by providing a buffer against losses,  and indirectly,  by forcing stockholders to bear the losses from risky strategies. Chapter 5 proposes systemically sensitive capital requirements that require larger and more complex banks to hold more capital.

Rather than relying only on shareholders to discipline the risk-taking tendencies of financial institutions,  regulators should also impose costs of failure on the management of these institutions that are greater than those shareholders are likely to impose on their own. Chapter 6 argues that each systemically important financial institution should be required to withhold a significant share of each senior manager's total annual compensation for several years,  with these holdbacks forfeited if the firm goes bankrupt or receives extraordinary government assistance.

Acknowledging that some financial firms will encounter problems,  Chapters 7 and 8 propose better mechanisms for stabilizing or liquidating struggling firms. Chapter 7 argues for a new hybrid debt instrument that would expedite the recapitalization of banks at no cost to taxpayers: banks would issue this debt before a crisis and,  if a pre-specified trigger were breached during a systemic crisis,  the debt would automatically convert into equity. In this way,  bondholders would bear the costs of failure when they should,  rather than benefit from government bailouts or threaten the system with bankruptcies.

Although such recapitalizations would help firms avoid failure,  they would not save every distressed firm. Accordingly,  Chapter 8 argues that that each systemically important financial institution should be required to create and maintain for regulators a "living will" (subject to regular review) that highlights key complexities of its organizational and financing structure and lays out a plan for how it could be legally dismantled if it fails.

The World Financial Crisis,  and specifically the failure of Lehman Brothers,  revealed some important technical weaknesses in the financial system,  specifically in the market for credit default swaps and the standard arrangements for prime brokerage,  that contributed to the chaotic environment of late 2008. In Chapters 9 and 10 we suggest reforms of CDS clearing mechanisms and the structure of prime brokerage to address these technical vulnerabilities.

The measures we propose in Chapters 7 through 10 have two important effects. First,  they make it much easier for governments to allow financial institutions to fail if a crisis does occur. Thus they directly reduce the likelihood of costly,  ad hoc interventions. Second,  to the extent that bondholders,  shareholders,  and managers of financial institutions understand that they are less likely to be bailed out in a crisis and,  in the case of bondholders and managers,  will suffer costs if such a bailout does occur,  they will be more cautious beforehand. This will reduce the likelihood that a crisis occurs in the first place.

Taken together,  our proposals would reduce both the likelihood and the severity of future financial crises. Existing rules in the United States and many other countries have led to ad hoc,  emergency interventions to save unprofitable banks at great current and future cost to taxpayers and great collateral damage to the broader economy. We offer a robust regulatory system that would be less prone to crisis and would better allow struggling banks to fail.

## Replaying The World Financial Crisis: How Our Recommendations Might Have Helped

How would the World Financial Crisis have played out had all our policy proposals been in place? Our answers are obviously speculative and benefit from 20/20 hindsight.

They should not be interpreted as criticism of the actions of regulators and policymakers during a difficult and chaotic period. Nevertheless,  the Crisis allows us to illustrate how our recommendations could work in practice.

## The Buildup To The Crisis

We recommend that central banks assume the role of systemic regulator,  empowered to "understand trends and emerging risks in the financial industry" and then "design and implement financial regulations with a systemic focus"
(Chapter 2). We do not recommend that the systemic regulator should try to identify asset price bubbles. In fact,  financial economists argue about whether reliable identification of bubbles is even possible in real time. However,  dangerous buildups of leverage in the financial system,  which sometimes accompany rising asset prices,  are clearly an appropriate object of concern for regulators. Thus,  it is likely that a systemic regulator would have devoted attention to the risks of historically unprecedented increases in residential real estate prices that were central to the World Financial Crisis.

Many central bankers were in fact keenly watching real estate and related derivatives in the years before the Crisis erupted. They did little,  but as systemic regulators they would have had a responsibility to act. For example,  a systemic focus on increasing leverage during the boom might have led to tangible actions that would have limited the origination of high-risk mortgages. More broadly,  mandated annual "risk of the financial system" reports highlighting the risk to the financial system from unexpected decreases in housing prices (Chapter 3) might have induced more prudent choices among other regulators,  financial firms,  and home builders and buyers. This is a specific example of the potential benefit of risk reporting to improve public understanding of financial risks (Chapter 4).

Monitoring,  reporting,  and regulating systemic risk is challenging. Thus,  the systemic regulator,  which we argue should be the central bank,  should be allocated resources for staff explicitly charged with analyzing the whole financial system. Even with this focus and these resources,  we do not presume that systemic regulators can avoid all crises and related recessions—including the one just past. However,  we do think that systemic regulators might have reduced some of the problems that created the World Financial Crisis.

One of the central goals of our recommendations is to eliminate expensive bailouts for financial firms. How would our policy recommendations have altered the nature and extent of support for five firms at the epicenter of the World Financial Crisis,  Bear Stearns,  Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac,  AIG,  and Lehman Brothers?

## Bear Stearns

The Securities and Exchange Commission,  Bear Stearns' main regulator,  was not up to the task of supervising the firm. Indeed,  the SEC Chairman infamously announced that all was fine with the company just 48 hours before it failed. Inadequate supervision meant that no one in government understood clearly Bear Stearns' balance sheet,  funding strategy,  or interconnections to the overall financial system. 1 Because of these problems,  Bear Stearns' rescue was orchestrated using very incomplete information and very rough guesses about how failure might impair the financial system.

Our recommendations could have helped in three respects. First,  from the perspective of the safety of the financial system,  Bear Stearns was seriously undercapitalized.

Public accounts of its demise emphasize the disagreement within the firm over whether to raise new equity or reduce risk. 2 Our proposals on capital rules (Chapter 5) would have forced Bear Stearns (and all other securities dealers)
To have had more capital in the months and years leading up to the crisis. Our regulatory hybrid securities (Chapter 7) could also have been issued by Bear Stearns and converted in time to reduce its interest payments and debt overhang problems during this difficult time.

Second,  our proposal for compensation holdbacks (Chapter 6) would have provided an additional buffer against taxpayer losses when Bear Stearns failed. It might also have changed the discussions within the firm about whether to cut risk exposure and raise capital during the early stages of the World Financial Crisis. In the five years before it was absorbed by J.P. Morgan,  Bear Stearns paid over $17 billion in employee compensation and benefits. Our proposal for compensation holdbacks might have set aside
$2 billion or more of this total. 3 In the Bear Stearns rescue,  the Federal Reserve provided J.P. Morgan protection against losses on roughly $30 billion of Bear Stearns' hardto-value securities. This guarantee was structured so that the Fed had a senior loan against the assets of $28.8 billion and J.P. Morgan had a junior loan of $1.15 billion. As of December 31,          2009,          the fair-market value of these securities had fallen to $27.2 billion. Thus,  compensation holdbacks would have materially reduced the Fed's risk on this loan.

At the time of Bear Stearns' takeover,  its employees were estimated to have held more than 30 percent of its outstanding shares. Thus,  Bear Stearns seems to have satisfied the often heard corporate-governance proposal for improving the incentives of executives by making employees hold their firm's shares. As we explain in Chapter 6,  however,  the key compensation issue from the perspective of systemic risk is not better aligning the incentives of managers with shareholders' incentives. Managers who receive stock become more aligned with stockholders,  but this does not align them with society.

Third and finally,  the systemic regulator would have been more familiar with Bear Stearns and its potential problems. For example,  we recommend that the systemic regulator be the authority that monitors and approves living wills,  in which financial institutions would identify potential lowcost buyers for key parts of their firms (Chapter 8). This living will information would have been valuable in arranging the distressed sale of Bear Stearns.

## Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac

Unlike Bear Stearns,  the problems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were well understood by many government officials. For instance,  starting in 2004,  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified on several occasions about the risks posed by these firms. 4 After major accounting scandals at both firms,  the Bush administration proposed legislation to revise their supervision. It could not get congressional support,  however,  and reform efforts stalled. Indeed,  in late 2007 some members of Congress were calling for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand their operations to support the faltering housing market. Given the depth of support the two companies had over many years from many parts of the federal government,  the existing regulatory system failed spectacularly to control their operations and overall systemic risk.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have two lines of business. One is guaranteeing securitizations of prime mortgages that meet their underwriting standards. The other is holding a portfolio of mortgages and of mortgage backed securities that they themselves guarantee. This portfolio grew dramatically through the 1990 s until leveling off in the early 2000 s. Around that time,  Fannie and Freddie began to build a large portfolio of lower-quality (subprime and alt-A) mortgages and the AAA tranches of securities backed by lower-quality mortgages. These purchases were seen by the enterprises as part of their mission to promote housing finance. However,  because Fannie and Freddie operated with so little capital,  once the housing market began to deteriorate,  they had an inadequate buffer to protect against the losses in their portfolio and on the mortgagebacked securities they guaranteed. As of early 2010,  the Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayer losses from these two institutions will exceed $300 billion.

It is clear that a competent systemic risk regulator would have flagged these institutions as a source of risk (Chapter 2). This regulator would then have had the authority to raise their capital requirements (Chapter 5). On closer examination,  it also might have insisted on tighter rules for minimum down payments. These policies would likely have greatly reduced the ultimate taxpayer cost of these two firms.

## Lehman Brothers

The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy remains one of the most controversial events of the World Financial Crisis. As the fourth largest investment bank,  with more than $600 billion in assets at the time of its failure,  our capital-requirement recommendations would have mandated that Lehman hold more capital during its pre-Crisis expansion because of both its size and its reliance on short-term funding (Chapter 5).

The compensation holdbacks we propose would have generated more pressure for Lehman to find a buyer without government support (Chapter 6). And,  like Bear Stearns,  Lehman could have issued regulatory hybrid securities that would have reduced its leverage amid its emerging distress in 2008 (Chapter 7).

The reporting requirements for our new information infrastructure would have required all major institutions to report their asset positions every quarter (Chapter 3).

Armed with this information,  as Lehman's condition worsened,  regulators would have better understood the losses Lehman's counterparties would suffer if the firm failed and could have identified and alerted institutions with concentrated exposure to Lehman—and,  as we discuss below,  to AIG,  which was rescued the day after Lehman failed.

Lehman's bankruptcy caused private sector losses that our regulatory proposals could have mitigated in at least three ways. First,  the bankruptcy filing triggered an abrupt unwinding of all Lehman's derivative positions. Lehman was party to 1.2 million derivative contracts worth a total notional value of $39 trillion. 5 Our proposals would push derivative transactions toward centralized clearing. If Lehman's contracts had been cleared,  the task of unwinding the positions would have been less urgent and less challenging.

Second,  the bankruptcy filing created chaos in Lehman's brokerage and clearing operations because many of its customers' assets and securities had been commingled with Lehman's own assets. Customers have been left as general creditors in the ensuing bankruptcy,  and many have yet to recover their money. Our recommendation that regulators tighten liquidity requirements for prime brokers (Chapter 10) might have induced greater segregation of customer assets within Lehman.

Third,  the bankruptcy filing has been difficult because of the complexity of Lehman's global structure. Lehman was operating in more than 40 countries,  with many activities run through London. When the firm's U.S. parent filed for bankruptcy,  the British operation was immediately sent into administration. Lehman had more than 900 operating companies worldwide,  and 16 different administrators are currently presiding over the bankruptcy in different jurisdictions. It will take years to resolve this case. Our proposals that firms like Lehman create and maintain living wills,  and that countries strive to harmonize bankruptcy rules for systemically important financial institutions,  could have streamlined Lehman's bankruptcy administration. We do not mean to overstate this,  however. Negotiating a common set of rules will take many years,  and resolving a large global firm like Lehman will take much time and effort under any regime.

Most important,  had our proposals been in place and understood,  expectations of a government bailout of Lehman would have been much lower,  and the firm's failure would not have triggered a major change in expectations about the rest of the financial system.

## American International Group

AIG's regulators were ill-equipped to understand the workings of AIG Financial Products,  the subsidiary that wrote the derivatives that played a critical role in AIG's problems. AIG's financing crisis arose because many of its derivative contracts forced it to post large amounts of additional collateral if its credit ratings from Moody's and Standard and Poor's were downgraded. When AIG's ratings were downgraded in September 2008 in the wake of Lehman's failure,  AIG was required to post more than $13 billion in collateral. Although failure to post the collateral would have meant AIG was in default on its contracts,          it was not able to raise funds quickly enough to do so. AIG had written more than $375 billion in credit default swaps,  including $70 billion on CDOs,  and was a significant counterparty to many of the financial system's most important firms. Its default would have led to significant losses for many of them. To prevent AIG's default,  authorities rescued the firm the day after Lehman's bankruptcy.

A systemic regulator armed with the information and tools we propose could in many ways have helped AIG,  taxpayers,  and the overall financial system. Because of AIG's size,  it would have faced substantially higher capital requirements as it grew in the years preceding the crisis (Chapter 5). Our proposed information infrastructure would have revealed its burgeoning unhedged CDS positions—information that,  in turn,  could have triggered the systemic regulator to initiate risk-control conversations with AIG management long before the fateful Lehman bankruptcy
(Chapter 3). The regulators overseeing AIG Financial Products had no reason to consider how a failure of AIG would affect its counterparties,  but a systemic regulator would have been responsible for assessing the firm's interactions with other systemically important institutions. AIG's living will would have discussed obvious distress scenarios—one of which likely would have been a rating-agency downgrade (Chapter 8). Compensation holdbacks might have raised the incentive of key AIG managers to limit the firm's growing risk (Chapter 6). Finally,  by giving AIG an incentive to use and clear standardized CDS contracts,  our recommendations would have reduced AIG's systemic importance
(Chapter 9). A March 2010 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office puts the taxpayer cost of rescuing AIG at $36 billion. Our proposals would have substantially reduced this amount.

The net impact our recommendations would have made in the World Financial Crisis will always be uncertain and debatable. However,  it seems reasonable to conclude that with these measures in place,  many of the central features of the Crisis would have played out differently,  with less damage to the overall financial system,  lower cost to taxpayers,  and perhaps better outcomes for key firms as well.

## Likely Challenges With Implementing Our Recommendations

Our full set of recommendations will require significant changes in laws and practices. Though our expertise is in financial economics rather than politics,  we can anticipate several challenges that may impede these changes.

The economic hardships triggered by the World Financial Crisis have caused government officials and citizens around the world to demand regulatory reforms that will prevent financial crises. There is no reasonable way to accomplish this goal. Financial crises have recurred throughout modern history. The run-up and collapse of house prices in the recent Crisis echo the speculation in tulip bulbs in the 1630 s,  in British railway stocks in the 1840 s,  and in Florida land in the 1920 s. We expect that financial crises will continue to happen for centuries into the future. Our goal is not to prevent such crises but to reduce their frequency and severity. This goal is intellectually sound and attainable,  but we acknowledge that it may seem underwhelming. Unreasonable expectations by the public,  however,  may keep legislators and regulators from enacting important changes that will reduce the conflict between financial firms and society.

Elected officials around the globe have been heavily criticized for many decisions made during the Crisis. Populist pressure in many countries has impeded discussion of even technical issues such as resolution reform. Some mistakenly claim,  for example,  that the intent of sensible bankruptcy reform is to enable future bailouts. Political rhetoric that reinforces this confusion delays meaningful change.

Most important,  reform is often impeded by powerful interests with a stake in the status quo. We expect many financial institutions to resist our proposals. One of our central principles is that a financial firm's losses should be borne by its stakeholders,  not by broader society. Recommendations that reduce the expected subsidy from taxpayers also reduce the expected wealth of stakeholders. Compensation holdbacks,  for example,  reduce management's incentive to take risks that might eventually be subsidized by taxpayer bailouts. Regulatory hybrid securities reduce the value of a financial institution by roughly the drop in the firm's expected subsidy from taxpayers. And higher capital requirements to protect the financial system lower the industry's bottom line. Our purpose is not to harm financial firms or their stakeholders. Indeed,  robust financial institutions are critical for economic growth and rising standards of living. However,  proposals to eliminate the socialization of losses that can occur in financial crises,  and thereby make crises less likely,  also would promote economic well-being.

Government regulators may also resist some of our proposals. We argue,  for example,  that central banks should be responsible for systemic regulation. In some countries this may require a transfer of existing authority from other agencies. In other countries it may conflict with the ambitions of other agencies seeking this role. Those agencies will fight against their loss of power and resources. Similarly,  our recommendation for a new information infrastructure might force some regulators to share information they currently hoard.

Finally,  our proposals would have their greatest benefit when they alter the behavior of financial institutions before a crisis occurs. This cannot happen unless the relevant decision-makers—financial executives,  current and potential creditors,  boards of directors—believe that the environment has truly changed. This will take time. It may also require the failure of one or more important financial firms without government bailouts for people to genuinely believe that a new regime is in place and that every large financial institution will not be bailed out. These challenges can be met and overcome. With appropriate new regulations,  financial firms can again resume their critical role of matching lenders with borrowers to help raise standards of living around the world. If new regulations are misguided,  however,  we will continue to be threatened by severe financial crises and the recessions and unemployment that often accompany them,  or we will face the even worse prospect of an overregulated and politicized financial system that cannot support a dynamic growing economy. We all should hope that policymakers are up to the task. Our book aims to support this effort.
