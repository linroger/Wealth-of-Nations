## The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act And Its Impact

On July 21,  2010,  President Obama signed into law the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ([[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act),  one of the most sweeping financial reform bills in the history of the United States. The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act,  in response to the preceding financial crisis of 2008–09,  fundamentally changed the finance industry and greatly affected its biggest players. This technical note gives an overview of the most important parts of the act (and other regulatory reform) and the effect these reforms may have on the country's largest financial institutions. It is important to note that the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act does not necessarily create hard and fast rules but often provides only guidance for regulators to proceed with rulemaking activities.

## Costs Of The Crisis

The financial crisis of 2008–09 was far-reaching and the most expensive in history. The IMF estimates that the total worldwide cost of the crisis was $2.3 trillion,   and the direct fiscal costs in the United States are estimated to be approximately 2% of the GDP or about $300 billion. But the costs could have been much higher. Public funds committed to the financial sector totaled as much as 30% of the GDP ($4.5 trillion),   and the initial fiscal outlays were approximately $700 billion (4%–4.5% of the GDP). Losses in private institutions were even greater. As a result of the financial crisis,  financial institutions experienced write downs and credit losses of around $1.2 trillion or 8% of the GDP.

Despite the previously unfathomable sums involved,  the final bill for the U.S. government's much ballyhooed rescue program,  TARP,  is predicted to be much smaller than initially anticipated. Final cost estimates for TARP put the cost to taxpayers at approximately $109 billion,   $34 billion of which is attributable to the auto industry. This modest final cost is due mostly in part to the substantial recoveries the government has received from the redemption of its interests in the nation's largest financial institutions. Tim Geithner,  the secretary of the treasury,  has actually stated that he believes the final cost of TARP will be in the ballpark of $50 billion.

## Goals Of Regulatory Reform

The stated aim of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act is "to promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system,  to end 'too big to fail,  ' to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts,  to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices,  and for

Other purposes."1 Essentially,  Congress's intent in passing the act was to reduce system-wide risk and to prevent a financial collapse like the one in 2008–09.

## The New Regulatory Environment And The Financial Stability Oversight Council

Page 2 UV 5662 Prior to the passage of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act,  the U.S. financial regulatory system was extremely fractured and had no regulator responsible for monitoring systemic risk. There were five major regulatory authorities who oversaw financial institutions: the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which regulated national banks,  the Federal Reserve Board (Fed),  which oversaw bank holding companies (BHCs) 2 and state member banks,  3 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),  which was responsible for banks that were not Fed members as well as all banks covered by deposit insurance,  the Office of Thrift Supervision
(OTS),  which regulated savings and loan associations and thrifts,  and finally state regulators that oversaw state chartered banks. The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act attempts to streamline banking regulation by eliminating the OTS and transferring its powers to the OCC,  Fed,  and FDIC,  while giving the Fed expanded oversight powers.

As a result of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act,  the Fed will wield the most oversight power,  and it is now the explicit responsibility of the Fed to "identify,  measure,  and monitor risks to the financial stability of the United States."4 In line with this objective,  the Fed will now be the regulator for certain nonbank financial institutions (i.e.,  insurance companies,  investment banks,  and broker-dealers) that are determined to be systemically important and their subsidiaries in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were a BHC. Additionally,  the Fed is required to establish prudential standards that include: Risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits Liquidity requirements Overall risk management Resolution plan and credit exposure reporting requirements Concentration limits Other standards deemed appropriate,  including but not limited to contingent capital requirements Of important note for BHCs and any other company that controls an insured depository institution,  the act now requires them to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries. This essentially means that parent companies now will be liable for a subsidiary that is experiencing financial difficulty and can no longer let it fail with no consequences to the parent.

Probably the most drastic change to the regulatory environment comes in the form of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC),  tasked with being a system-wide regulator. The FSOC has three purposes. First,  it is tasked with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States from both financial and nonfinancial organizations. Specifically,  it will monitor the financial system for systemic risk and will determine which institutions pose a significant risk to it; it will therefore be subject to regulation by the Fed. Second,  the FSOC is charged with promoting market discipline by eliminating expectations that there will be another bailout. Finally,  the FSOC must respond to emerging financial threats,  whether by imposing

1 [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,  2010. 2 Bank holding companies are shell corporations that don't directly engage in banking activities themselves but rather hold the stock of depository and other financial institutions. 3 State member banks are banks belonging to the Federal Reserve System,  thus giving them access to the payment system and Fed discount window but were chartered in their states rather than operating under a national charter. 4 The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act.
More stringent leverage limits or forcing large institutions to divest some of their holdings if they pose a grave threat.

The FSOC also has broad supervisory authority over financial institutions. It has the power to monitor,  investigate,  assess risks to the financial system,  and collect information from BHCs and nonbank financial institutions. Also,  the FSOC will continue to perform stress tests on the largest financial institutions to ensure that they have adequate capital in the event of another financial crisis. Finally,  the FSOC will work with other regulators to recommend enhanced capital,  liquidity,  and risk management standards for systemically important financial firms.

## Basel Iii Accord

In September 2010,  the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision passed the newest Basel Accord,  commonly known as Basel III,  which will be phased in over the next eight years. The Basel Accords serve as minimum prudential standards for participating international banking regulators. Regulators may require more stringent standards but cannot go below those specified by the Basel Accords. Based on Basel III,  banks will be required to hold common equity (essentially the same as tier 1 capital) equal to at least 7% of the bank's assets,  up from 4% in the United States and 2% internationally,  and across a wider range of assets. Part of that equity will be a 2.5% conservation buffer during strong economic periods (to be built up between 2015 and 2019). If a bank falls below this buffer level,  regulators could force it to retain more of its earnings in order to augment its regulatory capital. Regulators also discussed but did not come to an agreement about rules forcing banks to meet certain liquidity requirements; the issue will be revisited in 2015 when new rules are discussed.

The implications of the rules laid out in Basel III are not great for U.S. financial institutions because it is likely that U.S. regulators will install more stringent prudential standards following the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act. U.S.

Regulators have already contemplated measures similar to the conservation buffer,  wider asset base,  and increased capital requirements. Also most banks strive to be well-capitalized and already hold capital sufficient to meet the new standards set forth in Basel III.

## The Collins Amendment: Capital Requirements

The Collins Amendment is the portion of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act that sets forth the new standards for capital requirements. In addition to setting new standards for banks,  it also extends the application of these rules to nonbank financial institutions that are supervised by the Fed. The amendment sets forth some guiding principles for regulators in establishing new capital requirements so that capital levels are counter to economic cycles and requirements for BHCs and nonbank financial institutions are at least as stringent as those for banks. At a minimum,  there will be no reduction in capital requirements,  and it is expected that the Fed will increase current capital requirements by 200 basis points.

The mandate that capital requirements be countercyclical to the broader economy will most likely be addressed by requiring banks to hold more capital in times of economic expansion and relaxing capital requirements in times of contraction. The effect will be to slow growth of bank balance sheets in periods of expansion and to allow more flexibility in downturns,  serving to ultimately create more stable earnings. This is similar to how the Fed uses the federal funds rate—in times of economic expansion,  the rate increases to restrain economic activity,  while during downturns,  the rate is relaxed to encourage economic activity.

The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act additionally expands the asset base upon which capital requirements will be calculated. For the first time,  in determining capital ratios,  regulators will include many off-balance sheet items in the asset base. Such items would be repurchase agreements,  asset sales with recourse,  credit and interest rate swaps,  forward contracts,  and other assets.

## Trust Preferred Securities

Trust preferred securities (TRUPs) first appeared in 1993 as a way for banks to raise tier 1 capital while making a ratings play. Because TRUPs received equity credit from rating agencies but were priced as debt,  issuers were able to exploit an arbitrage opportunity in the rating system. If the rating agencies had not certified the TRUPs,  it is likely the security would not have come into existence. Initially,  because of the high transaction costs,  all but the largest banks were prevented from participating. But the creation of pooled offerings,  where multiple banks issued debt securities to the same trust and the trust issued uniform securities to the public,  made TRUPs accessible to firms of all sizes.

Issuing TRUPs involves a series of transactions happening simultaneously: (1) issuance of the trust preferred securities (preferred stock in the trust) to investors,  (2) issuance of the trust's common stock to the issuing bank,  and (3) issuance of debentures (which must be subordinated to all other debt of the bank) by the bank to the trust. The terms of the preferred stock and the debt are identical and generally have a 30-year maturity and periodic interest payments. (A diagram of a typical trust preferred transaction is provided in Exhibit 1.) The structure of this transaction gave banks the ability to raise tier 1 capital for regulatory purposes while deducting the interest payments for tax purposes. Ultimately,  the securities show up under Minority Interest in Equity between debt and equity on the balance sheet. When the trust is consolidated onto the bank's balance sheet,  the debentures are cancelled out,  and only the equity investment in the trust remains.

As the financial crisis started to hit the broader economy,  the TRUPs market began to collapse. Many investors began dumping the securities as the health of the issuing banks deteriorated,  causing the market to dry up (much like the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market after the collapse of Lehman Brothers). The securities began to lose value,  and investors were too low in the pecking order as banks failed to justify holding them on their balance sheets. Additionally,  pooled TRUPs were essentially CDOs and ended up suffering many of the same problems. The pooled offerings lacked transparency and often received ratings higher than the individual banks would have otherwise received on their own. Over the course of the financial crisis more than 100 banks who had issued TRUPs failed.

The Collins Amendment,  in trying to increase the quality of tier 1 capital,  eliminated TRUPs from inclusion in tier 1 capital for BHCs with more than $15 billion in assets. 5 Previously,  TRUPs could account for up to 25% of tier 1 capital (and they will still be afforded tier 2 treatment). This represents a move toward tier 1 being only common or tangible common equity. The elimination of TRUPs from tier 1 will be phased in over three years beginning in 2013. Because many outstanding TRUPs mature after the phase-in deadline,  it is common for the securities to include a clause that triggers early redemption if TRUPs lose their tier 1 treatment. Much of this legislation,  however,  will be moot as the market for TRUPs has essentially disappeared,  and regulators have proposed a new species of hybrid securities,  contingent convertibles,  to effectively replace TRUPs in the capital structure.

5 TARP preferred securities will be exempt from this portion of the legislation and will continue to count toward tier 1 capital. TRUPs issued before May 19,  2010 by banks with assets less than $15 billion will be grandfathered and still count toward tier 1 capital. BHCs with less than $500 million will be completely exempted from this provision.

## Contingent Convertible Securities

One provision in the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act that is surrounded by uncertainty is the introduction of contingent capital to bank capital structures. This contingent capital will likely come in the form of contingent convertible securities (CoCos),  which will convert from debt to loss-absorbing equity in times of distress and are seen as a replacement of sorts for current hybrid securities such as TRUPs. Banks would issue an as yet to be determined amount of subordinated debt in the form of bonds that would automatically convert to common or preferred stock at a series of predefined points (i.e.,  percentage decline in stock price,  decline in tier 1 capital,  or a ratings downgrade). The nonnegotiable trigger feature of CoCos is designed to address two of the major downfalls of old hybrid securities: banks are reluctant to halt coupon payments and/or avoid paying back the principal to placate bond investors or to use the securities as loss-absorbing equity in times of distress. CoCos,  however,  automatically become loss-absorbing equity in times of distress and convert to securities on which the issuer is not required to make coupon payments but rather can accrue any dividends payable (or eliminate dividends entirely). This would help banks avert insolvency in times of trouble,  so they will not be forced to default,  but CoCos will not necessarily address liquidity issues because the conversion does not mean a new injection of capital,  just a change in capital structure. But the ability to halt coupon payments does ease some of the pressure on illiquid institutions. Also it is important to note that CoCos are different from traditional subordinated convertible debentures in that they convert upon a decrease in stock price (or some similar trigger) rather than an increase in stock price. Because of this feature,  CoCos are likely to carry a higher interest rate than traditional convertibles because there is no downside protection.

Another main purpose of CoCos is to address the problems associated with the downfalls of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers,  which lost access to short-term funding and were unable to fund day-to-day operations. CoCos are meant to dissuade short-term creditors from refusing to roll over their debt obligations because of the fear of insolvency. Therefore,  the principal amount of the CoCos should be sufficient to alleviate these concerns. The idea is that when CoCos convert,  they will become tier 1 capital,  giving the bank a larger capital cushion and hopefully increasing creditor confidence. Also because banks can accrue the interest payments on the newly converted equity without defaulting,  they will have more cash available to service short-term obligations. The conversion of the CoCos,  however,  could put additional downward pressure on the stock price as existing shareholders are diluted upon conversion. As seen during the financial crisis in 2008–09,  a decline in stock price can lead to an adverse feedback loop wherein short-term funding becomes scarcer and more expensive as creditors begin to question the health of the bank. Nonetheless,  regulators believe that if an appropriate limit is set on the volume of CoCo funding,  the instrument can be effective. Ultimately,  regulators believe that contingent capital should reduce effective leverage,  the risk of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and the justifications for a bailout,  and the threat of dilution on existing shareholders should influence the risk behavior of banks ex ante. But this will undoubtedly be a difficult task for both regulators and banks alike,  and many market participants are still unsure as to how much will be needed and how effective CoCos will be.

Two other areas of great uncertainty surrounding CoCos are what kind of regulatory capital treatment they will be afforded and how they will be treated by ratings agencies. The [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act does not set forth any specific guidelines as to how much,  if any,  contingent capital banks must carry but rather leaves the issue to regulators. In Switzerland,  regulators have already addressed this issue,  determining that banks will be required to hold a higher amount of capital (19% of risk-weighted assets),  about half of which may be in the form of contingent capital (up to 9%). However,  U.S. regulators have yet to issue any rules regarding contingent capital,  but it is likely that they will not be afforded tier 1 capital treatment until after they convert into equity,  since until that time they are effectively pure debt,  and there is no guarantee that they will ever convert.

Rating agencies have been rather outspoken on this point regarding CoCos and have yet to give such a security an investment grade rating. The agencies consider these securities inherently risky for a number of reasons: (1) it is hard to predict triggering events; (2) it is hard to measure the losses debt holders would suffer as a result of the trigger; (3) it is difficult to assess the ability of the securities to absorb capital losses; and (4) rating agencies are unsure of how they will be treated by regulators. According to Standard & Poor's,  CoCos might not convert into loss-absorbing capital early enough to help banks in times of stress and act as a buffer for senior bondholders:
We do not consider contingent capital securities to be a form of common equity…If the conversion trigger is set at a level that we think would lead to a conversion occurring too late,  then we will treat the contingent capital security according to its initial format when considering how much equity credit to give the instrument. For example,  if a contingent capital security initially takes the form of a nondeferrable subordinated bond,  we would treat it as having "minimal" equity credit according to our criteria. In this case,  we would see the conversion as happening too late to give equity credit in our broad measure of capital-adjusted total equity,  which includes hybrid capital securities subject to strict limits. 6

But not agreeing that CoCos are an entirely useless part of a bank's capital structure,  Standard & Poor's said,
"They are one potential answer to one capital management question,  but many banks will still need to address their capital positions through traditional forms of tangible equity."7 Moody's has also expressed similar concerns about CoCos:
After reviewing the features of contingent capital securities,  we may decide that they cannot be rated…To the extent that there are triggers,  our focus will be on whether or not they provide an objective threshold for conversion enabling an investor to reasonably measure the risk associated with conversion. If we decide certain types of contingent capital securities can be rated,  the analysis will focus on the ability of the 'host' to absorb losses as a going concern,  the type of loss absorbing capital that the investor may ultimately hold,  the probability of conversion,  and the loss severity given the conversion based on the conversion ratio…In addition,  we will not rate securities for which the amount of promised principal repayment is dependent on the occurrence of a noncredit event. 8 Ultimately,  these statements by the major rating agencies may prove to be valuable guidance in what form of regulatory treatment CoCos will receive.

Page 6 UV 5662 Another concern for banks that will be required to issue CoCos is that it may be difficult to develop a market for these securities. Many traditional bank debt holders and fixed income investors will not or cannot buy them because of their hybrid features and non-negotiable trigger. Because regulators will likely require the issuance of CoCos for all banks,  there will need to be an extremely deep market for something that is rather obscure and untested. There is also inherent difficulty for banks in structuring these securities. Set the trigger too high and there will be no market because of the high risk of conversion; set it too low and the securities are useless—the market will lose confidence long before the trigger point is reached. Additionally,  there is the problem involved with an imminent conversion. If the market fears that the CoCos will convert,  it could trigger a share price collapse. There is also concern about what would happen if all the CoCos issued by the financial sector were to convert at once,  as would have been the case in 2008–09. So far,  these bonds have

Performed poorly,  and the combination of necessity of issuance and no natural buyer will likely make these securities extremely cheap.

Prior to the passage of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act,  only two major banks had issued contingent capital securities,  and both were European banks. In 2009,  Lloyds Banking Group was the first to issue a CoCo security,  and Rabobank Group followed suit in 2010. The two issuances,  however,  were different in one very important respect: Lloyds at the time of its issuance was in distress,  whereas Rabobank Group was considered one of the strongest banks in the world when it introduced its security.

Lloyds issued over $12 billion of contingent convertibles but as an exchange for its existing bonds,  as a part of a larger capital restructuring effort that also involved the exchange of existing debt for common equity. The CoCos issued by Lloyds will trigger when its tier 1 capital falls below 5%,  a 360 basis-point drop from its capital level after the exchange. The CoCos were rated two steps below investment grade by both Fitch and Moody's and will pay coupons of 150 to 250 basis points (bps) higher than the debt for which they are being exchanged. The key for the Lloyds issuance is that the CoCos will be counted as core capital.

The Rabobank Group's issuance of CoCos,  which occurred in early 2010,  is markedly different than the Lloyds offering. Most notably,  Rabobank Group did it from a position of strength,  as it was well-capitalized and maintained an AAA rating. Its issuance consisted of EUR 25 billion unsecured 10-year bonds that would convert if the bank lost $15 billion of its $35 billion of equity (when its tier 1 capital would fall below 7%).

Yet the price was steep as the bonds sold at an interest rate of 6.875%,  351 bps over equivalent swaps and 495 bps more than similar maturity government debt—almost seven times the normal spread of 73 bps for AAA rated companies. Additionally,  the bonds will not count toward the bank's regulatory capital and were not rated. But the most interesting feature is that if the trigger is hit,  the bonds will be subject to an immediate 75% haircut and will not be converted into equity but rather will be payable in cash. The idea is that this would reduce the bank's liabilities in a time of financial distress,  and conversion seems such a remote possibility for Rabobank Group's CoCos that investors have largely ignored this feature. Nonetheless,  the bonds performed poorly initially.

## The Volcker Rule

The Volcker Rule was one of the most hotly debated parts of the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act and is largely aimed at investment banks and large financial institutions who engage in a wide range of activities. The rule prohibits a bank or institution that owns a bank from engaging in proprietary trading that isn't at the behest of its clients and from owning and investing in a hedge fund or private equity fund. Prop trading is defined to include the purchase or sale of any security,  any derivative,  or any contract for sale of a commodity for future delivery,  with exceptions for trading in U.S. government securities and bonds issued by government-backed entities.

Additionally,  the largest financial institutions are limited in the liabilities they can hold and banned from conflict of interest trading (taking positions opposite those of clients). The prohibition on conflict of interest trading is of special concern for large financial institutions because it refers to those firms hedging their exposure to trades done on behalf of clients. Financial institutions will,  however,  be allowed to use swaps to hedge their own exposure,  but the dealing of these swaps,  like many other derivatives,  will be forced into separately capitalized "hives." These hives will be legally separated from the rest of the bank so that the bank will not be exposed to any losses.

Another important part of the Volcker Rule prohibits banks from investing more than 3% of tier 1 capital in private equity and hedge funds as well as in hedging instruments. There are,  however,  exceptions for seed and de minimis investments in funds,  but in each case the investment must be reduced to less than 3% ownership within a year and not push the aggregate investment in such funds above 3% of tier 1 capital.

Finally,  the Volcker Rule requires that many derivatives be traded on exchanges. The idea behind this provision is that it will lessen the risk that one dealer's failure brings down others as investors try to figure out who actually is the counterparty. Certain derivatives will be subject to capital and [[Lecture 6-Leverage, Tail Risk, Volatility Products#6.1.3 Margin requirements|margin requirements]] as well as collateral posting requirements. Notably,  Berkshire Hathaway has stated that it plans to scale back its derivative contracts due to the collateral posting requirements,  which will make such contracts too costly.

David Sokol,  a chairman of two Berkshire subsidiaries,  said,  "If you are now going to have to post dollar-fordollar collateral,  and you can't get a price in the market that we think reflects the value of the credit quality of the company,  then we wouldn't take on the risk…Ultimately what it will do is alter the pricing."9 In the end,  the effectiveness of this provision is uncertain. Not all derivative contracts will be subject to regulation,  and the most profitable contracts will be those that are not required to be exchange traded.

## Asset Securitization

Much of the financial crisis of 2008–09 was blamed on unchecked asset securitization. To address this concern,  the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act requires federal regulators to set rules imposing credit risk retention obligations on securitizers and originators who,  through the issuance of an asset-backed security,  transfers,  sells,  or conveys the economic interest to a third party. Securitizers will be required to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for residential mortgages (may be more depending on the forthcoming rules) and are prohibited from hedging or transferring this risk. 10 Securitizers will be allowed to retain less than 5% of commercial mortgages and other assets,  provided they meet certain disclosure requirements. Furthermore,  the SEC is tasked with adopting regulations requiring issuers to disclose information that will help identify each asset backing the security for each tranche or class of security.

## Orderly Liquidation Authority

Page 8 UV 5662 The Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) is another major regulatory change introduced by the DoddFrank Act and is designed to address the problem of too big to fail. While the exact resolution process is not laid out in the legislation,  the act does provide the framework for liquidation by the FDIC of institutions that pose systemic risk. Many observers see the OLA as an alternative to but not an outright prohibition of bailouts,  as regulators are still allowed to implement generalized programs to help large financial institutions through TARP. Large institutions must periodically submit plans for rapid and orderly shutdown if they were to go under in order to expedite the process should such an event occur. The key to the OLA is that regulators can seize any financial company whose failure threatens the financial system and quickly pay off secured creditors while imposing losses on shareholders as well as unsecured creditors. This process already existed for banks but can now be applied to nonbank financial companies such as Lehman Brothers or AIG. Of important note,  liquidation is now required for all firms put into receivership. The process of FDIC
Liquidation under the OLA is shown in **Exhibit 2**.

In order to pay for the resolution of failed financial firms,  the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act creates the Orderly Liquidation Fund. The fund will be an FDIC-managed fund to be used in the event of a liquidation that is not covered by the FDIC or SIPC (essentially for nonbank financial institutions). The purpose of the fund is to provide funding for the windup of failed firms so that taxpayers will not have to bear any of the losses from liquidation. Instead any losses will be the responsibility of the financial sector and will be recovered through

9 Hugh Son,  Andrew Frye,  and Betty Liu,  "Berkshire May Scale Back Derivative Sales after [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]],  " *Bloomberg*,  August 17,  2010,  http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-08-16/berkshire-may-pare-derivative-sales-after-dodd-frank-bank-bill-sokol-says.html (accessed Aug. 12,  2011). 10 Qualified residential mortgages that have features for which historical performance data indicates a lower risk of default would be exempt from this risk retention requirement.
Assessments or clawbacks from creditors as necessary. The fund will be capitalized over 5 to 10 years through a series of risk-based assessment fees (similar to deposit insurance) on any eligible financial company,  which is defined as any BHC with assets greater than $50 billion and any nonbank financial company supervised by the Fed (basically,  any systemically important financial firm). To the extent that any company covered by the fund has a negative net worth,  the FDIC will charge special assessments to the financial sector. **Exhibit 2** lays out the factors used in determining these assessments.

Page 9 UV 5662 Finally,  the Fed and the FDIC do retain some emergency powers under the OLA provision. The Fed may still implement an emergency lending program,  but it must be broad-based and not meant to aid a failing company,  and must be approved by the secretary of the treasury. Additionally,  the collateral for any loans must be sufficient to protect taxpayers from losses. 11 The FDIC is also limited in the guarantees it can make on the debt of banks that it regulates. It can guarantee the debt of solvent insured banks on a broad basis,  if they meet the following requirements:
 The FDIC must determine there is a threat to financial stability. The secretary of the treasury must approve and set a cap on the guarantee amount. The president and Congress must approve the guarantee.

Ultimately,  the Fed and FDIC are severely limited in their ability to aid a failing firm on an individual basis. After the [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] Act,  FDIC receivership appears to be the exclusive route for a failing firm.

11 Given this requirement,  it is probable that the Fed would have had no choice but to let Lehman Brothers fail because it deemed that its collateral was worthless—essentially the reason why it refused to allow Lehman Brothers access to the Fed discount window.

 Will have the discretion to draw a distinction between creditors,  and additional payments can be made in situations where it maximizes the value of the firm or enables it to continue essential operations.

Assessment Fees Under certain conditions,  assessments may be extended to regulated banks and other financial institutions (that normally wouldn't be subject to the assessments).

 Severity of the fees can be adjusted on an as-needed basis depending on economic conditions,  the relative size and value of a firm,  and other similar factors.

 Assessments will be imposed on a graduated basis based on assets and risk and implemented according to a matrix with the following factors:
O Economic conditions (higher assessments during favorable conditions)
O Whether an institution is an insured depository institution,  an SIPC member,  an insured credit union,  or an insurance company o Strength of the company's balance sheet (both onand off-sheet assets)
O Relevant market share o Potential exposure to sudden calls on liquidity precipitated by economic distress o The amount,  maturity,  volatility,  and stability of the company's liabilities,  including the degree of reliance on short-term funding o Stability and variety of sources of funding o Company's importance as a source of funding for households,  businesses,  and governments and as a source of liquidity for the financial system o The extent that assets are managed and not owned and the extent to which ownership of managed assets is diffuse o The amount,  categories,  and concentrations of liabilities (onand off-balance sheet)
Exhibit 2 (continued)
Miscellaneous Provisions Rating Agencies The act increases internal controls,  requires greater transparency of procedures and methodologies,  provides the SEC with greater authority over the rating agencies,  and provides investors with a private right of action.

 Rating agencies are required to establish "look-back" procedures that are meant to limit conflicts of interest for persons who have worked for both the rating agency and the company being rated.

Durbin Amendment—Debit Card Fees Limits the interchange fees that banks can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions.

- Issuers can only charge swipe fees that are "reasonable and proportional to the actual cost" of processing—specific regulation is forthcoming.
 Applies to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets.
- But small banks will still essentially have to match big bank rates to remain competitive.
 Will be a revenue hit,  but it is not clear what the exact amount will be.
- BOA Q 2 2010 earnings call said it could be as much as 70%.
 Essentially just transfers revenue from financial institutions to merchants (with no net benefit to consumers).
- Banks may end up charging fees to consumers for debit cards to make up for the revenue hit.
Expansion The act immediately relaxes interstate branching restrictions by allowing banks to establish branches in any state that would allow the establishment of a branch by a state bank chartered in that state.
- This is the key to enabling M&A activity.
 Requirements for interstate acquisitions:
- The BHC must be well-capitalized and well-managed.
- The resulting institution must be well-capitalized and well-managed.

Deposit Insurance The deposit insurance coverage limit has been permanently raised to $250,  000 and unlimited coverage for noninterest bearing transaction accounts has been extended for two years.

- This will allow smaller banks to attract and retain large deposits. O This provision will also help avoid irrational shifts of deposits based on rumors or fear with respect to the stability of a depository institution.
 Deposit insurance premiums will now be based on *average assets* less average tangible equity.
- Beginning in January 2010,  assessment rates range from 12–45 bps depending on risk category.

## Exhibit 2 (Continued)
- The basis for calculating premiums was previously *deposits* less tangible equity.
- Larger institutions with more nondeposit assets will be hit hardest by this provision and as a result will pay a greater percentage of the aggregate insurance amount.
 The minimum Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) ratio is increased from 1.15% to 1.35%.
- Institutions with less than $10 billion in assets are exempted from the cost of the increase. O This means that the largest institutions will bear the cost of this increase.
Covered Transactions Restrictions The act expands the definition of "covered transactions" (transaction between a bank and its affiliates) under §23 A of the Federal Reserve Act to include credit exposure on derivatives transactions,  securities lending,  borrowing transactions,  as well as the acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations as collateral for a loan or an extension of credit.
- Currently,  transactions with one affiliate cannot exceed 10% of capital or 20% of capital for transactions with all affiliates.
- Clarifies that collateral must be maintained at all times for covered transactions,  rather than only at the time of the transaction.
- It does allow for certain permitted activities:
 	- Purchasing,  selling,  acquiring,  or disposing of U.S. government or agency securities and state,  municipal and other political subdivision obligations.
	- Purchasing,  selling,  acquiring,  or disposing of securities in connection with underwriting or market-making type activities.
 	- Risk-mitigating hedging transactions designed to reduce specific risks.

Fair Value Accounting The proposed (but not yet adopted) FASB rule would require banks to mark-to-market loan portfolios.

- Some analysts say this will lead to increased earnings volatility while others have expressed concern over the feasibility of marking-to-market with illiquid loan portfolios.
 FASB says this will increase transparency and help spot problems earlier.
