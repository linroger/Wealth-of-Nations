# Case Study of Bear Sterns

Case Study of Bear Stearns From a forthcoming book:

Basel III: Proposals for a Better Banking Regime (The Wiley Finance Series)

Bear Stearns may not have been the largest investment bank on Wall Street,  but it was probably one of the most leveraged. The taste for innovation and risk-taking led Bear Stearns to embrace earlier than others the development of securitization and repackaging techniques,  which created new opportunities in asset management for investment banks in the post-dotcom era. Bear Stearns was one of the first to identify the potential of securitizing risky mortgages after arranging the first public securitization in 1997 for Community Reinvestment Act Loans (mortgage loans into poor neighborhoods). The expertise built in this field allowed Bear Stearns to become a major player in the CDO market in the 2000s. Bear Stearns was present in all the stages of the value chain: it structured,  managed,  and invested in CDOs. Bear Stearns was known for its aggressive trading strategies,  but was well respected at the time,  even by rating agencies who praised its “relatively conservative risk profile" and “strong management oversight."

Ironically,  it is through its Asset Management that came the losses that would hurt Bear Stearns in March 2008,  when the plunge in value of these funds eventually triggered a liquidity squeeze. Subprime and high leverage put Bear Stearns fundsunder pressure. In the years 2000s,  Bear Stearns Asset Management,  created in 1985,  had become a large player in CDOs via two highly leveraged mortgage hedge funds worth USD 18bn,  the *HighGrade Structured Credit Strategies Fund* (2003) and the *High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies*

 Enhanced Leverage Fund (2006). These funds delivered a steady result,  attracting institutional investors. Part of the performance of the fund came from the high leverage and the use of complex derivatives: for every $10 invested,   the funds would receive $1 from investors and borrow $9 in the market. Investors therefore faced an exposure to the housing market at ten times their initial investment. Leverage was made available at very attractive conditions through the repo market,  further increasing the return on the portfolio. The leverage on these funds even reached 35x invested assets. *"The thesis behind the fund was* that the structured credit markets offered yield over and above what their ratings suggested they should offer,  "2BSAM Fund Manager Ralph Cioffi was reported saying. Leverage in the funds was achieved through repo (repurchase agreements),  enabling a counterparty to borrow a security from another one and for a given period of time. The flows are as follows: Bear Stearns would borrow to purchase CDOs and pledge as collateral other CDO tranches,  accelerating the losses in the system when the cracks would appear in the housing market. With this boost from more additional risk-taking,  a CDO achieved a return between 15% and 23% annually,  a level well in excess of a traditional mortgage,  but this level did not raise any suspicion.

The return of the two funds started to suffer in 2006 as the housing market started to turn,  leading to investors' nervousness.

## Bear Stearns’s Reputation Weakened By The Collapse Of The Funds

Given the size of its exposure,  compounded by the leverage in the fund,  Bear Stearns’s options to face this confidence crisis were limited. Bear Stearns managers initially tried to sell the most risky securities,  but this only depressed the price of what were already illiquid assets,  harming the performance of the funds even further. They had no other alternative but to convince investors to remain in the fund. The CDO business had become an important component of Bear Stearns’s business model and could be easily reversed,  and despite obvious signs that the housing bubble was beginning to burst,  Bear Stearns even continued to build its exposure to the subprime market in the years 2006-2007. Selling CDO tranches had become more and more difficult,  and instead,  they were repackaged into "CDO-square" with a guarantee from a monoline insurer. This strategy may have bought Bear Stearns a bit of time,  but at the cost of an increase in the risk profile. Despite claims from Bear Stearns executives that the drop in the housing market would be temporary,  they had to face the reality that it was deteriorating very fast.

 Confidence evaporated,  and investors and securities lenders were becoming more and more concerned with the losses to come. The link between the funds and Bear Stearns presented a real danger,  and their underperformance was starting to affect directly Bear Stearns’ credit standing and reputation,  threatening its access to repo markets. Given the high dependence on external financing for Bear Stearns’ own operations,  it was crucial to remain a creditworthy counterparty and preserve its relationships with the major trading counterparties. In an effort to reverse the situation and convince investors not to pull,  Bear Stearns committed its own balance sheet and pledged a collateralized loan of USD3.2bn on 22 June 2007. But losses had reached USD 1.6bn in June,  and the decision to put on negative watch 612 tranches of US
subprime (worth USD 7.35bn) by S&P and 399 tranches (worth USD 5.2bn) by Moody's on 10th July 2007,  in reaction to the deterioration of the housing market,  was an additional blow. Expectations of further downgrade exacerbated the doubts on the value of the assets,  triggering a spiral of selling and plummeting prices,  further deteriorating access to refinancing through repos. On 31st July,  both High-Grade and Enhanced Leverage Funds filed for bankruptcy,  having lost 91% and 100% of their value,  respectively.

Deteriorating asset quality threatens access to liquidity. What the collapse of Bear Stearns' funds revealed to the market was the highly uncertain value of otherwise deemed "safe" securities and the huge vulnerability of the financial system in a declining scenario:

- Investors accelerated redemptions of their investments,  leading to asset sales. - Repo counterparties became worried about the quality of collateral against borrowings and thus required either more collateral or stopped borrowings,  forcing the sale of assets in the portfolio. Bear Stearns' repo counterparties started to take a closer look at the exact value of the fund and the value of the collateral posted by Bear Stearns as early as May 2007. Loss of confidence in the quality of the assets produced a similar effect as a bank run: fearing losses,  counterparties such as Goldman,  Lehman,  JP Morgan,  and Citigroup stopped providing the liquidity to the funds,  accelerating the losses and leading to a liquidity crisis. As shown on the chart below,  concerns on the quality of the assets (1) have counterparties requiring different assets as collateral and return of their cash in securities lending transactions (2),  adding to the pressure on liquidity and forcing sale of assets at a loss,  sending the prices of the assets down even further (3) and leaving Bear Stearns with no other choice but to freeze the redemption in the funds (4).

## Contagion Hits Bear Stearns Itself

Beyond the specific case of Bear Stearns,  all the dealers in securities lending started to revise their assumptions on the value of assets lent to them or used as collateral,  leading to systemic consequences on the repo market. Volume continued to drop,  as all lenders became more restrictive in collateral criteria,  asking either for more or even accepting only US Treasuries. Naturally,  after Bear Stearns reported a USD 1.9bn write-down in November 2007,  lenders started to require higher rates and more collateral to provide liquidity. Money market funds' removal of Bear Stearns from their list meant Bear Stearns' access to [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] had become almost impossible,  and it now had to rely on short-term repos,  increasing the vulnerability of its operations. Bear Stearns,  which continued to carry an exposure of USD 36bn in mortgages (almost USD26bn of which was subprime) by mid-February 2008,  came under pressure from rating agencies. These concerns fueled more worries in the derivatives market,  where Bear Stearns was no longer perceived as a prime counterparty despite a USD 13.4bn of notional exposure at the end of 2007. An increasingly difficult access to liquidity and perceived weakness also began to hurt the prime brokerage business,  another important pillar of the business,  with the direct effect of reducing assets under management from USD160bn in April 2007 to USD90bn in January 2008. At this point,  with limited scope to reduce risk and secure access to funding,  the future of Bear Stearns seemed bleak.

## The Collapse and Fed Rescue

Moody's downgrading of 15 mortgage-backed securities issued by Bear Stearns Alt-A Trust on 10th March 2008 triggered another liquidity squeeze. Rumors on Bear Stearns' ability to settle its own trades sent the stock further down. Investor fear and loss of confidence had entered into a spiral:

- withdrawals of funds (USD 5bn moved in 1 day by a hedge fund)
- reassignment of swaps with Bear Stearns to other banks
- cancellation of banking lines (USD500mn pulled by a single bank on March 11th)

At this point,  Bear Stearns was starting to run out of cash,  and the Fed,  conscious of the damages for other securities firms that a collapse of Bear Stearns would create,  responded through an extraordinary lending of USD 200bn,  the Term Securities Lending Facility designed to give breathing space to the repo market and restore confidence. Bear Stearns,  with only USD 2bn of liquidity left on March 13th,  received a USD 12.9bn lifeline from the Fed through JP Morgan the next day. JP Morgan ended up buying Bear Stearns for USD 10 per share,  and as part of the transaction,  USD 29.97bn worth of Bear Stearns troubled assets were transferred into a vehicle called Maiden Lane LLC owned by the Fed,  to which JP Morgan had extended USD 1.15bn of subordinated debt. The fall of Bear Stearns not only directly put into question the weaknesses and risks behind the investment banking model as it developed in the 2000s but also increased the fragility of the financial system when the repo market shuts and counterparty risk rises. Pressure on liquidity can start a vicious circle when asset liquidations exacerbate their valuations and increase the losses.

## Lessons To Be Drawn From This Case Study

Bear Stearns operated a fairly undiversified business model,  which became lethal to it when the housing market turned. The high level of risk in its balance sheet made any strategic turns and risk reduction difficult to implement. Instead,  the management hoped to rebuild confidence by claiming its confidence in the operations. Stuck between a rock and a hard place,  Bear Stearns’ only chance of preserving its reputation as a market counterparty was to rescue its funds,  but as markets were deteriorating,  it revealed the weaknesses of its own business model. Bear Stearns became the victim of its own expansion into CDOs and securities lending,  which had been at the source of its success in the 2000s.
