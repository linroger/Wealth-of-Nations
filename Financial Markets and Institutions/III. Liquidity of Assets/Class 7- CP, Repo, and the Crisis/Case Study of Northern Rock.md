# Case Study of [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]

Basel III: Proposals for a Better Banking Regime (The Wiley Finance Series)

Until demutualisation in 1997,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was a staid UK building society. Once it had become a plc,  it transformed itself into an upstart in UK mortgage finance. The [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] business model was aggressive in several financial aspects and eventually failed spectacularly at an early stage in the financial crisis. Despite a fairly modest size,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] is an instructive case study in financial (in-)stability and risk (mis-)management and served as a reminder of the importance of [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity management]]. It also represents an indelible icon of the woes of the UK banking system,  due to the horrific TV and newspaper pictures of patient depositors queuing at its branches to pull their savings to safety - the first bank run in the UK since Overend Gurney in 1866 and the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878.

The creation of a wholesale-funded model,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] grew fivefold in the decade after demutualisation. Between 1997 and 2006,  customer loans grew from £13bn to £87bn and profit grew from £73m to £395m. During the same period,  however,  regulatory equity capital increased by a more modest amount,  from £0.7bn to £1.7bn,  yet the regulatory Tier 1 solvency ratio was roughly stable,  having gone from 8.7% to 8.5% In short,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] had grown its mortgage book far faster than its regulatory capital requirements,  by using securitization on more than half of its mortgage book.

This capital "efficiency" and a low-cost marketing model with very few branches enabled an attractive and cheap mortgage product to be offered to customers. By 2007,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was writing one-fifth of all new UK mortgages and remortgages and growing at 40% per year. Securitisation is a valid tool for financing rock-solid loan books efficiently. However,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s use of securitisation was aggressive and excessive. Its business model relied heavily upon the securitisation markets being open and accessible. The bank ran a large amount of interest rate and refinancing risk. And a lack of diversification meant that one single shock - a liquidity shock in this case - would render the entire business non-viable very quickly. As liquidity dried up,  they were forced to hold on to assets they were planning to securitize.

The FSA supervision was weak,  chaotic,  and potentially even negligent. Supervisors were busy on other matters,  such as M&A activity in the UK banking sector at that time (eg. Abbey,  ABN Amro) and implementing Basel II. [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was not seen as a "high impact" firm. There was little [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|financial analysis]] in FSA methodologies,  and so [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s perilous risk profile was not explored; in fact,  the FSA decided to conduct supervisory reviews on a 36-month cycle. When reviews were conducted,  the work was over-delegated.

"Although liquidity was included within the February 2006 ARROW visit to [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s treasury,  it was not explored fully; the visit did not,  for example,  review the firm's stress testing. […] The intention was to include it in the Pillar 2 ICAAP *work,  but this was not scheduled until* […] 25-26 April 2007. […] The objectives of the review did not include wider questions about the implications or adequacy of the liquidity component of firms' business models."

### Liquidity gap,  panic,  and bank run

[[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] caused some concern in June 2007,  when it issued a profit warning due to shifts in market interest rates,  which negatively impacted its interest margins. Nonetheless,  it confidently announced a progressive dividend policy the following month: "*The benefits of Basel II enable us to increase our 2007 interim dividend by 30%. Going forward,  our dividend payout rate increases to 50% of underlying EPS from around 40%*"

Global market conditions took a turn for the worse in August 2007. At that time,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was preparing a large securitization deal,  which became impossible to execute. It had built up several billion pounds worth of mortgage assets on its balance sheet,  which were funded on a short-term basis. Market funding sources dried up,  and [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was shortly forced to seek government funding support. Unfortunately,  just before the emergency financial support was announced,  its details were leaked by the BBC,  causing sensation and precipitating a retail deposit run. This was a PR disaster. The head of the FSA noted to Parliament: "*It was extremely unfortunate that the information leaked because it meant that instead of this being put in place as,  'This is a solvent institution which has a cash flow problem and the Government is steppingin to make sure that it is saved',  it became a panic measure or a response to something that was already in the making. Panic was how it was seen."

As funding conditions continued to deteriorate,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] sought buyers,  but there was little interest unless the government would commit substantial funding (in the region of £30bn) as part of the deal. The government refused to do this,  and [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] was nationalised on 22 February 2008.

### Lessons to be drawn from this case study

[[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]'s lack of diversification in its business model meant that it had little resilience. Its capital ratios did not reflect the massive amount of risk that was building up in the balance sheet. These financial weaknesses combined with poor supervision to form a lethal combination in a bank which,  whilst small,  was growing rapidly and was big enough to matter.

Diversification,  resilience,  adequate financial resources,  and strong oversight of the business are all essential for a bank to survive and prosper.
