## Executive Summary

Asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (ABCP) programs provide a valuable,  flexible alternative for companies seeking short-term financing. ABCP programs first appeared in the early 1980s and have grown since then to constitute a significant segment of the entire [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market. An ABCP program is essentially a limited-purpose finance company. Many of the largest ABCP programs were established by major commercial banks as a means of providing trade receivables financing services to their customers. Other ABCP programs were established by banks and certain retailers as a means of financing their credit-card portfolios. Still other ABCP programs have been established with a view toward specializing in financing other types of receivables,  such as equipment leases. From the investor's perspective,  the three main risks that must be addressed in an ABCP
program are credit risk,  liquidity risk,  and structural risk. Credit risk is the risk that the receivables financed through the program will suffer losses and ultimately not be fully collectible.

Liquidity risk is the risk that collections on the receivables will not be received quickly enough to provide funds for the payment of maturing ABCP,  assuming that new ABCP cannot be issued to provide funds for the repayment of maturing ABCP. Structural risk refers mainly to the risk that an ABCP program might become entangled in a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or similar proceeding and,  therefore,  might be unable to make full and timely payments on its ABCP.

A **Prime-1** rating on an ABCP program expresses Moody's opinion that it is highly probable that investors will receive full and timely payment on the ABCP that they have purchased. Whether an ABCP program is structured to be fully supported or partially supported (present regulatory and accounting policies are driving programs increasingly toward the partially supported mode of operation),  at its heart is the *Issuer*.

The Issuer is a special purpose trust or corporation that issues the ABCP and is generally established by the program's *Sponsor*,  which is often a major commercial bank. When an Issuer commences operations,  it issues ABCP and acquires an interest in a roughly comparable amount of receivables from *Sellers* of receivables. A Seller remits collections on the related receivables to an account of the Issuer. The Issuer then can apply the amounts collected either to purchasing more receivables or to paying off maturing ABCP. A fully supported ABCP program uses a single external support facility,  provided by a highly rated bank or group of banks,  to provide 100% coverage against credit risk and liquidity risk. The support facility most often takes the form of either a letter of credit or an irrevocable revolving commitment to either purchase assets from the Issuer or to make secured loans to the Issuer. Funds provided under the support facility are supposed to protect investors from the credit risk and liquidity risk of the program's assets. The provider of the support facility will absorb any credit losses on the assets. If collections on the assets are not received quickly enough to enable the Issuer to pay off maturing ABCP,  the support provider will provide the necessary funds. The main practical risk to investors in a fully supported program is that the rating of the support provider may be lowered,  in which case the rating of the program's ABCP also might be lowered. Moody's analysis of a fully supported program is not based on the program's assets but rather on the financial strength of the support provider and the legal structure of the program.

In a partially supported ABCP program,  there is not one supporting facility but two. The first,  referred to as the credit enhancement facility,  generally addresses a combination of credit risk and liquidity risk. The second - the liquidity facility - addresses principally liquidity risk. The credit enhancement facility is intended to cover any losses on the receivables,  up to a specified amount. In many programs,  the credit enhancement facility also may be used by the Issuer to obtain funds necessary for liquidity purposes. The liquidity facility does not cover the credit risk of the receivables. In most cases,  the size of the liquidity facility equals either the total program size or,  if the credit enhancement facility provides liquidity protection as well as credit enhancement,  the difference between the total program size and the size of the credit enhancement facility. If a program employs operating restrictions that serve to address liquidity risk,  the size of the required liquidity facility may be reduced. Because the credit enhancement facility provides only partial coverage against credit losses on the assets in the program,  Moody's analysis of a partially supported ABCP program focuses on the receivables in the program. The goal is to determine that the probability of credit losses on the receivables exceeding the coverage of the credit enhancement facility is remote enough to be consistent with the rating assigned to the program. The analysis of a program's receivables includes a consideration of the credit strength of each Seller. The [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or insolvency of a Seller can adversely affect the performance of that Seller's receivables in a variety of ways. First,  the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or insolvency of a Seller can force a continually replenished,  revolving pool of receivables to start liquidating without replenishment. If that occurs,  losses suffered by the liquidating pool can be much more severe,  in proportional terms,  than losses on the predecessor revolving pool. The financial strength of a Seller also is significant in that there is likely to be a positive correlation between the Seller's general operations and its financial condition. If a Seller's general operations deteriorate,  there may be more problems with the Seller's receivables. In addition,  the financial condition of a Seller is important because it measures the Seller's ability to make certain required payments,  such as payments in respect of diluted receivables. The analysis of a Seller's receivables focuses on historical loss data as a basis for estimating future losses. Obligor insolvencies are only one element of losses on receivables. Other factors,  such as returns of sold goods and warranty claims,  can dilute the value of outstanding receivables. Both obligor credit quality and dilution can vary markedly across industries and even across Sellers within a particular industry. When appropriate,  Moody's separately considers and analyzes losses attributable to different causes. In addition,  in the case of longer-term,  secured receivables,  Moody's considers the possible effect that fluctuations in the value of the underlying collateral can have on the level of losses in the future.

Moody's uses a computer simulation approach for aggregating a program's risk exposure to different Sellers and obligors. On a program-wide basis,  it is desirable to have a large number of Sellers,  each of which contributes a relatively small portion of the receivables. That is,  diversification serves to reduce the maximum exposure of the Issuer to the credit risk of any single Seller. Similarly,  it is desirable to have a substantial degree of diversification of obligor risk. In addition,  it is highly desirable for an ABCP program to limit the Issuer's exposure to any single non-investment-grade Seller or obligor. The rating of a partially supported ABCP program depends on the performance of the program's assets,  the structural features of the program,  the ratings of the providers of the credit enhancement facility and the liquidity facility,  and the expertise of the program's manager. At present,  the largest and most visible ABCP programs are partially supported,  bank-sponsored,  multiseller programs. The size of the credit enhancement facilities in those programs typically ranges from 10% to 15%. The size of the liquidity facilities varies markedly because some programs employ operating restrictions and large syndicates of liquidity facility providers.

Moody's presently rates nearly all ABCP programs and publishes special reports when appropriate. Investors are invited to call Moody's with any questions concerning ABCP.

## Introduction

The term *[[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]* is used to describe virtually any high-quality,  negotiable note having an original maturity of not more than 270 days. Traditional [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] has been present in the U.S. capital markets since the 1800s and over the past century has become an increasingly important financing alternative for companies,  municipalities,  and foreign governments Traditional [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] provides issuers with direct access to investors,  and certain [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] has the additional advantage of being exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. securities laws Nevertheless,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was not widely known or understood until a series of credit crunches in the 1960s led to an explosive growth in issuance. The explosive growth in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] issuance has not been confined to the U.S. capital markets. Indeed,  in the past decade,  the U.S. market's share of global [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding has actually begun to decline,  despite the fact that the total [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding in the U.S. market continued to grow significantly throughout the period. In fact,  the amount of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding in non-U.S. markets grew more than thirtyfold in the 1980s

Accordingly,  new [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] products are developed frequently to address companies' short-term financing needs. Revolutionary changes in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market over the past decade have resulted not only in an enormous increase in volume,  but also in the creation of asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (ABCP). An ABCP program is a type of receivables financing vehicle. ABCP programs were developed in the 1980s by the major commercial banks as a means of providing more [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] receivables financing terms to their customers and,  in some instances,  as a means of conducting that activity on an off-balance-sheet basis.

At the heart of a typical ABCP program is a special-purpose corporation (an Issuer) that issues the ABCP.

The Issuer is established by the program sponsor (the Sponsor),  which is often a major commercial bank.

When an Issuer commences operations,  it issues ABCP and acquires an interest in a roughly comparable amount of receivables. The receivables are most often short-term trade receivables but may also include credit-card receivables,  medium-term lease receivables,  or other types of shortor medium-term financial assets. A Seller of receivables remits collections on the related receivables to an account of the Issuer. 4 The Issuer can then apply the amounts collected either to purchasing more receivables or to paying off maturing ABCP. In the normal course of operations,  an Issuer obtains funds to retire maturing ABCP by issuing a roughly equivalent amount of new ABCP. Accordingly,  collections on maturing receivables in which the Issuer has acquired an interest are generally applied to acquire interests in new receivables generated by the same Seller. Thus,  from the perspective of a Seller,  an ABCP program is a type of revolving credit facility in which the Seller is permitted to continually replace maturing receivables with new receivables. However,  Moody's analysis assumes that the Issuer will be unable to issue and sell new ABCP to obtain funds to retire maturing ABCP. Accordingly,

1 See "*[[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] 1*” (R. Felix ed. 1987). 2 See,  e.g.,  Securities Act of 1933 § 3(a)(3). 3 *See generally* Konstanty,  Grant,  Mahoney,  Noe,  and Watson,  "*Alternative Liquidity for [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Issuers*, ” Moody's Special Report (Feb. 1992).

4 For purposes of the following discussion,  the term Seller will be used to identify,  without distinction,  both (1) a company that *sells* receivables to an Issuer,  and (2) a company that *borrows* money from the Issuer and secures the borrowing with collateral consisting of the company's receivables.
Moody's analysis of an ABCP program focuses on the ability of the Issuer to make full and timely payments on maturing ABCP by using funds derived from sources available to the Issuer other than the sale of new ABCP. Since its introduction in the early 1980s,  the ABCP market has grown rapidly to the point where total ABCP outstanding by year-end 1992 was roughly $50 billion-$60 billion,  and total authorized program capacity was over $100 billion.

## Why ABCP Programs Developed

The emergence of ABCP programs is primarily attributable to [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] and regulatory factors affecting the banking industry.

 ![500](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fRzfzE2lBgvnheEonTDDc641GG30A6Hbz)

Competition: In the 1980s,  [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] forces drove commercial banks to find ways to offer lower-cost receivables financing to their commercial and industrial customers. When a bank's customer becomes a Seller in an ABCP program,  the customer acquires the ability to finance its receivables at rates comparable to prevailing rates for Prime-1 rated issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. Unless the customer is able to issue its own [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] at comparable rates,  the use of a bank-sponsored ABCP program is likely to provide the lowest-cost alternative for receivables financing.

Moody's Short-Term Debt Ratings Regulation: ABCP programs appeal to banks because the programs can be structured as a type of off-balance-sheet activity. An ABCP program permits the Sponsor to offer receivables financing services to its customers without increasing the size of the Sponsor's balance sheet. Fee Income: A third factor further motivates banks to sponsor ABCP programs. If a program becomes sufficiently large,  the Sponsor may be able to generate significant fee income from managing the program. As more banks establish programs,  however,  competition among sponsoring banks may erode the level of fee income generated by the programs. Other factors,  relating primarily to Sellers rather than to Sponsors,  have also contributed significantly to the growth of the ABCP market. Even a Seller that has a Prime-1 rating and that could issue its own [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] at attractive rates may be drawn to bank-sponsored ABCP programs to obtain anonymous financing in the capital markets. In addition,  a Seller may be able to achieve off-balance-sheet accounting treatment of receivables financed through a bank-sponsored ABCP program. Although most Sellers are not subject to the same regulatory accounting constraints as are sponsoring banks,  off-balance-sheet accounting may be desirable to a Seller in managing its balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

Moody's short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to repay punctually senior debt obligations that have an original maturity not exceeding one year. Obligations relying upon support mechanisms such as letters of credit and bonds of indemnity are excluded unless explicitly rated. Moody's employs the following three designations,  all judged to be investment grade,  to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers:
Prime-1 Issuers rated **Prime-1** (or supporting institutions) have a superior ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. **Prime-1** repayment ability will often be evidenced by many of the following characteristics: - Leading market positions in well-established industries. - High rates of return on funds employed. - Conservative capitalization structure with moderate reliance on debt and ample asset protection.

- Broad margins in earnings coverage of fixed financial charges and high internal cash generation.
- Well-established access to a range of financial markets and assured sources of alternate liquidity.

Prime-2 Issuers rated **Prime-2** (or supporting institutions) have a strong ability for repayment of senior short-term debt obligations. This will normally be evidenced by many of the characteristics cited above but to a lesser degree. Earnings trends and coverage ratios,  while sound,  may be more subject to variation. Capitalization characteristics,  while still appropriate,  may be more affected by external conditions. Ample alternate liquidity is maintained.

Prime-3 Issuers rated **Prime-3** (or supporting institutions) have an acceptable ability for repayment of senior short-term obligations. The effect of industry characteristics and market compositions may be more pronounced. Variability in earnings and profitability may result in changes in the level of debt protection measurements and may require relatively high financial leverage. Adequate alternate liquidity is maintained.

Not Prime Issuers rated **Not Prime** do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.

## The Basic Types Of ABCP Programs

There are several approaches that can be used in classifying ABCP programs. One focuses on the number of Sellers served by a program. A common form of ABCP program is one that acquires receivables from numerous Sellers and that is sponsored by a large commercial bank.

Such a program is referred to here as a *bank-sponsored,  multiseller ABCP program.* In contrast,  other ABCP programs are created and administered by a single Seller as a means of financing its own receivables portfolio. Such a program is referred to as a *single-seller ABCP program.*
Another approach is based on the manner and degree to which the program addresses the risk that some of the purchased receivables may default and become uncollectible. Certain ABCP programs are structured so that investors will be paid fully (by a third party) regardless of the performance of the underlying receivables. Moody's refers to such a program as a fully supported ABCP program. In contrast to fully supported programs,  other programs expose investors to losses if losses on the underlying receivables exceed a specified level. Such a program is referred to as a *partially supported ABCP program.*
Fully supported programs can be divided into two types. In the first type,  the ABCP is directly supported by a support facility. A program of this type is a direct fully supported ABCP
program. In the second type,  the support facility supports the receivables financed through the ABCP program,  thereby providing indirect support for the ABCP. Such a program is an indirect fully supported ABCP program. The following discussion focuses on distinguishing characteristics of fully and partially supported programs and introduces the various kinds of risks Moody's analyzes in ABCP programs.

## Direct Fully Supported ABCP Programs

The earliest ABCP programs included a support facility that *directly* and *fully* ensured the full and timely payment of maturing ABCP. In such a program,  the support facility often consists of a letter of credit issued by a highly rated bank (the Support Provider),  which,  in effect,  directly guarantees the ABCP. Holders of ABCP issued under such an arrangement have the right to seek payment directly from the Support Provider if the Issuer fails to fully retire ABCP at its maturity. The Support Provider in such a program bears the risk that collections on the receivables in which the Issuer has acquired an interest will ultimately be insufficient to fully reimburse the Support Provider for payments made to holders of the ABCP. That risk is referred to as the credit risk of the receivables. The Support Provider in such a program also bears the risk that collections on the receivables,  although ultimately received,  will not be received quickly enough to provide funds to retire maturing ABCP on its scheduled maturity date. That risk is referred to as the *liquidity risk.*
The fact that the Support Provider bears both the credit risk and the liquidity risk insulates holders of the ABCP from both risks. The rating of such a program should be,  in most circumstances,  the same as the short-term rating of the Support Provider. 5 The concepts of *credit risk* and *liquidity risk* are fundamental to an understanding of ABCP programs. To reiterate,  credit risk is the risk that the receivables will suffer losses and ultimately not be fully collectible. In contrast,  liquidity risk is merely the risk that collections on receivables will not be received quickly enough to provide funds for the payment of maturing ABCP. An analysis of liquidity risk must start with the assumption that new ABCP cannot be issued to provide funds for the repayment of maturing ABCP. If it is assumed that ABCP can always be "rolled over, " then there is no liquidity risk. However,  an assumption that ABCP can always be rolled over is not consistent with a **Prime-1** rating in light of the many factors that might trigger a disruption in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] markets in general or in the markets for ABCP in particular. Moody's analysis of an ABCP program encompasses the credit risk,  the liquidity risk,  and other factors discussed below.

6 - Asset-Backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]: Understanding The Risks 5 If the Support Provider is a bank,  the program's rating generally should be the same as the short-term rating of the Support Provider for letters of credit.

## Indirect Fully Supported Abcp Programs

The first variation on the original form of ABCP program altered the support facility so that the Support Provider fully ensured the timely payment of maturing ABCP but only on an *indirect* basis. In such a program,  the Support Provider does not directly guarantee maturing ABCP,  and holders of maturing ABCP do not have direct recourse to the Support Provider. Instead,  the Support Provider agrees either (1) to purchase receivables from the Issuer for a price sufficient to permit the Issuer to repay maturing ABCP6 or (2) to make secured loans to the Issuer in an amount sufficient to permit the Issuer to repay maturing ABCP. The Support Provider's obligation to purchase receivables or to make loans secured by the receivables is not dependent on the value of the receivables. Regardless of the value of the receivables,  the Support Provider will always pay par on a purchase or lend at 100% of the face amount of the receivables pledged as collateral. Because the amount of receivables included in the program should always equal or exceed the outstanding amount of ABCP,  the coverage furnished by the Support Provider's commitment should always equal or exceed the amount of ABCP outstanding The Support Provider in such a program bears all the credit risk and all the liquidity risk,  but the holders of ABCP may be exposed to a third type of risk not present in the earlier,  direct fully supported programs - *structural risk*,  or the risk that funds paid to the Issuer and intended to be available to retire maturing ABCP will not be available for that purpose. For example,  if the Issuer becomes the subject of a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding in the U.S.,  it is possible that the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code or the actions of a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court could prevent the Issuer from making payments even when it has sufficient funds to do so. In that event,  holders of maturing ABCP could not turn to the Support Provider to obtain payment. Of course,  Moody's analyzes the structural risk of any ABCP program to determine that it is consistent with the rating assigned to the program.

6 For example,  in some programs,  the Support Provider pays par for a quantity of receivables equal to the excess of the face amount of maturing ABCP over the proceeds of the issuance of new ABCP.

7 A Support Provider's obligation to purchase receivables sometimes takes the form of an irrevocable revolving commitment or *IRC*. However,  an indirect fully supported program can be structured with a standby letter of credit payable to the Issuer,  an IRC,  a loan agreement,  or with other types of support devices. Accordingly,  the presence or absence of a standby letter of credit or an IRC is not dispositive for purposes of determining whether a given ABCP program is a direct fully supported program or an indirect fully supported program.

8 In addition,  in some indirect fully supported ABCP programs,  the obligations of the Support Provider may terminate upon the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of the Issuer. This structural variation may be undesirable from an investor's perspective because it increases the expected severity of losses to which investors are exposed if the Issuer goes into bankruptcy.

## Partially Supported Abcp Programs

The rise of bank risk-based capital standards around the world in the past several years has imposed significant costs on Support Providers in fully supported ABCP programs. Risk-based capital standards have required Support Providers to maintain capital for the entire face amount of ABCP outstanding under certain ABCP programs because the support facility has been viewed as a "direct credit substitute" and not merely as a loan commitment. Naturally,  Support Providers sought to pass their increased costs over to Sponsors,  and together,  Sponsors and Support Providers created partially supported ABCP programs intended to achieve more advantageous treatment under the risk-based capital standards (and correspondingly more advantageous funding costs for Sellers). The primary distinguishing feature of a partially supported ABCP program is that investors bear a portion of the credit risk; the supporting facilities are not intended to fully insulate investors from the credit risk associated with the receivables. That is,  investors must rely,  to some degree,  on the performance of the receivables in which the Issuer has acquired an interest. However,  if a partially supported ABCP program has been assigned a rating of **Prime-1**,  the magnitude of the credit risk borne by investors should be extremely small and consistent with that rating.

In a partially supported ABCP program,  there is not one supporting facility but two. The first addresses primarily credit risk but may also address liquidity risk. It is often referred to as the credit enhancement facility. The second,  which primarily addresses liquidity risk,  is called the liquidity facility. The credit enhancement facility is intended to cover any losses on the receivables,  up to a specified amount (*e.g., * 10% or 15% of the total amount of ABCP outstanding) In many programs,  the credit enhancement facility may also be used by the Issuer to obtain funds necessary for liquidity purposes. The liquidity facility,  on the other hand,  generally is not intended to cover the credit risk of the receivables. Moody's analysis of a partially supported ABCP program is much more demanding than the analysis of a fully supported program. The credit enhancement facility provides investors with only partial protection against losses on the underlying receivables. Therefore,  Moody's considers and analyzes: - The receivables,  - Each Seller of receivables,  - The nature of the relationship between each Seller and the Issuer (*i.e., * debtor-creditor or seller-purchaser),  and

- The allocation of risks between the credit enhancement facility and its companion liquidity facility to determine the minimum size of the credit enhancement facility necessary to address investors' exposure to the credit risk of the receivables. In practice,  allocating risks between a credit enhancement facility and its companion liquidity facility is not accomplished by resorting to the concepts of credit risk and liquidity risk. Indeed,  those concepts are merely abstractions that help one understand the character of the separate risks that comprise the overall risk of an ABCP program. As a practical matter,  it may not be possible to classify a given risk as consisting solely of credit risk or solely of liquidity risk. A given risk may contain elements of both. The allocation of risks between a credit enhancement facility and its companion liquidity facility actually depends largely on the Sponsor's preferences. If a liquidity facility covers a relatively broad variety of risks,  the required size of the credit enhancement facility may be somewhat smaller than if the liquidity facility is more limited. But in the final analysis,  any risks not covered by the liquidity facility must be covered instead by the credit enhancement facility.

8 - Asset-Backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]: Understanding The Risks 9 In certain ABCP programs,  the credit enhancement facility also may be used to cover miscellaneous or unforeseen liabilities of the Issuers.
In general,  for a partially supported ABCP program to receive a **Prime-1** rating,  both the credit enhancement facility and the liquidity facility must provide a **Prime-1** level of protection. In the simplest case,  the credit enhancement facility providers (each,  a Credit Enhancement Provider)
and the liquidity facility providers (each,  a Liquidity Provider) all have **Prime-1** ratings. However,  when large syndicates of providers act collectively and provide relatively high levels of coverage
(*e.g., * more than 100% of the total ABCP outstanding under the program),  an overall **Prime-1**
level of protection theoretically may be achieved even if some of the Credit Enhancement Providers or Liquidity Providers have ratings lower than **Prime-1**.

## The Credit Enhancement Facility

 ![500](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fPB8O1GtpFIcD5KtX5md1PBDA7PxH4Ony)

The role of the credit enhancement facility in a partially supported ABCP program is to be the last line of defense protecting investors from losses or delays in payment. Before the credit enhancement facility is used,  other measures should have been exhausted in attempting to prevent a loss or delay. For example,  with respect to the credit risk of receivables,  an Issuer will frequently advance to a Seller only a fraction of the face amount of the Seller's receivables. If the Issuer advances 90% of the face amount,  the receivables can suffer losses of up to 10% before the Issuer will be faced with a shortfall and will be required to use the credit enhancement facility. Similarly,  with regard to liquidity risk,  if receivables do not pay off as rapidly as expected (but have not otherwise become doubtful),  the liquidity facility should provide sufficient funds in respect of those receivables so that the Issuer can retire maturing ABCP in a timely manner. Only if the liquidity facility becomes unavailable or is exhausted would the Issuer use the credit enhancement facility for liquidity purposes. 10 There should be few,  if any,  conditions on the Issuer's ability to draw on the credit enhancement facility. In addition,  there should be few,  if any,  limitations on the purposes for which the Issuer may use funds drawn from the credit enhancement facility. Thus,  although the size of the credit enhancement facility may appear relatively small compared with the size of the entire ABCP program,  it provides an essential and highly significant measure of protection to the program. Because the credit enhancement facility can be used to cover losses on any receivables in the ABCP program,  it essentially cross-collateralizes all the different Sellers. In a partially supported ABCP program,  the credit enhancement facility may take the form of one or more standby letters of credit or irrevocable revolving commitments. It may combine several such letters of credit or irrevocable revolving commitments,  or it may be a combination of such devices with one or more financial guarantee insurance policies. Certain partially supported ABCP programs use a combination of cash-collateralized guarantees from the Sponsor (acting as a Credit Enhancement Provider) and financial guarantee insurance policies issued by monoline insurance companies. Generally,  the size of the credit enhancement facility is 10% to 15% of the maximum amount of ABCP that the program is authorized to issue. In some cases,  the committed amount under the credit enhancement facility fluctuates to maintain a constant percentage level with regard to the receivables financed by the program. In those cases,  there usually is an absolute dollar floor below which the committed amount is never reduced. The floor protects against the loss of diversity and a potential decline in asset credit quality as a program winds down. In addition,  if there is no limit on the maximum permitted Seller exposure,  the credit enhancement may be the greater of (1) the program's largest exposure to any single Seller or (2) a stated percentage of the program's size.

## The Liquidity Facility

In contrast to the credit enhancement facility,  the liquidity facility is generally relatively large in size but is subject to significant restrictions concerning its availability and use. For example,  in certain partially supported ABCP programs,  the size of the liquidity facility equals the difference of the total program size minus the size of the credit enhancement facility. Accordingly,  if the size of the credit enhancement facility is 10% of the program size,  the size of the liquidity facility might be 90% of the program size. The most common approach is to provide total liquidity coverage equal to the size of the program. If the credit enhancement facility is available to cover liquidity risk,  the separate liquidity facility need only cover the portion of liquidity risk not covered by the credit enhancement facility. 11 Certain restrictions on the use of a liquidity facility relate to excluding credit risk from the risks covered by the liquidity facility. 11 Certain restrictions on the use of *eligible receivables*,
meaning generally those that have not been affected by any event that calls into question their ultimate collectibility. For example,  a liquidity facility might exclude from the definition of eligible receivable any receivable which has become past due by more than 90 days. As long as such an event has not occurred,  the Liquidity Provider is required to "fund against" the receivable. On the other hand,  if an event occurs that causes a receivable to fail to qualify as an eligible receivable,  the Liquidity Provider is not required to fund against that receivable. This approach to excluding credit risk from the scope of a liquidity facility is the one generally used in ABCP programs established to finance trade receivables.

An alternative approach for excluding credit risk from the scope of the liquidity facility is to condition the availability of the liquidity facility on whether or not the credit enhancement facility has been exhausted. As long as the credit enhancement facility has not been exhausted,  the liquidity facility remains available. The availability of the credit enhancement facility is viewed as partially protecting the Liquidity Provider from credit risk. Of course,  as reflected by a **Prime-1** Moody's rating of any ABCP Issuer,  the probability of the credit enhancement facility being exhausted is extremely small. This approach to excluding credit risk from the scope of a liquidity facility is the one generally used in ABCP programs established to finance credit-card receivables In addition,  the availability of funds under most liquidity facilities is subject to the condition that the Issuer has not gone into bankruptcy. Accordingly,  it is just as important in a partially supported ABCP program as in a fully supported one that the Issuer be established as a special-purpose,  bankruptcy-remote entity. Liquidity facilities can take a variety of forms. For example,  a liquidity facility can take the form of a revolving loan agreement or a standby agreement to purchase receivables. Indeed,  in larger partially supported ABCP programs,  numerous Liquidity Providers may provide liquidity support through a variety of agreements. Multiple provider liquidity facilities appear in two main forms. In the first,  each Liquidity Provider is committed to provide liquidity for its proportionate share of the liquidity needs of the entire program. In such an arrangement,  each Liquidity Provider's commitment is "generic" and relates to all the receivables acquired by the Issuer and all the ABCP issued by the Issuer. Moody's refers to such an arrangement as a *program-level liquidity facility.*
In the second form of multiple provider liquidity facility,  each Liquidity Provider's commitment relates solely to the receivables acquired from a specific Seller and the ABCP issued by the Issuer to fund its acquisition of those receivables. Moody's refers to this kind of arrangement as a *seller-specific liquidity facility.* When an ABCP program uses only seller-specific liquidity facilities,

11 A small minority of partially supported ABCP programs have liquidity facilities sized much smaller than the difference between the total size of the ABCP program and the size of the credit enhancement facility. Those programs,  however,  restrict the purchases of receivables by the program to only highly liquid assets such as [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] issued by other **Prime-1**-rated issuers.

12 It is appropriate for a liquidity facility to exclude credit risk either through the definition of *eligible receivables* (the trade-receivables approach) or through the use of the condition that the credit enhancement has not been exhausted (the credit-card approach). However,  it generally is not appropriate for both approaches to be used in a single liquidity facility.
Times,  there is one such facility for each Seller in the program. The composite of all the individual seller-specific liquidity facilities is,  in effect,  the program's liquidity facility. However,  because the unused portion under any single seller-specific liquidity facility would not be available to provide liquidity with respect to any other Seller's receivables,  it is common for each of the individual seller-specific liquidity facilities to cover 100% of the amount of ABCP that could be issued with regard to the related Seller's receivables. If a liquidity facility involves numerous Liquidity Providers,  Moody's considers what measures the Issuer has at its disposal to obtain funds for liquidity if any one of the Liquidity Providers fails to make a liquidity advance. In particular,  Moody's considers the possible consequences of an ABCP program lacking a mechanism to prevent a [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] default if a single member of a large,  syndicated program-level liquidity facility becomes unable or unwilling to perform its obligations A simple way to address that issue is for one of the Liquidity Providers (generally the one with the largest commitment) to provide backup liquidity if any other member of the liquidity syndicate does not deliver funds when required. Another approach is to provide for a supplemental drawing mechanism that permits additional required liquidity to be obtained from all other syndicate members,  subject to each member's maximum commitment. Restrictions on the amount of ABCP that can mature on a single day can reduce the likelihood of a program not being able to obtain enough liquidity to meet its needs. For example,  suppose an ABCP program includes a restriction limiting the amount of ABCP maturing on any single day to no more than 20% of the authorized size of the entire program. In that case,  the program would never need more than 80% liquidity during a four-day interruption in the Issuer's ability to issue ABCP. The need for more than 80% liquidity could not arise until the fifth day. In the example from the preceding paragraph,  assuming that the program employed a 20% single-day maturity limit,  the need for $1.41 billion under the liquidity facility could not occur until the fifth day of the Issuer's inability to roll outstanding ABCP. By that time,  the problem with the defaulting Liquidity Provider may have been resolved,  or collections on the receivables may have been received.

13 Any liquidity facility that has more than 10 Liquidity Providers must have some mechanism to address the risk that one of the providers becomes unable or unwilling to fulfill its obligations under the liquidity facility. In some cases,  such a mechanism is required even when there is a smaller number of providers.
For example,  suppose that an ABCP program has a $1.5 billion liquidity facility furnished by a syndicate of 15 banks,  each of which agrees to share proportionately in making liquidity advances,  but subject to an absolute maximum commitment of $100 million per bank. Furthermore,  suppose that on a particular ABCP maturity date,  $750 million of ABCP is maturing,  and no new ABCP can be issued because of a disruption in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] markets. In that case,  $750 million would be required under the liquidity facility. Suppose also that one of the 15 banks has become unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the liquidity facility. In the absence of protective features,  each of the 14 other banks is obligated to advance only $50 million (*i.e., * one fifteenth of the required amount),  resulting in total liquidity advances of $700 million and a shortfall of $50 million. On the other hand,  if the liquidity facility provides for a supplemental drawing mechanism,  each of the 14 other banks would be obligated to advance an additional $3.57 million (*i.e., * one fourteenth of the $50 million potential shortfall). In that case,  there would be no shortfall.

However,  if the total amount required under the liquidity facility was $1.41 billion instead of $750 million,  even the presence of a supplemental draw mechanism would not prevent a shortfall because of the absolute $100 million cap on each bank's commitment.

 ![500](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fZNCQSIQq9myNoRnmqizlVXXbk6KP8XLb)

In analyzing certain liquidity facilities,  Moody's focuses closely on the definition of eligible receivables because that term may define the limits for the availability of funds under the liquidity facility. From the perspective of investors,  the fewer conditions,  the better. An alternative approach,  which offers significant potential but which has not yet achieved widespread use,  is to define eligible receivables as all receivables except for those that satisfy one or more disqualifying conditions. Any receivable that fails to be an eligible receivable for the liquidity facility may still be covered under the credit enhancement facility. However,  if too many of the receivables in the program fail to satisfy the criteria for being eligible receivables,  the capacity of the credit enhancement facility may be exhausted. Accordingly,  the smaller the relative size of the credit enhancement facility,  the more important it is to make sure that the definition of eligible receivables is not overly restrictive.

Some components of a definition of eligible receivables describe features that are permanent with regard to any given receivable. For example,  a definition of eligible receivables might require that a receivable be denominated in U.S. dollars. Other components of the definition,  however,  relate to features of a receivable that change over time. For example,  a definition might require that the receivable be no more than 120 days past due. In that case,  on the 120th day following the due date,  a given receivable could qualify as an eligible receivable,  but on the 121st day,  it would not. The maximum length of time that a receivable can be past due and still constitute an eligible receivable for purposes of a liquidity facility is a significant factor in determining the required size of the companion credit enhancement facility. One way of viewing the outer limit of a receivable's age for these purposes is to view that age limit as the time at which a receivable is deemed to be written off. Thus,  any receivable that reaches the age limit is presumed to be a credit problem that cannot be covered under the liquidity facility,  but instead only under the credit enhancement facility. In all cases,  it is desirable that receivables not be deemed written off until after they are likely to have been collected in the normal course of events (i.e.,  the aging limit should always be long enough to give obligors enough time to pay their bills). Because 60-day delinquencies generally exceed 90-day delinquencies,  and 90-day delinquencies generally exceed 120-day delinquencies,  the shorter the age limit on eligible receivables under the liquidity facility,  the more likely it will be that a greater proportion of all the receivables will not qualify as eligible receivables under the liquidity facility. Accordingly,  the credit enhancement facility might have to be larger than it would otherwise have to be to cover those "ineligible" receivables.

After a Liquidity Provider makes an advance against given receivables,  the Liquidity Provider is exposed to losses that are subsequently realized on those receivables. In many programs,  the Liquidity Provider is entitled to reimbursement for those losses from the credit enhancement facility. However,  if the credit enhancement facility can be used to protect the Liquidity Provider from losses realized on receivables following a liquidity advance,  the credit enhancement facility will have to be larger than it would otherwise have to be.

In nearly all ABCP programs,  the liquidity facility covers risks associated with *cash collected* but not remitted. That expression refers to collections received by a Seller (in its role as servicer of receivables) which have not been transferred by the Seller to the Issuer. A delay in the transfer of collections can occur in the ordinary course of business because Sellers may not transmit cash to the Issuer on a daily basis. A delay also can occur upon the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of a Seller,  in which case collections in the possession of the Seller might be subject to the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay

## Structural Risk: Bankruptcy-Remoteness

In indirect fully supported ABCP programs and partially supported ABCP programs,  Moody's analyzes the structural risk to determine that it is consistent with the rating assigned to the Issuer. *The key structural risk is that an Issuer will become entangled in a bankruptcy* proceeding. Ideally,  the Issuer's affairs should be arranged so that the Issuer neither (1) will be drawn into another entity's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding (under the theory of substantive consolidation) nor (2) will become the subject of its own [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding.

To minimize the risk that the Issuer could be consolidated into the Sponsor in the event of the Sponsor's bankruptcy,  the Issuer often is established as a so-called *orphan subsidiary*. That is,  the Issuer technically is owned not by the Sponsor but by an independent third party (such as a [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer or persons associated with a [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer). The Issuer is required to observe all corporate and legal formalities in connection with the conduct of its business and,  in some cases,  to have at least two independent directors. The prevailing view among the major law firms that work on ABCP programs appears to be that this ownership arrangement makes the likelihood that the Issuer would be consolidated into the Sponsor,  in the event of the Sponsor's insolvency,  extremely remote Beyond the matter of consolidation,  it is also necessary to minimize the risk that the Issuer could become the subject of its own [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding,  either voluntarily or involuntarily.

Toward that end,  additional protective measures may be appropriate. Many longer-term asset-backed securities structures require a special-purpose corporation to have at least two independent directors and require the consent of those directors for the corporation to commence a voluntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding. The presence of independent directors is intended to assure that any decision to commence a voluntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding will not be controlled by the parent corporation. Some ABCP programs employ exactly the same approach. Others attempt to reach the same result by establishing the Issuer as an orphan subsidiary (*i.e., * the stock of the orphan subsidiary is not owned by the Sponsor and,  therefore,  the Sponsor does not have the power to appoint the board of directors of the Issuer).

With regard to the risk that the Issuer could become the subject of its own involuntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding,  the most common protective measure is the establishment of the Issuer as a special-purpose corporation. The Issuer typically is restricted by its organizational documents from engaging in any activities other than (1) issuing ABCP,  (2) acquiring interests in receivables,  and (3) engaging in activities incidental to those functions. The limitations on the Issuer's activities are intended to limit the risk that the Issuer will incur unforeseen liabilities that might create a basis for an involuntary proceeding.

In most of the early securitization transactions,  the special-purpose financing vehicle conducted no activities on an ongoing basis other than holding a liquidating pool of mortgage loans or other assets. Accordingly,  the possibility of unforeseen liabilities was relatively remote. In contrast,  in a modern ABCP program,  especially a multiseller ABCP program,  the Issuer more

15 The power of a Bankruptcy Court to order the substantive consolidation of two or more entities emanates from the court's equitable powers under Section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code. The legal opinions that Moody's has received addressing the issue of substantive consolidation generally indicate that substantive consolidation is an extreme remedy that should only be applied in limited circumstances and for limited purposes such as the prevention of fraud or the enforcement of a paramount equity. In particular,  circumstances that may increase the likelihood of the substantive consolidation of separate entities include the following: (1) creditors having dealt with the separate entities as a single economic unit in extending credit,  (2)
fraudulent transfers of assets among the separate entities,  (3) extreme entanglement of the affairs of the separate entities,  and (4) disregard of the distinct legal identities of the separate entities. *See generally Collier on Bankruptcy* ¶100.06; *In re Augie/Restivo Baking Co., * 860 Fd 515 (2d Cir. 1988); *Fish v. East, * 114 Fd 177 (10th Cir. 1940); *In re Vecco Construction Industries, * 4 B.R. 407 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1980). In addition,  from a practical perspective,  the issue of substantive consolidation also may arise under the other legal rubrics including instrumentality,  alter ego,  piercing the corporate veil,  and *reverse piercing of the corporate veil.* Although the cases discussed by counsel in the legal opinions received by Moody's have been limited to situations involving the proposed consolidation of legally affiliated entities (*i.e., * some measure of common ownership),  the general approach to substantive consolidation arguably should be equally applicable in an analysis of technically unaffiliated entities. In the context of a bank-sponsored ABCP program in which the Sponsor is not technically affiliated with the Issuer,  the Sponsor's right to receive (and set the level of) fee income from the Issuer might be viewed as a disguised class of equity which arguably could provide the basis for a substantive consolidation attack by a creditor of the Sponsor. Moody's analyzes the substantive consolidation aspect of structural risk and reviews legal opinions to determine that the magnitude of the risk is sufficiently small so as to be consistent with the rating assigned to an ABCP program.
closely resembles an operating finance company,  and the possibility of such liabilities cannot be so easily dismissed. For example,  unforeseen liabilities could arise in favor of third parties through the Issuer's normal operations as a result of administrative or managerial mistakes or as a result of customary indemnification arrangements or taxes. In addition,  in some circumstances,  the Issuer may be subject to a wide variety of potential tort liabilities. To the extent that miscellaneous potential liabilities can be identified in advance,  they can be addressed through a variety of means. For example,  the risk of liability resulting from administrative or managerial errors often can be addressed by obtaining *indemnification* from the administrator or manager of the program. Similarly,  the risk that the Issuer might become liable to a Liquidity Provider for increased costs can be addressed by limiting the Issuer's liability to the extent that it is able to collect corresponding amounts from the Sellers in the program. Another,  highly effective approach for addressing the risk of unforeseen liabilities is to fashion the support facility (in the case of an indirect fully supported program) or the credit enhancement facility (in the case of a partially supported program) so that it is available to satisfy any unforeseen liabilities of the Issuer When the support facility or credit enhancement facility can be used to provide funds with which to satisfy unforeseen liabilities of the Issuer,  any unforeseen creditors should receive payment and,  therefore,  should have no further claim against the Issuer to provide the basis for an involuntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding.

However,  using the support facility or the credit enhancement facility to satisfy unforeseen liabilities may create a corresponding new liability to repay or reimburse the Support Provider or the Credit Enhancement Provider. Without the use of certain protective devices,  the Issuer's obligation to reimburse the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider arguably might cause the Issuer to be insolvent17 or to have a material debt which it is unable to pay. If the Issuer is unable to promptly reimburse the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider,  it is more likely that any new unforeseen creditor may be able to assert that the Issuer is generally failing to pay its debts.

Therefore,  certain techniques have been used to attenuate the Issuer's reimbursement obligation so that the Issuer would not be deemed to be insolvent or to be failing to pay its debts generally as they come due,  merely because of the reimbursement obligation. One of the best ways to attenuate the Issuer's reimbursement obligation is to impose conditions precedent on the obligation. If properly crafted,  conditions precedent can significantly bolster the argument that the Issuer is not insolvent and is not failing to pay its debts generally as they come due. A second way to attenuate the Issuer's obligation to reimburse the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider is the establishment of a distant maturity date on the reimbursement obligation (usually at least a year and a day after the latest maturing ABCP). Because the reimbursement obligation is not immediately "due, " the present failure to pay the reimbursement amount arguably should not constitute the failure to pay a debt as it comes due. A third attenuation technique is to limit the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider's recourse to specific assets (*i.e., * the receivables acquired by the Issuer) and a fourth is the subordination of the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider's claim for reimbursement

16 A support or credit enhancement facility may be available to pay miscellaneous liabilities either directly or indirectly. In the direct case,  the support facility can be drawn at any time and for any purpose. In the indirect case,  collections on the receivables received between ABCP maturity dates are available to pay miscellaneous liabilities,  and the support facility can be used on a maturity date to cover any shortfall resulting from the use of collections to satisfy miscellaneous liabilities. 17 Insolvency is not sufficient grounds for an involuntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding. However,  Moody's views the insolvency of an issuer as an extremely negative event. If the issuer truly is insolvent,  the probability that the issuer might commence a voluntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding is much greater than if the issuer is solvent. Similarly,  if the issuer is insolvent,  there is an increased probability that it ultimately will become unable to pay its debts as they come due.

18 In some cases,  conditions precedent address (1) the right of the Support Provider or the Credit Enhancement Provider to receive payment from the Issuer and (2) the obligation of the Issuer to make the relevant payment. It is often appropriate to simultaneously use conditions precedent,  a distant maturity date,  limited recourse,  and subordination. In an appropriate context,  a provision limiting the Issuer's reimbursement obligation might provide that,  so long as any ABCP remains outstanding and the Issuer is not the subject of a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding,  the right of the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider to receive any payment from the Issuer would be subject to the following conditions precedent: (1) the making of such payment would not render the Issuer insolvent and (2) the availability of funds to make such payment. In addition,  the provision might require that any right to payment from the Issuer,  in favor of the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider,  arising as a result of the satisfaction of both the conditions precedent,  would be without recourse other than to the assets of the Issuer pledged to the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider under the applicable agreement. The provision might further state that unless and until both the conditions precedent are satisfied,  the Issuer would have no obligation to make any such payment. Finally,  the provision might conclude that any right to payment from the Issuer,  in favor of the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider,  arising as a result of the satisfaction of both the conditions,  would be subordinated to the ABCP holders' right to payment on the ABCP.
In all cases,  Moody's considers the risk of potential unforeseen liabilities and considers how those risks are addressed. As noted above,  one approach is to devise numerous specific measures,  each of which is directed at a particular potential liability. A second approach is to make the support or credit enhancement facility available to cover unforeseen liabilities (and to attenuate the Issuer's obligation to reimburse the Support or Credit Enhancement Provider). The two approaches have different merits and shortcomings,  but the second is generally the more simple to implement in the appropriate documents. Moody's will continue to monitor the ongoing evolution of practices and standards relating to the treatment of miscellaneous or unforeseen liabilities. As a further protection against the risk of an involuntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding,  it is highly desirable for all entities that enter into contracts with the Issuer to make "nonpetition covenants" in which they agree not to commence (or join in commencing) an involuntary [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding against the Issuer. However,  there remains some doubt concerning whether a nonpetition covenant would survive the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of the maker of the covenant - that is,  a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] trustee of the covenant maker arguably might not be bound by the nonpetition covenant. If reliance is placed solely on nonpetition covenants,  the strength of the Issuer's bankruptcy-remoteness may be linked to the financial condition or credit strength of each maker of a nonpetition covenant. Accordingly,  nonpetition [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] generally should not be the primary means for addressing the risk of involuntary bankruptcy. 19

## Sellers' Preferential Transfers

Another aspect of the structural risk present in an indirect fully supported program or a partially supported program is the possibility that a trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of a bankrupt Seller might have a preference claim against the Issuer and,  therefore,  might be able to force the Issuer into bankruptcy. For example,  in some cases,  the Seller-Issuer relationship is essentially that of debtor to creditor,  with the Issuer making loans to the Seller secured by the Seller's receivables portfolio. If the Seller goes into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] shortly after repayment of the loan and if the value of the collateral is determined (after the fact) to have been less than the amount of the loan,  the Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] may be able to assert that a portion of the repayment of the loan by the Seller constitutes a *voidable preferential transfer* by the Seller The Issuer then may be liable to the Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] for the amount of the voidable preferential transfer. If the Issuer lacks the funds to satisfy that liability (and assuming the support facility is not available to pay miscellaneous liabilities),  the Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] might be able to attack the Issuer and impair the Issuer's bankruptcy-remoteness. An ABCP program must address the risk of a Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] claiming that a past payment by the Seller constitutes a voidable preferential transfer. One way is for the Issuer to use collections on other receivables to pay the Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] the amount of the voidable preferential transfer and to treat the resulting claim against the Seller's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] estate as a new receivable that can be sold to the Support Provider (in an indirect fully supported program) or the Liquidity Provider (in a partially supported program). 21 Under such an approach,  the structural risk is effectively shifted to the Support or Liquidity Provider,  in all cases except for those in which the claim by a Seller's trustee in [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] exceeds the total amount of the Support or Liquidity Provider's commitment to purchase (or make loans against) receivables.

19 In addition,  unforeseen creditors usually will not have made nonpetition covenants. 20 *See* Bankruptcy Code § 547. 21 In the case of partially supported programs,  the liquidity facility is generally available to cover preference risk. If the liquidity facility is not available to cover preference risk,  the credit enhancement facility must cover that risk and,  accordingly,  the credit enhancement facility might be significantly larger than it would otherwise have to be.

## Operations And Legal Relationships In A Typical Multiseller Abcp Program

The *dramatis personae* of a bank-sponsored,  multiseller ABCP program includes many players.

The two main entities involved in an ABCP program are the Issuer and its Sponsor. However,  as noted above,  those two entities often are not affiliated - the Issuer may be established as a socalled *orphan subsidiary*. 22

 ![500](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/f9b3CPt5Vp8C4IidrLnkMwPsy0o0sH60R)

Although the Issuer technically is often owned by a third party not affiliated with the Sponsor,  the Sponsor actually controls the activities of the Issuer. That arrangement is often established by means of an administration agreement or a management agreement between the Issuer and the Sponsor. Such an agreement typically appoints the Sponsor as administrative agent or managing agent for the Issuer and grants to the Sponsor a power of attorney to take all actions on behalf of the Issuer. In addition,  the Sponsor or one of its affiliates may serve as the depositary for the ABCP according to a depositary agreement with the Issuer. In addition,  subsidiaries or affiliates of the Sponsor may enter into other contractual relationships with the Issuer.

For example,  the Issuer and such an affiliate may enter into a referral agreement under which the affiliate is appointed the referral agent to refer potential Sellers to the Issuer.

 ![500](https://storage.simpletex.cn/view/fSN0hxO3ThFmMSzAMdWrD1ImKHC1uxqxB)

Credit Enhancement Facility Provider(s)
The Sponsor and its affiliates receive fees for each of their roles under the program agreements. The exact amount of the fees is not determined in advance. Instead,  the level of the fees is continually adjusted so that substantially all the Issuer's income remaining after payment of fees to unaffiliated Credit Enhancement Providers and Liquidity Providers (and to other unaffiliated service providers) is paid over to the Sponsor or to its affiliates. Only a token amount of the Issuer's income is paid out as a dividend to the legal owner of the Issuer.

Sponsor and Affiliates
As noted above,  in some ABCP programs,  an entity associated with a [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer may be the legal owner of the issuer. However,  regardless of the ownership of the issuer,  the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer's main operational role in the program is to serve as a dealer and provide access to its customers as potential investors in the ABCP In some cases,  the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer provides other services for the issuer,  such as arranging hedge contracts.

In addition to an issuer,  a sponsor,  and a [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer,  an ABCP program also must include either a support provider (in the case of a fully supported ABCP program) or a combination of one or more credit enhancement providers and one or more liquidity providers (in the case of a partially supported program). If the sponsor has a sufficiently strong credit rating,  it customarily will be one of the credit enhancement providers and one of the liquidity providers.

22 In some programs,  the issuer is a subsidiary of a trust,  the beneficiaries of which are either directors and officers of an unaffiliated [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer or members of the directors' and officers' families.

23 If the sponsor has an affiliated [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer,  that entity may serve as a second [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dealer for the program.

## The Issuer-Seller Relationship

In addition to the participants described above,  every ABCP program has Sellers. Most Sellers are customers of the Sponsor,  but Sellers may also be referred by Credit Enhancement or Liquidity Providers for the program. The Issuer either purchases receivables from a Seller according to a receivables purchase agreement or extends loans (secured by the Seller's receivables) to a Seller according to a receivables financing agreement. Because Sellers have differing needs (and because of competition among Sponsors),  receivables purchase agreements and receivables financing agreements can vary substantially from one Seller to another in the same ABCP program. However,  virtually all these agreements employ the concept of "eligible receivables." The concept of eligible receivables as employed in receivables purchase agreements and receivables financing agreements is related to but distinct from the concept as used in the agreements governing a liquidity facility. In many older ABCP programs,  a single definition is used for both purposes. For purposes of a receivables purchase agreement or a receivables financing agreement,  the concept of eligible receivables is used to identify those receivables against which the Issuer will advance funds24 to the Seller. In essence,  the Seller's eligible receivables (under the receivables purchase agreement or receivables financing agreement) are the funding base for the Seller's involvement in the ABCP program. Accordingly,  from the perspectives of the Issuer and of investors in the ABCP,  it is desirable to have a relatively restrictive definition of eligible receivables in a receivables purchase agreement or receivables financing agreement to assure that the Issuer advances funds only against high-quality receivables. On the other hand,  from the perspective of investors,  once the Issuer has advanced funds against particular receivables,  it is desirable that the notion of eligible receivables as used in the liquidity facility be less restrictive in order to provide the greatest possible degree of liquidity protection. In effect,  when the definition of eligible receivables under the liquidity facility is less restrictive than the definition of eligible receivables under a receivables purchase or financing agreement,  the Liquidity Provider assumes some risk that a defect in the receivables may be discovered after the transfer of the receivables to the Issuer. If the defect would have caused the receivables to fail to qualify for transfer to the Issuer in the first place,  the Issuer should have recourse to the Seller. However,  if the Seller has become bankrupt,  the entire risk of the receivables must be covered by the liquidity facility or by its companion credit enhancement facility. As long as the defect does not cause the receivables to fail to qualify as eligible receivables under the liquidity facility,  the liquidity facility should be available with regard to the receivables,  and the Liquidity Provider bears the risk associated with that particular defect. However,  if the defect causes the receivables to fail to qualify as eligible receivables under the liquidity facility,  the liquidity facility will not be available with regard to those receivables. A Liquidity Provider can manage its risk exposure resulting from any difference between the definition of eligible receivables under the liquidity facility and under a receivables purchase or financing agreement by monitoring and auditing the Sellers participating in the ABCP program. For example,  one of the elements of the definition of eligible receivables under a receivables purchase or financing agreement may be the requirement that Issuer (or a collateral agent) have a perfected security interest in the receivables. A clerical error may cause the Issuer's security interest in the receivables not to be perfected. If the definition of eligible receivables under the liquidity facility includes an identical requirement,  the result of the clerical error could be that the receivables have no coverage at all under the liquidity facility. In that case,  the entire burden of addressing the consequences of the Issuer not having a perfected security interest in the receivables falls on the shoulders of the credit enhancement facility. On the other hand,  if the

24 As noted,  the transactions between the Issuer and a Seller can take the form of either outright sales of receivables or loans by the Issuer to the Seller secured by collateral consisting of the Seller's receivables. In either case,  the Issuer is said to "fund against" or to "advance funds against" the receivables that have been sold or pledged by the Seller.
Definition of eligible receivables under the liquidity facility includes no such requirement; the liquidity facility remains available with regard to the receivables. The Liquidity Provider can protect itself from the risk of not having a perfected security interest by reviewing the necessary documents and financing statements at the inception of the Seller's participation in the ABCP program. It is generally impractical for a Seller specifically to identify and segregate those receivables that qualify as eligible receivables under the Seller's receivables purchase or financing agreement from those receivables that do not so qualify. Therefore,  when an Issuer purchases or lends against receivables from a Seller,  the Issuer typically acquires an interest in all the Seller's receivables or in a specific pool of receivables that includes both eligible and ineligible receivables. In connection with an advance of funds against an estimated $25 million of eligible receivables,  the Seller may assign to the Issuer receivables having an outstanding balance substantially in excess of $25 million. The Seller,  in effect,  represents and warrants that the receivables assigned include at least $25 million of receivables that qualify as eligible receivables under the terms of the receivables purchase or financing agreement.

An Issuer generally will not advance $25 million against eligible receivables having an outstanding balance of $25 million. Rather,  the Issuer may apply some sort of discount factor (25%) in order to provide a measure of protection against receivables that prove to be uncollectible. Receivables that do not qualify as eligible receivables are not taken into account in determining the discount factor. In addition to,  or in lieu of,  applying a discount factor,  the Issuer may require the Seller to fully or partially guarantee payment of the receivables by the underlying obligors; that is,  the Issuer may require full or partial recourse against the Seller. (26) Following the sale or pledge of receivables to an Issuer by a Seller,  the Seller continues to service the receivables. In the case of trade receivables,  where the receivables represent obligations of the Seller's customers for merchandise sold or services rendered by the Seller in the ordinary course of its business,  the Seller's servicing activity consists of collecting payments due from its customers (the underlying obligors). The Seller remits all amounts collected to an account of the Issuer,  up to the amount advanced by the Issuer for the related receivables (plus interest and fees).

As the receivables are paid off by the underlying obligors,  the Seller generally transfers additional receivables to the Issuer. The receivables purchase or financing agreement between the Seller and the Issuer describes the Issuer's commitment to advance funds against the Seller's receivables. That commitment defines the maximum amount that the Issuer will advance at any time during the term of the agreement. In some arrangements,  as long as the agreement remains in force and its conditions for making advances are satisfied,  the Issuer is obligated to continue making advances against the Seller's new receivables to replace the paid-off advances made against receivables that have been collected. In effect,  the receivables purchase agreement is the equivalent of a revolving line of credit. In other cases,  the Issuer purchases or lends against receivables on an offering basis and has the right to cease purchasing or extending credit at any time. In a minority of cases,  the Issuer acquires only a liquidating pool of receivables and may not acquire any other receivables from the Seller.

25 For trade receivables,  a typical approach is to apply a discount factor equal to the greater of a specified percentage of the receivables balance or a multiple of the historical level of losses (measured by the loss-to-liquidation ratio) on the Seller's receivables over the past six months.

26 The use of recourse in lieu of a discount factor is appropriate only if the Seller has a relatively strong rating.

## Analysis of Credit Risk in a Typical Partially Supported Abcp Program

In a partially supported ABCP program,  Moody's analyzes each Seller's credit strength,  the relationship between the Seller and the Issuer,  and the Seller's receivables. In addition,  Moody's analyzes the effect of the possible correlation of risk across Sellers in an ABCP program. Finally,  Moody's considers relative Seller size limits,  if any,  and the program's level of Seller diversification. Based on the results of that analysis,  Moody's can assess whether the levels of protection from a proposed credit enhancement facility and a proposed liquidity facility,  together with any proposed operational restrictions on the Issuer,  are consistent with the desired rating of the Issuer.

## The Seller’s Credit Strength And Relationship With The Issuer

The Seller's credit strength is important because it is unlikely that the Issuer will suffer any losses relating to the Seller's receivables as long as the Seller remains solvent. Even when a discount factor is used as the method of Seller-level credit enhancement,  the Issuer customarily has recourse to the Seller for losses attributable to dilution In addition,  the solvency of the Seller may determine whether the Issuer has access to a continually replenished *revolving pool* of receivables or merely to a static *liquidating pool* of receivables.

## Revolving Pool

In many instances,  the Issuer acquires an interest in all present and future receivables of the Seller. Therefore,  even if a particular batch of receivables experiences losses in excess of the discount factor,  the Issuer ultimately can recover the entire amount advanced from the Seller's future receivables; that is,  the Issuer has access to a continually replenished revolving pool of receivables.

## Liquidating Pool

On the other hand,  if the Seller becomes insolvent,  the opportunity for recoveries from future receivables may be eliminated. That could occur if the Seller ceases its operations in connection with its insolvency or if it ceases transferring receivables to the Issuer. Also,  the Seller-Issuer relationship might not give the Issuer an interest in all the Seller's future receivables in the event that the Seller voluntarily withdraws from the program. In each such case,  the Issuer would have access only to a liquidating pool of receivables. From the Issuer's perspective,  the difference between having access to a revolving pool of receivables and having access to a liquidating pool of receivables may be quite drastic. As illustrated in the example in *Appendix I*,  an apparently stable and modest level of losses in the context of a revolving pool can become a significant threat if the pool stops revolving and becomes a static liquidating pool. As the pool liquidates,  the absolute amount of losses realized each month may not decline at the same rate as the outstanding balance of the receivables. That could happen if the occurrence of losses lags significantly behind the creation of the related receivables. In that case,  the relative amount of losses (*i.e., * losses as a percentage of outstanding balance) might increase significantly as the pool liquidates.

The [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or insolvency of a Seller may also trigger legal attacks on the transfer of receivables by the Seller to the Issuer. In particular,  because of the revolving characteristics of the relationship between the Issuer and a Seller,  even if the parties intend that each advance entail an outright *sale* of receivables by the Seller to the Issuer,  the realities of the overall relationship arguably may justify viewing the entire arrangement as a *financing* in which the Seller borrows

1. Losses attributable to dilution may significantly exceed losses due to obligor credit problems or bankruptcies. Dilution is addressed below in the discussion of trade receivables.
Money from the Issuer and gives the Issuer a security interest in the Seller's receivables. 28. In the normal course of events,  the characterization of the transfer of an interest in receivables does not matter. However,  if the Seller becomes a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code,  the characterization becomes critical. If the transfer of receivables is viewed as a sale,  the receivables do not constitute a part of the Seller's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] estate,  and the Issuer's right to pursue collections on the receivables from the underlying obligors is not subject to the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay. On the other hand,  if the transfer of receivables by a Seller to the Issuer is viewed merely as a series of pledges according to a financing arrangement,  the receivables do constitute a portion of the Seller's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] estate and the Issuer's right to collect amounts due on the receivables from the underlying obligors is subject to the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay. If the Seller-Issuer relationship is viewed as a financing,  the Issuer's security interest in the receivables provides little protection to the Issuer unless that security interest is perfected. In addition,  even if the Seller-Issuer relationship is not recharacterized,  the *sale* of certain types of assets is treated as the creation of a security interest. 29. Accordingly,  the Issuer customarily takes steps to obtain a first-priority,  perfected security interest in the Seller's receivables.

Because the receivables most often constitute "accounts, " "chattel paper, " or "general [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangibles]] " within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code,  the Issuer's security interest is perfected by means of filing financing statements in the appropriate public offices. In addition,  Liquidity Providers may require lockbox accounts to be established for segregating and further protecting the Issuer's security interest in the collections on the receivables. If the transfer of receivables is viewed as a sale,  it is more likely that the Issuer will be deemed not to have interest in any receivables created after the commencement of the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding. In addition,  even if the transfer is characterized as a financing in which the Seller expressly grants to the Issuer a security interest in all the Seller's "after acquired" receivables such a security interest may not cover receivables generated by the Seller following the commencement of a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding. 31 In that case,  the Issuer technically would have rights only in the liquidating pool of receivables existing before the commencement of the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding.

Even though the Issuer technically may not have rights in receivables generated by a Seller following the Seller's withdrawal from the program or following the Seller's bankruptcy,  as a practical matter,  the Seller (or the Seller's trustee in bankruptcy) may be unable to identify and

28 The issue of whether a particular transaction constitutes a sale or a financing is often referred to as the *true sale issue.* The issue arises in a [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding in which any party asserts that a purported sale of an asset by the debtor should be recharacterized as a financing. The result of a successful attack against a purported sale is that the subject asset becomes property of the debtor's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] estate and that the entity which had "purchased" the asset in the recharacterized sale suddenly finds itself a secured creditor. In general,  the types of factors courts have considered relevant to an analysis of whether a sale should be recognized as such in an insolvency or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding are (1) the objective indications of the intent of the parties,  (2) the legal characteristics of the sale,  and (3) the economic substance of the transaction. Objective Indications of Intent: Courts attach significance to both the form of the documentation used by the parties to characterize a transaction and the actions of the parties subsequent to the transaction. However,  simply labeling a transfer as a sale ordinarily will not control the legal effect. With regard to the conduct considered relevant,  permitting a seller to commingle the sold property with its own or to use the property for the seller's own purposes has influenced some courts to characterize a sale as a loan for purposes of an insolvency or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding. The commingling of funds has been cited by courts as a significant factor in determining whether a transfer is a sale or a loan. In cases in which a court concluded that commingling was inconsistent with a sale,  however,  that commingling frequently had been coupled with the essentially unrestricted right of the seller to use the funds for its own purposes. Legal Characteristics: Apart from the objective indications of the intent of the parties,  many courts independently assess the legal characteristics of the transaction. Factors that have been cited by some courts as leading to the conclusion that a sale should be characterized as a loan for purposes of an insolvency or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceeding include (1) the ability of the seller to substitute new property for the property transferred,  (2) the obligation of the seller to transfer additional property to the buyer without any additional payment from the buyer,  and (3) a structure providing for level payments by the seller to the buyer regardless of amounts collected on the transferred property.

Economic Substance: Many courts have held that an analysis of the economic substance of the transaction is an essential element in the characterization process. The major factor cited by courts in their analyses of the economic substance of transactions labeled as sales is the extent to which risks and benefits associated with ownership of the property have been transferred to the purchaser. The risks of ownership are essentially that the property transferred either will decline in value or will experience payment defaults. When the buyer has recourse to the seller to compensate it for all losses so occasioned,  courts have concluded that the seller has retained the related risk and that the economic substance of the transaction is that of a secured loan by the buyer to the seller. In addition,  rights to repurchase the subject assets,  to substitute assets,  and to retain any surplus remaining after obligations to pay amounts to the buyer are satisfied,  may indicate a debtor-creditor relationship.

To segregate collections with regard to receivables generated before the withdrawal or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] from collections with regard to receivables generated after the withdrawal or bankruptcy. In that case,  the Issuer effectively might continue to have access to a continually replenished revolving pool (to the extent that the Seller continues to generate new receivables). However,  the likelihood of that occurring is not readily estimable and,  therefore,  Moody's assumes that the Issuer has access only to a liquidating pool following a Seller's bankruptcy. In addition,  unless otherwise specifically provided in the relevant documents,  Moody's assumes that the Issuer has access only to a liquidating pool following a Seller's withdrawal from the program for other reasons.

Beyond the *revolving pool* vs. *liquidating pool* issue and the *sale* vs. *financing* issue,  the credit strength of a Seller is important in other ways. For example,  if the Issuer has obtained a full or a partial guarantee of the receivables from the Seller,  the guarantee may have little value if the Seller goes bankrupt. The solvency of the Seller may also have a significant effect on the expected payment behavior of the Seller's customers (the obligors on the receivables). In the case of trade receivables,  if the Seller becomes insolvent,  many of the Seller's customers may delay their payments or refuse to make their payments altogether. Such customers may assert that they are withholding payment either through the warranty period on delivered goods or pending the verification that the goods delivered or services rendered meet certain specifications. In addition,  in certain circumstances,  the customers' ability to pay might be correlated with the Seller's solvency.

If a Seller is rated by Moody's,  *the Seller's rating is used for the determination of the probability of the Seller's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or insolvency.* If a Seller is not rated,  it is treated as having a low noninvestment-grade32 rating unless substantial evidence indicates that a higher rating level is more appropriate.

## Credit Quality Of A Seller'S Receivables

The analysis of a Seller's receivables uses the Seller's historical loss experience on its receivables portfolio as a basis for estimating future losses. That approach requires explaining why losses occur. One obvious reason is that an underlying obligor (*i.e., * a Seller's customer liable for payment on a receivable) may become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill its payment obligation. However,  obligor insolvencies are only one reason for losses on receivables. With regard to trade receivables,  other factors,  such as returns of sold goods,  disputes,  offsets,  credits,  rebates,  and warranty claims,  can significantly *dilute* the value of outstanding receivables. The nature,  degree,  and effect of both obligor credit quality and dilution can vary markedly across industries and even across Sellers within a particular industry. Also,  fluctuations in the value of underlying collateral can affect the level of losses on longer-term,  secured receivables.

The analysis of a Seller's receivables often focuses on the Seller's experience in aging receivables. For example,  if a Seller routinely has many receivables that age beyond 120 days but which historically are fully collected within 180 days,  it may be appropriate to tailor the liquidity facility's definition of eligible receivables to include those receivables. Otherwise,  the liquidity facility might not cover those receivables even though there is an objective basis for concluding that they are collectible. On a program-wide basis,  it is desirable to have a relatively larger number of Sellers,  each of which contributes a relatively small portion of the receivables,  so that diversification reduces the Issuer's maximum exposure to the credit risk of any single Seller. Similarly,  it is desirable to have a substantial degree of diversification of obligor risk. Accordingly,  each Seller is often restricted concerning the maximum portion of its receivables that are payable by a single obligor. If such a restriction is applied on a uniform basis across all Sellers in a program,  the result is an overall limitation on the Issuer's exposure to any single obligor.

32 Securities rated **Baa3** or higher are referred to as being investment-grade. The terms noninvestment-grade and speculative-grade are applied to securities that have been assigned ratings below Baa3.

Moody's also considers how an ABCP program proposes to manage the Issuer's exposure to large Sellers and obligors. It is desirable for a program to limit the Issuer's maximum exposure to any single Seller and any single obligor: even highly rated Sellers and obligors are subject to event risk,  and a high-quality obligor may delay payment on a receivable (even though it is able to pay promptly) if it is dissatisfied with the related Seller's goods or services. It is beneficial for a program's exposure limits to be based on the credit ratings of Sellers and obligors (*e.g., * the Issuer might be permitted to purchase up to $75 million of receivables from an investment-grade Seller but only $25 million from a non-investment-grade Seller). For Moody's analysis,  it is highly desirable for an ABCP program to limit the Issuer's exposure to any single non-investment-grade Seller or obligor.

To protect against a deterioration in the credit quality of an individual Seller's receivables,  most ABCP programs incorporate "seller termination events." These typically include receivables performance triggers as well as the occurrence of certain events affecting a Seller (*e.g., * bankruptcy,  insolvency,  change of control,  and others). Some programs provide that the failure of a Seller to maintain an investment-grade rating constitutes a seller termination event. If a program uses performance triggers,  Moody's considers whether those triggers are based on performance in a single month or on a moving average of performance over several months. A trigger based on a moving average may not be reached until performance has worsened well beyond the trigger level. For example,  if a Seller's losses on its receivables are increasing,  a three-month moving average loss trigger of 6% might not be reached until monthly losses are significantly worse than 6%. If losses are 1% in the first month,  1% in the second,  6% in the third,  10% in the fourth,  and 14% in the fifth,  a three-month moving average loss trigger of 6% would not be reached until the fifth month. Moody's approach to rating a partially supported ABCP program is to focus primarily on the Sellers and on the obligors to which the Issuer has the greatest risk exposure. Indeed,  with regard to any particular Seller,  the receivables of which constitute only a small amount compared to the size of the program's credit enhancement facility,  an abbreviated analysis may be all that is necessary. If the credit enhancement facility is sufficiently large,  the negative impact that such a Seller could have on the program would be minimal. On the other hand,  if an ABCP program is just starting up and has only a small number of Sellers,  or if the credit enhancement facility is sized near the minimum level necessary to achieve the desired rating,  every Seller must be closely and thoroughly scrutinized.

## Trade Receivables

Trade receivables arise from transactions between business entities. They are distinguishable from consumer receivables in that the underlying obligor is a business rather than a consumer.

In general,  the term *trade receivables* encompasses only those business-to-business receivables that are due and payable in less than one year. A typical Seller's portfolio of trade receivables has an average life and a turnover period of 30 to 60 days.

Trade receivables tend to be much less fungible than consumer receivables because there is often a more significant interdependence between a Seller and its customers. The Seller's trade credit underwriting process is likely to be far more subjective than typical consumer credit underwriting processes. In general,  a Seller is initially willing to extend trade credit to a potential customer provided that the customer can provide credit references and historical information. A small customer with a weak credit history may receive only a low initial credit limit that can be increased after the customer develops a positive track record with the Seller. A large potential customer with a weak credit history may create a more difficult situation: such a customer may demand a high initial credit limit,  and the Seller may be pressured into compromising otherwise-strict credit underwriting policies in the interest of promoting the relationship with the large customer.

Similar issues arise in ongoing credit relationships between a Seller and its customers. For instance,  a Seller generally does not stop shipping goods or put a customer on a cash basis,  even though the customer has substantial unpaid balances. Instead,  the Seller tries to work with the customer by extending payment terms or implementing some other form of special arrangement. The Seller often does not write off the receivables due from such a customer within a reasonable time after the receivables were originally created. In fact,  some Sellers may not have any formalized write-off policy and will carry nonperforming receivables for one or two years before determining the receivables to be uncollectible.

Accordingly,  *historical data furnished by a Seller concerning losses on its receivables portfolio can be highly misleading.* As an alternative,  it may be appropriate to use data concerning the aging of receivables. Any receivable that ages beyond a certain point can be deemed uncollectible. In an analysis of a Seller's trade receivables based on aging data,  Moody's deems uncollectible any receivable that ages beyond the point at which it is no longer an eligible receivable under the liquidity facility. If available,  true static pool data often is the best foundation for analysis Even if a Seller can furnish accurate time series data about the aging of its receivables portfolio,  the data may provide little comfort if the portfolio is concentrated in a small number of underlying obligors and the identities of the obligors change frequently. In other words,  historical aging data are least useful for the estimation of future losses when the Seller's business involves making a relatively small number of one-shot sales of big-ticket items to an ever-changing population of nonrepeat customers. In that case,  the historical performance of the Seller's receivable portfolio is less likely to be an accurate and consistent estimator of its present and future receivables performance. On the other hand,  when the Seller's business involves a relatively large number of repeat sales to a stable customer base,  historical data can serve as a meaningful estimator of future performance. In balancing these considerations,  Moody's generally places greater weight on data about the more recent performance of a Seller's receivables portfolio.

In addition,  Moody's analyzes the degree of obligor concentration in a Seller's receivables portfolio. If a Seller's receivables portfolio has no significant obligor concentrations (*e.g., * no more than 1% of the receivables attributable to any single obligor and its affiliates),  the risk of obligor defaults can be reasonably assessed on a collective or pooled basis. On the other hand,  if a Seller's portfolio includes significant exposure to any particular obligor,  Moody's views that exposure as an unsecured loan by the Issuer to that obligor. If Moody's rates the obligor,  the rating serves as a measure of the obligor defaulting. If the obligor is not rated by Moody's,  the obligor is considered to have a low noninvestment-grade rating unless substantial evidence indicates that a higher rating level is more appropriate.

In typical Issuer-Seller relationships,  the risk of poor credit performance on the Seller's receivables is primarily addressed through the application of a discount factor or through recourse to the Seller. When a discount factor is used,  the Issuer advances only a fraction of the face amount of the Seller's receivables to the Seller. The discount factor typically is expressed as the greatest of (1) a specified percentage,  such as 5% or 10%,  of the face amount of eligible receivables; (2) a multiple,  such as 3 or 5,  of the average loss-to-liquidation ratio over the immediately preceding three months; or (3) a multiple of the standard obligor concentration limit. In applying a discount factor,  the loss-to-liquidation ratio should be calculated by treating any receivable that ages beyond the point at which it constitutes an eligible receivable for purposes of the liquidity facility as a loss.

33 Static pool data list the collections over time on a static,  liquidating pool of receivables. As to trade receivables,  a static pool is often defined as all the receivables generated in a particular month.

34 A loss-to-liquidation ratio is the ratio of write-offs to collections in a particular period. In the case of a stable,  revolving pool of receivables,  the ratio remains constant as long as write-offs remain constant. However,  if a pool of receivables is not revolving but is liquidating,  the ratio may climb as the total pool balance shrinks,  even if write-offs remain constant at historical levels.
There are two main approaches for applying a discount factor: - *Current Discount:* An increase in the recent loss-to-liquidation ratio causes the adjusted discount factor to be applied solely to new advances by the Issuer. For example,  if the increase in the loss-to-liquidation ratio would increase the discount factor to 6%,  the Issuer would advance 94% against the next delivery of receivables.

- *Retroactive Discount:* An increase in the Seller's loss-to-liquidation ratio causes the adjusted discount factor to be applied to all the Seller's receivables previously purchased or to be purchased by the Issuer. For example,  if an increase in the loss-to-liquidation ratio increased the discount factor to 9%,  on the next purchase of receivables from the Seller the Issuer would advance an amount so that the total of all outstanding advances would be 91% of all purchased or financed receivables If the application of a typical discount factor approach is uneconomical for a Seller,  and if the Seller has sufficient credit strength (*e.g., * a rating at least as high as that of the Issuer),  direct recourse to the Seller may be used as an alternative. However,  if the Seller's rating falls below that of the Issuer,  it may be necessary to switch to a discount factor approach to maintain credit enhancement at the Seller level. In addition,  the use of the recourse approach may significantly weaken the argument that transfers of receivables from the Seller to the Issuer should be viewed as true sales rather than as financings in the event of the Seller's bankruptcy.

Dilution: In addition to outright credit losses due to obligor defaults on a portfolio of receivables,  other events such as disputes,  returns of sold goods,  offsets,  credits,  rebates,  and warranty claims can significantly *dilute* the value of outstanding receivables. As long as a Seller remains solvent,  the Seller should absorb all losses resulting from dilution. However,  if a Seller becomes insolvent,  and losses from *dilution* exceed the amount of the discount factor,  if any,  the Issuer must be able to absorb the dilution losses through either the liquidity facility or the credit enhancement facility.

Disputes: A Seller and one of its obligors might disagree on the amount due and payable on a receivable. Disputes can arise from either a deficiency or defect in the goods sold or the services rendered or from some other breach of the agreement between the Seller and the obligor. Moody's does not view the risk of disputes as necessarily being highly correlated with the credit risk of the related obligor. However,  a significant degree of correlation may exist between the incidence of disputes and the credit condition of the Seller. Such correlation results from the presumption that the Seller's quality controls may deteriorate simultaneously with a deterioration of its financial condition. Accordingly,  historical data provided by a Seller with a stable financial history regarding the incidence of disputes may not permit a meaningful estimation of disputes in the event of a deterioration in the Seller's credit strength. In addition,  it may be appropriate to distinguish and to separately identify a disputed amount from the amount of the receivable subject to the dispute (*e.g., * only $5, 000 of a $20, 000 receivable may be in dispute in the case of an undershipping of goods). Returns: A Seller may permit its customers to return goods that they have been unable to resell. If returns occur with regard to receivables transferred by the Seller to the Issuer,  the receivables cease to exist,  and the Seller should be liable to the Issuer for the amount of such receivables. Returns can be analyzed based on historical data,  provided that the Seller does not change its policy concerning returns and that the obligor base either remains stable or is highly diversified.

Offsets: When a Seller owes money to one of its obligors,  the obligor may remit to the Seller only the excess,  if any,  of the amount payable by the obligor to the Seller over the amount payable by the Seller to the obligor. Offsets can be analyzed,  based on historical data,  to the same extent as returns. If an offset occurs with regard to receivables transferred by the Seller to the Issuer,  the Seller should be liable to the Issuer for the amount of the offset.

35 Arguably,  the first discount factor approach is more consistent with a true sale of the receivables than the second approach because the second closely resembles the type of collateral maintenance [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] typical of loan arrangements.

Credits: A Seller may offer discounts to its obligors for prompt payment or for the purchase of large volumes of goods or services. Credits may operate to reduce the collectible amount of receivables transferred by the Seller to the Issuer. Credits have the same effects and are analyzed in the same manner as returns and offsets.

Rebates: A rebate is generally a credit offered by a Seller for past purchases to induce its obligors to make future purchases. A manufacturing Seller may offer distributors rebates in response to a competitor's introduction of a better or cheaper product - especially in industries where product inventories face the risk of technological obsolescence. If a rebate offer is structured so that the amount of the rebate cannot be applied as an offset against outstanding invoices,  but only toward new purchases,  the rebate should not have an adverse impact on receivables previously sold. However,  a rebate offer not so restricted must be viewed as the equivalent of an ordinary credit by the Seller in favor of its obligor. Warranty Claims: Warranty claims are essentially a type of dispute. However,  special analysis of potential warranty claims may be necessary if the Seller offers obligors express warranties that survive for extended periods. In that case,  sales from previous months or years may result in warranty claims that can dilute the value of more recently generated receivables. Another form of dilution can result when businesses bill customers before the delivery of goods or the performance of services. For example,  an airline may create receivables for credit card sales of "advance purchase" tickets. If the airline goes out of business (or otherwise becomes unable to honor the advance purchase tickets),  it is likely that few,  if any,  of the related customers will ultimately pay for the tickets. The airline's receivables portfolio might suffer severe dilution,  which could not have been accurately predicted from historical data about the portfolio's performance while the business was still operating.

In addition to the types of dilution enumerated above,  receivables payable by the United States government may present special issues. Although the credit strength of the U.S. government is not in question,  its willingness to pay on a particular receivable may be an issue if it has any claims against the Seller that generated the receivable. Federal government claims can result not only from warranties and similar items but also from unpaid taxes,  certain pension-related matters,  and a staggering array of possible civil or criminal fines and penalties. In addition,  the Issuer's rights in any government receivables transferred by the Seller to the Issuer may be limited by the federal Assignment of Contracts Act 36 and the federal Assignment of Claims Act. 37 If federal government claims dilute the value of a receivable transferred by the Seller to the Issuer,  the Issuer generally has a claim for a corresponding amount against the Seller. Therefore,  if a Seller's receivables portfolio includes a substantial amount of United States government receivables,  the Seller's credit strength becomes a more significant factor in Moody's analysis. In many instances,  government receivables are excluded from the definition of eligible receivables under receivables purchase agreements. Notwithstanding the inherent limitations on the use of historical data in estimating future losses on a Seller's trade receivables portfolio,  Moody's initially considers several descriptive ratios in connection with its analysis. Chief among these are the historical turnover rate 38 of the receivables,  an adjusted loss-to-liquidation ratio and the dilution-to-liquidation ratio. 40 From these,  it is possible to make a rough estimate of expected credit losses and the expected losses from

36 41 U.S.C.A. §15 37 41 U.S.C.A. §3727 38 The turnover rate of a receivables portfolio is a measure of how quickly outstanding receivables are paid off. Strictly speaking,  turnover can be expressed either as a rate (i.e. amount of turnover per unit of time) or an interval (i.e.,  the time required for the portfolio to turn over once). For example,  if a Seller had sales of $2, 000 over the previous year and an average receivables portfolio balance of $500 over the same period,  the portfolio would be said to have a turnover rate of four times a year. Alternatively,  the portfolio may be viewed as having a turnover interval of 90 days.

39 See,  note 34. For purposes of the following discussion,  the adjusted loss-to-liquidation ratio is calculated including only write-offs attributable to obligor credit problems and insolvencies,  which permits the separate calculation of the dilution-to-liquidation ratio without inappropriate double-counting.

40 The dilution-to-liquidation ratio is calculated in the same way as the loss-to-liquidation ratio,  except that only losses attributable to dilution items are included. Straight credit losses attributable to obligor credit problems or insolvencies are excluded.
dilution. In particular,  assuming that a receivables pool is stable and revolving,  credit losses may be estimated through the following relationship:
E (Loss) ≈ *WPxLx* BA
TU
where:
E(Loss) = the expected losses attributable to credit defaults in a Seller's receivables portfolio
(during a single write-off interval)
WP = the lesser of the number of days a receivable must have aged either before it is written off under the Seller's normal credit policy or before it would fail to qualify as an eligible receivable under the liquidity facility (the “write-off interval")
L = the adjusted loss-to-liquidation ratio,  calculated without reference to losses attributable to dilution BA = the outstanding balance of the Seller's receivables portfolio TU = the turnover interval for the receivables,  expressed in days.

Similarly,  losses attributable to dilution may be estimated through the following relationship:

$\pi$ ($\pi$).
E (Dil.) ≈ DPxDx BA
TU
where:
E(Dil.) = the expected losses attributable to dilution in a Seller's receivables portfolio (during a single dilution interval)
DP = the interval,  expressed in days,  following each sale of goods or services by the Seller,  during which substantially all (*e.g., * 95%) of losses due to dilution will occur (the "dilution interval")
D = the dilution-to-liquidation ratio BA = the outstanding balance of the Seller's receivables portfolio TU = the turnover interval for the receivables,  expressed in days.

Longer-Term Receivables Moody's analysis of longer-term obligations (term receivables) differs significantly from its analysis of short-term trade receivables. A trade receivable is either collected within a short period or it reveals any problems that reasonably would draw into question its ultimate collectibility. In contrast,  a term receivable may stay current,  and thereby conceal increasing risk,  even though the underlying obligor is suffering a gradual but continuous deterioration in its financial condition.

In the case of term receivables,  the lengthy interval of exposure to the credit risk of the underlying obligors may require either stringent program termination triggers41 or higher levels of credit enhancement than comparable trade receivables. As in the case of trade receivables,  Moody's treats the exposure to an obligor as an unsecured loan by the Issuer to that obligor. However,  if the term receivable is secured by collateral,  such as leased equipment,  the exposure will be treated as a secured loan having the benefit of the collateral In general,  when term receivables are included in an ABCP program,  credit enhancement for the term receivables is provided at the Seller level in an amount that initially would be sufficient to support a high-investment-grade rating in a stand-alone,  long-term transaction involving 41 *See* page 29. 42 For further information on Moody's approach for evaluating pooled corporate obligations in the context of long-term securitization structures see Lucas,  Kirnon and Moses,  *Rating Cash Flow Transactions Backed by Corporate Debt 1995 Update*,  Moody's Structured Finance (April 7,  1995).

Those term receivables. That amount of credit enhancement is often determined based on historical data and reflects judgments made from that data. Naturally,  the actual credit performance of the term receivables may be either better or worse than originally anticipated,  and,  accordingly,  the credit enhancement may be viewed as providing a correspondingly better or worse margin of safety as the performance of the term receivables unfolds. However,  different types of term receivables may have very different expected levels of credit performance volatility (after giving effect to Seller-level credit enhancement). For example,  the credit performance of long-term securities backed by automobile loans and credit-card receivables,  as measured by Moody's ratings,  has,  in general,  been stable. It may be reasonable to expect comparable stability with regard to the credit performance of those asset types in the future. On the other hand,  there have not been enough rated transactions involving other types of term receivables,  such as leases on certain types of equipment,  to formulate a specific expectation about the future volatility of credit performance.

If the performance of a pool of term receivables is worse than expected,  the rating of a hypothetical,  long-term transaction backed by those receivables might be lowered. Similarly,  if the performance of a pool of term receivables included in an ABCP program is worse than expected,  the overall credit quality of the program would be adversely affected. One of the challenges for a Sponsor in including term receivables in an ABCP program is deciding how the program should respond if those receivables deteriorate. Naturally,  if the Issuer finances the Seller's term receivables on a revolving basis,  the Issuer might cease making any further advances against new term receivables from that Seller. However,  that leaves the problem of how to deal with the accumulated inventory of deteriorating term receivables that the Issuer has previously financed. If the Issuer continues to issue ABCP backed by those term receivables,  the credit quality of the whole ABCP program may be imperiled,  and the rating of the Issuer might have to be downgraded. One way for a Sponsor to reduce the risk that the rating of an ABCP Issuer might have to be downgraded because of the deterioration of term receivables is to arrange at the outset for a Liquidity Provider to purchase the term receivables as long as they meet certain eligibility criteria. A proactive Sponsor might then cause the Issuer to sell the term receivables to the Liquidity Provider before any significant deterioration in the receivables has occurred. With such an arrangement,  the Sponsor can reduce the Issuer's exposure to the term receivables if it considers it appropriate. 43 A second approach,  which could be available if the relationship between the Issuer and the Seller of the term receivables is structured as a loan (and if the Seller has a sufficiently strong rating),  is to permit the Issuer to declare the Seller's loan to be in default and to accelerate the maturity of the loan in order to recover advances made against the term receivables. In other cases,  a Sponsor facing the prospect of a downgrade of its ABCP Issuer as a result of the deterioration of term receivables might try to prevent the downgrade by increasing the size of the program's credit enhancement facility. However,  for purposes of the rating analysis,  Moody's does not assume that a Sponsor will necessarily provide additional credit enhancement. Moody's views the ratings of ABCP Issuers that finance novel types of term receivables as being inherently more susceptible to downgrade risk than the ratings of Issuers that finance only trade receivables or the types of term receivables that have previously been included in many securitization transactions.

43 The purchase of the term receivable by the Liquidity Provider should be without recourse to the Issuer and without recourse to the credit enhancement facility. If the Liquidity Provider has continuing access either to the general credit of the Issuer or to the credit enhancement facility to cover future losses on the receivables,  the desired effect of permitting the Issuer to eliminate further exposure to the term receivables is nullified. In that vein,  a liquidity loan by a Liquidity Provider under those circumstances would be ineffectual since the full risk of the term receivables would still be borne by the Issuer.

## Consumer Receivables

Apart from several major ABCP programs established specifically to finance credit card receivables,  ABCP programs generally do not include a significant amount of consumer receivables.

To the extent that an Issuer accepts transfers of consumer receivables,  those receivables are analyzed in the same way as they would be for traditional long-term mortgageand asset-backed securitization structures. Common types of consumer receivables include conventional first-lien residential mortgage loans,  closed-end second-lien mortgage loans,  auto loans,  recreational vehicle loans,  boat loans,  revolving home equity loans,  and revolving credit card accounts. Moody's has developed approaches for analyzing the various common types of consumer receivables. For further information on Moody's approach to analyzing consumer receivables,  please refer to previously published Moody's Special Reports. 44

## Health Care Receivables

Health care receivables arise when a doctor or a hospital provides a patient with health care services. The bill for the services rendered may be payable entirely by the patient,  entirely by some form of insurance,  or partially by the patient and partially by insurance. The insured portion of a health care receivable may be payable by a government program,  such as Medicare,  Medicaid,  or CHAMPUS; a Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance company,  or another private insurance company. Moody's has received a variety of proposals for partially supported ABCP programs intended solely to finance health care receivables constituting the insured portion of medical bills. Health care receivables present several challenging issues: Estimating the Net Collectible Value of a Receivable: If a doctor renders a $2, 500 bill for a certain procedure (and assuming that there is no co-payment due from the patient),  Medicare or Medicaid might be willing to pay only a fraction of that amount based on their system of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Similarly,  a Blue Cross/Blue Shield company or another private insurance company might limit the amount that it would pay to its estimate of the reasonable and customary charge for the procedure in the locality in which the medical service was rendered. The ultimate amount collected on the receivable from the applicable federal or private insurance provider is the *net collectible value* of the receivable. The fraction,  expressed as a percentage,  equal to the net collectible value divided by the face amount of the medical bill is the collection rate of the receivable. In general,  the *collection rate* on receivables paid by Blue Cross/Blue Shield and by other private insurers is higher than the collection rate on receivables paid by the federal programs. When the appropriate time series data are available,  it may be possible to draw meaningful inferences from the historical collection rates achieved by a health care provider for different payor classes (*e.g., * private insurers as one class and federal programs as another). Ideally,  one would be able to derive confidence intervals for future collection rates for each payor class based on historical data. However,  except under ideal theoretical conditions,  the reliability of inferences based on ordinary confidence intervals may be suspect. In addition,  the ever-changing regulatory and political environment imposes additional constraints on the quality of estimates of future collection rates based on historical data. Alternatively,  it may be possible to measure the consistency and reliability of a health care provider's past estimates of the net collectible value of its own receivables. If a health care

44 *See,  e.g.,  Robinson,  Credit-Card-Backed Securities: Understanding the Risks, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (Jan. 1991);
Esaki and Curry,  *Moody's Approach to Rating Residential Mortgage Pass-Throughs, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (Apr. 1990); Cavalier,  Silver,  and Festekjian,  Special Report: *Securities Backed by Loans on Recreational Vehicles, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (Jan. 1990); Forbes and Curry,  Special Report: Moody's Approach to Assessing the Credit Quality of Residential Second-Lien-Backed Securities,  Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (Sep. 1989); *The Credit Risks of Limited Documentation Loans, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (Mar. 1989); Esaki ,  *The Default Risk of Negatively Amortizing ARMs, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (July 1988); Selzer,  *Rating Convertible Adjustable Rate Mortgage Pass-Throughs, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (July 1988); Special Report: *Moody's Approach to Rating U.K. Mortgage-Backed Securities, * Moody's Structured Finance Research & Commentary (June 1988).
A provider can demonstrate that its estimates are consistently accurate,  it may be reasonable to rely on those estimates for valuing the receivables. However,  if such an approach is taken,  there should be strict triggers that will terminate the health care provider's participation in the ABCP
program if the accuracy of its estimates declines. Quality of the Data Available for Analysis: Often,  health care provider accounting practices do not capture the data relevant for a rating analysis,  and it may not be possible to recreate the relevant data after the fact. In particular,  historical data of accounts-receivable aging cannot be relied on for determining monthly cash flow on a portfolio of health care receivables. That is because the difference between 30-day accounts in one month and 60-day accounts in the following month may not reflect the cash collections in the first month for the relevant accounts. Rather,  the difference may reflect the aggregate of collections,  write-offs,  and other adjustments in the first month. Those write-offs and adjustments represent,  in part,  the difference between the original face amount of the medical bills generated and the final net collectible value of those bills. Accordingly,  the data available may not reveal actual historical cash flow and may not permit the determination of historical collection rates. Delays in Collections: Many factors in the claims submission and processing system can cause delays. Clerical errors in the submission of claims to Medicare and Medicaid can cause a claim to be bounced and require its resubmission. Or an insurer may challenge the validity of a claim based on the assertion that there was not a *bona fide* medical necessity for the procedure or test performed. A challenge,  even if ultimately resolved favorably,  may create a significant delay in payment. Another possible source of delays in payment may simply be the temporary unavailability of funds in a state that has exhausted its Medicaid budget before the end of its fiscal year.

Set-Offs Asserted by an Insurer against the Health Care Provider: Medicare and Medicaid have the right to periodically audit the activities of health care providers in order to monitor compliance with applicable regulations. If past violations or discrepancies are uncovered,  each has the right to set off past overpayments against the present claims payable to the offending health care provider. In addition,  other claims against a health care provider in favor of the federal government might be offset against amounts payable under Medicare and Medicaid to that provider. Health care receivables also present further issues,  such as the requirement of direct payment under Medicare to health care providers. A consequence of the direct payment requirement is that Medicare payments paid to a bankrupt Seller might be trapped by the Bankruptcy Code's automatic stay.

## Program Termination Triggers

Beyond the analysis of the credit strength of each Seller and the credit quality of each Seller's portfolio,  Moody's approach to analyzing an ABCP program includes an evaluation of structural safeguards intended to protect the program as a whole from deterioration of credit quality over time. Because the credit enhancement facility in a partially supported ABCP program covers credit losses on receivables up to a limited amount,  it is customary for such programs to include a feature that will cause the program to wind down in an orderly fashion after a specified portion of the total credit enhancement facility has been used. Typically,  the trigger level is set at roughly 20% to 50% of the total amount of the credit enhancement facility. Investors should note that by the time losses on the receivables underlying an ABCP program have reached the applicable trigger level,  the rating of the Issuer may have already been lowered from its original level. If the credit enhancement facility is drawn to or beyond the trigger level,  the Issuer will be prohibited from acquiring interests in new receivables and from issuing any new ABCP. That is,  the Issuer will be required to apply collections on existing receivables toward retiring outstanding ABCP,  and,  to the extent that such collections are not sufficient,  to use the liquidity facility and the credit enhancement facility to do so. A trigger level should be set so that the remaining amount available under the credit enhancement facility after reaching the trigger level is sufficient to provide a high degree of certainty that future losses on the existing receivables will be covered fully. Therefore,  the actual trigger level depends,  in part,  on the nature of the receivables and on the maximum remaining maturity of the outstanding ABCP.

Another common type of program termination trigger is the loss of the Issuer's **Prime-1** rating due to a deterioration in asset quality (not merely as a result of the downgrade of a Liquidity or Credit Enhancement Provider). If a program includes such a termination trigger,  any reduction or withdrawal of Moody's rating on the Issuer will cause the program to wind down. Other program termination triggers are commonly included in ABCP programs. Some of those triggers are intended to protect investors from events that could compromise the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] remoteness of the Issuer; others may address the risk of deteriorating operations or administration.

## Additional Factors Affecting the Rating Analysis

Certain ABCP programs can achieve relatively lower levels of total credit enhancement or liquidity enhancement by placing operating restrictions on the Issuer. For example,  the program documents may limit the Issuer to acquiring interests in receivables only from Sellers that have investment-grade ratings (*i.e., * **Baa3** or higher).

Alternatively,  a program might limit the types of receivables in which the Issuer can acquire interests to money market instruments that are themselves rated **Prime-1**. In that case,  the level of credit enhancement necessary for the Issuer to achieve a **Prime-1** rating would be substantially less than it would be if assets of lower credit quality were included. Indeed,  if such an ABCP program further requires the Issuer to match the maturities of the ABCP issued to the maturities of the **Prime-1** money market instruments acquired,  and if the program requires the Issuer to stagger the maturities of the ABCP issued,  the total level of liquidity enhancement required for the Issuer to achieve a **Prime-1** rating may be substantially less than the 100% typically required for a nonmatch-funded program. The skill and experience of the Sponsor are also important factors in the rating analysis. The Sponsor of an ABCP program should be able to demonstrate that it can (1) reasonably evaluate its customers' (*i.e., * the Seller's) ability and willingness to perform on their obligations and (2) effectively manage the operations of the program. In addition,  the Sponsor should be able to demonstrate that it has the systems and operational capacity to adhere to any timing constraints and clearance and settlement procedures required for the operation of the program.

## Assessing Overall Program Risk

Assessing the overall credit risk of an ABCP program entails combining the evaluations of each Seller and each Seller's receivables. Moody's uses a Monte Carlo simulation technique. The simulation process generally indicates the need for relatively high levels of credit enhancement for ABCP programs that are not well diversified. This reflects Moody's view that a high concentration of risk in any single Seller,  obligor,  or industry can be a negative factor. In other words,  Moody's views diversification of risk across many Sellers,  obligors,  and industries as contributing significantly toward reducing the level of credit enhancement required to achieve a **Prime-1** rating.

For purposes of the simulation process,  the evaluation of a Seller's credit strength is used to assign a probability of the Seller going into bankruptcy. The historical data about the performance of each Seller's receivables portfolio,  together with other information about the lines of business in which the Seller is engaged and about the markets served by the Seller,  is used to establish two sets of descriptive parameters - one relating to expected amount and variability of losses on the Seller's receivables portfolio if the Seller does not become bankrupt,  the other relating to the expected amount and variability of losses on the Seller's receivables portfolio if the Seller goes into bankruptcy. Values describing the expected amount and variability of losses on each Seller's receivables portfolio in both the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and nonbankruptcy scenarios are used in the simulation of an entire ABCP program's portfolio performance. Also included in the simulation are the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] probabilities for each obligor that exceeds any applicable concentration limits,  (each a special concentration obligor).

Each iteration of the simulation process starts by generating a random number in each period for each Seller in the ABCP program. Each random number determines whether the corresponding Seller is considered to have gone into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in that period. Depending on whether the Seller is considered to have gone into bankruptcy,  the appropriate set of parameters is used to determine the amount of losses on the Seller's portfolio in that period. The simulation generates a value for the losses suffered on a particular Seller's receivables portfolio in a given period,  according to the following formula:
Lt = E (L) x e*V(L)xN*
where:
Lt = simulated losses on the Seller's receivables portfolio in period t E(L) = mean value of losses on the Seller's portfolio in each period under the applicable scenario (*i.e., * bankruptcy or nonbankruptcy)
e = the base of natural logarithms (e ≈ 2.718281828)
V(L) = variability factor of losses on the Seller's portfolio in each period under the applicable scenario N = a normally distributed random variable with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (*i.e., * µ = 0 and σ = 1).

The results of a simulation are often highly sensitive to the values assigned to *V(L)* for each Seller. A Sponsor can help to reduce the value assigned to *V(L)* by providing as much historical data as possible about each Seller's receivables portfolio. 45 In addition,  simulated losses for each special concentration obligor are calculated in each period based on the assigned probability of the obligor's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and on the further assumption that losses will be zero if the obligor does not go into [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and will be a specified percentage if the obligor does. The exposure to each special concentration obligor is determined across all Sellers in the program so that if a given obligor is a special concentration obligor of more than one Seller,  the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of that obligor affects all receivables payable by that obligor. In general,  it is assumed that bankruptcies of special concentration obligors are independent of Seller bankruptcies.

If an ABCP program is exposed to high concentrations of risk in one or more specific industries,  the simulation is adjusted to reflect that exposure. In the absence of any such exposures,  the simulation process treats Seller bankruptcies as independent events. When there is a high concentration of Sellers or obligors in a single industry,  it is more reasonable to expect a positive correlation of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] risk across separate Sellers or obligors in that industry.

Each iteration of the simulation then accumulates losses for all Sellers and all special concentration obligors for all periods and determines whether those losses would have been fully covered at various levels of total program credit enhancement. Numerous iterations of the simulation are run,  and a frequency distribution is obtained reflecting the proportion of iterations in which each level of credit enhancement fails to fully cover the total simulated losses. From that frequency distribution,  long-term rating grades can be assigned to the various levels of total program credit enhancement. A **Prime-1** rating for an ABCP Issuer under review is obtained by setting total program credit enhancement at a level roughly corresponding to a high,  investment-grade,  long-term rating.

45 Mathematically inclined readers may observe that the sampling distribution of simulated losses resembles the probability density function of the lognormal distribution,  which is appropriate because losses can never be less than zero,  but there is some probability that they can be *much* larger than expected. The lognormal distribution is a good probability model because it is skewed with a long and skinny right tail.
In certain circumstances,  losses attributable to dilution must be considered separately from true credit-related losses. In such a case,  it may be possible and appropriate to model dilution-related losses in the manner described above. However,  when that is not appropriate or not possible,  one or more alternative techniques are used to address dilution. In addition to the matters of credit risk and dilution risk,  Moody's analyzes the liquidity facility on an overall basis. In most cases,  the total liquidity for an ABCP program is 100% and,  therefore,  the focus of the analysis is on the legal and operational aspects of the liquidity facility. However,  in the rare cases in which an ABCP program employs appropriate operating restrictions,  Moody's also performs a quantitative analysis,  and possibly simulations,  to ascertain the level of liquidity enhancement necessary for an Issuer to achieve a **Prime-1** rating in view of the characteristics of the operating restrictions.

The simulation process described on page 31 may be performed more than once for a given ABCP program. Separate simulations may be performed on hypothetical receivables portfolios that the program might acquire and which reflect the relevant operating restrictions of the program. For example,  if a program includes an operating restriction to the effect that only Sellers with investment-grade ratings are allowed to transfer receivables to the Issuer,  Moody's will perform a simulation on the actual Sellers identified by the Sponsor and on a hypothetical portfolio of Sellers,  each of which has the lowest possible rating consistent with the program restriction. If the actual Sellers have,  on average,  ratings higher than the lowest permitted by the program operating restrictions,  the simulation with the actual Sellers would not reflect the possibility of a permitted reduction in overall portfolio quality.

If an ABCP program displays exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the market value of certain types of underlying assets,  Moody's uses its existing standards for market-value-based transactions for determining the rating classifications that correspond to various levels of overcollateralization. That approach may be most relevant when the underlying assets are long-term investment securities. Even if the credit risk associated with such assets is nil (*e.g., * U.S. Treasury obligations or GNMA pass-through certificates),  it may be necessary to liquidate the assets at a time when market values are depressed in order to obtain funds to pay off maturing ABCP. In general,  the levels of overcollateralization necessary to achieve a rating of **Prime-1** under a market-value analysis tend to be higher than levels achieved by ABCP programs that are not exposed to fluctuations in the market value of underlying assets.

Notwithstanding the extensive use of traditional statistics,  modeling,  and simulation techniques,  and the investigation of legal and structural issues,  the analysis of a partially supported,  multiseller ABCP program necessarily relies also on subjective judgment concerning such aspects as the expertise of the Sponsor's management in running the program. The limitations on inferences that can be drawn from historical data,  the ever-changing legal and regulatory framework,  and the passage of the economy through business cycles require the exercise of judgment in the analysis of transactions as complex as partially supported,  multiseller ABCP programs. Therefore,  the preceding discussion simply highlights the major elements considered by Moody's in the rating process,  and it is necessarily limited to general aspects of existing programs. For most features of most programs,  the rating process emphasizes the issues and relies on the approaches described. However,  any transaction can present special or unique issues that defy quantification and that cannot be addressed through reliance on precedent. In those circumstances,  the analysis can proceed only through the informed judgment of the analyst and the rating committee.

## Variations on the Basic Theme

Although the types of ABCP programs discussed above are the most useful for illustrative purposes,  they are not the only forms of ABCP programs. Two other forms of ABCP programs merit separate discussion: *single-seller ABCP programs* and *unsupported ABCP programs.*

## Single-Seller ABCP Programs

As the term implies,  a *single-seller ABCP program* is one that is created to finance the receivables of a single seller. In a multiseller ABCP program,  the risk of a single seller’s deterioration or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] may be addressed primarily through diversification; a single seller ABCP program must use other means to address the possibility of the seller’s deterioration or bankruptcy. In a single-seller ABCP program,  the issuer’s rights in receivables transferred by the seller can be assured through structural safeguards. Also,  as in the case of a multiseller ABCP program,  the availability of funds under the liquidity facility in a partially supported single-seller ABCP program must not be impaired by the deterioration or [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of the seller. In fact,  only the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of the issuer itself,  or circumstances that call into question the ultimate collectibility of the receivables,  should constitute conditions under which the liquidity facility might not be available.

The risk of the possible substantive consolidation of the Issuer with the Seller must be addressed in a single-seller program. In a multiseller program,  no such issue is likely to be present. However,  in a single-seller program,  the Seller might be actually affiliated with the Issuer and also might perform many of the functions of a Sponsor. Accordingly,  structural safeguards must be employed to eliminate or reduce the risk of substantive consolidation to a level consistent with a **Prime-1** rating. A single-seller ABCP program may also exhibit significantly higher levels of obligor concentration than typical multiseller programs. Unless the obligors are of high credit quality,  the effects of high obligor concentrations may necessitate relatively higher levels of credit enhancement. In a single-seller program,  it is also important to consider the effects of seasonality on the Seller's receivables portfolio and to ensure that the credit enhancement facility is sized appropriately. For example,  a retailer may have its peak sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas and then experience its peak losses a few months later,  when the level of outstanding receivables is at a seasonal low. The significance of seasonality is most pronounced in single-seller programs. In other aspects,  the analysis of a single-seller ABCP program is generally similar to that of a multiseller program. Any new ABCP program intended ultimately to be a diversified multiseller program may go through a phase in which it has only one participating Seller. The appropriate analysis then reverts to the single-seller approach.

## Unsupported Abcp Programs

An *unsupported ABCP program* is one with neither a credit enhancement facility nor a liquidity facility. Under Moody's published standards,  an ABCP Issuer can receive a **Prime-1** rating with neither a credit enhancement facility nor a liquidity facility if (1) the Issuer's assets consist of loans to ten or *fewer* borrowers,  each of which is rated **Prime-1** and (2) the Issuer's liabilities consist of ABCP that is maturity-matched to the loans This rating standard follows from the fundamental meaning of Moody's short-term ratings: a short-term rating is an expression only of the probability of a default,  not an indication of the expected severity of any such default.

Although the default probability corresponding to the **Prime-1** rating classification is extremely small,  it is not zero. When assessing a portfolio of **Prime-1**-rated obligations,  one naturally would perceive an overall reduction in risk as the holdings in the portfolio become increasingly diversified. In other words,  diversification is generally viewed as reducing overall risk by limiting the relative severity of portfolio losses resulting from a single default. However,  as a portfolio

46 Rhodes and Moses,  *Rating [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Programs Backed by Maturity-Matched Loans*,  Moody's Structured Finance Research &
Commentary (July 1991).
becomes increasingly diversified,  there is an increased probability that any one of the various holdings in the portfolio will default.

If the probability of a single **Prime-1**-rated obligation defaulting is p and the number of such obligations contained in a portfolio is n,  and assuming that defaults are statistically independent of each other,  the probability that no defaults will occur in the entire portfolio is (1-p)
n.

Conversely,  the probability that at least one default will occur is 1-(1-p)
n. In addition,  if n is sufficiently large,  the probability of any given number of the portfolio's holdings defaulting may be approximated by the binomial distribution Accordingly,  the probability that any one obligation held in the portfolio will default is approximately np(1-p)
n-1 and the probability that any two holdings in the portfolio will default is approximately 1⁄2n(n-1)p2(1-p)
n-2.

Moody's view of **Prime-1** rated issuers is that p is sufficiently small so that for all values of n less than or equal to ten,  the quantity (1-p)
n is approximately equal to 1-p. That is why an unsupported ABCP program can receive a **Prime-1** rating as long as its holdings consist of the obligations of ten or fewer borrowers,  each of which is rated **Prime-1**.

However,  notwithstanding a **Prime-1** rating,  an unsupported ABCP program may display certain characteristics that may be of concern to investors:
First,  an investor in an unsupported ABCP program is not informed of the identity of the underlying borrowers. In effect,  an unsupported ABCP program is a blind pool of **Prime-1**-rated issuers. Therefore,  an investor has no way of monitoring or controlling its exposure to the underlying borrowers. If an investor is subject to operating restrictions that require it to monitor or limit its maximum exposure to any single company,  an investment in an unsupported ABCP program may be incompatible with the applicable operating restrictions. Suppose a hypothetical investor employs an operating restriction limiting its maximum exposure to any single entity to 5% of its total portfolio. Assume further that XYZ Co. is rated **Prime-1** and that the investor has invested 3% of its portfolio in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] issued by XYZ Co. Next,  assume that XYZ Co. is one of two borrowers that participate in a hypothetical unsupported ABCP program called NAF Funding and that NAF Funding lends equal amounts to each of the two borrowers. If the investor invests 5% of its portfolio in ABCP issued by NAF Funding,  the investor's total exposure to XYZ Co. will be 51⁄2%,  consisting of 3% directly invested in XYZ Co. [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and 21⁄2% through the unsupported ABCP issued by NAF Funding. Therefore,  the investment of 5% in the NAF Funding ABCP will have caused the hypothetical investor to have unknowingly violated its operating restrictions. Second,  is the possibility of "domino effect" defaults occurring as a result of a single borrower defaulting on its obligations. For example,  suppose a hypothetical company is rated **Prime-1**
and borrows through five different unsupported ABCP programs. If the company defaults on its obligations,  each of the five unsupported ABCP programs will also default. The ABCP program defaults will be a virtually inevitable result of a default by the company because none of the ABCP has any credit enhancement facility to protect it from the company's default.

47 If the number of separate holdings in the portfolio is n and the individual probability of a given holding defaulting is p,  the probability that x separate holdings will default,  assuming that n is large,  may be approximated by the following binomial expression:
P [x holdings defaulting] ≈ px (1-p) n *n-x x* ( )
If n is very large,  the Poisson distribution may serve as an appropriate probability model and simplifies calculations. However,  if n is small,  occurrences of defaults arguably should not be viewed as an approximation of Bernoulli trials. In that case,  the technically more correct approach would be to view occurrences of defaults as a process of sampling without replacement and,  accordingly,  the hypergeometric distribution would be the more appropriate probability model.

## Conclusion

ABCP programs provide a valuable and flexible alternative for companies seeking short-term financing. The dominant forms of ABCP programs now in existence are single-seller programs and bank-sponsored,  multiseller programs. Either type of ABCP program can be structured to be either fully or partially supported. However,  regulatory and accounting policies are driving programs increasingly toward the partially supported mode of operation.

Moody's analysis of an ABCP program encompasses the credit risk,  the liquidity risk,  the structural risk,  and other factors. Credit risk is the risk that losses will occur on the assets transferred to the program. Liquidity risk is the risk that collections on the assets will not be received quickly enough to provide funds needed to retire maturing ABCP (assuming that new ABCP cannot be issued to provide funds for that purpose). Structural risk refers to risks associated with the legal structure of the program. The concepts of credit risk and liquidity risk are the central concepts in understanding ABCP,  but they are merely abstractions. In reality,  many of the specific risks that must be analyzed in an ABCP program contain elements of both credit risk and liquidity risk. In order for an issuer of ABCP to receive a **Prime-1** rating,  the risk of default on the ABCP must be extremely small. A fully supported ABCP program uses a single external support facility to provide 100% coverage against credit risk and liquidity risk. The support facility most often takes the form of either (1) a letter of credit or (2) an irrevocable revolving commitment to either purchase assets from the issuer or to make secured loans to the issuer. In either case,  the amounts provided under the support facility are intended to fully insulate investors from the credit risk and liquidity risk of the program's assets. In the event that there are credit losses on the assets,  the support provider is intended to absorb those losses. If collections on the assets are not received quickly enough to enable the issuer to pay off maturing ABCP,  the support provider is intended to provide the necessary funds. The main risk to investors in such a program is that the rating of the support provider may be lowered,  in which case the rating of the issuer of the ABCP might also be lowered. Moody's analysis of a fully supported program is not based on the program's assets but primarily on the financial strength of the support provider. A partially supported ABCP program has a credit enhancement facility that provides only partial coverage against credit losses on the assets in the program. Therefore,  Moody's analysis of a partially supported program focuses on the assets. The goal is to determine that the probability of losses on the assets exceeding the coverage of the credit enhancement facility is so remote as to be consistent with the rating assigned to the issuer. Because the credit enhancement facility provides only partial coverage,  a separate liquidity facility is used to address liquidity risk. In most cases,  the size of the liquidity facility equals either 100% (i.e.,  the total program size) or,  if the credit enhancement facility provides liquidity protection,  as well as credit enhancement,  the difference between 100% and the size of the credit enhancement facility,  expressed as a percentage. If a program employs operating restrictions that serve to address liquidity risk,  the size of the required liquidity facility may be reduced. The rating of a partially supported ABCP program depends on multiple factors,  including (1) the performance of the program's assets,  (2) the rating(s) of the provider(s) of the credit enhancement facility,  (3) the rating(s) of the provider(s) of the liquidity facility,  and (4) the expertise of the program's manager. The largest and most visible ABCP programs are partially supported,  bank-sponsored,  multiseller programs. The levels of the credit enhancement facilities in those programs range typically from 10% to 15%. The sizes of the liquidity facilities vary markedly because some programs employ operating restrictions and large syndicates of liquidity facility providers.

A **Prime-1** rating on an ABCP issuer expresses Moody's opinion that it is highly probable that investors will receive full and timely payment on the ABCP. Moody's plans to continue its present practice of rating nearly all ABCP issuers and of publishing special reports when appropriate. Investors are invited to call Moody's with any questions concerning ABCP.

## Appendix I

Consider a hypothetical Seller called Acme Company that begins business operations on January 2,  1992. Assume that Acme has sales of $100 each month starting in January 1992.

Collections with respect to each month's sales are received according to the following pattern:
Month of sale $20.00 First month following sale 45.00 Second month following sale 15.00 Third month following sale 10.00 Fourth month following sale 5.00 Fifth month following sale 2.50 Sixth month following sale 1.00 TOTAL $98.50 Acme employs a write-off policy that calls for writing off any receivable that has aged beyond 180 days. Therefore,  because Acme collects only $98.50 through the end of the sixth month following each month of sales,  Acme ultimately will write off $1.50 with respect to each month of sales in the sixth following month (*e.g., * in July 1992,  Acme writes off $1.50 for the sales made in January 1992). In July 1992,  Acme starts financing its receivables through an ABCP program. The issuer of the ABCP (the "CP Issuer") advances funds against Acme's receivables subject to a discount equal to the greater of 5% or three times Acme's historical loss-to-liquidation ratio. The upper portion of the table on the following page sets out Acme's sales and collections activities on a month-by-month basis.

As illustrated in the row labeled "Total Outstanding, " from January 1992 through June 1992,  Acme's receivables portfolio increases each month until it reaches a steady-state level of $152.50. At that point,  Acme's monthly collections reach a steady-state level of $98.50 per month. Applying a 5% discount factor,  starting in July 1992,  the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer advances $144.88 to Acme against Acme's receivables portfolio. The [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer permits Acme to retain the $144.88 as long as Acme's outstanding receivables portfolio contains at least $152.50 in receivables.

To consider the case of the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's recovery from a *revolving pool*,  assume that Acme withdraws from the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's program in October 1992 and that the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer has a legal claim against all Acme's future receivables. In that case,  the $98.50 collected in November and in December 1992 will permit the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer to fully recover its outstanding advances of $144.88 in just two months. To consider the case of the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's recovery from a *liquidating pool*,  assume that Acme stays in business through the end of December 1992 and files for liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise ceases its operations on January 2,  1993,  before having made any sales in January 1993. If the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's outstanding advances have remained at $144.88 through the end of December 1992,  the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer will never fully recover that amount from the collections on the receivables over the next six months. The absence of new sales following December 1992 means that the amount collected each month on the outstanding receivables begins to decline sharply. Before January 1993,  monthly collections are at a stable $98.50. But in the six months from January 1993 through June 1993,  the monthly collections are merely $78.50,  $33.50,  $18.50,  $8.50,  $3.50,  and $1.00,  respectively. As illustrated in the last six columns of the table,  the six-month run-off of the final receivables portfolio from January 1993 through June 1993 results in total recoveries of only $143.50. The result is a loss to the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer of $1.38,  which must be covered by the credit enhancement facility of the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's ABCP program.

36 - Asset-Backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]: Understanding The Risks 48 The [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's discounting approach calls for applying a discount equal to the greater of 5% or three times the loss-to-liquidation ratio. The loss to liquidation ratio is approximately 1.52%. The discount used is 5% because 5%>3x1.52%.
Now suppose that following Acme's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] on January 2,  1993,  the level of write-offs on the outstanding receivables doubles,  so that in each month from January 1993 through June 1993,  write-offs increase to $3.00 from $1.50,  and collections are reduced by $1.50 per month (also assume that collections slow down so that at least $3.00 remains outstanding at the end of each month through May 1993). In that event,  the loss suffered by the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer would be $10.38,  consisting of the $1.38 suffered in the previous scenario and an additional loss of $1.50 relating to each of the six months from January 1993 through June 1993 (*i.e., * $1.38+6x$1.50=$10.38). The credit enhancement facility in the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer's ABCP program would have to be able to absorb a loss of $10.38 in order to prevent the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer from defaulting. The effect of doubling write-offs following the Seller's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] is to increase more than sevenfold the total losses suffered by the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] Issuer.
