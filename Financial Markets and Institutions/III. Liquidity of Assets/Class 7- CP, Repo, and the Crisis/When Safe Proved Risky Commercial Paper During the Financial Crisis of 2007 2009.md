Nevertheless,    many large issuers are active in both markets and issue simultaneously in Europe and in the United States. We will focus here on the commercial paper market in the United States,    though most of our analysis also applies to the commercial paper market in Europe.
From the perspective of a commercial paper issuer,    one benefit of commercial From the perspective of a commercial paper issuer,    one benefi t of commercial paper is that the issuer can avoid registration under the Securities Act of 1933,    which is the issuer can avoid registration under the Securities Act of 1933,    which is the set of rules that requires any firm issuing securities to provide a description of rules that requires any firm issuing securities to provide a description of the company's properties and business,    of the security itself,    and of corporate of the company's properties and business,    of the security itself,    and of corporate management,    along with financial statements.

This growth was mostly spurred by the development of asset-backed stantially. This growth was mostly spurred by the development of asset-backed commercial paper,  which was first issued in the 1980 s.

Asset-backed commercial paper is issued by off-balance-sheet conduits of large Asset-backed commercial paper is issued by off-balance-sheet conduits of large financial institutions,  where "off balance sheet" means that the assets and liabilities financial institutions,  where "off balance sheet" means that the assets and liabilities of the conduits are not included on the financial institutions' balance sheets. Of the conduits are not included on the financial institutions' balance sheets.

However,  the assets are under the control of the financial institution in the sense However,  the assets are under the control of the financial institution in the sense that the conduit is a shell company that is managed by the financial institution. That the conduit is a shell company that is managed by the financial institution.

Conduits typically hold diversifi ed portfolios of financial assets. In the 1980 s,  conduits typically hold diversifi ed portfolios of financial assets. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s,  most conduits only invested in short-term and medium-term assets. In the early 1990 s,  most conduits only invested in short-term and medium-term assets such as trade receivables (dues for goods sold) of the sponsoring financial institusuch as trade receivables (dues for goods sold) of the sponsoring financial institutions' clients. During the late 1990 s,  some conduits started investing in long-term tions' clients. During the late 1990 s,  some conduits started investing in long-term assets,  including securitized assets such as mortgage-backed securities. By the early assets,  including securitized assets such as mortgage-backed securities. By the early 2000 s,  most conduits invested in long-term assets,  some of which were originated by 2000. Some conduits invested in long-term assets,  some of which were originated by the financial institutions' own clients and some of which were securitized assets origthe financial institutions' own clients and some of which were securitized assets originated by other financial institutions. As a result of this investment strategy,  conduits were indebted to other financial institutions. As a result of this investment strategy,  conduits developed a maturity mismatch between the long maturity of their assets and the developed a maturity mismatch between the long maturity of their assets and the short maturity of their asset-backed commercial paper. This maturity mismatch short maturity of their asset-backed commercial paper. This maturity mismatch exposed conduits to roll-over risk,  the risk that investors would stop refinancing the exposed conduits to roll-over risk,  the risk that investors would stop refi nancing the asset-backed commercial paper. The roll-over risk made the conduit riskier for the asset-backed commercial paper. The roll-over risk makes the conduit riskier for outside investors because the conduit may go bankrupt if all investors stop refinancing side investors because the conduit may go bankrupt if all investors stop refinancing at the same time,  and the conduit cannot sell off its assets to repay investors. At the same time and the conduit cannot sell off its assets to repay investors.

To protect outside investors against roll-over risk,  the financial institution To protect outside investors against roll-over risk,  the financial institution that manages the conduit typically provides credit guarantees to outside investors. That manages the conduit typically provides credit guarantees to outside investors.

Under these credit guarantees,  the financial institution promises to pay off maturUnder these credit guarantees,  the financial institution promises to pay off maturing asset-backed commercial paper in case the conduit is unable to do so. From an ing asset-backed commercial paper in case the conduit is unable to do so. From an investor's perspective,  the combination of credit guarantees and conduit's assets investor's perspective,  the combination of credit guarantees and conduit's assets substantially reduces the default risk of asset-backed commercial paper (Moody's substantially reduces the default risk of asset-backed commercial paper (Moody's Investors Service,  2003).

Commercial Paper and Financial Crises in Historical Perspective Although the commercial paper market is generally a stable source of Although the commercial paper market is generally a stable source of financing,  periodically there have been large and sudden declines in its size. Financing,  periodically there have been large and sudden declines in its size. The most prominent example is the Penn Central failure (for discussion,  see The most prominent example is the Penn Central failure (for discussion,  see Calomiris,  1994; Calomiris,  Himmelberg,  and Wachtel,  1995). In June 1970,  the Calomiris,  1994; Calomiris,  Himmelberg,  and Wachtel,  1995). In June 1970,  the transportation company Penn Central declared bankruptcy—the largest corpotransportation company Penn Central declared bankruptcy—the largest corporate bankruptcy up to that point—and as a result of its bankruptcy,  defaulted on rate bankruptcy up to that point—and as a result of its commercial paper. Once Penn Central defaulted,  investors lost confidence in its commercial paper. Once Penn Central defaulted,  investors lost confidence in other corporate commercial paper issuers and stopped refinancing maturing commercial paper issuers and stopped refi nancing maturing commercial paper. Within three weeks of Penn Central's bankruptcy,  corporate commercial paper. Within three weeks of Penn Central's bankruptcy,  corporate commercial paper outstanding dropped by more than 9 percent,  from $32 bilcommercial paper outstanding dropped by more than 9 percent,    from $32 billion to $29 billion. The Federal Reserve responded by lending aggressively to lion to $29 billion. The Federal Reserve responded by lending aggressively to banks through the discount window,  which alleviated liquidity constraints and banks through the discount window,  which alleviated liquidity constraints and stabilized the market.

After the Penn Central failure,  and largely as a result of it,  corporate commercial After the Penn Central failure,  and largely as a result of it,  corporate commercial paper issuers started purchasing insurance against market-wide liquidity disruptions paper issuers started purchasing insurance against market-wide liquidity disruptions in the form of backup loan commitments. Within a few years after the crisis,  almost in the form of backup loan commitments. Within a few years after the crisis,  almost all corporate commercial paper issuers held backup loan commitments covering all corporate commercial paper issuers held backup loan commitments covering 100 percent of outstanding commercial paper. The loan commitments were issued 100 percent of outstanding commercial paper. The loan commitments were issued by banks through which the Federal Reserve had administered its lending during the Federal Reserve had administered its lending during the crisis. This arrangement improved the safety of the corporate commercial paper market during the crisis. This arrangement improved the safety of the corporate commercial paper market for two reasons: 1) banks have access to the discount window; and 2) banks market for two reasons: 1) banks have access to the discount window; and 2) banks typically experience deposit inflows during periods of market-wide liquidity disruptypically experience deposit infl ows during periods of market-wide liquidity disruptions (Gatev and Strahan,  2006). However,  the backup loan commitments increase tions (Gatev and Strahan,  2006).

Similar episodes of declines in the size of commercial paper market have Similar episodes of declines in the commercial paper market have occurred since Penn Central. Typically,  a single commercial paper occurred since Penn Central. Typically in such cases,  a single commercial paper issuer experiences a negative shock,  which reduces investors' confidence in other issuer experiences a negative shock which reduces investors' confi dence in other commercial paper issuers. The common element of such episodes is that they commercial paper issuers. The common element of such episodes is that they appear suddenly and lead to large,  usually temporary contractions in the market appear suddenly and lead to large,  usually temporary contractions in the market size. For example,  the failure of the energy company Enron in 2001 raised concerns size. For example,  the failure of the energy company Enron in 2001 raised concerns about the quality of financial reporting and led to a sharp decline in outstanding about the quality of financial reporting and led to a sharp decline in outstanding corporate commercial paper. However,  an important difference between all such corporate commercial paper. However,  an important difference between all such episodes and the financial crisis of 2007–2009 is that the former concerned the episodes and the financial crisis of 2007–2009 is that the former concerned the corporate commercial paper market rather than the financial or the asset-backed commercial paper market rather than the financial or the asset-backed commercial paper market.

Collapse of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market The decline in the asset-backed commercial paper market was triggered by the asset-backed commercial paper market was triggered by the crisis in the subprime mortgage market. Although delinquencies on subprime the crisis in the subprime mortgage market. Although delinquencies on subprime mortgages had been rising through most of 2006,  the financial crisis showed its mortgages had been rising through most of 2006,  the financial crisis showed its first clear signs only in summer 2007. On July 31,  2007,  two Bear Stearns hedge first clear signs only in summer 2007. On July 31,  2007,  two Bear Stearns's hedge funds that had invested in subprime mortgages filed for bankruptcy.

Figures 1,  2,  and 3 also illustrate that the events of August 2007 had little effect on issuers of financial and corporate commercial paper. Those issuers continued rolling over commercial paper at customary rates.

The amount of non-asset-backed commercial paper outstanding remained stable at $980 billion in the year after the crisis.

## Lehman’s Bankruptcy

The second major negative shock in the commercial paper market was the default of Lehman Brothers. In September 2008,  many investors were surprised to learn that the Reserve Primary Fund—one of the largest money market funds with more than $65 billion of assets under management—owned more than
$785 million of Lehman's commercial paper. The founder of the Reserve Primary Fund—Bruce Bent—who had been one of the pioneers of the money market industry— had publicly expressed the view that money market funds should not invest in commercial paper because it was too risky. In line with this view,  until September 2005,  the Reserve Primary Fund stated in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the fund did not invest in commercial paper. This and Exchange Commission that the fund did not invest in commercial paper. This commitment was abandoned in later filings,  from 2006 onwards,  the Reserve commitment was abandoned in later filings and from 2006 onwards,  the Reserve Primary Fund began acquiring significant amounts of commercial paper to boost Primary Fund began acquiring signifi cant amounts of commercial paper to boost its performance (Stecklow and Gullappalli,  2008). Its performance (Stecklow and Gullappalli,  2008).

The revelation of the Reserve Fund's exposure to Lehman's bankruptcy The revelation of the Reserve Fund's exposure to Lehman's bankruptcy triggered an immediate run on the fund. On September 16,  2008,  the Reserve triggered an immediate run on the fund. On September 16,  2008,  the Reserve Primary Fund was forced to pay out $10.8 billion in redemptions and faced about Primary Fund was forced to pay out $10.8 billion in redemptions and faced about $28 billion of further withdrawal requests. The run quickly spread to other money $28 billion of further withdrawal requests. The run quickly spread to other money market funds with commercial paper holdings. Our analysis based on iMoneyNet market funds with commercial paper holdings. Our analysis based on iMoneyNet data shows that,  within a week,  institutional investors reduced their investments in data shows that,  within a week,  institutional investors reduced their investments in money market funds by more than $172 billion. To stop the run on money market funds by more than $172 billion. To stop the run on money market funds,  on September 19,  2008,  the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced funds,  on September 19,  2008,  the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a temporary deposit insurance covering all money market investments. This temporary deposit insurance covering all money market investments. This announcement stopped the run on money market funds,  and redemption requests announcement stopped the run on money market funds,  and redemption requests promptly receded.

Nonetheless,  investors interpreted Lehman's bankruptcy as a signal that Nonetheless,  investors interpreted the Lehman's bankruptcy as a signal that commercial paper,  issued and sponsored by financial institutions,  was far riskier than commercial paper,  issued and sponsored by financial institutions,  was far riskier than investors had previously thought. As Figure 1 indicates,  financial commercial paper investors had previously thought. As Figure 1 indicates,  financial commercial paper outstanding dropped by 29.5 percent,  from $806 billion on September 10,    2008,    to outstanding dropped by 29.5 percent,    from $806 billion on September 10,  2008,  to $568 billion on October 22,    2008. Over the same time period,    asset-backed $568 billion on October 22,  2008. Over the same time period,  asset-backed commercial paper outstanding dropped by 9.8 percent,  from $741 billion to $668 commercial paper outstanding dropped by 9.8 percent,  from $741 billion. Somewhat surprisingly,    however,    issuances of commercial paper doubled,    billion. Somewhat surprisingly,    however,    issuances of commercial paper doubled,    from $62 billion to $123 billion,    as shown in Figure 2. Despite that,    commercial from $62 billion to $123 billion,  as shown in Figure 2. Despite that,  commercial paper outstanding decreased because the average maturity of commercial paper outstanding decreased because the average maturity of commercial paper dropped after Lehman's bankruptcy. Finally,  Figure 3 shows that the spreads on commercial paper dropped after Lehman's bankruptcy. Finally,  Figure 3 shows that the spreads on commercial paper increased,  though the effect for financial commercial paper and commercial paper increased,  though the effect for financial commercial paper and corporate commercial paper was shorter than that for asset-backed commercial corporate commercial paper was shorter than that for asset-backed commercial paper.

Money market funds were a leading force in the decline of the commercial Money market funds were a leading force in the decline of the commercial paper market. Even though money market fund investments were considered safe paper market. Even though money market fund investments were considered safe because of the newly introduced deposit insurance,  money market funds thembecause of the newly introduced deposit insurance,  money market funds themselves decided to reduce their holdings of commercial paper. As shown in selves decided to reduce their holdings of the newly introduced deposit insurance. As shown in Figure 4,  within one month after Lehman's bankruptcy,  commercial paper holdings fell within one month after Lehman's bankruptcy,  commercial paper holdings fell from 24.2 to 16.9 percent of money market funds' assets. To offset the decrease from 24.2 to 16.9 percent of money market funds' assets. To offset the decrease in commercial paper holdings,  money market funds expanded their holdings of in commercial paper holdings,  money market funds expanded their holdings of Treasuries and agency debt from 36.7 to 44.5 percent of asset holdings. This drastic Treasuries and agency debt from 36.7 to 44.5 percent of asset holdings. This drastic change in asset holdings is often described as flight-to-quality—that is,  an episode change in asset holdings is often described as flight-to-quality—that is,  an episode during which risk-averse investors,  such as money market funds,  only want to hold during which risk-averse investors,  such as money market funds,  only want to hold assets of highest quality,  such as government debt. Assets of highest quality,  such as government debt. To the Rescue: Federal Reserve Interventions Both the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market and Lehman's Both the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market and Lehman's bankruptcy triggered immediate responses by policymakers. The responses were triggered by the bankruptcy. The responses were largely motivated by concerns about the effect of the commercial paper market on the effect of the commercial paper market on Figure 4 Money Market Funds' Asset Shares in Total Holdings,  January 2004–December 2008

These interventions seemed successful in improving financing conditions These interventions seemed successful in improving financing conditions for large financial firms. Even though the investment bank Bear Stearns failed in for large financial firms. Even though the investment bank Bear Stearns failed in March 2008,  its failure had little impact on the commercial paper market. By mid-March 2008,  its failure had little impact on the commercial paper market. By mid-2008,  the asset-backed commercial paper market had stabilized,  the asset-backed commercial paper market had stabilized and larger conduits managed to issue asset-backed commercial paper. Also,  financial companies duits managed to issue asset-backed commercial paper. Also,  financial companies and corporations were still able to issue financial and corporate commercial paper. And corporations were still able to issue financial and corporate commercial paper.

The AMLF,  administered by the Federal Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF). The AMLF,  administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,  was supposed to provide loans to commercial banks so that the Reserve Bank of Boston would provide loans to commercial banks so that they could purchase high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money that they could purchase high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market funds.

Also,  the financial commercial paper outstanding came back to its pre-crisis level. Also,  the spreads on all types of commercial paper significantly decreased. By the end of spreads on all types of commercial paper signifi cantly decreased. By the end of 2008,  the total value of commercial paper purchased under the CPFF program 2008,  the total value of commercial paper purchased under the CPFF program equaled $335 billion dollars,    out of which one-third was asset-backed commercial equaled $335 billion dollars,  out of which one-third was asset-backed commercial paper.

The main difference was that it was restricted to loans to money market funds. The main difference was that it was restricted to money market instruments other than asset-backed commercial paper,  such as money market instruments other than asset-backed commercial paper,  such as certifi cates of deposit,  bank notes,  and financial and corporate commercial paper.

We discuss three possible explanations for the collapse of the commercial We discuss three possible explanations for the collapse of the commercial paper market: substitution to other sources of financing,  adverse selection,  and paper market: substitution to other sources of financing,  adverse selection,  and institutional constraints faced by money market funds. These explanations are not institutional constraints faced by money market funds. These explanations are not mutually exclusive,  and we present evidence in favor of each of the explanations. Mutually exclusive,  and we present evidence in favor of each of the explanations. Substitution to Other Sources of Financing One possible reason for the decline in commercial paper is that buyers of One possible reason for the decline in commercial paper is that buyers of commercial paper,  such as money market funds,  learned during the financial crisis commercial paper,  such as money market funds,  learned during the financial crisis that commercial paper was riskier than they initially thought and therefore they that commercial paper was riskier than they initially thought and therefore they revised upwards their expectations about the likelihood of commercial paper's revised upwards their expectations about the likelihood of commercial paper's default. For example,  investors learned that asset-backed commercial paper was default. For example,  investors learned that asset-backed commercial paper was collateralized by assets for which liquidity in the secondary market could suddenly collateralized by assets for which liquidity in the secondary market could suddenly disappear. With Lehman's bankruptcy,  investors in commercial paper learned that it could disappear. With Lehman's bankruptcy,  investors in commercial paper learned that even large financial institutions could collapse overnight,  causing the default of even large financial institutions could collapse overnight,  causing the default of supposedly safe commercial paper. As a result,  investors required a higher return on supposedly safe commercial paper. As a result,  investors required a higher return to compensate them for bearing more risk,  which substantially raised the cost of to compensate them for bearing more risk,  which substantially raised the cost of commercial paper funding.

Also,  before the financial crisis,  most investors believed that commercial paper Also,  before the financial crisis,  most investors believed that commercial paper almost never defaults and therefore had little incentive to invest in information almost never defaults and therefore had little incentive to invest in information gathering about issuers of commercial paper. Such poor information-gathering gathering about issuers of commercial paper. Such poor information-gathering incentives can manifest themselves,  for example,  in taking portfolio positions that incentives can manifest themselves,  for example,  in taking portfolio positions that more closely resemble the market (Kacperczyk,  Sialm,  and Zheng,  2005; Kacpercmore closely resemble the market (Kacperczyk,  Sialm,  and Zheng,  2005; Kacperczyk,  van Nieuwerburgh,  and Veldkamp,  2009). This behavior seemed to have taken zyk,  van Nieuwerburgh,  and Veldkamp,  2009). This behavior seemed to have taken place among money market funds as most of them held commercial paper from 50 place among money market funds as most of them held commercial paper from 50 or more issuers,  in addition to holding other money market instruments. However,  for more issuers,  in addition to holding other money market instruments. However,  during the crisis,  investors decided to invest more resources in informationduring the crisis,  investors decided to invest more resources in informationgathering activities because the value of commercial paper was more sensitive to gathering activities because the value of commercial paper was more sensitive to new information. As a result,  the spread on commercial paper increased to comnew information. As a result,  the spread on commercial paper increased to compensate investors for the increase in costs of information gathering. This effect compensates investors for the increase in costs of information gathering. This effect is likely to be particularly strong in the short run as investors need some time to is likely to be particularly strong in the short run as investors need some time to adjust to the new market environment. Adjust to the new market environment.

As a result of the higher costs of commercial paper,  some issuers of commercial As a result of the higher costs of commercial paper,  some issuers of commercial paper were forced to consider substitution to other sources of financing. In the case paper were forced to consider substitution to other sources of financing. In the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market,  the primary sources of the collapse of the asset-backed commercial paper market,  the primary sources of alternative financing were the sponsoring financial institutions. The sponsors of alternative financing were the sponsoring financial institutions. The sponsoring financial institutions were required to repurchase the assets from conduits ing financial institutions were required to repurchase the assets from conduits in case investors were unwilling to refinance maturing asset-backed commercial paper,  conduits were required to repurchase the assets. Hence,  sponsoring financial institutions used other sources of financing,  paper. Hence,  sponsoring financial institutions used other sources of financing,  such as bank deposits,  certificates of deposits,  or even financial commercial paper,  certifi cates of deposits,  or even financial commercial paper to replace financing from the asset-backed commercial paper market. To replace financing from the asset-backed commercial paper market.

In the period following Lehman's bankruptcy in September 2008,  the situaIn the period following Lehman's bankruptcy in September 2008,  the situation was different. In this episode,  the decline in asset-backed commercial paper was different. In this episode,  the decline in asset-backed commercial paper looked much as it had in the fall of 2007. However,  the impact on financial institutions looked much as it had in the fall of 2007. However,  the impact on financial institutions was stronger because—in addition to the financing requirements from assetwas stronger because—in addition to the financing requirements from assetbacked commercial conduits—financial institutions themselves lost access to the backed commercial conduits—financial institutions themselves lost access to the commercial paper market as a direct funding source. Other short-term funding,  commercial paper market as a direct funding source. Other short-term funding,  such as repurchase agreements,  also became unavailable at that time. Hence,  many such as repurchase agreements also became unavailable at that time. Hence,  many financial institutions faced severe liquidity problems,  which eventually prompted financial institutions faced severe liquidity problems,  which eventually prompted the large-scale interventions by the Federal Reserve.

The effect on corporate commercial paper was less severe. Still,  some issuers The effect on corporate commercial paper was less severe. Still some issuers switched to alternative long-term financing,  mostly as a response to growing uncerswitched to alternative long-term financing,  mostly as a response to growing uncertainty regarding the commercial paper market. For example,  on March 3,  2009,  tainty regarding the commercial paper market. For example,  on March 3,  2009,  Coca Cola announced that it had sold $0.9 billion of five-year and $1.35 billion of Coca Cola announced that it had sold $0.9 billion of five-year and $1.35 billion of ten-year notes to repay its maturing commercial paper. In the process,  it agreed to ten-year notes to repay its maturing commercial paper. In the process,  it agreed to pay 4.875 percent to replace short-term debt with an average yield of 0.41 percent to replace short-term debt with an average yield of 0.41 percent.

This swap amounted to about $48 million in extra annual interest on every $1 bilThis swap amounted to about $48 million in extra annual interest on every $1 billion borrowed and used to replace commercial paper. Similarly,  in February 2009,  Lion borrowed and used to replace commercial paper. Similarly,  in February 2009,  the largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment—WellPoint—sold $1 billion of fivethe largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment—WellPoint—sold $1 billion of fiveyear and ten-year notes at rates as high as 7 percent to repay its commercial paper year and ten-year notes at rates as high as 7 percent to repay its commercial paper with an average yield of about 2 percent. Also,  General Electric Co. Cut its financing with an average yield of about 2 percent. Also,  General Electric Co. Cut its financing arm's commercial paper borrowing by about a third,  to $60 billion,    as part of a plan arm's commercial paper borrowing by about a third,    to $60 billion,  as part of a plan to reduce its overall debt (Keogh,  Detrixhe,  and Coppola,  2009).

Overall,  the substitution to other debt market instruments can explain a fair share of the decline stitution to other debt market instruments can explain a fair share of the decline in commercial paper funding,  but probably not all of it. In commercial paper funding,  but probably not all of it. Adverse Selection **Adverse Selection**
During the financial crisis,  many issuers found themselves unable to issue During the financial crisis,  many issuers found themselves unable to issue any commercial paper at all,  regardless of the interest rate offered. For example,  any commercial paper at all,  regardless of the interest rate offered. For example,  during the decline in asset-backed commercial paper,  Moody's Investor Services during the decline in asset-backed commercial paper,  Moody's Investor Services (2007 b) reported that "programs [conduits] found it difficult or impossible to issue (2007 b) reported that "programs [conduits] found it diffi cult or impossible to issue commercial paper" and that "issuing paper at longer maturities was unavailable." commercial paper" and that "issuing paper at longer maturities was unavailable."
Similarly,  after Lehman's bankruptcy,  the Similarly,  after the Lehman's bankruptcy,  the Wall Street Journal *Wall Street Journal* reported that "the reported that "the
[commercial paper market all but froze" (Mollenkamp,  Whitehouse,  Hilsenrath,  [commercial paper] market all but froze" (Mollenkamp,  Whitehouse,  Hilsenrath,  and Dugan,  2009). And Dugan,  2009).

One possible explanation for the sharp decline in the market size is adverse One possible explanation for the sharp decline in the market size is adverse selection between commercial paper's issuers and investors. Suppose that the selection between commercial paper's issuers and investors is adverse. Suppose that the highest-quality issuers leave the commercial paper market because commercial paper spreads rise. This may happen if such issuers could obtain financing most paper spreads rise. This may happen if such issuers could obtain financing most easily and cheaply elsewhere. As a result,  the average quality of the remaining issueasily and cheaply elsewhere. As a result,  the average quality of the remaining issuers of commercial paper would decrease,  and assuming that investors could not ers of commercial paper would decrease,  and assuming that investors could not tell quality differences between the remaining issuers,  they would further increase tell quality differences between the remaining issuers,  they would further increase their required commercial paper spreads,  which would then prompt even more their required commercial paper spreads,  which would then prompt even more issuers to drop out. If this cycle continued,  it could lead to a complete market freeze issuers to drop out. If this cycle continued,  it could lead to a complete market freeze (Akerlof,  1970). (Akerlof,  1970).

It is surely plausible that adverse selection can explain some of the decline in It is surely plausible that adverse selection can explain some of the commercial paper market; nonetheless,  it is difficult to test for its presence in the commercial paper market; nonetheless,  it is difficult to test for its presence in this context because adverse selection primarily amplifies existing substitution to this context because adverse selection primarily amplifies existing substitution to other sources of financing. Notably,  Covitz,  Liang,  and Suarez (2009) analyze the other sources of financing. Notably,  Covitz,  Liang,  and Suarez (2009) analyze the type of asset-backed commercial paper issuers that were leaving the commercial type of asset-backed commercial paper issuers that were leaving the commercial paper market. They find that in the first weeks of the 2007 crisis,  almost all issuers left the paper market. They find that in the first weeks of the 2007 crisis,  almost all issuers were affected by the difficulties in issuing such paper. Over time,  however,  it was were affected by the diffi culties in issuing such paper. Over time,  however,  it was mostly the weaker conduits (as measured by the strength of the credit guarantees mostly the weaker conduits (as measured by the strength of the credit guarantees provided by their sponsors) that left the market. Assuming that unobservable qualprovided by their sponsors) that left the market. Assuming that unobservable quality measures are positively correlated with observable quality measures,  this finding ity measures are positively correlated with observable quality measures,  this finding would suggest that adverse selection was less important,  especially during the later would suggest that adverse selection was less important,  especially during the later weeks of the crisis in 2007. Weeks of the crisis in 2007.

In comparison,  preliminary results using data on commercial paper outIn comparison,  preliminary results using data on commercial paper outstanding around Lehman's bankruptcy suggest that adverse selection was more standing around Lehman's bankruptcy suggest that adverse selection was more important in 2008. In our own work,  we find that financial institutions with large important in 2008. In our own work,  we find that financial institutions with large drops in their share prices continued to issue commercial paper after Lehman's drops in their share prices continued to issue commercial paper after Lehman's bankruptcy,  while financial institutions with stable share prices reduced or bankruptcy,  while financial institutions with stable share prices reduced or stopped issuing commercial paper after Lehman’s bankruptcy. Assuming that the decline in share prices stopped issuing commercial paper. Assuming that the decline in share prices is a good proxy for a financial institution's unobserved quality,  this finding is a good proxy for a financial institution's unobserved quality,  this finding suggests that adverse selection may have amplifi ed the decline in commercial suggests that adverse selection may have amplifi ed the decline in commercial paper outstanding in 2008.

Over time,  as money market ensure that money market funds invested in safe assts. Over time,  as money market investors searched for higher yields,  money market funds responded by increasinvestors searched for higher yields,  money market funds responded by increasing their holdings of commercial paper because commercial paper offered higher ing their holdings of commercial paper because commercial paper offered higher yields than Treasuries.
