## Lehman’s Bankruptcy

The second major negative shock in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market was the default of Lehman Brothers. In September 2008,  many investors were surprised to learn that the Reserve Primary Fund—one of the largest [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] with more than $65 billion of assets under management—owned more than
$785 million of Lehman's [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. The founder of the Reserve Primary Fund—Bruce Bent—who had been one of the pioneers of the money market industry— had publicly expressed the view that [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] should not invest in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] because it was too risky. In line with this view,  until September 2005,  the Reserve Primary Fund stated in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the fund did not invest in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. This and Exchange Commission that the fund did not invest in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. This commitment was abandoned in later filings,  from 2006 onwards,  the Reserve commitment was abandoned in later filings and from 2006 onwards,  the Reserve Primary Fund began acquiring significant amounts of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] to boost Primary Fund began acquiring signifi cant amounts of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] to boost its performance (Stecklow and Gullappalli,  2008). Its performance (Stecklow and Gullappalli,  2008).

The revelation of the Reserve Fund's exposure to Lehman's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] The revelation of the Reserve Fund's exposure to Lehman's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] triggered an immediate run on the fund.

On September 16,  2008,  the Reserve Primary Fund was forced to pay out $10.8 billion in redemptions and faced about Primary Fund was forced to pay out $10.8 billion in redemptions and faced about $28 billion of further withdrawal requests. The run quickly spread to other money $28 billion of further withdrawal requests. The run quickly spread to other [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] with [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings. Our analysis based on iMoneyNet market funds with [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings. Our analysis based on iMoneyNet data shows that,  within a week,  institutional investors reduced their investments in data shows that,  within a week,  institutional investors reduced their investments in [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] by more than $172 billion. To stop the run on [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] by more than $172 billion. To stop the run on [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  on September 19,  2008,  the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced funds,  on September 19,  2008,  the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced a temporary deposit insurance covering all money market investments. This temporary deposit insurance covering all money market investments. This announcement stopped the run on [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  and redemption requests announcement stopped the run on [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  and redemption requests promptly receded.

Somewhat surprisingly,    however,    issuances of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] doubled,    billion. Somewhat surprisingly,    however,    issuances of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] doubled,    from $62 billion to $123 billion,    as shown in Figure 2. Despite that,    commercial from $62 billion to $123 billion,  as shown in Figure 2. Despite that,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding decreased because the average maturity of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding decreased because the average maturity of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dropped after Lehman's bankruptcy. Finally,  Figure 3 shows that the spreads on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] dropped after Lehman's bankruptcy. Finally,  Figure 3 shows that the spreads on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] increased,  though the effect for financial [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] increased,  though the effect for financial [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and corporate [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was shorter than that for asset-backed commercial corporate [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was shorter than that for asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]].

Money market funds were a leading force in the decline of the commercial Money market funds were a leading force in the decline of the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market. Even though money market fund investments were considered safe paper market.

As shown in Figure 4,  within one month after Lehman's bankruptcy,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings fell within one month after Lehman's bankruptcy,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings fell from 24.2 to 16.9 percent of [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]' assets. To offset the decrease from 24.2 to 16.9 percent of [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]' assets. To offset the decrease in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings,  [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] expanded their holdings of in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] holdings,  [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] expanded their holdings of Treasuries and agency debt from 36.7 to 44.5 percent of asset holdings. This drastic Treasuries and agency debt from 36.7 to 44.5 percent of asset holdings.

We discuss three possible explanations for the collapse of the commercial We discuss three possible explanations for the collapse of the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market: substitution to other sources of financing,  adverse selection,  and paper market: substitution to other sources of financing,  adverse selection,  and institutional constraints faced by [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]. These explanations are not institutional constraints faced by [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]. These explanations are not mutually exclusive,  and we present evidence in favor of each of the explanations. Mutually exclusive,  and we present evidence in favor of each of the explanations. Substitution to Other Sources of Financing One possible reason for the decline in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] is that buyers of One possible reason for the decline in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] is that buyers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  such as [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  learned during the financial crisis [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  such as [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  learned during the financial crisis that [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was riskier than they initially thought and therefore they that [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was riskier than they initially thought and therefore they revised upwards their expectations about the likelihood of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]'s revised upwards their expectations about the likelihood of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]'s default. For example,  investors learned that asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was default. For example,  investors learned that asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was collateralized by assets for which liquidity in the secondary market could suddenly collateralized by assets for which liquidity in the secondary market could suddenly disappear. With Lehman's bankruptcy,  investors in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] learned that it could disappear. With Lehman's bankruptcy,  investors in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] learned that even large financial institutions could collapse overnight,  causing the default of even large financial institutions could collapse overnight,  causing the default of supposedly safe [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. As a result,  investors required a higher return on supposedly safe [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. As a result,  investors required a higher return to compensate them for bearing more risk,  which substantially raised the cost of to compensate them for bearing more risk,  which substantially raised the cost of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] funding.

Also,  before the financial crisis,  most investors believed that [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Also,  before the financial crisis,  most investors believed that [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] almost never defaults and therefore had little incentive to invest in information almost never defaults and therefore had little incentive to invest in information gathering about issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. Such poor information-gathering gathering about issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. Such poor information-gathering incentives can manifest themselves,  for example,  in taking portfolio positions that incentives can manifest themselves,  for example,  in taking portfolio positions that more closely resemble the market (Kacperczyk,  Sialm,  and Zheng,  2005; Kacpercmore closely resemble the market (Kacperczyk,  Sialm,  and Zheng,  2005; Kacperczyk,  van Nieuwerburgh,  and Veldkamp,  2009). This behavior seemed to have taken zyk,  van Nieuwerburgh,  and Veldkamp,  2009).

However,  for more issuers,  in addition to holding other money market instruments. However,  during the crisis,  investors decided to invest more resources in informationduring the crisis,  investors decided to invest more resources in informationgathering activities because the value of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was more sensitive to gathering activities because the value of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was more sensitive to new information. As a result,  the spread on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] increased to comnew information. As a result,  the spread on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] increased to compensate investors for the increase in costs of information gathering. This effect compensates investors for the increase in costs of information gathering. This effect is likely to be particularly strong in the short run as investors need some time to is likely to be particularly strong in the short run as investors need some time to adjust to the new market environment.

As a result of the higher costs of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  some issuers of commercial As a result of the higher costs of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  some issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] were forced to consider substitution to other sources of financing. In the case paper were forced to consider substitution to other sources of financing. In the collapse of the asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market,  the primary sources of the collapse of the asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market,  the primary sources of alternative financing were the sponsoring financial institutions.

In the period following Lehman's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in September 2008,  the situaIn the period following Lehman's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] in September 2008,  the situation was different. In this episode,  the decline in asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] was different. In this episode,  the decline in asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] looked much as it had in the fall of 2007. However,  the impact on financial institutions looked much as it had in the fall of 2007. However,  the impact on financial institutions was stronger because—in addition to the financing requirements from assetwas stronger because—in addition to the financing requirements from assetbacked commercial conduits—financial institutions themselves lost access to the backed commercial conduits—financial institutions themselves lost access to the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market as a direct funding source. Other short-term funding,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market as a direct funding source. Other short-term funding,  such as repurchase agreements,  also became unavailable at that time. Hence,  many such as [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repurchase agreements]] also became unavailable at that time. Hence,  many financial institutions faced severe liquidity problems,  which eventually prompted financial institutions faced severe liquidity problems,  which eventually prompted the large-scale interventions by the Federal Reserve.

During the financial crisis,  many issuers found themselves unable to issue During the financial crisis,  many issuers found themselves unable to issue any [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] at all,  regardless of the interest rate offered. For example,  any [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] at all,  regardless of the interest rate offered. For example,  during the decline in asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  Moody's Investor Services during the decline in asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  Moody's Investor Services (2007 b) reported that "programs [conduits] found it difficult or impossible to issue (2007 b) reported that "programs [conduits] found it diffi cult or impossible to issue [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]" and that "issuing paper at longer maturities was unavailable."

One possible explanation for the sharp decline in the market size is adverse One possible explanation for the sharp decline in the market size is adverse selection between [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]'s issuers and investors. Suppose that the selection between [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]'s issuers and investors is adverse. Suppose that the highest-quality issuers leave the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market because [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] spreads rise. This may happen if such issuers could obtain financing most paper spreads rise. This may happen if such issuers could obtain financing most easily and cheaply elsewhere. As a result,  the average quality of the remaining issueasily and cheaply elsewhere. As a result,  the average quality of the remaining issuers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] would decrease,  and assuming that investors could not ers of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] would decrease,  and assuming that investors could not tell quality differences between the remaining issuers,  they would further increase tell quality differences between the remaining issuers,  they would further increase their required [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] spreads,  which would then prompt even more their required [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] spreads,  which would then prompt even more issuers to drop out. If this cycle continued,  it could lead to a complete market freeze issuers to drop out. If this cycle continued,  it could lead to a complete market freeze (Akerlof,  1970). (Akerlof,  1970).

It is surely plausible that adverse selection can explain some of the decline in It is surely plausible that adverse selection can explain some of the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market; nonetheless,  it is difficult to test for its presence in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market; nonetheless,  it is difficult to test for its presence in this context because adverse selection primarily amplifies existing substitution to this context because adverse selection primarily amplifies existing substitution to other sources of financing.
