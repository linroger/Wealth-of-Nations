# Runs and Interventions in the Time of Covid 19 Evidence From Money Funds

## Abstract

Liquidity restrictions,  like the redemption gates and fees introduced in the 2016 Money Market Fund reform,  are meant to improve stability during runs. However,  we find evidence that they may have inadvertently exacerbated the run on prime funds during the Covid-19 crisis. Severe outflows from prime funds amid frozen short-term funding markets led the Federal Reserve to intervene with the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF). By providing "liquidity of last resort",  the MMLF successfully stopped the run on prime funds and gradually improved conditions in funding markets,  lowering funding costs and resuming the supply of funding to corporations.

## 1 Introduction

In the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis,  financial regulators worldwide introduced a new wave of regulations aimed at promoting financial stability. Various liquidity regulations were designed with the intention to make financial institutions capable of withstanding funding stress without the need for emergency interventions. For example,  the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requires banks to hold enough liquidity to withstand a 30-day run without the need for emergency liquidity support. For [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] (MMFs),  the SEC introduced two reforms,  one in 2010 and one in 2016,  to reduce run risks. The 2010 SEC reform required MMFs to hold at least 30 percent of assets in securities that could convert into cash within a week (called weekly liquid assets,  or WLA). In addition,  another SEC reform enacted in 2016 allowed MMFs to impose redemptions gates and liquidity fees in the event that WLA drops below 30 percent of assets. In the same spirit of the LCR,  the MMF reform was meant to endow MMFs with tools to deal with runs on their own,  without the need for external emergency interventions.

These liquidity regulations require institutions to hold large liquidity buffers with the expectations that these buffers,  while possibly hindering maturity transformation in good times,  would enhance stability during a run. However,  the possibility that a MMF may impose redemption gates and fees when liquidity falls below the minimum requirement could incentivize investors to run on the less liquid funds before such gates and fees are potentially imposed. This is what Cipriani et al. (2014) refer to as a preemptive run in their theoretical model.

In this paper,  we show that the possibility that a MMF could impose redemption gates and liquidity fees may have exacerbated runs on prime MMFs (especially the less liquid ones) during the Covid-19 crisis of March 2020. We study the anatomy of the run on prime MMFs and assess the efficacy of the main emergency intervention targeted at stabilizing short-term funding markets and MMFs.

In mid-February,  with increasing Covid-19 cases in the U.S. and Europe,  stock prices started to plunge,  accompanied by widening yield spreads on [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] (panel (a) in Figure 1). By mid-March,  spreads on various short-term funding securities,  including [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs),  had surged to the levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis (panel (b) in Figure 1). Amid the broad risk-off sentiment,  investors started to run on prime MMFs,  which are significantly invested in [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and negotiable CDs. Within two weeks from March 9,  $96 billion of investments (about 30% of assets under management) were withdrawn from institutional prime MMFs.

The run on prime MMFs was especially concentrated among institutional investors
(panel (a) in Figure 2) who,  particularly concerned about the potential imposition of gates and fees,  ran more intensely on funds with lower liquidity levels (panel (b) in Figure 2). Worried about investors' panicking and accelerating redemptions,  prime MMFs started to hoard liquidity and refrained from investing in instruments with maturities greater than one week. This liquidity crunch accelerated the deterioration of conditions in funding markets like [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs. Issuance of [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs with maturities longer than one week mostly stopped.

Facing this downward liquidity spiral in money markets,  an intervention to restore stability was deemed necessary. The Federal Reserve announced in the late evening of March 18 the plan to implement the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) to support the liquidity and functioning of money markets. Under the MMLF,  banks could purchase high-quality [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs from MMFs and pledge those assets at the MMLF in exchange for a cash loan for the whole life of the security With the help of the MMLF,  MMFs were able to liquidate some of their longer-tenor assets to meet redemptions. As a result,  funding conditions in the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD markets greatly improved. As of April 7,  the outstanding amount of MMLF usage totaled $53.2 billion.

We start our empirical analysis by comparing this crisis to the previous two prominent MMF runs,  namely,  the financial crisis run around the September 2008 Lehman

1Intuitively,  this is similar to banks selling the assets that they bought from MMFs to the Fed.
bankruptcy and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis run in the summer of 2011. The Covid-19 run and the 2008 one are especially similar in terms of timing and intensity,  with institutional prime funds losing more than 30% of assets in about 20 days (Figure 3). However,  a key difference between the 2020 run and the two earlier ones is that,  starting in 2016,  the SEC allowed institutional prime funds to impose gates and fees whenever their WLAs fall below 30% of assets. The possibility of imposing these restrictions may have incentivized investors to preemptively run on less liquid funds in 2020.

We find that investors ran substantially more from funds with lower liquid holdings
(i.e.,  WLA) during the 2020 crisis relative to any of the previous two crises. Specifically,  while a decrease of 10 percentage points of WLA is associated with an increase in daily outflows by 0.1 percentage points during the 2008 crisis,  it is associated with 1 percentage point additional daily outflows during the 2020 crisis (ten times the 2008 effect). Furthermore,  funds with WLA close to the 30% threshold suffered incrementally more outflows in 2020 but not in the previous two crises. The nonlinearity of runs as WLA approaches 30 during the 2020 crisis suggests an acceleration of runs when investors are concerned about potential imposition of fees and gates. Taken together,  these findings suggest that the inclusion of redemption gates and fees in the 2016 MMF reform might have inadvertently exacerbated the run on institutional prime MMFs during the Covid-19 crisis We design various tests to study the effectiveness of the MMLF. We define the two weeks before its March 23 implementation as the crisis period and the two weeks after as the post-MMLF period. First,  we document a significant calming effect of the MMLF
on prime MMF runs. In particular,  institutional prime funds' daily flows are up by 2.2 percentage points in the post-MMLF period. Moreover,  funds with lower WLA experience stronger rebound in their assets under management (AUM) after the launch of MMLF,  suggesting that the MMLF is especially beneficial to funds with lower WLA. To test the

2The 2016 SEC reform also required institutional prime funds to transact at a floating net asset value
(NAV). However,  we do not find evidence that lower floating NAVs drive additional outflows during the Covid-19 crisis (see Appendix Table A). While funds' floating NAVs saw some declines during the crisis,  they were never near the "breaking the buck" threshold.
potential channel of the MMLF effect on fund flows,  we use the CUSIP-level holding data of MMFs and calculate the share of assets that are MMLF-eligible at the end of February 2020. Our test results show that MMFs with more MMLF-eligible holdings have a larger rebound in their flows in the post-MMLF period,  mostly driven by their holdings of eligible CDs.

Second,  we study the spillover effect of the MMLF to similar but MMLF-ineligible market participants,  namely,  offshore USD prime MMFs,  who invest in exactly the same pool of assets as their domestic counterparts and cater to international investors. Assets in these funds dropped by about 25% during the crisis time,  and our test results show that the MMLF had a calming effect on these offshore funds as well,  although the magnitude of such effects is smaller (less than half) and the reaction time is longer (only in the second week).

Third,  we provide evidence that the MMLF greatly eased the tension in [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD
markets. We develop various identification strategies to show that the calming effects are attributable to the MMLF. Specifically,  we show that tighter spreads and greater issuance come from the specific instruments that are more heavily held by prime MMFs. In addition,  the improvements are concentrated among top rated instruments,  as lower rated ones are not MMLF-eligible. Moreover,  given the pricing terms of the MMLF,  only securities with a yield greater than 125 basis points (bps) are economical to pledge. We confirm in our tests that our results indeed come from those securities with yields greater than 125 bps.

Our paper lies at the intersection of several literatures. Some papers document the run on money funds in 2008,  the role of sponsor support,  franchise value,  and informed institutional investors (McCabe,  2010; Kacperczyk and Schnabl,  2013; Schmidt,  Timmermann and Wermers,  2016),  and how money funds depleted liquidity to accommodate redemptions (Strahan and Tanyeri,  2015). The effects of the run on prime funds in 2011 are instead documented by Chernenko and Sunderam (2014) and Ivashina,  Scharfstein and Stein (2015). Relatedly,  Covitz,  Liang and Suarez (2013); P´erignon,  Thesmar and Vuillemey (2017); Gorton and Metrick (2012); Copeland,  Martin and Walker (2014) document the funding freeze in asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (ABCP),  CDs,  and [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repurchase agreements]] in 2008. Others study the effectiveness of Federal Reserve emergency lending during the 2007-09 crisis (Armantier et al.,  2015; Acharya et al.,  2017; Carlson and Macchiavelli,  2020) and,  in particular,  Duygan-Bump et al. (2013) study the effects of the Asset-Backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility
(AMLF) on stemming the run on money funds and normalizing ABCP yield spreads. Echoing Duygan-Bump et al. (2013),  we show the effectiveness of the MMLF in stabilizing money fund flows and bringing down yield spreads. In addition,  we show that the market improvement is not only in lowering spreads but also in restoring issuance,  and that such improvements occurred specifically for the instruments more heavily held by prime funds. Moreover,  we contribute to the MMF run literature by identifying a new run pattern driven by investors' increased sensitivity to lower WLA,  which suggests that the potential imposition of gates and fees can be especially destabilizing during a crisis.

We also contribute to the literature that studies the effects of the 2016 SEC reform on MMFs. Cipriani and La Spada (forthcoming); Baghai,  Giannetti and J¨ager (2018) study the effects of the reform on the premium paid by investors to maintain moneyness and on the risk-taking of the surviving prime funds. In a theoretical framework,  Cipriani et al. (2014) discuss the possibility that the introduction of gates and fees may trigger preemptive runs. To the best of our knowledge,  our paper is the first empirical study that documents the impact of the 2016 reform on prime MMF flows during a crisis.

## 2 Background

In this section we introduce the money fund industry,  as well as the purpose and effects of the two SEC reforms of 2010 and 2016. We then describe the MMLF which was introduced by the Federal Reserve to stabilize conditions in money markets at the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.

## 5 2.1 [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|Money Market Funds]]

Money market funds raise cash from both retail and institutional investors by issuing shares that can be redeemed on demand. Money fund managers then invest the pool of cash in a set of eligible assets. Since investors can withdraw on demand,  MMFs typically hold a diversified portfolio composed of short-term high-quality debt instruments. There are three broad MMF types: government funds invest in government debt (Treasury and agency debt) and [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repos]] backed by government debt; prime funds mainly invest in shortterm high-quality corporate debt,  including time deposits,  CP,  and CDs,  as well as [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repos]] backed by corporate collateral; finally,  tax-exempt funds invest in municipal and state debt. Altogether,  the money fund industry manages around $5 trillion in assets For a fund to be considered a money market fund,  it has to follow SEC 2a-7 rules.

Against the backdrop of the 2007-09 financial crisis,  which saw a prime fund "breaking the buck" due to its exposure to Lehman and a subsequent run on prime funds (McCabe,  2010; Kacperczyk and Schnabl,  2013),  the SEC introduced two reforms. The first reform,  implemented in 2010,  required MMFs to hold a minimum amount of liquidity,  limited the maturity of their portfolios,  and enhanced the public disclosure of their holdings. The change that is most relevant for our paper consists of requiring MMFs to hold at least 30% of assets in weekly liquid assets (WLA),  namely cash,  Treasuries,  certain agency notes that mature within 60 days,  and assets that convert into cash (mature) within one week The second reform,  announced in 2014 and implemented in October 2016,  primarily aims at making institutional funds less prone to runs. It introduces two main changes affecting non-government (prime and tax-exempt) funds. First,  it requires non-government funds catering to institutional investors to transact at a floating net asset value (NAV),  which means that investors withdrawing their money may not receive $1 per share,  as under stable NAV (where assets are valued at amortized cost). Instead,  they would redeem shares based on the market value of the fund portfolio.

4Prior to the 2010 MMF reform,  there were not minimum liquidity requirement for money funds. The 2010 reform changed that,  mandating that a minimum percentage of assets be highly liquid securities.

Specifically,  the SEC required that all prime MMFs must have at least 10 percent of assets in cash,  U.S.

Treasury securities,  or securities that convert into cash within one day (the "daily liquidity" requirement),
and at least 30 percent of such assets in weekly liquid assets. The reforms also shortened the average maturity limits for MMFs. Specifically,  the SEC restricted the maximum "weighted average life" (WAL)
maturity of a fund's portfolio from unlimited to 120 days,  and reduced the maximum weighted average maturity (WAM) of a fund's portfolio from 90 days to 60 days.

Secondly,  the reform allows non-government funds to impose redemption gates and liquidity fees if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below a regulatory minimum. WLA is defined as under the 2010 MMF reform: securities that convert into cash (mature) within one week,  including Treasuries,  and certain agency notes that mature in 60 days or less.

If WLA falls below 30%,  the fund can impose liquidity fees (up to 2%) and suspend redemptions for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.

Institutional investors in prime MMFs treat their money fund shares as cash,  and many of them did not like the idea of potentially being unable to access their cash due to the imposition of gates,  or redeeming at less than $1 per share due to liquidity fees and floating NAV. Therefore,   many institutional investors in prime funds decided to move their money from prime funds to government funds as a result of the 2016 reform,   and about $1 trillion moved from prime to government funds over the one year leading up to the reform implementation. Over time,  however,  some investors returned to prime funds,  possibly enticed by the relatively higher returns. From the low of the post-reform period,  when prime funds managed $500 billion,   they saw steady inflows until they managed about $ 1.1 trillion right before the Covid-19 crisis.

## 2.2 The Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (Mmlf)

As the severity of the pandemic started to be priced in short term funding markets in early March,  investors began to redeem cash from prime MMFs. The latter were faced with the arduous task to accommodate outflows while maintaining sizable liquidity buffers. They tried to achieve this by selling longer-term [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs to dealers,  but to no avail. The secondary market for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs was frozen. As a result,  many prime funds saw their WLA decline,  some close to the 30% minimum requirement. In order to preserve liquidity,  prime funds stopped lending at tenors greater than one week,  essentially transmitting illiquidity to [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD borrowers,  in a downward liquidity spiral.

To improve the liquidity and functioning of short-term funding markets and stabilize the MMF industry,  the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF) on March 18. The MMLF was created under the authority granted by Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act,  which allows the Federal Reserve to lend to any market participant with broad-based eligibility in case of
"unusual and exigent circumstances". Operated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,  the facility provided nonrecourse loans to banks for them to purchase certain high-quality assets from MMFs. The banks would then pledge the assets as collateral for the loan. The MMLF began operations on March 23.

Initially,  MMLF-eligible assets included [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] as well as government securities (Treasury and agency debt). The list of eligible assets was then expanded in two occasions. On March 20 to include short-term municipal debt and on March 23 to include CDs and variable rate demand notes. The latter are variable rate notes issued by municipalities. The MMLF loans are priced at a fixed spread over the Primary Credit Rate (PCR,  or discount rate),  depending on the type of the collateral. For example,  loans secured by [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs are priced at PCR plus 100 bps,  while Treasury and agency debt at PCR plus zero bps.

It is worth noting that,  economically,  pledging assets to the MMLF is similar to selling the assets to the Federal Reserve. The principal amount of the MMLF loan is equal to the value of the collateral. The MMLF loan is made without recourse to the borrowers and has the same maturity date as the collateral. In addition,  on March 19,  2020,  U.S. regulators issued a rule that effectively neutralizes the effect of asset purchases under the MMLF on banks capital ratios.

Due to the large potential demand for MMLF liquidity,  banks quickly set up operations to purchase assets from prime funds to pledge at the MMLF as soon as the facility was announced on March 18. Starting its operations on March 23,  public H0.\1 data shows that MMLF loans outstanding spiked to $30.6 billion on March 25 in just two days,   climbed to $52.7 billion on April 1,  and reached $53.2 billion on April 7. As the runs on prime funds subsided,   so did usage at the facility. Indeed,   as fewer new loans were originated while some were already maturing,   MMLF loans outstanding started to decline,   with $50.7 billion outstanding on April 15 and $48.8 billion on April 22.

# 3. Data

Our main data set is compiled from three sources. First,  we obtain share-class level MMF information from iMoneyNet,  at daily,  weekly,  and monthly frequencies. Daily. And weekly data are available for both domestic MMFs (i.e.,  2 a-7 funds defined by the SEC) and offshore USD MMFs,  and include the following fund characteristics: assets under management (AUMs),  weekly liquid assets (WLA),  weighted average maturity (WAM),  expense ratios,  investor type (institutional or retail),  as well as funds² portfolio composition,  including shares of the portfolio invested in Treasuries,  agency debt,  repos,  time deposits,  unsecured CP,  ABCP,  CDs,  and floating rate notes. Since one fund can have many share classes catering to the needs of various types of investors,  we aggregate the share-class level data to the fund level,  uniquely identified by the fund’s SEC filing ID.

We obtain MMFs' security-level holdings data from their SEC N-MFP filings. Each 2 a-7 MMF is required to report its portfolio holdings as of every month-end in the NMFP Form. For each security in their portfolios,  MMFs report its CUSIP,  asset type,  amortized cost,  market value,  yield,  and maturity among other characteristics. We merge the iMoneyNet data and N-MFP data based on the funds' SEC filing IDs.

Finally,  we use confidential [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD micro level data from Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The DTCC data includes both transaction level data for each trade in [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs,  and daily data that provide total par amount outstanding for each instrument. The transaction data provide detailed information for each primary market trade,  including CUSIP,  transaction date and maturity date,  yield,  and quantity For CP,  the data also include ratings assigned by both Moody's and S&P. For some tests,  we merge the DTCC data with the N-MFP security-level holding data based on the securities' CUSIP information

# 4 Runs on prime MMFs: what is new this time?

From late February to early March,  as equity and bond markets went into a tailspin (Figure 1),  stress in short-term funding markets also mounted and prime MMFs saw large redemptions from their institutional investors in mid-March (Figure 2)-Prime MMFs have two ways to raise cash to meet investors redemptions. The first option is to tap into their liquid assets that are readily convertible into cash and the second option is to sell longer-term holdings,  like [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs. According to the 2016 SEC reform,  institutional prime funds can apply liquidity fees and redemption gates when their WLA fall below $30\%$ of their total assets. Therefore,  investors could get anxious and run preemptively when funds’ WLA approaches that threshold. As investors started to withdraw from prime funds,  eroding their liquidity buffers,  fund managers would try to sell their longer-term [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs in an attempt to raise liquidity. However,  [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD dealers,  who act as intermediaries and often do not take one-sided bets,  had difficulty in finding third parties interested in buying those securities. 5 A fight to liquidity emerged and the secondary markets for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs were essentially frozen. The frozen short-term funding markets in turn triggered even larger redemptions from investors

## 4.1 Empirical design and Summary Statistics

To gauge the magnitude of MMF runs during the Covid-19 crisis and to explore whether the 2016 MMF reform changed the nature of runs on money funds,  in this section we compare the Covid-19 MMF run with the previous two prominent MMF runs: the financial crisis run of September 2008 and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis run in the summer of 2011. A crucial difference between the Covid-19 crisis and the previous ones in 2008 and 2011 is that institutional prime MMF investors were not subject to contingent liquidity restrictions (gates and fees）in either 2008 or 2011.

We are interested in answering the following questions: First,  did the liquidity restrictions (gates and fees) introduced by the 2016 SEC reform prevent runs from happening or at least alleviate the their severity? Second,  did investors’ concerns about the potential imposition of gates and fees exacerbate the run on less liquid prime MMFs?

While the exact triggers of the three runs on prime MMFs differ somewhat,  they share some common features. They all start with increasing concerns about credit quality and liquidity of the underlying assets that prime funds invest in,  and quickly spiral into runs on liquidity. It should be noted that illiquidity can spread easily from one short-term funding market to another as their common lenders scramble for liquidity. Investors could run on a MMF for liquidity reasons even though the MMF has extremely low exposures to credit risk.

We focus on institutional prime funds for the tests on MMF runs. 6 As shown in Figure 3,  the 2008 and 2020 runs are remarkably similar in their outfow patterns and magnitudes. They both spanned a period of about 20 days,  over which they both saw outflows of more than $30\%$ of AUMs. On the other hand,  the 2011 run on prime funds amid the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis was milder but lasted longer,  resulting in a $17\%$ decline in AUMs over a 50 day horizon.

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the three MMF runs,  with the month before crisis defined as the “normal" period. It shows that fund size is comparable across the three crises,  all about $\$9$ billion for an average institutional prime MMF. During the “normal” periods before large redemptions begin,   funds on average experience little fluctuations in their AUMs. However,   during crisis periods,   funds experience significant daily redemptions of 1.3%,   0.3%,   and $2.4\%$ of their assets for 2008,  2011,  and 2020 runs respectively

Compared to 2008,  prime funds hold substantially more weekly liquid assets (WLAs) in 2011 and 2020. More interestingly,  only $3\%$ of institutional prime funds have thein WLAs below $35\%$ in 2020 during the normal period,  while $72\%$ (44 $\%$ ) of such funds have WLAs lower than $35\%$ in 2008 (2011). These findings suggest that institutional prime MMFs are extremely careful in managing their liquid asset holdings in the post-2016 reform era.

## 4.2 Regression Results

To assess whether the presence of contingent liquidity restrictions changed the nature of investor runs on prime funds,  we run a set of regressions that compare the fow sensitivity to WLA during the 2020 run to that of the 2008 and 2011 runs. Specifically,  we use daily and weekly MMF data from iMoneyNet and estimate the following regressions for the three subsamples:7

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i,   t}&=\beta_{1}Crisis_{t}+\beta_{2}WLA_{i,   t-1}+\beta_{3}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i,   t-1}\\&(+\beta_{4}1(WLA<35)+\beta_{5}Crisis_{t}\times1(WLA<35))+\varepsilon_{i,   t},   \end{aligned}$$

where $Flow_{i,   t}$ is the daily percentage change in the AUM of fund $i$ ,  winsorized at the $1\%$ and 99% levels. 8 $WLA_{i,   t-1}$ (in percent) is the share of weekly liquid assets to total assets of fund $i$ on the previous Tuesday,  ? And 1 $(WLA<35)$ equals one if $WLA_{i,   t-1}$ is below 35%. Crisis: equals one during each of the crisis periods: September 10-30 in 2008,  June 10-August 1 in 2011 and March 624 in 2020

The coefficients of interest are the one on the interaction term between $Crisis_{t}$ and $WLA_{i,   t-1}$ ,  which measures the additional sensitivity of flows to WLA during the crisis,  as well as the one on the interaction term between $Crisis_{t}$ and 1 $(WLA<35)$ ,  which measures the additional daily outflows during the crisis when WLA falls below 35. For all specifications,  standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level

Table 2 reports regression results,  with Columns (1)-(3),  (4)-(6),  and (7)-(9) displaying results for the 2008,  2011,  and 2020 runs,  respectively. Comparing the results in Column (1),  (4),  and (7),  we find that lower WLA during normal times is actually weakly associated with more inflows (although only significant for the 2011 sample),  probably because lower WLA is sometimes associated with higher fund yields that attract investors

However,  during crisis times the relation is reversed and lower liquidity leads to more outflows. The magnitude of such effect differs drastically across different crises. While in 2008 and 2011 institutional investors run only slightly more on funds with lower WLA,  in 2020 they run substantially more on funds with lower WLA. In particular,  a decrease of 10 percentage points of WLA is associated with an increase in daily outflows by 0.1 percentage points during the 2008 crisis and by 1 percentage point during the 2020 crisis (ten times the 2008 effect),  both significant at the $5\%$ level. Considering that institutiona prime MMFs experienced on average daily outflows of about $2.4\%$ during the 2020 crisis a one standard deviation decline in WLA (equal to $8\%$ in 2020) explains $27\%$ of the average daily outflow.

Columns (2),  (5) and (8) examine whether funds suffer more intense runs when thein WLA falls below $35\%$ during the crisis. While the coefficient on the interaction between $Crisis_{t}$ and 1 $1(WLA<35)$ is only mildly negative and not significant for the 2008 and 2011 samples,  it is strongly negative and significant at the $5\%$ level for the 2020 sample In particular,  a fund with below-35 WLA on average suffers an additional $1.4\%$ daily outflows during the 2020 run.

Columns (3),  (6),  and (9) test for the nonlinearity of runs when WLA approaches $30\%$ ,  the threshold that could trigger fees and gates after the 2016 SEC reform. While there is no significant result for the 2008 and 2011 sample,  Column (9) shows that even after controlling for the linear effect of WLA,  investors tend to run disproportionately more on funds with close-to-30 WLA during the crisis,  suggesting an acceleration of runs when investors are concerned about potential fees and gates imposed by the MMFs.

In unreported tests,  we also control for a battery of lagged fund characteristics and asset holdings,  including MMFs' weighted average maturity,  gross yields,  charged expense ratios (i.e.,  management fees),  age,  whether associated with a bank,  share of ABCP in their portfolios,  and share of foreign CDs in their portfolios,  and our results remain robust and similar.

Table 3 combines the three subsamples together to assess the difference in fow sensitivity to WLA across crises and how significant such difference is. In particular,  we estimate the following regressions:

$$Flow_{i,   t}=\beta_{1}Crisis_{t}+\beta_{2}Crisis_{t}\times Year_{t}+\beta_{3}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i,   t-1}\\+\beta_{4}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i,   t-1}\times Year_{t}+controls_{i,   t-1}+FE_{i,   t}+\varepsilon_{i,   t},   $$

where controls include various fund characteristics and asset holdings,  and year fixec effects are included in all specifications. In some specifications we use the dummy $1(WLA<35]$）instead of $WLA$ .The baseline Crisis dummy refers to the 2020 run,  and the interactions with $Year=2008$ or $Year=2011$ estimate the additional effects of the 2008 and 2011 runs relative to the most recent one.

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 show that the difference in average outflows between the 2008 and the 2020 crisis is insignificant,  while the 2011 MMF run is significantly milder. Columns (3)-(5) show that the fow sensitivity to WLA is significantly weaker in either 2008 or 2011 relative to the 2020 baseline sensitivity (in Column (5) we alsc control for fund fixed effects). Similarly,  Columns (6)-(8) show that below-35 WLA triggers significantly larger outflows during the 2020 crisis relative to the 2008 or 2011 ones.

Combined,  Table 2 and Table 3 show that institutional investors run substantially more on funds with lower WLA during the 2020 crisis. In addition,  not only lower liquidity levels drive heavier redemptions,  but WLA very close to the regulatory threshold can also trigger a disproportionate acceleration in runs. These findings are consistent with the conjecture that in the fear of imposed fees and gates,  institutional investors run more heavily on funds with WLA approaching the triggering point (preemptive runs)

It is worth noting that the 2016 MMF reform not only allows institutional prime funds to impose gates and fees when their WLA falls below $30\%$ ,  but it also requires them to transact at a foating NAV,  meaning that buying and selling shares must take into account the market value of the fund's assets. We also explore whether foating NAVs could be destabilizing,  and do not find evidence that lower NAVs significantly drive outflows during the Covid-19 crisis,  as shown in Appendix Table A0.\1

One possible reason for our finding is that MMFs' foating NAVs actually stayed far above the threshold for “breaking the buck” (i.e.,  falling below 0.995) during the crisis while WLAs have dropped close to or even below $30\%$ for some funds. Indeed,  among all institutional prime MMFs,  the lowest NAV ever observed during the crisis is 0.998,  and the lowest WLA during the same crisis period is $27\%$ . Therefore,  we focus the empirica analysis on the sensitivity of flows to WLA

# 5. The calming effects of the MMLF

In this section,  we estimate the calming effects of the MMLF on prime funds and examine whether the stability effects of the MMLF accrued to a greater extent to funds holding more MMLF-eligible assets. We also study the spillover effect of the facility to offshore USD prime MMFs. The latter are characteristically similar to domestic prime MMFs and suffered similarly large outflows during the crisis,  but are not covered by the MMLF.

## 5.1 Effects and channels of theMMLF on prime funds

Table 4 presents summary statistics for three different types of prime MMFs during the crisis and the post-MMLF period. With the MMLF becoming operational on March 23 we define the two weeks before the implementation of the MMLF as the “crisis” period (i.e.,  March 9 to March 20,  business days only) and the two weeks immediately after implementation as the “MMLF" period (i.e.,  March 23 to April 3,  business days only)

Table 4 shows that on average institutional funds suffered the most severe outflows during the crisis period,  followed by offshore USD funds,  while retail funds were much less affected. In the post-MMLF period,  outflows slowed quite a bit for institutiona funds and offshore funds. It's interesting to see that all types of prime funds significantly boosted their liquid asset holdings in the post-MMLF period,  increasing their WLAs by 4-8 percentage points

Weformally test the relation between the MMLF and prime fund flowsby estimating the following regressions

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i,   t}&=\beta_{1}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{2}WLA_{i,   t-1}+\beta_{3}MMLF_{t}\times WLA_{i,   t-1}\\&+controls_{i,   t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,   t},   \end{aligned}$$

where $Flow_{i,   t}$ is the daily percentage change in the AUM of fund $i$ ,  $WLA_{i,   t-1}$ (in percent is the share of weekly liquid assets to total assets of fund $\dot{i}$ on the previous Tuesday,  and $MMLF_{t}$ is the dummy for the post-MMLF period (ie.,  equals one for the period of March 23 to April 3). We double cluster standard errors at fund and day levels.

Table 5 presents the regression results for Equation (3). The sample for Columns (1) and (2) includes both institutional and retail prime funds. Column (1) uses a simple specification to show that on average prime funds' daily outflows decline by 1 percentage point in the post-MMLF period. Column (2) includes the institutional dummy and its interaction term with $MMLF_{t}$ ,  and the estimation results show that all the reduction in outflows after the launch of the MMLF is concentrated among institutional funds. In particular,  relative to retail funds,  institutional funds see their daily outflows reduced by 2.3 percentage points after the launch of the MMLF,  significant at the $1\%$ level.

Therefore,  in Columns (3) to (6),  we focus on institutional funds only. Column (3) repeats the specification of Column (1) within the institutional fund sample and shows that the MMLF effect on fund flows is doubled in terms of magnitude,  significant at the $1\%$ level. Column (4) includes lagged WLA and its interaction with $MMLF_{t}$ .The results show that while higher WLA helps ease fund outflows during the whole sample period funds with lower WLA experience a stronger rebound in their AUMs after the launch of MMLF,  significant at the $5\%$ level.

Column (5) repeats the test of Column (4) while controlling for various lagged fund characteristics,  including gross yields,  share of risky holdings (CP,  CDs,  and foating rate notes),  share of safe holdings (Treasury and agency debt),  charged expense ratios,  fund age,  and affiliation to banks,  and Column (6) further controls for fund fixed effects. The coefficient on the interaction term remains negative and significant. Moreover,  it's interesting to find that funds that charge higher management fees suffered less outflows during the sample period,  significant at the $1\%$ level. 10 It's possible that funds' management fees are positively correlated with funds’ effort in managing relationships with their institutional investors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fund managers spend significant. Effort during the crisis time to calm down their anxious investors and persuade them not to withdraw

Overall,  the results of Table 5 suggest that the MMLF significantly attenuated the sensitivity of flows to the liquidity of the fund (WLA),  which characterized the crisis dynamics. Indeed,  the ability of a fund to access the MMLF made its current liquidity less of a concern given the availability of plentiful “liquidity of last resort” at the MMLF

To test the potential channel for the MMLF effect on fund flows,  we use the CUSIPlevel holding data of MMFs and calculate the share of assets that are MMLF-eligible at the end of February 2020,  right before the run started. As described in the MMLF background section,  to be MMLF-eligible,  assets (including unsecured CP,  ABCP,  anc CDs) had to satisfy certain maturity,  rating,  and domicile criteria. Utilizing the granular security-level information in N-MFP,  we are able to identify assets that are MMLF-eligible for each MMF. We then merge the N-MFP information with the iMoneyNet data and run the following regression

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i,   t}=\beta_{1}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{2}EligiblePct_{i}+\beta_{3}MMLF_{t}\times EligiblePct_{i}\\&+controls_{i,   t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,   t},   \end{aligned}$$

where $EligiblePct_{i}$ is defined as the share of MMLF-eligible assets relative to the fund AUM on February 28 for fund $i$ .In all specifications,  standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.

Regression results of Equation (4) are reported in Table 6. Column (1) shows that the interaction term between $EligiblePct_{i}$ and $MMLF_{t}$ has a positive and significant effect on flows,  indicating that MMFs with more MMLF-eligible holdings have a larger rebound in the post-MMLF period. This result is robust to including lagged controls of fund characteristics,  as shown in Column (5).

In Columns (2)-(4) of Table 6,  we break down MMLF-eligible assets into different security types,  namely,  eligible ABCP,  eligible unsecured CP,  and eligible CDs,  and repeat our test with each of the subgroups of eligible assets. While the estimated coefficient on the interaction term between $MMLF_{t}$ and $EligiblePct_{i}$ remains positive for each asset category,  it is only statistically significant for CDs.

Several reasons could explain our findings. First,  ABCP and unsecured [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] were announced to be eligible to the MMLF on March 18,  the day MMLF was first announced to the public,  while CDs were admitted to be eligible only on March 23,  the day the MMLF started to operate. Outflows at funds with high shares of eligible ABCP and unsecured [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] could have already slowed somewhat between March 18 and March 23 while funds with high shares of eligible CDs only started to recover after March 23.

Alternatively,  MMFs saw the largest liquidity benefits from pledging the longest-teno. Assets in their portfolios,  which are in most cases CDs.

Finally,  in unreported results we show that the MMLF also had a positive effect on stabilizing foating NAVs,  bringing them back up from the lower levels seen during the crisis. However,  we do not emphasize this result since,  as previously discussed,  foating NAVs seem not to be significant drivers of outflows during the crisis

## 5.2 Spillover Effects of the MMLF on offshore USD MMFs

In mid-March,  as institutional investors started to run on domestic prime MMFs,  similan runs occurred on offshore USD prime MMFs,  which invest in exactly the same pool of assets as their domestic counterparts and cater to global investors. L Moreover,  as shown in Table 4,  offshore USD prime funds on average invest in less liquid and riskier asset portfolios,  as represented by their lower WLA,  longer weighted average maturity,  more risky assets,  and less safe instruments. Assets in offshore USD prime funds also dropped by about $25\%$ during the crisis time.

The MMLF was designed to protect U.S. investors and MMFs,  and thus offshore USD funds,  although also investing in the U.S. short-term debt instruments,  were not coverec by the MMLF. This fact offers us a great opportunity to study the potential spillover effects of the MMLF to similar but ineligible market participants,  namely,  offshore USD prime MMFs. Specifically,  we estimate the following regression

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i,   t}=\beta_{1}Offshore_{i}+\beta_{2}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{3}Offshore_{i}\times MMLF_{t}\\&+controls_{i,   t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i,   t},   \end{aligned}$$

where $Offshore_{i}$ equals one for offshore USD prime funds and $MMLF_{t}$ equals one after

The MMLF becomes operational on March 23,  2020. The sample for this test include both institutional prime MMFs and offshore USD prime funds. Standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.

Table 7 displays the regression results for Equation (5). Column (1) runs a simple test of the MMLF effect on all prime funds in the sample and shows that daily flows increase by 1.7 percentage points in the post-MMLF period. Column (2) shows how the MMLF affects domestic and offshore funds differently. While offshore funds on average have smaller outflows over the sample period,  as shown by the positive and significant coefficient on the $Offshore_{i}$ dummy,  offshore funds also experience a smaller rebound after the implementation of the MMLF. In particular,  while domestics funds' daily flows recover by on average 2.2 percentage points in the post-MMLF period,  an those of offshore funds recover only by 0.95 percentage points in the same post-MMLF period. These results are robust to the inclusion of lagged fund characteristics controls and fund family fixed effects,  as shown in Columns (3)-(4)

Columns (5)-(8) are designed to test for the speed of investors’ reaction to the MMLF Column (5) shows that the slowdown of MMF outflows is not significant in the first week after the launch of the MMLF when pooling offshore and domestic prime funds together. But is highly significant,  both statistically and economically,  in the second week after the launch of MMLF. Column (6) includes the interaction terms between the $Offshore_{i}$ dummy and the two post-MMLF windows and shows that offshore fund investors almost did not respond to the MMLF over the first week of its operation. Specifically,  while domestic funds’ daily flows recover by 1.7 percentage points in the first week after the launch of the MMLF,  those of offshore funds barely change over the same time period. In the second week of the post-MMLF period,  flows were not significantly different between offshore funds and domestics funds,  as shown by the coefficient on the interaction term between $Offshore_{i}$ and $MMLF\_W2_{t}$ .These results are also robust to the inclusion of lagged fund characteristics controls and fund family fixed effects,  as shown in Columns (7)-(8).

In sum,  the MMLF had a calming effect on market participants beyond its direct coverage,  although the magnitude of such effects is smaller and the reaction time is longer.

# 6. The Impact of MMLF on [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD Markets

As the MMLF stabilized MMF flows and liquidity conditions,  these funds were able once again to purchase [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs at tenors greater than one week. In this section,  we conduct a battery of tests to evaluate the impact of MMLF on the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD markets While MMLF might have had a stabilizing effect on the overall [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD markets such effect should be stronger within the set of instruments more heavily traded by money funds and therefore effectively pledgeable at the MMLF.

We rely on DTCC's transaction level data for trades in all U.S. [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] These data provide information regarding each trade such as yield and quantity,  and the rating that the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] received from Moody's and S&P at the time of trade. As a [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] can be rated differently by these two rating agencies,  we follow the principle used by the MMLF in determining the CP's credit quality and assign a composite rating to each [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] on each day 12 [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] with ratings belonging to the top two notches together account for $91\%$ of the data,  with those in the top notch alone accounting for $62\%$ .Based on the number of days to maturity,  we also assign each [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] to one of the following ten term buckets: overnight 1 and 2 weeks,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  and 6 months. Trades in these 9 term buckets together account for over $97\%$ of the data. [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] with time to maturity longer than 7 months are excluded from our study due to very limited issuance at those terms. For each trade. Its spread to Is is calculated by subtracting from its yield the Is rate for the same term bucket. To construct our sample,  we calculate the volume weighted average spread across instruments issued by the same [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuer $j$ ,  on the same day $t$ ,  and within the same term bucket $Trn.$ $(Spread_{j,   t,   m})$ .Our final dataset consists of all the issuer-day-term level estimates for the period that spans from two weeks before and two weeks after the launch of MMLF,  namely from March 9,  2020 to April 3,  2020.

Our first identification strategy focuses on testing the differential effect of MMLF across [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] with different credit quality. To be considered MMLF-eligible,  [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] must belong to the top rating category. If the MMLF stabilized the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market following its launch on March 23,  we should expect such effect to be stronger among MMLF-eligible CP,  namely with top rating. To test this hypothesis,  we create a dummy $TopRating_{t}$ that takes the value one if a CP's composite rating is equal to 1 on day $t$ ,  and estimate the following panel regression

$$Spread_{j,   t,   m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times TopRating_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j,   t,   m}$$

Where $MMLF_{t}$ is a dummy for the two weeks following the launch of MMLF,  and $\mu_{j}$ $\mu_{t}$ ,  $\mu_{m}$ ,  $\mu_{T}$ represent issuer,  day,  maturity,  and rating fixed effects,  respectively. Standard errors are two-way clustered at the issuer and day level. Consistent with the MMLF design,  Table & shows that spreads in top rated [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] declined by more following the launch of the facility. The coefficient of the interation of $MMLF_{t}$ and $TopRating_{t}$ is negative and highly significant. The magnitude is also economically meaningful. A 1/P 1-rated [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] experienced an additional 45 bps decline in rate spreads compared to other lower-rated [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] during the two weeks post MMLF

Our second test identifies the MMLF effect by building on our earlier analysis on the impact of the MMLF on money fund flows. Since financial and non-financial borrowers rely on MMFs for funding to different degrees,  we test whether borrowers that depend more on MMFs saw a greater benefit from the MMLF than borrowers less dependent on MMFs. For that purpose,  we use data on security level holdings by MMFs from thein monthly N-MFP flings to the SEC. For each [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuer,  we aggregate the total amount of its [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] held by money funds by the end of February 2020. We then normalize the number by the average daily [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] outstanding amount during February 2020 for each issuer (data obtained from DTCC) and name it $(ShareMMF_{t}$ ). We hypothesize that if the MMLF has stabilized the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market by stemming money fund outflows,  its impact on spreads would be stronger for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] more heavily held by money funds prior to its implementation

To test this hypothesis,  we replace $TopRating_{t}$ with $ShareMMF_{t}$ and reestimate Equation 6. Consistent with the MMLF lowering [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] spreads through its impact on money fund flows,  the coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is negative and highly significant (Table 8),  suggesting that spreads declined more for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] more heavily held by money funds prior to the launch of the MMLF. As money funds are unlikely to sell [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] with short maturity to the MMLF since they turn into cash quickly,  we re-estimate Equation 6 by excluding overnight papers and get somewhat stronger results

It is worth noting that right before the launch of the MMLF,  the Fed created the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) to aid primary dealers in supporting smooth market functioning. As the credit extended to primary dealers under the PDCF improvec dealers funding conditions,  one might argue that it could have also contributed to the improvement in [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] spreads during the post MMLF period. While we are not able to exclude the possibility that PDCF has also caused [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] spreads to narrow,  we also note that the MMLF effect we identified earlier is likely to be above and beyond the PDCF effect. Unlike the MMLF,  the PDCF accepts both A 1/P 1 and A 2/P 2 [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] as eligible collateral to pledge at the PDCF. Therefore,  focusing on the additional decline in spread for A 1/P 1 [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] allows us to identify the additional impact that the MMLF had on [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] spreads. Moreover,  dealers can pledge at the PDCF [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] that they bought from all sorts of market participants,  not just money funds. Therefore,  finding a stronger effect for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] more heavily held by prime funds suggests that the MMLF had a significant effect over and above the PDCF

In addition to cheaper credit,  the MMLF was also believed to have contributed to more robust [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuance across tenors. In the several days prior to the creation of the MMLF,  new [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuance dropped precipitously and many market participants viewed the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market as being essentially frozen. Once the run on prime MMFs abated due to the enhanced liquidity provided by the MMLF,  MMFs were once again willing to buy CP,  knowing that they could pledge it back to the MMLF to monetize it in case of future runs.

To understand the MMLF impact on [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuance,  we use the same [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] sample and estimate the following panel regression

$$Log (Issuance)_{j,   t,   m}=\beta MMLF_t\times TopRating_t+\mu_j+\mu_t+\mu_m+\mu_r+\varepsilon_{j,   t,   m}$$

Where $Log (Issuance)_{j,   t,   m}$ is is the log of one plus the amount issued by borrower $j$ on day $t$ with time to maturity within maturitybucket $mt$ .Since not issuing debt is valuable information,  we consider issuer-day-term observations with no issuance as zero issuance leading to $Log (Issuance)_{j,   t}$ being equal to zero in those cases.

Results in Table 9 support the view that the MMLF has improved the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market by restarting new issuance. Top rated [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuers experienced larger increase in issuance volume during the post MMLF period (column (1)). In addition,  borrowers that rely more heavily on MMFs to obtain funding were able to borrow more after the introduction of the MMLF. When we replace $TopRating_{t}$ with $ShareMMF_{t}$ and reestimate Equation 7,  the coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is indeed positive and highly significant (column (2)). The MMLF effects are evident when we focus only on term [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] (column (3))

One salient feature of the MMLF is its pricing schedule. Banks can pledge [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs and obtain funding by paying a rate of 125 bps (100 bps above the discount window's primary credit rate). Because of the MMLF pricing,  [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issued at 125 bps or higher would be quite attractive for MMFs to buy because they could be liquidated to the MMLF without either the MMF or the bank incurring a loss. Anecdotally,  industry strategists suggested that 125 bps could indeed be the foor for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] rates and as a result also for the London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR). Therefore,  the MMLF effect,  if any,  should be stronger in CPs issued at 125 bps or higher

Using its pricing feature,  we develop our third test toidentify the MMLF impact on the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market. Specifically,  we estimate $Log (Issuance)_{j,   t,   m}$ separately for CPs issued at rates greater than 125 bps and those below 125 bps,  and name them $Log (HighRateIssuance)_{j,   t,   m}$ and $Log (LowRateIssuance)_{j,   t,   m}$ respectively. We then estimate the following panel re gressions:

$$Log (HighRateIssuance)_{j,   t,   m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times ShareMMF_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j,   t}$$

$$og (LowRateIssuance)_{j,   t,   m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times ShareMMF_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j,   t,   m}$$
Where the explanatory variables are defined as in Equation 7. Consistent with the hypoth esis that [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] more profitable to pledge (with rate above 125 bps) benefited particularly from the MMLF,  we find that issuance restarted significantly more for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] issuers with more reliance on MMFs only when the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] yields more than 125 bps. The coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is positive and highly significant in Equa tion 8,  but negative and not significant in Equation 8 (columns (4) and (5)). Excluding overnight issuance yields similar findings. The limited effects of the MMLF on issuance of cheaper [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] (with rate below 125 bps) suggests that MMFs were not particularly interested in purchasing these instruments since they may not have been able to liquidate them at the MMLF in case of need.

Similar MMLF effects are also evident in the CD market. Using the DTCC data for CDs,  we estimate both spread to Is and issuance volume at the issuer-term-day level and study the additional impact of $ShareMMF_{t}$ post MMLF. Results in Table 10 are again consistent with the stabilization effects that the MMLF had on short-term funding markets. Borrowers more reliant on funding from MMFs experienced significantly larger declines in borrowing costs and greater increase in issuance volume after the introduction of the MMLF (columns (1）and (2)). In addition,  the issuance effect is concentrated among CD instruments offering more than 125 bps,  similarly to what we found for CF instruments (columns (3) and (4)). 13

Once again,  the fact that the spread reduction and increased issuance effects are concentrated among instruments that are economically viable to pledge at the MMLF and those more heavily purchased by MMLF eligible participants,  namely money funds suggests that the MMLF provided stability benefits in addition to any effect coming from the PDCF.

## 7. Conclusion

Financial stability regulations are expected to curb excessive risk taking ex-ante so as to reduce the severity of a crisis whenever it occurs. It is therefore understood that some of these regulations create a trade-off: they reduce liquidity transformation and risk-taking. In normal times to provide more stability in bad times. We compare three runs on prime money funds,  two of which happened prior to the introduction of strict liquidity restric tions on prime funds and one that occurred after these restrictions were put in place. We find evidence consistent with the fact that the introduction of gates and fees that was meant to curb runs actually created an incentive for investors to preemptively run on the less liquid funds. After documenting the run on prime funds that occurred during the Covid-19 crisis,  we study the effectiveness of the introduction of the Money Market Mu tual Funds Liquidity Facility (MMLF). By providing “liquidity of last resort",  it allowed prime funds to quickly rebuild liquidity buffers,  improving investors' confidence. The. MMLF quickly stopped prime MMF outflows and allowed funds to restart the provisior of funding to banks and corporations in the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD markets,  and at cheaper rates. The recent Covid-19 crisis highlighted that ex-ante liquidity regulations could not achieve the goal of creating a system immune from runs. Ultimately,  when liquidity concerns arise and investors run on money funds while dealers stop providing secondary market liquidity,  ex-post interventions are necessary..

## Table 2: Two Decades of Crises and Sensitivity to WLA

The three separate samples consist of institutional prime MMFs during three time periods: the Covid-19 crisis (Feb 04 to March 24); the 2011 Eurozone sovereign debt crisis (May 03 to Aug 01); and the 2008 financial crisis (Aug 04 to Sep 30). Flow is the daily percentage change in assets under management. Winsorized at the $0.5\%$ and $99.5\%$ levels. WLA is the lagged share of weekly liquid assets to total assets and 1 ( $WLA<35$ ) equals one if WLA is below $35\%$ .Crisis equals one from Sep 10 to Sep 30 in 2008,  from Jun 10 to Aug 1 in 2011,  and from Mar 6 to Mar 24 in 2020.

## Table 10: MMLFeffects on CD spreads and issuance

The daily sample goes from March 9,  2020 to April 3,  2020 and contains CD data at the issuer-day-term level. The sample includes CDs with maturities between 1 week and 1 year. Spread is the difference in percentage points between the CD yield and the Is rate at equivalent maturity.Log (Issuance) is the log of one plus the amount issued by a certain firm in a given day. MMLF equals one after the MMLF implementation date of March 23,  2020. ShareMMF is the share of an issuer's CD held by MMFs by the end of February 2020. Standard errors (in parentheses) are two-way clustered at the issuer and day level.

# Appendix: MMLF and other emergency facilities

There are a couple of other Federal Reserve facilities that were announced around the time of the MMLF announcement and might also have some impact on the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD markets. The [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Funding Facility (CPFF) was announced on March 17. CPFF supports liquidity in the [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] market by purchasing paper directly from issuers and by giving investors confidence that issuers will be able to roll maturing CP. However. The CPFF was not operational until April 14,  where the market conditions had improved substantially since MMLF operations began on March 23.

There are several important differences between CPFF and MMLF. First,  while CPFF buys newly issued CP,  MMLF loans are secured by assets that are purchased by banks from MMFs existing holdings. Second,  collaterals under MMLF can have maturity ranging from overnight to 12 months,  while CPFF only buys 3-month CP. Lastly,  the pricing of [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] under MMLF and CPFF are quite different. To access the CPFF,  issuers must pay an upfront facility fee equal to 10 basis points of the maximum amount of its [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] that CPFF may own. Under CPFF,  for A 1/P 1 rated [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  pricing will be based on the then-current 3-month overnight index swap (Is) rate plus 110 basis points and for [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] rated A 2/P 2/F 2,  then-current 3-month Is rate plus 200 basis points. On the other hand,  MMLF has no facility fees. MMLF loans secured by [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] are priced at PCR plus 100 bps.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was also announced on March 17. PDCF provides credit to primary dealers of the New York Fed against a broad range of collateral including [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CD. The maximum maturity of PDCF loans is 90 days and PDCF loans are priced at PCR regardless of loan maturity or collateral.

There are several important differences between PDCF and MMLF. First,  PDCF is open only to the 24 primary dealers,  while MMLF is accessible by all US banks,  affliates of US bank holding companies,  and US branches of foreign banks. Second,  PDCF loans have maturity up to 90 days,  while MMLF loans have maturity up to 12 months. Third

Under PDCF,  primary dealers cannot pledge securities issued by themselves as collateral for loans. There is no such limitation on MMLF collateral. Fourth,  PDCF loans do not have preferential treatment with respect to regulatory capital ratios,  and are made with recourse beyond the pledged collateral to the primary dealers. MMLF loans do not affect banks capital ratios and have no recourse. Fifth,  A 2/P 2-rates [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs are eligible collateral for PDCF loans,  while MMLF loans only accept A 1/Pl-rates [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|CP]] and CDs as collateral. Last,  the PDCF loans are priced at a fixed rate equal to the PCR. Regardless of collateral type or loan maturity and loan amount is limited to the amount of margin-adjusted eligible collateral. MMLF loans have no margin-adjustments and are priced at a fixed spread over PCR,  depending on the type of the collateral.

## Table A0.\1: Timeline of Main Federal Reserve Interventions

This table summarizes the timeline of major interventions by the Federal Reserve during the Covid-19 crisis. CPFFrefers to the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Funding Facility; PDCF to Primary Dealer Credit Facility MMLF to Money MarketMutual Fund Liquidity Facility; PMCCF to Primary Market Corporate Credi Facility; SMCCF to Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility; TALF to Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; PPPLF to Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility; MLF to Municipal Liquidity Facility; MSLP to Main Street Lending Program. Finally,  VRDNs stands for variable rate discount notes and CDs for certificates of deposit.

### Table A0.\1: Effect of floating NAV on flows

The daily sample goes from February 4 to March 24,  2020 and contains institutional prime funds. Flow is the daily percentage change in assets under management. Crisis equals one from March 6 to March 24. NAV_to. L equals (1 lagged NAV) times 100 and I $\lfloor (NAV<1$ ) equals one if lagged NAV is below 1. WLA is the lagged share of weekly liquid assets to total assets. Controls include lagged WAM,  GSY Expense Ratio,  Fund Age,  and Bank Affiliation,  holdings of ABCP,  and holdings of foreign CDs,  as of the previous Tuesday. Standard errors (in parentheses) are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.
