# Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook

## Summary

- Twenty-eight issuers defaulted on approximately $6.0 billion of syndicated bank loans in 2006,         down from thirty issuers that defaulted on roughly $13.4 billion in 2005. Of the twenty-eight loan defaulters,  eight were rated by Moody’s,  and they accounted for approximately $2.6 billion in dollar volume.
- Distress in the automobile industry accounted for over one-third of 2006 defaulting loan volume,  as seven automotive companies defaulted on approximately $2.3 billion in loans.
- Mirroring the credit environment for syndicated bank loans,  the dollar volume of Moody's-rated corporate bond defaults also decreased in 2006. A total of twenty-eight Moody's-rated issuers defaulted on $7.8 billion in debt in 2006 compared with twenty-nine corporate issuers that defaulted on $28.3 billion in 2005.
- Speculative-grade loan and bond default rates declined substantially in 2006. At the end of 2006,  the loan default rate had fallen to 0.6% from 1.8% at the beginning of the year,  while the bond default rate had declined to 1.9% from 2.3%.
- Recovery rates on defaulted bonds declined during 2006,  while loan recovery rates were relatively steady. The issue-weighted average senior unsecured bond recovery rate for defaulting issuers fell to $43.4 in 2006 from $61.0 in 2005 (relative to par of $100),         while the average loan recovery rate was roughly unchanged in 2006 at approximately $88.0.
- Moody's forecasting model for its global speculative-grade bond default rate predicts that the global speculative-grade default rate will rise from its current 1.7% level to 2.6% by the end of 2007. Given the strong historical correlation between speculative-grade bond and loan default rates,  Moody's expects the speculative-grade loan default rate to increase to 2.1% from its current 0.6% by the end of 2007. Although credit quality remained relatively steady in 2006,  slower expected economic growth in 2007 and the large amounts of low-quality bonds issued in 2004 are expected to lead to climbing default rates during 2007.

## Loan Defaults

As reflected in a benign corporate credit environment,  in 2006 the dollar volume of syndicated bank loan defaults declined more than 50% from 2005 levels. Exhibit 1 shows that twenty-eight issuers defaulted on approximately $6.0 billion of bank loans in 2006,         down from thirty issuers that defaulted on roughly $13.4 billion in 2005. Of the twenty-eight 2006 loan defaulters,  eight were rated by Moody's and they accounted for approximately $2.6 billion in volume.

Among these eight,  six were based in the US,  while there was one defaulter based in France and one in Germany. In 2005 there were eleven Moody's-rated loan defaults,  all by US issuers. The Appendix includes summary descriptions of the eight 2006 loan default events.

Distress in the automotive parts industry accounted for almost one-third of 2006 defaulting loan volume,  as seven automobile issuers defaulted on $2.3 billion in auto loans (see Exhibit 2). The largest 2006 loan defaulter was LG

Philips Displays Holding BV with $1.4 billion in bank debt. Loan defaults were relatively small in 2006 as the average size of loan defaults decreased to $213 million per issuer from $447 million per issuer in 2005.

## Corporate Bond Defaults

Mirroring the credit environment for syndicated bank loans,  the dollar volume of Moody's-rated corporate bond defaults also decreased substantially in 2006. A total of twenty-eight Moody's-rated issuers defaulted on $7.8 billion in bonds in 2006 debt in 2006 compared with twenty-nine corporate issuers that defaulted on $28.3 billion in bonds in 2005 (see Exhibit 3). Similar to the loan market,  distress in the automotive parts industry led to $2.5 billion in bond defaults in this industry,  contributing roughly one-third of total 2006 global bond default volume (see Exhibit 4).

Exhibit 3 Global Bond Default Volume Fell Sharply in 2006

Dana Corporation,  together with Dana Credit Corporation,  was the year's largest default at approximately $1.9 billion. Corporate bond defaults were concentrated in the US in 2006,         with twenty-two issuers defaulting on a total of $6.4 billion in debt. Four issuers defaulted on $1.2 billion in Europe,         and two bond issuers based in South America defaulted on $0.2 billion in debt.

## Default Rates

The global speculative-grade corporate bond issuer default rate fell to 1.7% in 2006 from 1.9% in 2005,  marking the fifth consecutive annual decline and the lowest year-end level since 1996. Relatively low interest rates,  tight yield spreads,  and abundant liquidity helped keep the speculative-grade default rate within a narrow band throughout 2006,  not exceeding 1.9% or falling below 1.6% during the year. Since 1980,  the default rate for speculative-grade corporate bond issuers has averaged 5% per year,  while reaching a high and low of 12.7% and 0.4%,  respectively. By industry,  in 2006 only the textiles,  leather,  and apparel industry experienced a default rate higher than the long-run average of 5% for the overall speculative-grade default rate.

Exhibit 5 presents trailing twelve-month default rates for U.S. speculative-grade bond and loan issuers,  showing the loan default rate declining to 0.6% in December 2006 from 1.8% in December 2005,  and the bond default rate falling to 1.9% from 2.3% over the same period. These data are consistent with Moody's research indicating that default rates on loans are materially lower than default rates on bonds across individual issuers due to issuers that default on their bonds via a distressed exchange while avoiding default on their loans In 2006,  for example,  GFIS

Inc. defaulted on its bonds in a distressed exchange while remaining current on its loans. Similarly,  Charter Communications Inc. and Charter Communications Holdings LLC suffered distressed exchanges on their bonds while another entity within the corporate family,  Charter Communications Operating Company,  remained current on its loans.

## Bond And Loan Recovery Rates

Recovery rates on defaulted bonds declined in 2006,  while loan recovery rates were relatively steady. Exhibit 6 shows that the issue-weighted average senior unsecured bond recovery rate for defaulting issuers rose to $43.4 in 2006 from $61.0 in 2005 (relative to par of $100),         while the average loan recovery rate was unchanged at approximately $80.

Reflecting the currently benign credit environment,  both bond and loan recovery rates remain relatively high by historical standards. Moody's studies,  as well as academic research,  have noted that when default rates are high,  as they were in 2001 and 2002,  recovery rates tend to be low,  and vice versa. 2

## 2007 Default Rate Outlook

Moody's forecasting model for its global speculative-grade bond default rate predicts that the default rate will rise from its current 1.7% level to 2.6% by the end of 2007. Given the historical relationship that loan default rates are on average 20% lower than speculative-grade bond default rates,  the bond default rate forecast of 2.6% implies a loan default rate forecast of approximately 2.1% by the end of 2007.

Exhibit 7 shows Moody's global speculative-grade bond default rate forecast for 2007. Moody's point forecast indicates that the default rate will experience a gradual increase in 2007,  but remaining well below its long-run 5% average. The chart also shows the effect on the default rate if forecasted default rates are 50% higher and lower than the model-generated estimates. In the event that the high default rate scenario occurs,  the resulting default rate is still below its historical average.

Moody's forecast is based on a statistical model with a one-year forecast horizon. The model's primary drivers include changes in the distribution of credit ratings,  high-yield issuance,  and macroeconomic factors. The trends in the credit and economic variables that drive Moody's forecast are somewhat mixed relative to a year ago. On the positive side,  the credit quality of speculative-grade issuers - those most likely to default - remained steady in 2006. The number of downgrades was roughly equal to the number of upgrades during 2006,  similar to the downgrade-toupgrade ratios experienced in 2004 and 2005. Additionally,  in 2006,  favorable rating outlook changes were similar to non-favorable rating outlook changes,  a continuation of a trend that began in 2003.

On the negative side,  consensus macroeconomic forecasts for 2007 predict slower GDP growth in North America and Europe,  likely impacting corporate profitability and the ability to service debt obligations. Consistent with these forecasts,  the Treasury yield curve is now inverted with short-term interest rates above long-term rates. Yield curve flattening or inversion is historically correlated with slowing economic growth and a rise in [[Moody's Corporate Default and Recovery Rates,   1920-2008|corporate defaults]]. Lastly,  as Moody's pointed out in its 2004 default study,  the unprecedented increase in the number of new issuers rated Caa and below - nearly 1/3 of new speculative-grade rated issuers in 2004 - will begin to put upward pressure on the aggregate default rate in 2007.

## Dana Corporation

On March 1,  2006,  Dana Corporation ("Dana") failed to make interest payments on its 7% Senior Notes due 2029 and its 6.5% Senior Notes due 2009. Two days later,  Dana became the sixth Moody's-rated automotive parts supplier to file for Chapter 11 [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] protection since the beginning of 2005,  citing an erosion of operating performance as well as lower production levels in the automotive sector. The Toledo,  Ohio-based company supplies axles,  brakes,  drive shafts,  and other parts to many automakers,  but Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. are by far its two largest customers. Dana has been impacted by declines in market shares of its two largest customers,  increased pricing pressures,  higher raw material costs,  and operational inefficiencies in its commercial vehicle segment. As a result of these events and their credit impact,  Dana defaulted on approximately $1,        582 million of bonds and $400 million loans.

## Dura Operating Corp

On October 16,  2006,  Dura Operating Corp. ("DOC") missed the semiannual interest payment due on its 8.625%

senior notes maturing in 2012. Two weeks later,  DOC's parent company,  Dura Automotive Systems,  Inc.,  filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code along with its domestic and Canadian subsidiaries,  including DOC. Based in Michigan,  Dura Automotive Systems,  Inc.,  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture automotive systems and parts for the global automotive and recreation and specialty vehicle industries.

## Global Automotive Logistics S.A.S

On May 18,  2006,  Global Automotive Logistics,  S.A.S. ("GAL") became the first Moody's-rated European company to default in fifteen months. GAL shareholders filed for a "procedure de sauvegarde,  " which is similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,  and a default under Moody's definition. This French procedure will give the company time to restructure and reorganize its debts,  which include $127 million of Moody's-rated bonds and $127 (or 100)

million of Moody's-rated loans. Located in Boulogne-Billancourt,  France,  GAL is one of the largest logistics providers to the automotive industry in Europe.

## J.L. French Automotive Castings

On February 10,  2006,  J.L. French Automotive Castings ("J.L. French") filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in Delaware. A privately held company,  J.L. filed for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] along with eight affiliates,  citing declining sales from Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.,  its two largest customers,  for its current problems. Headquartered in Sheboygan,  WI,  J.L. French supplies high-pressure die-cast aluminum automotive components and assemblies to the automotive industry.

## Le-Nature'S,  Inc

On November 1,  2006,  creditors of Le-Nature's,  Inc. ("Le-Nature's") filed an involuntary petition for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,  after court-appointed custodian Kroll Zolfo Cooper LLC filed an affidavit alleging fraud on the part of management. Two days later,  the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania converted the filing into a voluntary Chapter 11 filing. At the time of the filing,  the U.S. Attorney's office in Pittsburgh was investigating the possibly criminal conduct of one or more of Le-Nature's management team.

Headquartered in Latrobe,  Pennsylvania,  Le-Nature's develops and markets noncarbonated beverages.

## Performance Transportation Services,  Inc

On January 25,  2006,  Performance Transportation Services,  Inc. ("PTS") filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Western District of New York. PTS cited lower vehicle output at Detroit automakers,  increased diesel fuel prices,  and escalating labor costs for its bankruptcy. Headquartered in Wayne,  Michigan,  PTS is the second-largest transporter of new automobiles,  sport-utility vehicles,  and light trucks in North America.

## Schefenacker Ag

On November 2,  2006,  Schefenacker AG ("Schefenacker") suspended the interest payment on its senior secured bank loans. This credit event comes as news was released last month that Schefenacker plans to transfer its headquarters to the United Kingdom in order to accelerate a restructuring agreement with creditors. A German-based company,  Schefenacker is a leading private Tier 1 automotive supplier of rear vision systems,  lighting systems,  and a Tier 2 supplier of sound systems.

## Werner Holding Co.,  Inc

On May 15,  2006,  Werner Holding Co.,  Inc. ("Werner") missed the semi-annual coupon payment due on its 10%

Senior Subordinated Notes. The company announced that it would take advantage of the 30-day grace period while trying to consummate a recapitalization plan with bondholders. Before the end of the grace period on June 12,  Werner filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result,  Werner defaulted on USD 135 million of Moody's-rated bonds and USD 240 million of Moody's-rated loans. Located in Greenville,  Pennsylvania,  Werner is the world's leading manufacturer and distributor of ladders,  climbing equipment,  and ladder accessories.
