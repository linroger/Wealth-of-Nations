## Summary

Moody's has updated its projection of cumulative losses for recent vintage subprime pools. Moody's now expects cumulative losses of 13%,  30% and 36% of original securitized subprime collateral for 2005,  2006 and 2007 vintages,  respectively. These projections reflect our opinion of the loss mitigation that will be afforded by the recently announced Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP). In the absence of the plan,  Moody's loss estimates would have been 14%,  33% and 40%,  respectively,  for these vintages.

In September 20081,  Moody's issued a report updating its loss projections for recent vintage subprime RMBS pools. In that report,  we discussed two alternative scenarios to highlight the range of potential outcomes under divergent stress assumptions. In this update to our subprime loss expectations,  we have migrated to a scenario broadly consistent with the stressed scenario discussed in September. Since September 2008,  performance of subprime pools has weakened.

Prepayment rates,  which had been at historic lows,  have further diminished to the mid single-digit range. In light of the weak housing market and limited available credit for subprime borrowers,  we believe that voluntary prepayments will remain depressed. Since September 2008,  loss severities on subprime loans have increased rapidly from approximately 50% to 1 See "Subprime RMBS Loss Projection Update: September 2008" Moody's Structured Finance,  September 18 2008.

Greater than 60%.

We anticipate that loss severities will rise to around 70%,  based on an expected further 10-15% decline in home values. The rating actions resulting from these revised loss projections will vary by vintage,  but it is likely that the B o Caa or below,  particularly for such bonds issued vast majority of mezzanine and subordinate certificates currently rated r above will be downgraded to ratings of in 2006 and 2007. Actions on senior bonds will differ based on payment priority and protection relative to projected losses. This report will begin by discussing the trends in subprime mortgage performance that have led to Moody's revised loss projections. It will follow with a discussion of Moody's updated loss projection methodology,  with a sample mortgage pool examined in detail.

## Recent Performance

The performance of mortgage pools backing subprime transactions issued in 2005,  2006 and 2007 has continued to deteriorate. As of January 2009,  the seasoning-adjusted rate of serious delinquencies (those loans 60 or more days delinquent,  in foreclosure,  or held for sale [i.e. real estate owned or REO]) has worsened in each quarter of issuance between Q 1 2006 and Q 2 2007,  and are far higher than what earlier vintages had experienced at Figure 1).

Similar points in their lives (
While the proportion of delinquent loans has leveled off recently,  the stabilization coincides with an acceleration of property liquidations. The rapid growth in cumulative loss levels across all quarter-vintages ( of increasing liquidation volume. Combined,  the data suggest that the volume of defaulting loans has continued to accumulate.

Figure 2) is evidence Currently,  42% of outstanding 2006 vintage subprime loans are at least 60 days delinquent,  in foreclosure,  or held for sale (REO). Moody's believes that,  without intervention,  nearly all of the already-delinquent loans would eventually default. This assessment is based on very high observed roll rates to foreclosure combined with increasing unemployment and decreasing property values. In addition,  we believe that,  by year end,  one-third of borrowers who are currently paying their mortgages will become delinquent and eventually

Default. This projection is based on loan-level analysis of the mortgages predictors of future defaults. This analysis includes forecasted loan-to-2 and loan characteristics as value ratios (LTVs) for the end of 2009,  when the decline in home prices is expected to reach bottom. The LTV ratios were determined by using projections from Moody's Economy. Com for metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). In addition,  other predictive metrics such as loan type,  occupancy status and documentation level were considered in the analysis. Loss severities have also worsened in the last few months,  rising to 63% according to the latest subprime performance data. We forecast a continued rise in severity to around 70%,  based on an expected further 10-15% decline in home values. While home prices are expected to slowly recover,  subprime severities are likely to remain elevated over time. Even as the housing market boomed in recent years,  subprime loss severities increased with loan age. This is generally attributable to accrual of servicer advances and deterioration in property condition over the course of lengthened foreclosure timelines. The likelihood of similar issues persisting in the future leads Moody's to conclude that,  despite the anticipated recovery in the housing market,  subprime severities are likely to remain elevated over time.

Rapidly falling prepayments (_Figure 3_) are evidence of a dearth of refinancing opportunities for borrowers.

![2_Subprime_RMBS_Loss_Projection_Update_0.png](2_Subprime_RMBS_Loss_Projection_Update_0.png)

The scarcity results from a tight credit market and little or no homeowner equity. Originally high LTV ratios have further increased with declining home prices. Despite the possibility of a modest recovery in the housing environment over the next few years,  Moody's expects subprime borrowers to be subject to prolonged refinancing limitations due to negative equity and lack of available credit. As the expected life of a subprime loan is extended,  the likelihood of default is expected to similarly grow as life event risk increases with the passage of time. Moody's analysis indicates that,  without intervention,  72% of all remaining 2006vintage subprime loans (both current and delinquent) would eventually default. A large component of this 72% is comprised of loans that are already seriously delinquent.
When we last updated subprime loss figures in September,  2008,  we generalized that our expected case corresponded to:
"an environment where performance improves over the medium-to-long term. In this scenario,  levels of delinquency and default will decline,  implying that government intervention,  loss mitigation strategies,  and recovery in the housing market will generally help the performance of non-delinquent borrowers. This scenario also assumes moderate improvement in refinancing opportunities for subprime borrowers who are current on their mortgages."
Our stressed scenario,  by comparison,  reflected an environment where: "levels of delinquency and default remain elevated throughout the life of a transaction as loss severities rise. Such performance implies that government intervention and loss mitigation strategies will result in insignificant improvements in credit performance. Any near-term recovery in the housing market would be unlikely in this scenario. This scenario further assumes continued refinancing constraints for subprime borrowers,  limiting future prospects for prepayment."
Since September,  performance data (particularly prepayment and severity trends) suggests that the latter,  more stressful scenario is materializing. As a result we are migrating our underlying assumptions to reflect such a scenario. Further,  the rapid rise in loss severity relative to our current home price forecasts necessitates updating our assumptions to reflect an even more stressful case than had been previously discussed.

However,  as noted above,  intervention attributable to the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan,  announced February 18 th,  may have a mitigating impact on future delinquency and defaults. To account for the impact of large-scale modification,  we have included an explicit calculation of modification benefit into our loss projection methodology.

## Loss Projection Methodology

While subprime pools are generally homogeneous in terms of their collateral characteristics,  collateral attributes such as loan type (FRM vs ARM),  geographic location and LTV can be highly predictive of performance. Therefore,  we have further enhanced our previously published,  loss-curve based methodology. While the updated approach will account for pool characteristics on a deal-by-deal basis,  the underlying assumptions for the subprime population as a whole are generally consistent with those underlying our stressed loss curve expectations. Ultimately we migrated away from the loss-curve-based approach outlined in the September paper because we believe that the updated approach will more precisely distinguish between the relative risks across pools.

The Default Burnout Factor (DBF) Approach with Collateral Analysis The Default Burnout Factor (DBF) approach is based on the assumption that the portion of a pool that is current when home prices bottom out in the future will perform better than the portion of the pool that has already defaulted or is seriously delinquent at that point in time.

Therefore,  we seek to,  first,  project serious delinquencies forward to the anticipated home-price trough. Second,  we calculate the implied,  transaction-specific lifetime default rate reflective of that delinquency projection. Third,  Moody's adjusts this default rate to reflect improving future prepayment and default conditions and applies the resulting rate to the projected remaining loans. To all projected defaults we apply our deal-specific severity expectation. Overall this expectation for 2005 through 2007 vintage deals averages roughly 70%.

## Projecting Delinquencies

Specifically,  the DBF approach uses current performance trends to project out delinquencies and prepayments through late 2009 (the projection date),  corresponding to the current expected trough in home prices. Based on home price projections from Moody's Economy. Com,  as well as on other research,  we have assumed that home prices will fall by 10-15% during 2009 and will bottom out by year end. Our methodology projects serious delinquencies for each pool forward to year end by averaging the results of two distinct approaches:

- Performance-Based Projection - The projected serious delinquency rate is determined by linearly interpolating the observed trends in the serious delinquency rate and the loan default rate for the pool over the most recent 6 months.
- Collateral-Based Projection - The serious delinquency rate for each pool is projected using a regression model based on key loan-level credit characteristics and metro-level home price behavior. For each loan in the pool,  the likelihood of serious delinquency or default as of the projection date is estimated using a regression model based on loan type (fixed/adjustable),  purpose,  documentation,  occupancy status,  property type,  FICO score,  origination loan-to-value ratio (LTV),  and expected home price appreciation/depreciation from the loan closing date until the end of 2009. The individual loan results are aggregated to determine the serious delinquency and default projection for the pools they belong to. (The Appendix provides a detailed description of the collateral-based projection methodology.)
The results of the performance-based and collateral-based projection methods are generally within 20% of each other. For some individual pools,  however,  the difference in the results may be more significant.

When considering these two approaches Moody's typically assigns a weight of 30% to the performancebased projection and 70% to the collateral-based projection. 3

3 Where loan-level data is unavailable Moody's utilizes a 100% weight to the performancebased projection.
Once delinquencies have been projected,  Moody's subprime expected lifetime roll rates are applied to arrive at lifetime defaults. These roll rates are converted to a default rate by taking a weighted average based on the current,  pool-specific distribution of serious delinquencies. An example of this calculation as well as expected subprime lifetime roll rates are presented in _Figure 5_.

## Calculating Lifetime Default Rate ("Default-To-Liquidation")

Moody's calculates an adjusted Default-to-Liquidation rate based on the current level of cumulative defaults to date,  the defaults resulting from the roll rate analysis,  and the assumed prepayments.

- Cumulative defaults to date are observed from historic performance data by dividing cumulative losses to date by historic average severities.
- Defaults from the projected pipeline are taken from the calculation described above
- Prepayments are assumed to be held constant at their current levels based on individual pool performance through the year-end projection period (subject to a cap of 10%)
Default-to-liquidation is calculated by,  first,  adding cumulative defaults to date to expected defaults from the projected delinquency pipeline. Next,  the resulting sum is divided by the pool pay-down to date adjusted for the expected prepayment to year end. The resulting ratio will next be adjusted to reflect expected relative improvement in performance as described below.

## Applying The Default Burn-Out Factor

Finally,  the portion of the pool that is not seriously delinquent on the projection date is assumed to perform better than the portion of the pool that had been seriously delinquent up to that point. This is reflected in the Default Burnout Factor (DBF) assumption. Put simply,  the DBF represents one minus the expected reduction in default rates going forward. The expected default rate on the non-seriously delinquent portion of the pool after projection date is the product of the previously calculated Default-to-Liquidation rate and the DBF. Projected losses on this portion of the pool are calculated by multiplying the projected default rate by the assumed loss severity rate.

Typical DBFs applied to 2006 & 2007 vintage subprime pools average 75%. However,  DBFs can range from 50% to 90% depending on each pool's historical performance and collateral composition. For example a lower DBF may be applied to a fixed-rate pool deemed to be more responsive to improving conditions as a function of its collateral characteristics and/or performance history. Conversely,  a pool which may have seen high prepayments early in its life,  but has substantially weaker collateral remaining may have a higher DBF applied to it. Along these lines,  pools from the 2005 vintage had generally experienced stronger performance early in their lives which is generally not expected to be replicated going forward. To these,  Moody's will typically apply a DBF of 85%.

After calculating a pool's remaining defaults based on the application of the DBF,  Moody's arrives at total future defaults by adding the resulting projection to defaults expected from the projected pipeline. The pool-specific loss severity assumption is then applied to the resulting sum to arrive at projected future losses.

The result can then be added to cumulative losses incurred to date to arrive at expected lifetime cumulative losses.

## Projecting Loss Given Default ("Loss Severity") & Calculating Losses

Loss severity is estimated by taking an equally weighted 4 average of the following three values:

- The most recent actual three-month average severity observed on the pool (+ 8%5 to adjust for anticipated future severity increases);
- A collateral-driven severity estimate. This is determined through a loan level analysis of LTV,  future anticipated home price change,  estimated gross recovery,  time to liquidate the property,  and various liquidation and maintenance costs (see Appendix for more details); and
- General Subprime 1 st Lien Severity Assumption: 70%
In addition,  the observed average loss severity component is subject to a floor (55%) and a cap (75%) to eliminate data anomalies and any volatility associated with limited sample sizes. This cap and floor will also be adjusted to account for lender paid mortgage insurance coverage

## Adjusting For Second Lien Loans

Many primarily first lien transactions contain portions of collateral that are junior-lien in nature. Therefore,  we must adjust the described approach to account for the risk differential between the two asset types. Since most subprime borrowers are in a negative equity position,  second lien loans have defaulted at an alarming rate. The negative equity results in 100% loss given default in virtually all cases. Given the elevated risk associated with second lien collateral Moody's assumes that the few remaining second lien loans in first lien securitizations will default at a frequency of 90% with 100% severity.

## Adjusting Loss Projections For Potential Modification

As noted above,  we have tempered its "no-intervention" loss projections to account for the large-scale mortgage modifications that are now likely. Moody's pre-intervention analytics,  outlined in the preceding sections,  would forecast average losses to the 2005,  2006 and 2007 vintage subprime pools of 14%,  33%,  and 40% of original securitized balances,  respectively. Potential government-sponsored modification programs,  notably the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan (HASP),  lead us to reduce our current cumulative loss forecasts to 13%,  30%,  and 36% of original balances for the respective vintages. In our opinion,  servicers would be substantially more aggressive in modifying mortgages going forward given the incentive structure and explicit guidelines of the HASP Plan. Servicers,  however,  will be unable to modify some of the loans that are likely to default - including many loans currently in foreclosure and all loans in REO. Additionally many investor property loans,  second lien loans,  and lowor no-documentation loans will be ineligible for modification. Although the outlined HASP Plan has stressed interest rate reduction as the first option,  and any cram-down legislation has yet to pass,  we believe that some successful modifications will involve principal reduction. We also anticipate that some small amount of principal losses would occur through the modification of loans that would have otherwise paid in full without the benefit of modification. Ultimate loss reduction in this sector will hinge on the modification program's success in avoiding re-default.

4 Where loan-level data is unavailable Moody's doubles the weigh given to the recent actual severity component. 5 8% has been applied to adjust average observed severities in line with future expectations. As average severities tend toward our expectations this adjustment may be reduced accordingly.

## Estimating Modification Rates

In light of the HASP plan's goals and industry-wide call to action,  as well as the incentive payments and cost-sharing it offers,  servicers are likely to seek to implement more aggressive modification terms wherever possible. The $1,  000 upfront cash incentive provided to servicers for each modification will alleviate additional costs associated with active loss mitigation efforts and could encourage servicers to modify more loans. In forecasting modification rates under the HASP plan,  we assume that servicers will be reasonably aggressive in their modification efforts.

Given these assumptions and constraints,  Moody's modification analysis begins by projecting the balance of loans that will be modified. The starting point for this projection is Moody's calculation of the percentage of expected future defaults using the methodology described above. This calculation is made by merely taking projected future losses,  as a percentage of the outstanding balance divided by expected future severity. Once we derive expected future defaults without intervention,  we then determine the balance of loans which may be modified by eliminating those that are identified as ineligible,  including:

- 100% of loans classified as REO
- 100% of remaining second lien loans - 33% of loans currently in foreclosure Moody's estimated modification rate,  50%,  is then applied to the resulting figure. As many ineligible loans,  such as investor loans and unemployed obligors,  are likely to remain even after the aforementioned exclusions,  our assumed 50% modification rate would actually represent a more substantial proportion of eligible mortgages.

## Projecting Recidivism And Principal Forgiveness

The re-default rates on loans modified so far have been significant with over half of these borrowers becoming delinquent again in a very short time (i.e. six-months). However,  it is expected that servicers may attempt more aggressive modifications - lowering borrowers' rates to as low as 2% and forbearing substantial portions of principal without interest. While ultimate recidivism could range from 40% to 100%,
Moody's estimates that 65% of modified loans will re-default. Further Moody's expects principal losses to occur through some servicer actions. Given the targeted 38% & 31% DTI levels,  we believe that a portion of successful modifications will be,  in part,  due to reduced principal obligations. Therefore,  we have further adjusted our loss expectations by the approximation that 15% to 25% of successful modifications (those which do not re-default) will involve principal reductions averaging 15% of their outstanding balance.

Moody's expects that a percentage of loans not expected to default under our projection will also receive modifications,  some of which would also include principal reductions. Losses attributable to such modification will partially offset the reduction to loss projections. Moody's estimates that 2-5% of loans which would otherwise not default will receive principal modifications of 15%. Each of the previously outlined assumptions regarding modification represents our best estimate under highly uncertain conditions. As more data with respect to the level,  type and effectiveness of modifications undertaken within the HASP guidelines become available,  we will adjust our assumptions accordingly. As an example,  Moody's expects that,  without intervention,  72% of outstanding 2006-vintage subprime loans will default. As approximately 10% of such loans are in REO,  16% are in foreclosure and 2% are second liens,  we assume that of the projected defaults,  only 54% of outstanding loans could be eligible for modification. This remaining 54% will still include some investor obligors,  some recently unemployed borrowers and others who will prove too difficult to modify. Moody's assumes 50% of the 54% will be modified,  or 27% of the outstanding balance. Given that an additional portion of loans that would have otherwise paid in full without modification will also be modified,  Moody's arrives at its expectation that 3035% of outstanding loans will be modified.

Calculating Updated Projected Losses - An Example Figure 6 provides an example of the DBF approach applied to a sample subprime transaction,  quantifying losses without the benefit of the HASP Plan or other substantive modification program. This transaction is assumed to have a pool factor of 55% (Row A) at 30 months of seasoning (Row B),  a CPR of 8% (Row C),
And realized losses to date of 6% (Row G). Delinquency statistics as a percentage of current balance are shown in Rows I through N,  while the 60+ day delinquency rate as a percentage of original balance (22%)
is shown in Row P.

The DBF approach projects delinquencies to the end of 2009. Row T shows that the projected 60+ delinquency rate as a percent of original balance as of year end is projected to be 31%. This figure is arrived at by weighting the collateral (Row S) and Performance (Row R) projections by 30% and 70% respectively.

Rows T looks to the distribution of delinquencies compared to the lifetime roll rates (from _Figure 6_) in assigning expected default frequency to the projected delinquency. In this case,  95% of the projected delinquencies are expected to default.

Row X,  the adjusted pool factor,  shows the portion of the pool's original balance (19%) that is estimated to be outstanding and current (that is,  less than 60 days delinquent) as of year end. This is calculated by,  first,  reducing the current pool factor (55%) by any principal pay-down through the projection point (7.5% = 90% pool factor * 10% Annual CPR / 12 * 10 months) less the percentage of the previously described projected delinquencies (31%) and any current second liens. Applying expected lifetime average loss severity assumptions (Row V) to the projected defaults,  and adding back losses to date,  we arrive at cumulative losses after projected delinquencies (Row Y),  27% in the example. The total defaults to this point (Row Z) can be calculated by dividing cumulative losses as of today by historical average loss severities and adding this to the expected defaults from the projected delinquency pipeline. Next,  this can be converted to a cumulative default rate by calculating implied cumulative defaults (Row Z) as a percentage of the aggregate first lien pool factor reduction (100% minus Row X minus Row D). This implies a projected and realized default rate as a percentage of original balance (as shown in Row AA) of 49%. Utilizing the resulting figure as the expected future default rate would imply that past performance,  given macro-conditions,  would be replicated on the remaining pool. However,  as demonstrated in the example,  we expect conditions to improve in terms of both prepayments and defaults. Therefore,  we reduce the anticipated future default rate by the DBF (Row AB) to reach the anticipated default rate to be applied to the adjusted pool factor from row X. Multiplying the adjusted pool factor (row X),  by the expected future severity (Row V) and also by the projected default rate (row AC),  we arrive at projected future losses (Row AD) (19% * 37% * 70% = 5%).

Finally,  the cumulative loss projection (as a percent of original balance) is equal to 32% (Row AE). This equals the sum of current realized losses (Row G,  6%),  projected pipeline losses (Row W,  21%),  projected future first lien losses (Row AD,  5%) and expected future second lien losses (Row E * 90%,  0.9%).

## Modification Adjustment

Continuing with the previous example,  _figure 7_ below presents how Moody's will adjust the previously described analysis to account for the estimated benefit derived from of large-scale modification.

First,  we calculate projected future defaults by dividing projected loss (as a percentage of outstanding balance) by expected future loss severity. Next,  to limit the loans eligible for modification,  we subtract all loans classified as REO as well as any remaining second lien loans and 1/3 of all foreclosures. In this example we are left with 55% of remaining loans eligible for modification. To this figure,  we then apply the estimated modification rate from row I (50%) to arrive at projected modifications of 26% of the outstanding pool. Assuming servicers successfully mitigate default for 35% of these borrowers (65% re-default rate: row K) we arrive at projected defaults despite modification (17%: row L). This figure is then added to the projected non-modified defaults (row M) to arrive at the adjusted total default projection of 60% of outstanding loan balance (row N).

Next we calculate losses attributable to principal reductions. The first component of this calculation generates the anticipated losses from reduced principal on cured loans. To calculate this value we first,  identify the cured loans (100% minus row K times row J) and apply our expected frequency and severity of principal reduction occurring within cured loans (Frequency = 20%: row O,  Severity = 15%: row P). The result,  in this example,  is less than 1% of current balance lost due to principal reduction. The second component of losses is attributable to principal reduction on loans that did not need modification to avoid default. To calculate this value we multiply the percentage of loans we do not expect to default (31%) by the percentage of such loans anticipated to be modified and the percentage of such modifications expected to reduce principal. The product of the prior calculation is multiplied by the expected severity of loss associated with principal reduction (row P) to arrive at projected losses (row T). Total losses attributable to principal reductions are then added (row U) to the adjusted loss from re-defaulting modifications (row N divided by row C) to arrive at the modification adjusted projected loss (row V).

## Loss Projection Results

The resulting total projected losses for the 2005,  2006 and 2007 vintages are summarized in _Figure 8_. We continue to observe a material difference in expected cumulative loss by vintage,  and anticipate substantially larger losses for late 2006 and early 2007 than for deals securitized earlier.

In Moody's updated projections,  the 2005 vintage will ultimately lose an average of 13% of original securitized balance,  corresponding to an additional loss of 36% of the outstanding balance. 2006 vintage subprime pools will ultimately lose an average of 30% of the original securitized balance,  corresponding to an additional loss of 45% of the outstanding balance. Subprime pools issued in 2007 pools will on average lose 36% of original balance,  an additional 42% of the outstanding collateral balance. A number of factors will influence the extent to which ultimate losses differ from Moody's updated projections. Loss severities will depend in part on whether home price depreciation proceeds ahead of or behind Moody's expectation as well as the speed of the foreclosure and liquidation process. Future default frequencies will likely be influenced by broad economic factors such as unemployment. Further economic decline would hasten the pace of new defaults,  while a strong rebound might dampen it. And,  among the largest uncertainties,  the willingness of the government to directly intervene in the housing and/or securitization markets could have substantial impact on the ultimate outcome. There will continue to be much uncertainty about the ultimate scope and effectiveness of the recently announced Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan for at least several months,  and potentially well over a year. Given this uncertainty and the rating implications of successful,  large-scale loss mitigation efforts,  Moody's has tempered its loss expectations accordingly. If the program ultimately proves underutilized or recidivism rates exceed our estimates,  we may revise our loss projections accordingly.

## Impact Of Updated Loss Projections On Ratings

Moody's expects significant rating migration across the capital structure for virtually all 2005,  2006 and 2007 transactions. However,  the sequential nature of most principal waterfalls will ensure that the ratings of many senior bonds that are deemed highly likely to be paid in full in the near term will be confirmed. While the modification assumptions described above have had a mitigating effect on projected losses,  it is noteworthy that extensive modifications could reduce available credit support. Aggressive reductions in mortgage rates on subprime borrowers will reduce available excess spread that would have otherwise been utilized to cover pool losses and accelerate the retirement of senior securities. The level of modifications currently anticipated will likely reduce excess spread by 20-40% over the next few years,  based on our updated projections. In assigning updated ratings to subprime RMBS,  this assumed loss of excess spread will offset a material portion of the anticipated reduction in default achieved through loan modification. Overall,  the forthcoming rating changes will vary by vintage and collateral quality,  but it is likely that the vast majority of mezzanine and subordinate certificates currently rated B or above would be downgraded to ratings of Caa or below,  particularly for bonds issued in 2006 and 2007. Actions on senior bonds will differ based on payment priority and protection relative to projected losses. Given the level of losses currently projected,  a majority of senior certificates will likely be downgraded below investment grade. Many,  particularly longer duration senior bonds from 2006 and 2007,  are expected to be downgraded to B or below.

As general guidance to subprime RMBS ratings at the lower end of Moody's scale,  securities rated B 2 or higher are likely to be paid off in full under expected conditions. Once a security is likely to take a loss under an expected scenario,  we will typically rate it B 3 or lower. To determine those ratings,  an estimated recovery ratio is calculated using available enhancement,  including excess spread,  and the priority of principal distribution. Securities with expected recoveries of 75% to 95% are rated in the Caa range.

Securities with expected recoveries of 25% to 75% are rated Ca,  while securities are rated C if their expected recoveries are below 25%.

## Appendix: Collateral-Based Delinquency Projection

In addition to its linear projections based on a pool's past performance,  Moody's supplemented its delinquency projections with a loan-level collateral-based approach. The performance-based and collateral-based projections are weighted in a pool's ultimate delinquency projection as of the projection date. The collateral-based approach incorporates loan characteristics such as borrower FICO,  CLTV,  loan type and purpose,  and level of documentation as well as an estimate on home price appreciation (HPA) in order to project the likelihood that a loan will default over the projection period.

## Data Sample And Variables

Moody's compiled loan-level collateral and performance data for loans included in subprime transactions issued in 2005,  2006 and 2007. We apportioned the overall loan population into six subgroups by period of half-yearly origination (1 H 2005-2 H 2007). Moody's classified each first lien loan according to seven independent variables. Two of the variables,  Origination FICO and Updated Combined Loan to Value (CLTV),  take numerical values. The rest featured values that were classified as follows:

- Loan Type: Fixed or ARM
- Loan Purpose: Purchase,  Refinance or Cash-Out
- Occupancy: Investor,  Owner,  or Other
- Documentation: Unknown,  Full,  Partial,  or No documentation
- Property Type: Single Family,  Other,  Condominiums The Updated CLTV is intended to capture the impact of changes in home prices on default performance,  calculated as follows: Updated CLTV = Origination CLTV * Origination Median Home Price/Current Median Home Price Median home prices were obtained from Moody's Economy. Com at an MSA level.

## Analytical Approach And Results

Moody's developed a logistic regression to quantify the historical relationship of a loan's characteristics with its probability of default. The dependent variable,  State of Default,  was set equal to 1 if the loan has defaulted and 0 if it has not defaulted between the time of origination and late 2008. For this purpose,  Moody's defines a defaulted loan as one that is 60 or more days delinquent,  in foreclosure or REO,  in bankruptcy,  or charged-off.

Moody's found that all of the variables were statistically significant for the subgroups. The impacts of key variables such as FICO and Updated CLTV were consistent across vintages. The impacts of other variables,  however,  were moderately different across origination periods. Moody's believes that differences in origination practices across vintages are driving these differences in the observed results.

## Projecting Roll Rates On Non-Delinquent Loans

The final step in the analysis is to transform the default likelihoods obtained from the regression output into 12-month roll-rates to default for non-delinquent loans. For any given combination of loan characteristics,  the regression equation gives the likelihood of that loan defaulting. In order to link that default probability to the rate at which current loans will roll into default over the projection period,  Moody's compared the regression output of loans that were current as of late 2007 with those loans' rate of delinquency as of late 2008. _Figure 9_ describes the upward-sloping relationship between the loans' estimated default likelihood (grouped in cohorts rounded to the nearest integer) and their rate of 60+ delinquency. For example,  for all of the loans that were current as of late 2007 with an estimated default likelihood of 20%,  17% were found to be in default 12 months later. Three distinct rollrate curves were developed for vintages 2005 to 2007.

![14_Subprime_RMBS_Loss_Projection_Update_0.png](14_Subprime_RMBS_Loss_Projection_Update_0.png)

Moody's projects the default likelihood of each non-delinquent loan by applying Moody's Economy. Com MSA-level 12-month HPA forecasts to the Updated CLTV and plugging it,  along with the other loan characteristics,  into the regression equation. Moody's then finds the corresponding 12-month delinquency rate for the resulting default likelihood cohort and applies it to each loan in the cohort,  giving the loans' probability of becoming 60+ days delinquent over the projection period. A pool's delinquency projection is the sum of (1) the aggregation of these probabilities for each current loan in the pool and (2) the percentage of loans that were already in default as of the current date. The above analysis was only used for first lien loans. For second lien loans,  Moody's assumes harsher default likelihood and did not utilize the above analysis.

## Calculating Loss Severity Using Forward-Looking Hpa Forecast

Moody's applied Updated LTVs and general assumptions regarding the costs of maintenance and liquidation (10% of the current home price),  interest (10%),  taxes and insurance (7%),  and gross proceeds
(70% of projected property value) to defaulted loans in order to calculate loan loss severities: Loss Severity = (Updated LTV - Net Proceeds) / Updated LTV,  where Net Proceeds = Gross Proceeds - Maintenance and Liquidation Costs - Interest Costs - Taxes and Insurance Expenses Although the above assumptions are based on historical data on home liquidation,  an increase in foreclosure sale and REO liquidation timelines along with higher discounts on liquidations may result in higher actual loss severities than expected.

**Corporate Default and Recovery Rates,  1920-2008**

The recovery data discussed above is based on debt trading prices 30 days after the default date.An alternative recovery measure is based on ultimate recoveries,  or the value creditors realize at the resolution of a default event.For example,  for issuers filing for bankruptcy,  the ultimate recoveries are the present values of the cash and/or securities that creditors actuallyreceive when these issuers exit bankruptcy,  typically 1-2 years following their initial default dates.

In Exhibit 8,  we present data on ultimate recovery rates for North American companies in Moody’s Ultimate Recovery Database.Last year,  Moody’s added 20 firms that either emerged from [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] or resolved their default events in 2008. The average “firm-wide”recovery rate for these 20 firms was   ,  below 2007’s   level,  but still well above the long-term average of   since 1987. As shown inExhibit 8,  the individual debts at these 20 firms,  in most cases,  enjoyed higherrecoveries in 2008 compared tohistorical averages.However,  among the10 of the 20 companies that defaulted in 2008 and also had their default events resolved in the same year,  debt holders of all priorities,  except senior unsecured bonds,  experienced weaker recovery rates compared to their 1987-2008 historical averages. Since there is a substantial time lag between anissuer’s default date and when its ultimaterecovery isknown,  these data are consistent with there also being a lag in the observed [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclicality]] of ultimate recovery rates and default rates.

1. Some of thesenumbers differ from last year’s report due to newdata being added to the Uitimate Recovery Database during 2008.
1. There were only two sr. sub bond defaults in 2008.

As highlighted above,  Moody’s and other academic researchers have found that annual corporate default rates are negatively correlated with annual average recovery rates as measured bypost-default trading prices. There is also a similar negative relationshipusing ultimate data.As shown inpanel Ain Exhibit 9,  a linear regression of annual average senior unsecured bond recovery rates on annual speculative-grade default rates yields an R-square value of 0.5.In panel B using firm-wide ultimate recoveries,  a similar negative correlation isalso observedwith anR-square of 0.4

**Exhibit 9**

Correlation between Default and Recovery Rates

Moody’s credit ratings are opinions of relative expected credit losses upon default,  which are functions of both the probability of default and severity of default (LGD). Exhibit 10 shows annual credit loss rates from 1982 to 2008 for Moody’s-rated corporate issuers. In 2008,  the rising default rate,  coupled with a higher loss severity rate,  led to an increase in the credit lossrate among Moody’s-rated issuers to   ,  compared to   in 2007. The average annual credit loss rate since 1982 is   (see underlying data in Exhibit 29)

**Default and Recovery Outlook for 2009**

**Default Rate Forecasts**

The ongoing banking crisis and global economic downtum makeit almost certain that default rates will continue to climb sharply during 20o9. The only outstanding questions are to what levels they will rise and how quickly.Because the impact of the current economic downturn on corporate debt issuers is likely to be more severe than for the two most recent credit cycles of the early 1990s and 2000s,  Moody’s expects that the speculative-grade default rate willexceed the peaks of   and   reached in those cycles,  respectively. Indeed,  the speculative-grade default rate could exceed the   record level set in 1933 when the speculative-grade market was solely a fallen angel market comprised exclusively of downgraded. investment-grade issuers.

Moody’s formal forecasting model,  the Credit Transition Model   ,  indicates that the global issuerweighted speculative-grade default rate willhit a peak of   in November. If this forecast materializes,  the speculative-grade default rate will almost quadruple from a level of.   at the endof 2008. In terms of the absolute numbers of the defaulters,  the model forecastimplies roughly 300 defaulters in 2009

Exhibit 11 shows the model’s baseline forecasts through 2009,  as well as the optimistic and pessimistic forecast scenarios. The baseline forecast assumes that the unemployment rate will increase to.   in the U.S. and   in Europe by year end.We note,  however,  that the high level of uncertainty surrounding the likely severity and length of the current global economic downturn imply similarlyhigh uncertainty around the point estimates of model-based forecasts of default rates.Moreover,  some of the model’s main drivers,  including the current record lowratings mix of Moody’s issuers and record high levels of high yield bond spreads,  are in ranges not seen in the historical data used to parameterize the model,  implying heightened model risk.

Exhibit 11
 ![500](502692e1577f88dfbc8a5309c7dc18d1d77c24cefa193020d68cd4e742f589c4.png)

The high level of the high yield bond spread,  which is a primary driver underlying the model’s forecasts for rising default rates in 2009,  beganincreasing in the second half of 2007 andreached a peak of approximatel 2,  000 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2008. Coincident with this increase in the high yield spread Moody’s Distressed Issuer index,  which shows the percentage of speculative-grade issuers with debts trading at spreads toTreasuries greater than 1. oo0 basis points,  also climbed sharply and now stands at   of speculative-grade issuers. Exhibit 12 shows the historical correlation between speculative-grade default rates,

**Corporate Default and Recovery Rates,  1920-2008**

high yield spreads,  and Moody’s Distressed Issuer index.The historical data suggest that movements in the high-yield spread often coincide with changes in thelevel of the speculative-grade default rate.During the last two credit cycles of 1990-91 and 2001-02,  high yield bond spreads peaked at roughly 1,  000 basis points,  and were associated with peak speculative-grade default rates of roughly   . If this historical relationship were to hold up in this cycle,  the recent peak of 2,  oo0 basis points in the high yield spread suggests that speculative-grade default rates could approach  

Exhibit 12

The currenthigh default rate forecast also stems from deteriorating credit quality andincreasing refunding risk for corporate issuers.As shown in Exhibit 13,  at the beginning of 2009,  the share of Caa-C issuers accounted for almost   of Moody’s speculative-grade issuers,  the highest level recorded since 1983. Moreover,  . roughly   of issuers currently rated Caa1 or below either have negative outlooks or are on watch for possible downgrades. In the current environment,  lowly rated issuers are particularly vulnerable to default if they need to refinance maturing debt or obtain forbearance from covenant violations..

Exhibit 13

**Corporate Default and Recovery Rates,  1920-2008**

In addition to deteriorating credit quality,  refunding risks are projected to increase over the next several years as more than one-half of current U.S. speculative-grade issuers have debts maturing in the next three years. As shown in Exhibit 14,  measured by dollar volume,  a total of   billion in debt is coming due over the next three years,  which more than doubles the refunding needs of   billion between 2008 and   .This increase in issuers’ refunding needs stems from maturing debt that was originated during the refinancing boom years of 2004-2007.Among Caa-C issuers,  almost one-half have at least some debt maturing from 2009 to 2011.

Exhibit 14

Across geographical regions,  the speculative default rate is expected to climb to   in the U.S. by year-end 2009,  while the European default rate is expected to rise more sharply to   .Driving this differential is the currently weaker ratings mix among European speculative-grade issuers relative to U.S. issuers.

Exhibit 15 shows the baseline one-year default rate forecasts across industries in both the U.S. and Europe. In the U.S.,  the consumer transportation industry,  comprised mostly of airline companies,  is expected to experience the highest default rate at over.   .In Europe,  the most troubled sectoris expected to be durable consumer goods

1. There is only one European issuer in the Consumer Service industry

Besides forecasting default rates,  the CTM can also forecast probabilities of upgrade and downgrade rates for all or any sub-group of Moody’s-rated issuers. The CTM is currently forecasting that rating downgrades will continue to outnumber rating upgrades in 2009. The upgrade-to-downgrade ratio is anticipated to decline. further to0.2in 2009 from 0.3 in 2008. Among investment-grade companies,            of issuers are expected to have their ratings downgraded toBa1 orbelow in the coming twelve months.On the otherhand,  only   of speculative-grade issuers are expected to become rising stars in 2009.

**Recovery Outlook**

As recovery rates are negatively correlated with default rates,  Moody’s expectsrecovery rates to decline in 2009 as default rates continue to increase.Moreover,  recoveries are likely to be below historical averages as aresult of strong loan issuance inrecent years.The increasing share of loans in issuers’liability structures implies less protection for loan investors because it entails a corresponding reduction in the share of total debt junior to the loans—which servesas a first-loss cushion for theloansin the event of default.For unsecured bond holders,  the increasing loan shares imply more debt senior to the bonds and,  therefore,  lower recovery rates on those bonds.Based on Moody’s current LGD assessments,  the average expectedrecovery rate across all U.S.first lien loans is   ,  which compares with ahistorical average of   from Moody’s ultimate recovery database. For senior unsecured bonds,  the average expected recovery rate is   which is also lower than historical average of   (see Exhibit 16). In light of the current economic slowdown,  we also present the LGD outlook under regularand stress-downturn scenarios where firm-wide recovery rates average   and   respectively. In the previous two credit cycles of1991 and 2001,  firm-wide recovery rates averaged roughly   . However,  the current downturn,  and its impact on firm-wide recovery rates,  could certainly be more severe than those associated with the previous two credit cycles.

**Rating Accuracy Metrics.**

Moody’s ratings have historically proven to be effective predictors of default. This is illustrated in Exhibit 17,  which plots the average and median ratings of roughly 1,  300 corporate issuers that defaulted from 1983 to 2008. The chart shows that Moody’s-rated issuers have,  on average,  been downgraded to the Ba3 level as early as fiveyears prior to default.Among issuers that defaulted in2008,  the average rating is Ba2fiveyears prior to default,  which is slightly higher than its comparable historical average. In the year prior to default,  2008. defaulters’ ratings were downgraded to B2 on average,  which is comparable to historical average since 1983

Exhibit 17
 ![500](7016775767f2e47f504b3e8a4b7f9a6132dc24c204ff1f68cbc0ce686ec22b1c.png)
As a valuable tool tomeasure credit risk,  ratings are expected to differentiate strong credits from weaker ones. In other words,  an effective rating system should not only assignlowratings to issuers that ultimately default but also assign high ratings to those that are remote to default.Ametric designed to measure this aspect of ratings performance is the cumulative accuracy profile(CAP) plot as shown in Exhibit 18. A rating system that possessed no predictive information about default risk would lie on the   line; the further the CAP curve

**Corporate Default and Recovery Rates,  1920-2008**

bows toward the northwest comer,  the betterit is at identifying defaults in the riskiest rating categories.Exhibi 18 shows that the CAP curvefor 2008liesbelow the one for the1983-2008period,  which indicates a worse performance in 2008relative to the historical average.The drop inrating performance in 2008is largely the result of several investment-grade defaults in the banking and financial sectors,  including Lehman Brothers,  Washington Mutual and three Icelandic banks.

Exhibit 18

Another way to measure rating performance is the accuracy ratio,  which is derived from the CAP curve.The accuracy ratio (AR) is the ratio of the area between the CAP curve and the   line,  to the maximum possible area above the   line. AR values range from minus one to positive one and a higher AR indicates better. rating accuracy. Exhibit 19 shows both oneand five-year horizon accuracy ratios for the period of 1983-2008. The graph suggests that the one-year accuracy ratiois positively correlated with the credit cycle: when defaults increase,  the accuracy ratio falls.At the five-year horizon this correlation is much less evident. In the short run,  the stability objective of Moody’s rating system dampens rating changes; at longer time horizons,  the stability objective is less of a constraint,  and accuracy increases.

**Guide to Data Tables and Charts**

In this section we briefly describe theinterpretation of some of the Exhibits contained in thisreport Methodological details are discussed in separate sections below.

Exhibit 11 presents Moody’s speculative-grade default rate forecast for 2009. The model generated point forecasts for each month are shown,  as well as forecasted optimistic and pessmistic bounds. The pessimistic and optimistic bounds represent positive and negative economic scenarios for the U.S. unemployment rate and highyield spread.

Exhibit 17 was derived bymapping Moody’sratings to a linear scale,  then taking the average and median values of the numerically mapped ratings

Exhibit 27 shows average senior unsecured recovery rates by letter rating and year prior to default.Each cell in the table indicates the average recovery rate on senior unsecured bonds with a specific rating within T years of default. For example,  the   two-year B recovery rate reported in Exhibit 27 indicates that the average recovery rate on B rated issues that default at some time within a two-year period,  not mean recovery rate for issuers rated B exactly two years before default Together with issuer-weighted average cumulative default. rates,  these multi-period recovery estimates are use to calculate cumulative expected credit loss rates,  as presented in Exhibit 28

Exhibits 38 through 42 show issuer-weighted historical average default rates by rating category over various investment horizons. These data were generated by averaging the multi-year default rates of cohorts formed at monthly intervals. In addition to being statements of historical fact,  these data are also useful proxies for expected default rates.For example,  over a five-year period a portfolio of B-rated issuers defaulted at a   average rate between1983 and 2008(see Exhibit 40).For an investor with a five-year exposure to a B-rated debt obligation or counterparty,  this estimate also happens to be the best estimate of the expected risk of default for a B-rated exposure based on the available historical data,  particularly over long investment horizons

Exhibit 46 shows average cumulative volume-weighted default rates by rating category. Whereas issuer-basec. default rates weight each issuer equally,  these data weight each issuer by the total volume of defaulted debt; larger defaults receive relatively more weight. Average default rates based on debt volume affected are less suitable estimates of expected default risk.One reason is that issuer default volumes vary considerably over time. On average,  a leveraged corporate issuer defaults on approximately   million of bonds. However that total can be very high (e.g.   billion for WorldCom). Issuer-based default rates receive particular. emphasis in the rating process because the expected likelihood of default of a debt issuer holding a given rating is expected be the sameregardlessof differencesin the nominalsizes of the exposures

Exhibit 47 shows the cumulative issuer-weighted historical default rates of cohorts formed at annual intervals between theyears 1970 and 2008(January 1of each year).These data are a subset of the data used to calculate the issuer-weighted averages shown in Exhibits 38 through 40(which,  again,  are based on cohorts formed at monthly time intervals).The default rates in Exhibit 47maybe useful for scenario analysis.For example,  if one believed that future default rates for a given pool of issuers will behave as they did in,  say,  1997,  then one can use the January 1,  1997 cohort cumulative default rates as proxies for expected default rates.
