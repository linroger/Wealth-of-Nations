# Temp MMF Guarantee 2008

FROM THE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE GROUP

## Executive Summary

The following is an Executive Summary of certain of the relevant provisions of the U.S. Treasury Department's Temporary Guarantee Program for [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|Money Market Funds]]. For more information please contact the Paul Hastings Attorneys below.

## Key Points

Eligibility - only **registered** open-end funds that have adopted a **policy** of maintaining a stable $1 net asset value or share price and that operate in **compliance with Rule 2a-7** are eligible to participate in the program. The Fund must make an election to participate in the Program by October 8,       2008. Only Funds with a market-based NAV of at least $0.995 as of September 19,  2008,  are eligible to participate in the Program.

Guarantee Events and Guarantee Amount - A Guarantee Event is the first day after September 19,  2008 (the "Agreement Date"),  on which the market-based NAV is less than $0.995 ("NAV Break" or "Guarantee Event"). Note: if an NAV Break is cured (the market-based NAV is brought to $0.995 or above without consideration of the Guarantee Payment) prior to the date the Board takes action to commence the liquidation of the Fund (as described below),  then no Guarantee Event is deemed to occur and no payment will be made under the Program. A Guarantee Cure Events notice must be delivered to the Treasury in such circumstances.

- The Guarantee Payment is available on a first-come first-served basis. Requests received by the Treasury from multiple funds on the same business day shall be honored on a pro-rata basis (based on the number of outstanding shares of each requesting fund) if they exceed the amount available under the Program. The Program limit is approximately $50 billion and the premium is not refunded if the Program limit is exhausted.
- The Guarantee Payment covers the following number of shares held by each shareholder of record as of September 19,  2008:
- the lesser of the
- (i) number of shares held on that date or
- (ii) the number of shares held on the date of the Guarantee Event.
- **Note,  if a** shareholder owns 100 shares as of September 19,  then sells 50,  then reacquires 25 shares before the Guarantee Event,  then 75 shares are covered even though 25 shares were acquired after the Agreement Date. However,  if the shareholder reduces his account to $0 after September 19,       then reacquires 75 shares before the Guarantee Event,       no shares are covered. Reduction of the account to $0 removes the account from coverage.
- The Guarantee Amount is $1 per share less
- (i) the amount of cash and other assets distributed by the Fund,  including amounts distributed as income or gain,  since the Guarantee Event,  and
- (ii) the amount of cash and other assets held by the Fund on the Payment Date (other than amounts held in reserve to meet disclosed liabilities) that are designated for distribution to shareholders upon liquidation of the Fund.

## Requirements Upon A Guarantee Event

- The Treasury must be informed of the occurrence of the Guarantee Event by midnight of the business day following the Guarantee Event. The Board must initiate action within 5 business days of the Guarantee Event to liquidate the Fund. The Treasury must receive written assurance that there is no legal impediment to the disbursement of the Guarantee Amount to the appropriate shareholders. The Investment Adviser must execute an acknowledgement and Undertaking. Payment of the Guarantee Amount will be made on the first business day after submission of the required Payment Request Notice. Payment is made to the Fund and must be held in a separate interest bearing account,  segregated from Fund assets,  pending disbursement to shareholders. The Guarantee Amount is NOT deemed to be Fund assets. Interest earned on the Guarantee Amount pending distribution shall be remitted to the Treasury.

Ramification of Exercise of the Guarantee:

- The Fund must be liquidated within 30 days,  unless an extension is granted by the Treasury. Upon the occurrence of a Guarantee Event,  the Board must initiate action to liquidate the Fund within 5 business days of the Guarantee Event. The Board must promptly cease the declaration and payment of dividends,  cease issuing new shares,  and suspend the right of redemption.

## Board Findings

- Before entering into the Guarantee Agreement,  the Board must make the following finding: "The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders to maintain a stable net asset value or share price and,  in light of that finding,  the Fund's investments and other affairs are to be managed in a manner that is designed to reduce the likelihood that a Guarantee Event will occur or,  if such an event does occur,  to reduce the amount of the Guarantee Payment that may be payable under the Guarantee Agreement (including,  as necessary,  giving consideration to obtaining and drawing upon credit support for the Fund's portfolio securities or other accommodations or undertakings designed to maintain the Fund's stable net asset value or share price)".
- Before entering into the Guarantee Agreement,  the Board (including a majority of the independent directors) must also make the following finding:
"The Board has determined that entering into the Guarantee Agreement and the Fund's fulfillment of its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders".

## Premium Payments

- 0.00010 multiplied by the Fund's outstanding shares as of September 19,  2008,  if the market-based NAV is greater than or equal to $0.9975 on September 19,  2008,  and
- 0.00015 multiplied by the Fund's outstanding shares as of September 19,  2008,  if the market-based NAV is less than $0.9975 but greater than $0.995 on September 19,  2008.

## Reports To Treasury

A Participating Fund must promptly report to Treasury by e-mail if the market-based NAV is less than $0.9975 on any given day ("Report Date") and shall provide Treasury and the SEC with a required Portfolio Schedule as of the Report Date. The Fund shall also provide the Treasury and the SEC with the same reports it provides to its Board concerning the extent of the deviation of the Fund NAV and its market-based NAV until the market-based NAV is $0.9975 or greater. If the Board is not provided with such a report in any week,  the Fund must nevertheless provide the Treasury and the SEC with such a report within two business days after the end of that week.

## Nav Support Agreements

Upon the occurrence of a Guarantee Event,  the Fund must demand payment of all amounts to which it is entitled under any NAV Support Agreement. If payment under such an agreement requires disposition of a particular security,  then the security shall be disposed of and payment demanded. No existing NAV Support Agreement may be amended,  terminated,  or withdrawn unless it is replaced by a new agreement which the Treasury has approved. Existing NAV Support Agreements must be renewed. A Fund without an NAV Support Agreement shall use its best efforts to obtain an NAV Support Agreement. If an NAV Support Agreement is provided by the Adviser or its affiliates,  then the Adviser or its affiliates will not amend,  terminate or withdraw such agreement without approval of the Board and the Treasury.

## Disclosure

The SEC expects Funds to disclose their participation in the Program. The Treasury has the right to require the Fund to modify or remove any disclosure regarding the Fund's participation in the Program if it deems it to be inaccurate or unacceptable. Fund must comply with 31 U.S.C. 333 and will not use any reference to the Dept of the Treasury to convey the impression that the Treasury has approved,  endorsed,  sponsored,  or authorized the Fund.

## Termination Date

The Program terminates on December 18,  2008. It may be extended by the Secretary of the Treasury in his sole discretion through September 18,  2009.

## Program Extensions

If the Program is extended,  only Funds participating in the Program at inception may elect to extend. A Fund can elect to extend only if:

- it has not been previously subject to a Guarantee Event,
- its market-based NAV as of the extension date is at least $0.995,
- the Board (including a majority of the independent directors) makes the following finding
- "The Fund's continued participation in the Program and the Fund's fulfillment of its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders",  and
- Appropriate extension notices are filed and the premium is paid.
- **Note: if a Fund elects not to** participate in one extension period,  it may not participate in future extension periods.

## Other Matters

The Guarantee Agreement also contains additional provisions relating to:

- The Fund's receipt of payments after receipt of the Guarantee Amount (such amounts to be forwarded to the Treasury),
- Assignment of rights (Fund assigns to the Treasury all rights to claims,  demands,  lawsuits and judgments with respect to its business or ownership of its assets,  including any rights against the investment adviser),
- Indemnification (the Adviser agrees to indemnify the Treasury and the SEC for claims arising out of any breach of a representation or warranty they made to the Adviser as to itself or the Fund in the Guarantee Agreements or accompanying certificates or any breach of a covenant or obligation of the Adviser in the Guarantee Agreement or certificates),
- Valuation of securities delivered to shareholders upon liquidation in-kind (market quotations,  or fair value if market quotations are not available),
- Omnibus Accounts (the Fund and the Adviser shall use their best efforts to assure that Guarantee Payments are disbursed to the appropriate beneficial owners. The Fund will provide the Treasury and the SEC,  upon request,  with a written plan to this effect),  and
- Mergers (agreement generally will move to the surviving fund if the surviving fund and the merging fund meet the eligibility criteria of the Program).

Funds determining to participate in the Program who wish to retain the confidentiality of the information submitted should file a Freedom of Information Act request with their submission.
