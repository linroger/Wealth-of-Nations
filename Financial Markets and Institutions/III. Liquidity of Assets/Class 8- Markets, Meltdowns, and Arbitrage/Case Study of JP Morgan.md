# Case Study of JP Morgan

Case Study of JP Morgan From a forthcoming book by Basel III: Proposals for a Better Banking Regime

JP Morgan counts undisputedly as one of the major winners in the crisis,  its reputation as a "rock" for the financial system staying virtually unscathed,  at least until May 2012. JP Morgan is the largest bank in the US with 259,  000 employees,  a diversified range of operations,  a strong capital base (stock holder equity of USD 204 bn at the end of 2012) and an exceptional ability to grow through external acquisitions. Total net revenue for 2012 reached 97 bn and net income USD 21 bn. Chase Manhattan bank is itself the result of the merger more than 1,  200 predecessor institutions,  including:

- J.P. Morgan (2000);
- Chemical bank which merged with Chase Manhattan in 1996 after it merged with Manufacturers Hanover (in New York City) in 1991;
- Bank One in 2004,  after it merged with First Chicago,  and National Bank of Detroit (in the Midwest) ;
- And more recently as a consequence of the subprime crisis,  Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; What distinguishes the losses of the Chief Investment Office (CIO) from other banks is not only that they involve one of the most highly regarded player,  but that they occur nearly four years after the events of 2008 and after a new regulation designed to stabilize the financial system was introduced. Rumors of major losses at the CIO in May 2012 caught the market's attention,  not just because of the magnitude of the losses,  but because this revealed an unexpected reality in one of the best run institutions at times of high skepticism on the value of banking. In the words of the New York Times editorial board "Recklessness,  tied to speculation in derivatives,  still pervades the banking system and still puts the public at risk. (…) JP Morgan saga is a reminder that big banks are too big to fail,  to manage,  to regulate and to prosecute"1.

## A Recognized Leader In Risk-Management

JP Morgan,  which counts among the strongest global banks,  is at the center of the US economy and played a pivotal role in the rescue of many failed institutions during the crisis,  either to structure a lending facility (AIG) when approached by the US Treasury,  or help the consolidation

1 New York Times 21 March 2013 to avoid the bankruptcy of one of its competitors and to stabilize the financial system (Bear Stearns,  Washington Mutual). JP Morgan itself has been a pioneer in many of the risk management tools including the development of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and offers advisory services in risk management to its clients. JP Morgan's approach to risk is best described with its own words "Generally speaking,  a robust risk management framework is based on five essential components: a strong corporate governance that diffuses a positive risk culture from the top to the bottom of the organisation,  a coherent and exhaustive set of policies and procedures,  the technological capability to extract data about the organisation's performance and the risk of its uncertain environment,  know-how in measuring this uncertainty,  and finally,  its ability to monitor risk on an ongoing basis in order to optimise the risk taking process."2 In contrast with all the failed institutions,  the success of JP Morgan could was providing an evidence of the benefits of banking when it was in the hands of a well-run,  prudent and welldiversified institution. This expertise,  widely recognized by the industry,  has won JP Morgan many awards including: - Derivatives House of the Year (Risk,  2012) - Equity Derivatives House of the Year (Risk,  2012) - Commodity and Energy Derivatives House of the Year (Risk,  2012) - Commodity Derivatives House of the Year (IFR,  2011) - Best Bank for Credit Derivatives and Credit Derivatives Research (Credit,  2011)

## Specificity Of The CIO

JP Morgan had established the CIO as a separate entity in 2005,  acting like a dedicated fund manager reporting directly to the senior management. As of December 31,  2011,  it had 428 employees,  consisting of 140 traders and 288 middle and back office 22 employees. The CIO's primary responsibility is to compensate some of the credit risk that JPMorgan faces as a lender and actively manage risk-weighted assets (RWA). But the CIO's responsibility is also to manage the excess between JPMorgan's deposits and loans and engage into long term investments with the objective of generating revenues at the Treasury level. At the end of 2012,  the size of the portfolio invested by the CIO amounted to about USD 360 billion (USD $1.1 trillion in deposits minus USD 700 billion in loans). These numbers are consistent with JP
Morgan's consolidated balance-sheet,  which exhibits an excess of deposits over loans:

| USD mn          | 2012      | 2011      |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Total assets    | 2,   359,   141 | 2,   265,   792 |
| Loans           | 733,   796   | 723,   720   |
| Deposits        | 1,   193,   593 | 1,   127,   806 |
| Excess deposits | 459,   797   | 404,   086   |

The CIO is separate from the Treasury and invests excess cash in Treasuries,  agencies,  mortgage-backed securities,  high quality securities,  corporate debt and other domestic and overseas assets 3. In 2006,  the CIO started trading synthetic credit derivatives,  which led to establishing the Synthetic Credit Portfolio (SCP). The SCP,  whose notional grew rapidly from USD 4 bn in 2008 to USD 51 bn in 20114 and where all the losses took place,  was a relatively small subset of the CIO's total portfolio. Most of CIO's other assets comprised of USD 323 bn of available-for-sale securities with an average rating of AA+,  as well as USD 175 bn in deposited at central banks,  all run quite conservatively.

1. The SCP is designed to protect,  in the words of J. Dimon,  "the company against a systemic event,  like the financial crisis or Eurozone *situation*"and "*generate modest returns in a benign* credit environment and more substantial returns in a stressed environment" 7.

The trades involved a credit default swap index based on the default risk of major U.S. corporations but the issue seems to be more aroundthe environment in which the transaction was executed,  which CEO Dimon described as "flawed,  complex,  poorly reviewed,  poorly executed,  and poorly monitored". The CIO manages a large volume of risk,  which exceeded the VaR in JPMorgan's investment bank in Q 1 and Q 2 2012. To compare,  the CIOs average VaR was $69 million in Q 4 2011 and $67 million in Q 1 20128,  where the investment bank's VaR was $57 million in Q 4 2011 and $63 million in Q 1 2012.

## Expansion Of The SCP Beyond Control

For most of 2011,  the SCP was positioned "short credit",  which means it would benefit in an environment where credit losses would occur,  reflecting the views on the economy (economic recession,  crisis in the Eurozone,  cut in public spending etc..). While these trading positions protected JP Morgan against a deterioration in the credit environment,  especially in the more risky segment (High Yield),  they also attracted a capital charge and added to the Group's RWA. At the end of 2011,  an improvement of economic conditions combined with a desire by the senior management to reduce RWA in response to the upcoming Basel 3 regulations,  the SCP was asked to reduce its "short credit" orientation and rebalance its portfolio to a more "neutral" position.

At the same time,  the management reiterated the importance of generating profit through the CIO trading activities,  especially after the completion of a few highly successful bets (on American Airline for example,  which netted USD 400 mn profit for a total of USD 453 mn for the year) using a relatively low cost default protection. Anticipating corporate defaults seemed like a low risk/low cost/high reward business and the CIO increased the purchase protection on specific names or indices to position the trading book to generate profit out of the situations it had identified. The profitability of the SCP was volatile at best and almost all the results in 2011 were driven by one single bet.

The SCP started implementing a rebalancing of the portfolio through the building of an Investment Grade exposure. Putting in place a "long" Investment Grade the "short" High Yield allowed to achieve a risk neutral position at the end of January 2012. It is unclear whether this superposition of risk helped reduce the RWA,  but it is certain that it added more risk to the portfolio instead. Why did not traders at the SCP simply cancel or significantly reduce the existing "short" High Yield position by purchasing long positions? It would have been more efficient from a pure risk standpoint,  but traders at the SCP believed in the benefits of the "short" positioning on the more risky credits to benefit from specific bankruptcies and generate profits. In the first quarter of 2012,  the "neutralization" translated into an increase of notional of the SCP from USD 51 bn to USD 157 bn 9. The size of the position achieved was clearly not standard for the market,  which operates in "clips" of USD 250 mn normally. Transactions of USD 500 mn are noticed and USD 1 bn clearly move the market and start to attract attention. These were quite rare,  until a counterparty accumulated very large positions,  trading several clips of USD 1 bn per day and raising suspicion it was trying to "corner" the market. Also,  the CIO had entered these positions in a short period of times,  with USD 40 bn in the month of March only,  which was starting to impact the overall trading conditions. These transactions did not come unnoticed and a number of experienced market participants started to question the identity of the trader soon to be nicknamed "the London whale" A story appeared in the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg unveiling the role of JP Morgan's CIO in these trades.

The is trend continued and while the portfolio may be qualified as "risk neutral" it was actually highly exposed to a convergence of the risk between High Yield and Investment Grade risks. To illustrate,  even if the portfolio appeared to neutralized at the end of 2011,  the High Yield and Investment Grade positions although they were symmetrical did not move at the same pace: - tightening of the High Yield: $575 million loss - widening of the Investment Grade $50 million in revenue Total $525 million loss By the end of February,    losses at the SCP had increased by $69 million 12. At the end of March 2012,  the mark-to-market loss on the portfolio was already at USD 718 mn. Further worsening of the situation and worsening rumors following articles by the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg left no other option to the management but to file an 8-K report containing information about the first quarter result on 13 April 2012 followed by a conference call.

In summary,  the decision to reduce risk in early 2012,  using the word of J. Dimon,  had "morphed into something that,  rather than protecting the firm,  created new and potentially larger risks" 13. The losses were not the result of rogue trading,  but rather transactions wrongly executed and raise serious questions of risk management and control of the CIO activity.

## Governance And Risk Management Failures

An report form the internal Task Force has identified three levels of failure:

- "CIO management had not properly understood and vetted the flawed trading strategy and appropriately *monitored its execution*"
- "CIO control functions - including the CIO Risk and Finance organizations - *were* performing well and were providing effective *oversight of CIO's trading strategy*"
- "the magnitude and significance of the changes in the Synthetic Credit Portfolio during the first quarter of 2012 including the increases in RWA,  *size,  complexity and riskiness of* the portfolio" 14 had not been fully appreciated.

According to Jamie Dimon,  CEO of JP Morgan: "CIO,  particularly the Synthetic Credit Portfolio,  should have gotten more scrutiny from both senior management,  and I include myself *in that,  * and the Firm-wide Risk control function… . . Make sure *that people on risk committees are* always asking questions,  sharing information,  and that you have very,  very granular limits *when* you're taking risk… . . In the rest of the company we have *those disciplines in place. We didn't* have it here."
 The losses have led to a comprehensive discussion and disclosures by JP Morgan on the failures in conception,  execution of the trading strategy and escalation of the issues 16. But execution and misreading of the market solely would not have produced these effects if the risk control procedures had been more prominent at the CIO,  as it was in other areas of the bank. In reality,  the controls and oversight of CIO in 2012 seemed weak when compared to the importance and complexity of its activities: 1- *Organizational issues at the CIO Risk Management*: CIO Risk Management lacked the personnel and structure necessary to manage the risks of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio. With respect to personnel,  a new CIO Chief Risk Officer was appointed in early 2012,  and he was learning the role at the precise time the traders were building the ultimately problematic positions. More broadly,  the CIO Risk function had been historically understaffed,  and some of the CIO risk personnel lacked the requisite skills. With respect to structural issues,  the CIO Risk Committee met only infrequently,  and its regular attendees did not include personnel from outside CIO.

2- *Risk modeling*: The SCP breached the VaR limits more than 330 times between January and April 201217,  but these alerts did not stop the increase of risk. As early as February,  the loss using the Comprehensive Risk Measure was estimated at USD 6.3 bn 18. Worse still,  traders considered the risk measurement as flawed and challenged the results which they claim overstated the risk. Traders eventually obtained the replacement with a new CIO VaR model for the SCP,  whose effect was to "immediately lower (ing) the SCP VaR by 50%"19. The old model reported USD 129 mn or more in per day was at risk during the first quarter of 2012 when the new model estimate was now USD 67 mn. The risk at the CIO also seems high when compared to JP Morgan's CIB in 2012:

## Lessons To Be Drawn From This Case Study

These losses may have harmed JP Morgan's reputation,  but have never threatened its existence. Ironically,  the "London whale" episode has affected the wider banking industry more than JP Morgan itself and gave ammunitions to supporters of the separation of banking activities and strengthening of the Volcker rule to reopen the debates. Having traders deciding on the right model to value the risk,  converting a department in charge of investing excess deposits and failing to report losses accurately are very severe shortcomings and a reminder that risk remains present in even the strongest banks.

## Appendix - Conclusion From The Task Force

“The Task Force has identified six factors that it believes may have led to less rigorous scrutiny for CIO.

- First,  CIO and the Synthetic Credit Portfolio had largely performed very well in the past. Neither had a history of significant losses and,  as Mr. Dimon has explained,  there “was a little bit of complacency about what was taking place [in CIO] and maybe overconfidence.” Moreover,  CIO EMEA Credit – the unit in which the Synthetic Credit Portfolio was located – had not previously experienced major control issues. In particular,  CIO EMEA Credit received “Satisfactory” ratings in prior audits. Nevertheless,  senior Firm management did not take sufficient steps to confirm the belief that CIO was subject to appropriate oversight and risk limits,  nor did they confirm how the Firm-wide Risk organization was monitoring and overseeing CIO’s activities.
- Second,  CIO is not a client-facing business and does not involve the host of regulatory,  risk and other limits applicable to dealings between the lines of business and their clients,  which require more attention from various control functions,  including compliance,  audit,  legal and finance. There was no meaningful effort to ensure that,  notwithstanding this fact,  CIO was subject to appropriately rigorous risk and other limits and was updating those limits on a regular basis.
- Third,  the more conservative nature of the majority of CIO’s portfolio,  as well as its overall mandate to invest the Firm’s investment portfolio in “top of the capital structure” instruments,  may have suggested to senior Firm management that CIO did not present significant risks.
- Fourth,  the large size of CIO’s overall portfolio may explain the lack of an aggressive reaction of numerous people,  including senior Firm management,  to the relative size of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio. When coupled with representations of CIO traders and management that the Synthetic Credit Portfolio was “balanced” (as well as the fact that CIO could hold the positions for a long period),  the notional numbers that were being discussed at the time were large but not alarming. But,  the growth in the notional size of the Synthetic Credit Portfolio during the first quarter of 2012 should have prompted additional scrutiny by the Risk organization (at both the Firm and CIO level) into both the trading strategies that had caused this growth and the proposed exit strategy.
- Fifth,  the implementation of a new model that significantly reduced CIO’s VaR likely distracted focus from the increase in VaR that occurred in January 2012. Absent the new model,  or if VaR limits had been promptly adjusted downward following the implementation of the new model,  breaches of the CIO Global 10-Q VaR limit would have continued,  and could have triggered a more rigorous analysis by Risk Management personnel both inside and outside CIO – potentially leading to earlier discovery of the risks in the Synthetic Credit Portfolio and modification or termination of the trading strategies that persisted through late March. Sixth,  the CIO Risk organization did not mature into the type of robust and independent function that is needed for trading activities that involve significant risk. The CIO Risk function was not staffed with as many experienced or strong personnel as it should have been. The Firmwide Risk organization bears responsibility for not having built,  over time,  a strong,  independent Risk function within CIO. This failure meant that notwithstanding the new Chief Risk Officer’s efforts beginning in early 2012 to improve controls and oversight,  the necessary infrastructure was not in place when the need arose and the CIO Risk function was tested.
- CIO management also bears responsibility for this weakness in the CIO Risk function. The CIO Risk function had also been understaffed for some time,  and CIO management,  rather than the Risk function,  had been the driving force behind the hiring of at least some of the risk personnel. Although CIO had long-tenured Risk personnel in less senior positions (such as Mr. Weiland),  they appear not to have been expected,  encouraged or supported sufficiently by CIO management or by the Firm-wide Risk organization to stand up forcefully to the CIO front office and to vigorously question and challenge investment strategies within CIO. Rather,  at Further,  the CIO Risk Committee met only three times in 2011. There was no official membership or charter for the CIO Risk Committee and attendees typically included only personnel from CIO,  such as the regional Chief Financial Officers and Chief Investment Officers,  the Chief Risk Officer,  the Chief Operating Officer,  the Global Chief Financial Officer,  and Ms. Drew. Although Mr. Zubrow regularly was invited to attend CIO Risk Committee meetings,  he typically did not do so,  in contrast with his frequent participation in Investment Bank Risk Committee meetings. Had there been senior traders or risk managers from outside CIO or had the CIO Risk Committee met more often,  the process might have been used to more pointedly vet the traders’ strategies in the first quarter of 2012. As it was,  the Committee was too slow to recognize the need to put in place risk limits specific to the Synthetic Credit Portfolio or an updated limit structure for CIO as a whole.”
