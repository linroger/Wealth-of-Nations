## The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) Process

### What it is: Deeper Dive

The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process stands as a fundamental concept in the study of **stochastic processes**, which are mathematical models for systems evolving randomly over time. Its defining characteristic is **mean reversion**, a property that makes it particularly suitable for modeling real-world phenomena where values tend to fluctuate around a central equilibrium or average level. Imagine an object tethered by a spring: random forces might push it away from its resting position, but the spring constantly pulls it back. The OU process captures this dynamic mathematically.

It was initially conceived by Leonard Ornstein and George Uhlenbeck in the 1930s to provide a more realistic model for the velocity of a massive particle undergoing Brownian motion, incorporating the effect of friction (drag) which prevents the velocity from increasing indefinitely. Unlike standard Brownian motion (a random walk), which can drift infinitely far from its starting point, the OU process exhibits a "memory" of its central tendency, `μ`. This inherent stability makes it invaluable in diverse fields:

- **Finance:** Modeling short-term interest rates (which tend to revert to a long-run average set by monetary policy), volatility smiles, or pairs trading strategies where the spread between two related assets is expected to revert to zero.
    
- **Physics:** Beyond particle velocity, it can model systems subject to damping forces and random excitation, like a damped harmonic oscillator.
    
- **Biology:** Modeling neuronal membrane potentials, which fluctuate due to synaptic input but revert towards a resting potential, or population dynamics with carrying capacities.
    
- **Engineering:** Modeling noise in control systems or the temperature of a system subject to random heat exchange but regulated towards a set point.
    

The mathematical heart of the OU process is its Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):

```
dX(t) = θ(μ - X(t)) dt + σ dW(t)
```

Let's break down the components further:

- `X(t)`: Represents the state (e.g., velocity, interest rate, temperature) of the system at a given time `t`.
    
- `μ`: The **long-term mean** or equilibrium level. This is the value the process would eventually settle at if the random noise were absent. It acts as the center of gravity for the process's fluctuations.
    
- `θ`: The **rate (or speed) of mean reversion**. This crucial parameter (`θ > 0`) dictates how strongly the process is pulled back towards `μ`. A larger `θ` implies a stronger pull and faster reversion; deviations from the mean are corrected more quickly. Conversely, a smaller `θ` means the process reverts more slowly and can wander further from the mean for longer periods. The quantity `1/θ` is often called the **characteristic time** or **relaxation time**, representing the typical timescale over which deviations decay.
    
- `σ`: The **volatility** or diffusion coefficient (`σ > 0`). This parameter quantifies the intensity of the random "kicks" the process receives. A larger `σ` leads to more pronounced, larger-amplitude random fluctuations around the mean.
    
- `dW(t)`: An increment of a **Wiener process** (standard Brownian motion). This is the engine of randomness. Over an infinitesimal time interval `dt`, `dW(t)` behaves like a random variable drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance `dt`. It represents the cumulative effect of many small, independent random shocks.
    
- `dt`: An infinitesimal increment in time, representing the timescale over which changes are considered.
    

The SDE elegantly combines deterministic and stochastic elements:

1. **Drift Term:** `θ(μ - X(t)) dt`. This is the deterministic "pull-back" component. Its magnitude is proportional to the current deviation `(μ - X(t))` from the mean and the reversion speed `θ`. If `X(t)` is above `μ`, the term is negative, pushing the process down. If `X(t)` is below `μ`, the term is positive, pushing it up. This is the mathematical embodiment of mean reversion.
    
2. **Diffusion Term:** `σ dW(t)`. This is the stochastic "random kick" component. It introduces unpredictable fluctuations, scaled by the volatility `σ`. This term ensures the process doesn't simply decay exponentially to `μ` but continues to explore values around it.
    

### Analytical Derivation (Solving the SDE) Explained

Solving the OU SDE provides an explicit formula for `X(t)`, revealing its structure. We employ the integrating factor method, a standard technique for linear differential equations, adapted for the stochastic context using the rules of Itô calculus.

1. Rearrange the SDE: Group terms involving X(t) on one side:
    
    dX(t) + θX(t) dt = θμ dt + σ dW(t)
    
    This form highlights the linear structure dX + (function of t)X dt = (other terms).
    
2. **Determine the integrating factor:** For a term like `dX + θX dt`, the integrating factor is `exp(∫ θ ds) = e^(θt)`. Multiplying by this factor aims to make the left-hand side a perfect differential.
    
3. Multiply the SDE by e^(θt): Apply the factor to all terms:
    
    e^(θt) dX(t) + θe^(θt)X(t) dt = θμe^(θt) dt + σe^(θt) dW(t)
    
4. Apply Itô's Product Rule (or recognize the pattern): The crucial step is recognizing that the left side corresponds to the differential of the product e^(θt)X(t). According to Itô's rule for d(f(t, X(t))), where f(t, x) = e^(θt)x, we have df = (∂f/∂t)dt + (∂f/∂x)dX + (1/2)(∂²f/∂x²) (dX)². Here, ∂f/∂t = θe^(θt)x, ∂f/∂x = e^(θt), and ∂²f/∂x² = 0. So, d(e^(θt)X(t)) = (θe^(θt)X(t)) dt + e^(θt) dX(t). This precisely matches the left-hand side.
    
    Thus, the equation simplifies to:
    
    d(e^(θt)X(t)) = θμe^(θt) dt + σe^(θt) dW(t)
    
5. Integrate both sides from an initial time s to a later time t (t > s): The integral of a differential is the difference in the function's values at the endpoints. The right side involves a standard Riemann integral and a stochastic Itô integral.
    
    ∫[s, t] d(e^(θu)X(u)) = ∫[s, t] θμe^(θu) du + ∫[s, t] σe^(θu) dW(u)
    
    e^(θt)X(t) - e^(θs)X(s) = θμ [e^(θu)/θ]_s^t + σ ∫[s, t] e^(θu) dW(u)
    
    e^(θt)X(t) - e^(θs)X(s) = μ(e^(θt) - e^(θs)) + σ ∫[s, t] e^(θu) dW(u)
    
6. Solve for X(t): Isolate X(t) by multiplying the entire equation by e^(-θt):
    
    X(t) = e^(-θ(t-s))X(s) + μ(e^(-θt)e^(θt) - e^(-θt)e^(θs)) + σ e^(-θt) ∫[s, t] e^(θu) dW(u)
    
    X(t) = e^(-θ(t-s))X(s) + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-s))) + σ ∫[s, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)
    
    Often, we start the process at time s = 0:
    
    X(t) = e^(-θt)X(0) + μ(1 - e^(-θt)) + σ ∫[0, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)
    

This **analytical solution** is highly informative. It shows that `X(t)` is composed of three parts:

- `e^(-θt)X(0)`: The influence of the initial condition `X(0)`, decaying exponentially over time with a rate `θ`.
    
- `μ(1 - e^(-θt))`: The growing influence of the long-term mean `μ`. As time progresses (`t → ∞`), this term approaches `μ`.
    
- `σ ∫[0, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)`: The accumulated effect of random noise up to time `t`. Notice the term `e^(-θ(t-u))` acts as a weighting factor: more recent noise increments (`u` close to `t`) have a larger impact than noise from the distant past (`u` close to 0), reflecting the decaying memory of the process.
    

### Properties Explored

The analytical solution and the SDE reveal several key properties:

1. **Mean Reversion:** As already emphasized, the drift term `θ(μ - X(t))` inherently drives the process towards `μ`. This property is crucial for modeling phenomena that don't exhibit unbounded growth or decay but rather fluctuate around a stable average. It ensures the process has a finite long-term variance.
    
2. **Markov Property:** The future state `X(t+Δt)` depends only on the current state `X(t)` and the intervening random shock `dW`, not on the path taken to reach `X(t)`. This "memoryless" property (beyond the current state) simplifies analysis and simulation, as we don't need to track the entire history of the process. It stems directly from the SDE formulation where `dX(t)` depends only on `X(t)` and `dW(t)`.
    
3. **Gaussian Process:** Because `X(t)` is constructed as a linear combination of the (potentially random, but often assumed deterministic or Gaussian) initial state `X(0)` and the Itô integral (which represents a sum of Gaussian increments `dW`), `X(t)` itself follows a Gaussian (Normal) distribution for any fixed `t`. Furthermore, the joint distribution of the process values at multiple time points, `(X(t₁), X(t₂), ..., X(tₙ))`, is multivariate Gaussian. This Gaussian nature is extremely convenient, allowing for analytical tractability of moments, transition probabilities, and likelihood functions used in parameter estimation.
    
4. **`Moments (Conditional on a deterministic X(0)):`** These describe the average behavior and spread of the process over time, starting from a known point.
    
    - Mean: E[X(t) | X(0)] = e^(-θt)X(0) + μ(1 - e^(-θt))
        
        This shows the expected value starts at X(0) and exponentially transitions towards the long-term mean μ. The speed of this transition is governed by θ. For large θ, convergence is rapid; for small θ, it's slow.
        
    - Variance: Var[X(t) | X(0)] = (σ² / (2θ)) * (1 - e^(-2θt))
        
        The variance starts at 0 (since X(0) is fixed) and increases over time, asymptotically approaching a maximum value, the stationary variance, σ² / (2θ). This contrasts sharply with Brownian motion, whose variance σ²t grows linearly without bound. The bounded variance is a direct consequence of mean reversion. The rate at which the variance approaches its stationary value also depends on θ.
        
5. **Stationary Distribution:** As `t → ∞`, the influence of the specific initial state `X(0)` decays away (`e^(-θt) → 0`), and the process settles into a statistical equilibrium. The distribution of `X(t)` converges to a **stationary distribution**, which is invariant over time. If the process starts with `X(0)` drawn from this distribution, its distribution remains unchanged for all `t > 0`. This long-term equilibrium distribution is Normal (Gaussian) with:
    
    - Mean: `μ`
        
    - Variance: σ² / (2θ)
        
        The existence of this stable, time-invariant distribution is a hallmark of ergodic, mean-reverting processes and represents the long-run statistical behavior.
        
6. Autocovariance (in stationary state): This measures the correlation between the process's value at two different times, s and t (assume s < t), once it has reached stationarity.
    
    Cov(X(t), X(s)) = E[(X(t) - μ)(X(s) - μ)] = (σ² / (2θ)) * e^(-θ(t-s))
    
    The covariance depends only on the time lag τ = t-s and decays exponentially as the lag increases. A larger θ leads to faster decay, indicating that the process has a shorter "memory" – its value at time t is less correlated with its value at earlier times. A smaller θ implies slower decay and higher persistence. The autocorrelation function is Corr(X(t), X(s)) = e^(-θ(t-s)).
    

### Parameters Recap and Impact

The three parameters `μ`, `θ`, and `σ` fully define the univariate OU process and control its behavior:

- `μ` (Long-term mean): Determines the central level around which the process fluctuates. Changing `μ` shifts the entire process vertically without altering the nature of the fluctuations.
    
- `θ` (Mean reversion speed): Controls how quickly the process returns to `μ` after a deviation. High `θ` results in paths that oscillate rapidly and tightly around `μ`. Low `θ` results in paths that wander more slowly and can exhibit longer excursions away from `μ`, resembling a random walk over short timescales but eventually returning.
    
- `σ` (Volatility): Governs the amplitude of the random noise. High `σ` produces highly jagged, noisy paths with large fluctuations. Low `σ` results in smoother paths with smaller deviations from the mean-driven trajectory.
    

Visualizing sample paths with different parameter combinations helps build intuition about their respective roles.

### Behavior Summary

An OU process path exhibits random fluctuations around its mean `μ`. When the process deviates far from `μ`, the deterministic drift term dominates, pulling it back strongly. When close to `μ`, the random diffusion term becomes more influential, causing local jitter. While random shocks can cause temporary overshooting of the mean, the mean-reverting tendency ensures long-term stability and bounded variance. The interplay between `θ` and `σ` determines the character of the fluctuations – whether they are rapid and small or slow and large.

### Multivariate OU Process Insights

The generalization to `n` dimensions allows modeling complex systems where multiple variables interact:

`d**X**(t) = **Θ**( **μ** - **X**(t) ) dt + **Σ** d**W**(t)`

- **X**(t), **μ**, **W**(t): Now n-dimensional vectors.
    
- **Θ** (Mean reversion matrix): An `n x n` matrix. Its diagonal elements `Θᵢᵢ` relate to the own mean-reversion speed of component `Xᵢ(t)` towards `μᵢ`. Off-diagonal elements `Θᵢⱼ` (for `i ≠ j`) represent **cross-reversion effects**: how the deviation of `Xⱼ(t)` from `μⱼ` influences the drift of `Xᵢ(t)`. For example, in an ecosystem model, a large predator population (`X₁`) above its mean might negatively impact the drift of the prey population (`X₂`). The stability of the multivariate system depends on the eigenvalues of **Θ**; typically, all eigenvalues must have positive real parts for the system to be stable and possess a stationary distribution.
    
- **Σ** (Diffusion matrix): An `n x n` matrix determining the noise structure. The matrix `**C** = **ΣΣ**^T` is the instantaneous covariance matrix of the noise term. Diagonal elements of **C** relate to the individual volatilities of each component `Xᵢ(t)`. Off-diagonal elements represent instantaneous correlations between the noise driving different components. For instance, random shocks affecting two related stock prices might be positively correlated, which would be captured by off-diagonal terms in **C** (and thus implicitly in **Σ**).
    

The multivariate OU process provides a flexible framework for modeling linear stochastic systems with equilibrium tendencies and correlated noise, finding applications in areas like econometrics (vector autoregressions with error correction), neuroscience (networks of neurons), and engineering (multi-input multi-output control systems).

## Conditional and Unconditional Densities: A Closer Look

Understanding the evolution of stochastic processes like the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, `X(t)`, hinges on characterizing the probability of finding the process in a particular state at a given time. Two key concepts are central to this characterization:

1. **Conditional Probability Density Function (PDF):** `p(x, t | x₀, t₀)`
    
    - This function, often called the **transition density**, quantifies the likelihood (per unit state `x`) of the process being at state `x` precisely at time `t`, _given the knowledge_ that it started at a specific state `x₀` at an earlier time `t₀` (where `t > t₀`). Think of it as a probabilistic forecast: "Knowing the temperature was `x₀` degrees at time `t₀`, what is the probability density of it being `x` degrees at time `t`?"
        
    - It fully describes the _dynamics_ of how the probability distribution evolves from a single point (`x₀` at `t₀`). For Markov processes, like the OU process, the entire future probabilistic evolution depends _only_ on this current state (`x₀, t₀`), not on the path taken to reach it. This "memoryless" property is mathematically captured by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, which relates transition densities over different time intervals: `p(x, t | x₀, t₀) = ∫ p(x, t | y, s) p(y, s | x₀, t₀) dy` for `t₀ < s < t`.
        
    - This conditional density is fundamental for tasks like simulation (predicting the next state given the current one) and parameter estimation using maximum likelihood methods (calculating the likelihood of observing a sequence of states).
        
2. **Unconditional Probability Density Function (PDF):** `p(x, t)`
    
    - This function describes the probability density of finding the process at state `x` at time `t`, _without_ reference to a specific starting point in the past. It represents the overall distribution of the process across its state space at time `t`. Imagine observing many independent realizations of the process; `p(x, t)` describes the histogram of their states at time `t`.
        
    - Its relationship to the conditional density highlights how the overall distribution is formed from all possible starting points. If we know the distribution of starting states `p(x₀, t₀)` at time `t₀`, we can find the distribution at time `t` by summing (integrating) the probabilities of transitioning from each possible `x₀` to `x`, weighted by the initial probability of being at `x₀`: `p(x, t) = ∫ p(x, t | x₀, t₀) p(x₀, t₀) dx₀`
        
    - Often, analysis starts assuming a known initial condition at `t₀ = 0`. This could be a fixed point, `X(0) = x₀`, where `p(x₀, 0)` is a Dirac delta function `δ(x₀ - x_{start})`, or it could be a distribution representing initial uncertainty. The unconditional density `p(x, t)` then describes how this initial distribution spreads out and evolves over time under the process dynamics.
        

## Densities for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process: Derivation and Interpretation

To find these densities for the OU process, we leverage its analytical solution, previously derived: `X(t) = e^(-θ(t-s))X(s) + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-s))) + σ ∫[s, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)`

Let's set `t₀ = s` and condition on the starting state `X(s) = x₀`. Our goal is the conditional density `p(x, t | x₀, t₀)`.

The structure of the solution is key: `X(t)` given `x₀` is the sum of a deterministic term (which depends linearly on `x₀`) and a stochastic Itô integral term. The Itô integral `∫ H(u) dW(u)` represents a limit of sums of Gaussian increments `dW(u)`(scaled by `H(u)`). As sums of Gaussian variables are themselves Gaussian, the Itô integral follows a normal distribution with mean 0. Consequently, `X(t)` given `x₀` must also be normally distributed. To define this normal distribution, we only need its mean and variance.

- **Conditional Mean:** (The expected location at time `t` given `x₀` at `t₀`) `E[X(t) | X(t₀)=x₀] = E[e^(-θ(t-t₀))x₀ + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-t₀))) + σ ∫[t₀, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)]` Since the expectation of the Itô integral is zero:`E[X(t) | x₀, t₀] = e^(-θ(t-t₀))x₀ + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-t₀)))` _Interpretation:_ The expected future value is a weighted average of the initial state `x₀` and the long-term mean `μ`. The weight `e^(-θ(t-t₀))` on the initial state decays exponentially as time `t` progresses (or as the time lag `t-t₀` increases), while the weight `(1 - e^(-θ(t-t₀)))` on the long-term mean grows correspondingly. The speed of this shift in influence is determined by `θ`.
    
- **Conditional Variance:** (The uncertainty or spread around the conditional mean) `Var[X(t) | X(t₀)=x₀] = Var[e^(-θ(t-t₀))x₀ + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-t₀))) + σ ∫[t₀, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)]` Since the first two terms are deterministic given `x₀`, the variance comes solely from the stochastic integral: `Var[X(t) | x₀, t₀] = Var[σ ∫[t₀, t] e^(-θ(t-u)) dW(u)]` Using Itô isometry (`Var[∫ H dW] = E[∫ H² dt]`): `Var[X(t) | x₀, t₀] = σ² E[∫[t₀, t] (e^(-θ(t-u)))² du] = σ² ∫[t₀, t] e^(-2θ(t-u)) du` Evaluating the integral (as shown previously via substitution `v = t-u`): `Var[X(t) | x₀, t₀] = (σ² / (2θ)) * (1 - e^(-2θ(t-t₀)))` _Interpretation:_ The variance starts at 0 at `t=t₀` (since `x₀` is known) and increases over time, asymptotically approaching the stationary variance `σ² / (2θ)`. This reflects the accumulation of uncertainty due to the random shocks `dW(u)`, but the mean reversion prevents the variance from growing indefinitely. The rate of approach to the asymptotic variance is governed by `2θ`.
    

**`Conditional Density p(x, t | x₀, t₀):`** Knowing `X(t)` given `(x₀, t₀)` follows `N(Mean, Var)`, its PDF is the standard Gaussian formula: `p(x, t | x₀, t₀) = (1 / sqrt(2π * Var)) * exp(-(x - Mean)² / (2 * Var))` where:`Mean = e^(-θ(t-t₀))x₀ + μ(1 - e^(-θ(t-t₀)))` `Var = (σ² / (2θ)) * (1 - e^(-2θ(t-t₀)))`

This transition density describes how a sharp probability spike at `x₀` at time `t₀` spreads out into a Gaussian bell curve whose center (Mean) drifts from `x₀` towards `μ` and whose width (sqrt(Var)) increases towards `sqrt(σ² / (2θ))` as time `t`progresses.

## Stationary Density and Mean Reverting Processes: Equilibrium and Stability

- **Mean Reverting Process:** The concept of mean reversion is fundamental to modeling systems that exhibit stability or are subject to restoring forces. A process `X(t)` is mean-reverting if its drift pulls it towards a long-term level `μ`. In the OU SDE `dX(t) = θ(μ - X(t)) dt + σ dW(t)`, the term `θ(μ - X(t))` explicitly implements this: if `X(t)` is above `μ`, the drift is negative, and vice-versa. This contrasts sharply with processes like Brownian motion (`dX = σ dW`) or Brownian motion with drift (`dX = δ dt + σ dW`), where the absence of such a restoring force allows the process variance to grow without bound. Mean reversion implies predictability over longer horizons (the process is likely to be near `μ`) and is characteristic of many economic variables (e.g., inflation rates, interest rates relative to a target) and physical systems (e.g., temperature under thermostatic control).
    
- **`Stationary Density p_s(x):`** For stable (`θ > 0`) OU processes, the system eventually "forgets" its precise initial condition and settles into a state of **statistical equilibrium**. In this state, the overall probability distribution `p(x, t)` no longer changes with time; it becomes the **stationary distribution**, characterized by the **stationary density**`p_s(x)`. This happens because the tendency of the drift to pull the process towards `μ` (concentrating the distribution) eventually balances the tendency of the diffusion term to spread the distribution out.
    
    - The condition for stationarity is that the time derivative of the probability density is zero, `∂p/∂t = 0`. This is used in the context of the **Fokker-Planck equation**, which is a partial differential equation describing the time evolution of the probability density `p(x, t)` for a process defined by an SDE. Setting `∂p/∂t = 0` in the Fokker-Planck equation for the OU process yields an ordinary differential equation whose solution is `p_s(x)`.
        
    - Alternatively, as shown previously, we can find `p_s(x)` by considering the limit of the conditional (transition) density as the time elapsed `τ = t - t₀ → ∞`. The conditional mean converges to `μ`, and the conditional variance converges to `σ² / (2θ)`.
        
    - Thus, the **`stationary density p_s(x) for the OU process`** is the PDF of a Normal distribution `N(μ, σ² / (2θ))`: `p_s(x) = (1 / sqrt(2π * (σ² / (2θ)))) * exp(-(x - μ)² / (2 * (σ² / (2θ))))` `p_s(x) = sqrt(θ / (πσ²)) * exp(-θ(x - μ)² / σ²)`
        
    - _Significance:_ `p_s(x)` tells us the long-term probability of finding the process in any given region of its state space. It describes the typical fluctuations and where the process spends most of its time in equilibrium. For ergodic processes like OU, time averages calculated over a single long trajectory will converge to the ensemble averages calculated using `p_s(x)`.
        

## Analytical Derivation of a Simple Random Walk with Drift (Continuous Time)

Often considered the simplest non-trivial continuous-time stochastic process, **Brownian Motion with Drift** models phenomena with a constant average trend (`δ`) superimposed on random fluctuations (`σ dW(t)`). Its SDE is:

`dX(t) = δ dt + σ dW(t)`

Where:

- `X(t)`: State variable (e.g., position, log-price).
    
- `δ`: The constant drift rate, representing the average change in `X` per unit time.
    
- `σ`: The constant volatility, scaling the magnitude of random shocks.
    
- `dW(t)`: Increment of a standard Wiener process (source of randomness).
    

The solution is obtained by direct integration, as the coefficients `δ` and `σ` do not depend on `X(t)`.

1. **Integrate the SDE** from time 0 to `t`: `∫[0, t] dX(s) = ∫[0, t] δ ds + ∫[0, t] σ dW(s)`
    
2. **Evaluate the integrals:** The integral of `dX` is the net change in `X`. The integral of `δ` is `δ` times the interval length. The integral of `σ dW` is `σ` times the net change in the Wiener process `W(t)`.
    
    - `∫[0, t] dX(s) = X(t) - X(0)`
        
    - `∫[0, t] δ ds = δt`
        
    - `∫[0, t] σ dW(s) = σ (W(t) - W(0))`
        
3. **Combine:** `X(t) - X(0) = δt + σ (W(t) - W(0))`
    
4. **`Assume W(0) = 0`** (standard definition): `X(t) = X(0) + δt + σ W(t)`
    

This is the **analytical solution**. It clearly shows `X(t)` is the initial position plus a linear deterministic trend plus scaled Brownian motion.

**Properties and Implications:**

- **Distribution:** Since `W(t) ~ N(0, t)`, `X(t)` is normally distributed: `X(t) ~ N(X(0) + δt, σ²t)`.
    
- **Mean:** `E[X(t)] = X(0) + δt`. The expected value follows the deterministic drift.
    
- **Variance:** `Var[X(t)] = σ² t` (assuming deterministic `X(0)`). The variance grows linearly with time _without bound_. This is a crucial difference from the OU process.
    
    - _Implication:_ The uncertainty about the process's position continually increases. The process can, and eventually will, wander arbitrarily far from its starting point. This makes it suitable for modeling phenomena like stock prices (in log terms, under the geometric Brownian motion model) where there isn't necessarily a strong pull back to a specific level.
        
- **No Stationary Distribution:** Because the variance grows indefinitely, the distribution `p(x, t)` never settles down; it just keeps spreading out. Therefore, Brownian motion (with or without drift, unless `σ=0`) does not possess a stationary distribution over the infinite real line.
    
- **Not Mean-Reverting:** There is no drift term pulling the process back towards any specific level `μ`. The process follows its drift `δ` on average but is free to diffuse arbitrarily far away due to the `σ dW(t)` term.

This comparison highlights how the inclusion of the mean-reverting drift term fundamentally changes the long-term behavior of the process, leading to bounded variance and a stable equilibrium distribution, unlike the ever-diffusing random walk.
