# Institutional Trading  

# 4.1 INSTITUTIONS AND MARKET IMPACT  

Institutions today own the bulk of securities traded in today’s marketplace and execute the majority of trades. The  Boston Consulting Group (2021)  estimated that institutions managed roughly  $\S103$   trillion in 2021 for tens of millions of clients. Among these institutional investors are buy-side institutions such as mutual funds, pension funds, life insurance companies, trust departments of banks, and investment companies. Institutional investor transactions are frequently executed by professional traders, either as employees of the institutions or acting as their agents, and these transactions provide opportunities and risks for other traders. Institutional transactions also have important effects on security liquidity, prices, and volatility. Institutional investors play crucial and varied roles in markets and are behind conditions that affect every trader. For example, stocks with the largest proportional institutional ownership experience the most volatile swings when the market is most volatile.   Why is this? Is it because institutions invest in larger blocks of shares and their transactions push the market more than non institutional shareholders? Are institutional shareholders more informed than other traders? Regardless, understanding the link between institutional trading and security behavior is important to the trader. We will discuss such issues in this and in later chapters.  

We introduced buy and sell sides of the market in Chapter 1. In this and the next two sections, we will discuss buy-side institutions before turning our attention to sell-side institutions. On the buy side, we start with the  investment company , which is an institution that accepts funds from investors for the purpose of investing on their behalf. The investment company is compensated with fees, typically based on some combination of performance and investment portfolio size. Clients expect that the investment company will provide professional and competent management services and pass on cost advantages resulting from economies of scale. These cost advantages include reduced transactions costs and managerial costs. In addition, these scale advantages provide for more efficient record keeping and enable improved diversification. There are a number of different types of investment companies that register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  
and operate under SEC oversight. In addition, there are a variety of unregistered investment companies. We will discuss many of these shortly.  

As we mentioned above, institutional traders can have dramatic impacts on security prices. Obviously, large block orders will result in dramatic price reactions. But how large will these reactions be, and what other factors will affect these reactions? Which types of institutional transactions will have the most significant price impacts? For example, numerous studies, including  Kraus and Stoll (1972)  and  Saar (2001)  have documented asymmetric reaction to block trades. In particular, institutional block buy orders result in a much larger upward effect than the downward effect caused by otherwise comparable institutional sell orders. This raises an interesting question: Why are institutional buys associated with significantly larger price impacts than institutional sells? Arguments offered by  Chan and Lakonishok (1993)  and  Saar (2001)  suggest that buy orders convey more information than sell orders because:  

1.  Liquidity needs drive many sales.

 2.  Most institutions have a much larger pool of stocks from which to buy than to sell.

 3.  Mutual funds are reluctant to short sell, so that they focus their research efforts on shares that they might buy and might serve as good diversification mechanisms.

 4.  Mutual funds cannot borrow to invest, so that they have to be particularly selective in their purchases.  

Thus, if one or more of these observations are correct, there should be more information content in institutional stock purchases than stock sells, and price changes will react accordingly to institutional transactions. We will focus more on the market impact of institutional transactions later in this chapter and in Chapter 6.  

# 4.2 REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES  

The buy-side institutions that execute the largest volume of transactions have an enormous impact on trading for all market participants. Among the most significant of these managed investment institutions are the registered investment companies, which are required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  Such companies include mutual funds, unit investment trusts, and real estate investment trusts (REITs). Investment companies manage assets on behalf of clients. Managed assets usually include, but are not limited to, publicly traded financial securities such as shares of stock, bonds, and derivative instruments.  

# Managed Investment Company Types  

One type of managed investment company is the  closed-end investment company , which is a corporation that issues a specified number of shares that can be traded in secondary markets such as the New York Stock Exchange. One might purchase shares through a brokerage firm.  Open-end investment companies , typically known as  mutual funds , frequently accept additional funds directly from investors and are willing to repurchase or redeem outstanding shares. An investor buys into a mutual fund by purchasing shares from the fund and cashes out by redeeming those shares.  
The major markets in which mutual funds operate are equities, fixed income, money markets and commodities and foreign exchange markets. Fixed income funds seek to provide stable interest income for their investors. One type of income fund, the high-yield fund, seeks to provide higher income by investing in a diverse portfolio of higher-risk, higher-return (junk) bonds. Municipal bond funds purchase tax-free state and local government bonds for their investors. These funds are particularly attractive to investors in high income-tax brackets. Money market funds seek to maintain safety and liquidity for their investors, focusing their investments in short-term, highly liquid, and safe debt instruments. Such investments include U.S. Treasury bills and bonds, GNMA, FNMA, and other federal government agency issues, bank issues such as repurchase agreements and corporate issues such as commercial paper. Stock funds might be categorized according to their objectives or types of stock that they may invest in. Among the categories of stock funds are aggressive growth funds, growth funds, income funds, balanced funds, global funds, and emerging markets funds. Some larger fund management companies such as Fidelity, Dreyfus, Vanguard, and T. Rowe Price manage entire families of funds with a wide variety of investment objectives ranging from aggressive growth to generating tax-free income. Commodity funds enable investors to take focused or diversified positions in a variety of commodities such as oil, gold, and agricultural products, and foreign exchange funds enable investors to take positions in the currencies and instruments of other countries.  

Index funds such as those in the Vanguard family have increased in popularity in recent years. These funds employ a passive management technique where managers simply attempt to maintain a fund composition matching a particular market index (basket of stocks or other instruments) rather than attempt to “out-guess” the market. The passive management technique is also intended to keep fund management expenses low because the index strategy does not require hiring securities analysts to pick stocks in an effort to outperform the market. In addition, these funds provide investors with opportunities to achieve broad diversification at a low cost. As of year-end 2020, and excluding ETFs, the U.S. index fund market was comprised of 490 funds with   $\S4.807$   trillion in assets ( Investment Company Institute, 2021 ).  

# Managed Investment Company Fees and Structures  

Mutual funds that accept investments directly from investors without a sales charge are called  no-load  funds; investors buy and sell funds at  net asset value , the difference between the fund’s total assets and liabilities divided by its number of outstanding shares. An investor buys into a mutual fund by paying for her shares exactly the value of her proportional ownership of the fund’s investments, computed at the end of the transaction date, without a sales fee or commission. Institutions that charge a sales fee are called  load  funds. The loads may be imposed when investors buy into a fund ( front-end load ), sell out of a fund ( back-end load  or redemption fee), or a combination of both. An investor should be aware that fund performance computations are frequently overstated because returns are usually calculated only on the investment net of fees. In addition, load charge percentages are generally understated in that the loads are determined as a fraction of the amount invested in the fund in addition to any loads charged.  
A number of funds adopt a 12b-1 plan that enables them to use fund assets to market their shares. Such   $^{12\mathsf{b}-1}$   expenses are often included with the sum of administrative expenses when computing annual expense ratios. Funds are permitted by the SEC to call themselves no-load funds even if they charge an annual 12b-1 fee, as long as the amount is less than   $0.25\%$   of the invested amount per year. The 12b-1 fee in effect enables the fund to impose its marketing costs on investors without reporting them as loads. In addition to potential load and 12b-1 fees, both load and no-load funds normally impose an annual management fee. These fees cover management compensation and various periodic administrative expenses.  

A managed investment company such as a mutual fund maintains a board of directors to oversee its operations, but normally does not have managers and employees, at least not in significant numbers. Most managed investment companies retain a separate  management company  or  advisor  to actually manage the fund’s assets in accordance with the fund’s prospectus. The advisor will typically hire analysts and fund managers and will pay the following types of institutions to perform certain important functions:  

Custodian : Holds the fund assets on behalf of shareholders. Transfer agent : Processes orders to purchase and redeem shares of the fund and maintains customer records. The NSCC (see Chapter 3) processes and clears most mutual funds that involve brokers and dealers. Distributor : Markets shares of the fund through various channels.  

Shareholders of management companies incur management fees, miscellaneous administrative expenses, and often other costs as well.  

# ETFs  

Exchange-traded funds  ( ETFs ) are funds whose shares trade on exchanges. The first was the  S&P Depository Receipt  ( SPDR  or “Spider,” ticker SPY) sponsored by State Street Bank and the Merrill Lynch Investment Company. The Spider fund is intended to mimic performance of the S&P 500 Index by maintaining the same portfolio of securities as is comprised by the index. As of year-end 2020, the U.S. ETF market was comprised of 2204 funds with   $\S5.4$   trillion in assets, accounting for approximately   $69\%$   of the   $\S7.9$   trillion worldwide ETF market ( Investment Company Institute, 2021 ).  

Unlike the case with most mutual funds, investors can trade shares of ETFs throughout the day at market prices that vary as the market index varies. Hence, investors can more easily trade the market portfolio throughout the day rather than have to wait for closing net asset values (NAVs) as is required for trading mutual funds. This ease of trading facilitates creation of options and other derivative contracts on the indices, which do not normally exist on mutual funds. Additionally, because an ETF is not actively managed, investors can benefit from low management expenses. On the other hand, investors typically will have to pay brokerage expenses to trade the fund and will be faced with a bid  offer spread, potentially increasing transaction costs. Some ETFs are leveraged and investors might have the opportunity to purchase ETFs on margin or even to short sell them. Most mutual funds cannot provide these opportunities. Discrepancies between ETF market prices and those of their index target portfolios create potential arbitrage opportunities for ETF market participants.  
An ETF is created by a  sponsor  who first chooses the ETF’s investment objectives and/ or index target along with the method of tracking the index. The sponsor will form a trust or other entity as the holding vehicle for securities that the fund will hold. The sponsor then identifies a portfolio of assets (e.g., a portfolio that will replicate the index target) in which to invest. This portfolio will typically comprise some combination of shares of equity, bonds and/or total return swap contracts.   The sponsor will then select an institutional investor to serve as the fund’s  authorized participant , which, in turn, purchases the actual portfolio of assets to form  creation units  that will correspond to a fixed number of shares in the ETF. Thus, the authorized participant (there might be more than one) actually purchases and delivers the portfolio of assets that the ETF will hold (initially called the creation units or creation basket), in exchange for ETF’s shares that are taken back from the fund’s sponsor who created them. Then all or most of the ETF shares are listed and sold to other investors on an exchange. Under normal circumstances, no new shares are created and no shares are redeemed during the life of the fund, enabling the ETF to closely match its index target and to avoid holding cash. Exceptions might occur when actual demand for fund shares differs substantially from the expected demand. When the ETF is ultimately terminated, the authorized participant repurchase s shares from investors and redeems them to the fund sponsor.  

For example, the trust underlying SPDR contracts is comprised of a portfolio of individual stocks that replicates the S&P 500. On the other hand, bear funds such as the  Short S&P 500 ProShares  (ticker SH), created to enable investors to easily short the market index, are comprised of a combination of short positions in shares of stock and short positions in swap contracts involving shares.  Ultra ETFs  (bull funds) are created to enable investors to easily leverage their investments in an index. For example, the  Ultra S&P 500 ProShares (ticker SSO) invests in combinations of shares of stock along with long positions in shares in swap contracts to leverage its position in the market index. Funds that double leverage  $(2x)$   or triple leverage   $(3x)$   are most common among bull funds, but funds are available with as much as  $50\mathbf{x}$   leverage.  

Other well-known ETFs include  DIA  “Diamonds” that mimic the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  QQQ  that mimics that NASDAQ 100, and a number of narrower sector and industry funds such as the    $i\cdot$  -shares energy sector  that mimics the portfolio of Dow Jones Energy companies. These funds all provide investors opportunities to trade large or important small segments of the market and to hedge risks associated with these segments.  

While our ETF discussion has thus far focused on passively managed funds that seek to replicate index targets, at year-end 2020, there were 2204 actively managed ETFs with almost  $\S174$   billion under management in the U.S. ( Investment Company Institute, 2021 ). These funds seek to fulfill some investment objective other than index replication. Shares of these funds trade as shares of individual stock, but transparency of fund management activities is essential because fund shares are traded in secondary markets throughout the trading day.  
While different in structure from ETFs and index funds, unit investment trusts have been created to replicate indices. For example,  Diamonds  are shares of the Diamonds Trust created to replicate the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and to sell on the former American Stock Exchange (ASE).   Spiders  (Standard & Poors Depository Receipts) track the S&P 500,  Midcap Spiders  track the S&P Midcap 400 Index, and  Webs , which track the Morgan Stanley world equity benchmark indices, were also created to trade on the ASE. Combined, these four products accounted for approximately   $15\%$   of ASE volume prior to its acquisition by the NYSE. The “Dogs of the Dow” track the 10 DJIA stocks with the highest dividend yields, and are represented by their own trust. Although each of these trusts are designed to track a particular index, their shares are often more volatile than the index itself. One explanation for this volatility is that there is substantial trading volume when the market swings. This possible explanation is interesting in that it might suggest that traders’ activities tend to increase market volatility.  

# 4.3 UNREGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES  

As we discussed, registered asset managers such as mutual funds provide investment services for tens of millions of clients, functioning under the regulatory authority of the SEC. But there are many asset managers that are not required to register as registered investment companies. For example, pension funds and private equity management firms are not required to register with the SEC as public investment companies. Pension fund clients cannot trade their fund investments.  Private equity  firms are alternative professionally managed equity investments in unregistered securities issued by public and private firms. Investments in private equity firms are often tightly restricted by their managers, in part, to avoid SEC reporting requirements for registered investment companies. Other unregistered asset managers include banks, bank trusts, foundations, endowments, and insurance companies. All of these institutions are important buy-side securities traders.  

# Pension Funds  

Pension funds  are established by employers to facilitate and organize the investment of employees’ retirement funds.  Defined benefit plans  specify payments that employees will receive when they retire and  defined contribution plans  define employer and employee contributions, but actual benefits depend on fund investment performance. In most cases, investment horizons for pension funds are long term. Many pension funds are large enough to afford more sophisticated investment techniques and managers. Pension funds in sum hold over   $\S20$   trillion in assets for their beneficiaries. More than half of working Americans participate in pension plans, including defined contribution plans such as 401-k plans, representing very diverse ownership structure somewhat representative of the U.S. population. Regulators, in part due to the Employee Retirement and Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), tend to discourage pension plans from taking imprudent risks. Nevertheless, many pension funds, particularly defined benefit plans, have been criticized for being underfunded and not providing adequate capital to secure their employees’ retirements (see, for example,  Kwan, 2003 ). The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, a federal corporation created by the ERISA, provides limited protection for the pensions of nearly 44 million American workers and retirees in over 30,000 private, single-employer and multi employer, defined-benefit pension plans.  
# Bank Trusts and Private Banking  

Banks also provide professional asset management services, including trust management for clients. Trusts are legal entities or vehicles for enabling settlors or grantors (entities that set aside assets in trusts on behalf of beneficiaries such as heirs, charities, and others) to accomplish various financial goals. Banks in their roles as trustees or asset managers actively manage trusts on behalf of grantors and their beneficiaries. Most banks maintain trust departments to serve as trustees or perform services on behalf of trustees.  

Private banking refers to financial services such as banking and investment management services provided by banks to private high-net-worth clients. Private banking services offered by major banks such as Citigroup, HSBC, Bank of America (U.S. Trust), and Wells Fargo have frequently been particularly lucrative. These personalized services tend to be rather broad-based and banks strive to provide their clients the greatest confidentiality. Private banking services frequently include specialized financing solutions to complex problems, as well as retirement and estate planning. These operations contribute to banks’ trading operations.  

# Private Equity  

Private equity refers to asset managers who make equity investments in companies that are not publicly traded. Private equity markets provide funding for start-up firms, private middle-market firms   $\mathfrak{F}25$   million to   $\S500$   million in sales), management buyouts (MBOs), leveraged buyouts (LBOs), firms in financial distress, and public firms seeking buyout financing. Traditionally, private equity ownership is not publicly traded (there are a few exceptions), not liquid, and exempt from SEC registration requirements. Private equity firms frequently take active monitoring, management, and advising roles in their portfolio firms. There are a variety of types of private equity firms, ranging from venture capital (VC) firms to hedge funds.  

# Hedge Funds  

Hedge funds  are unregistered private funds that allow investors to pool their investment assets. To avoid SEC registration and regulations, hedge funds usually only accept funds from small numbers (often less than 100) of  accredited  investors, typically high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Because most hedge funds have only a small number of managers, they typically focus their investment strategies on the expertise of a smaller number of key managers. Many hedge funds seek investment opportunities or niches where larger institutions are prohibited or constrained due to regulatory restrictions. For example, because many banks, pension funds, and other institutions cannot focus activities in the securities of distressed corporations facing reorganization or bankruptcy, some hedge funds will specialize in such investments. Other funds may specialize in short sales and derivatives to hedge against market downturns and others will simply focus on searches for arbitrage opportunities. Hedge fund managers typically take a proportion of assets invested   $(2\%$   is a norm) and another portion of profits   $(20\%$   is typical) as compensation. While hedge funds are frequently able to report results that beat the market, investors should realize that performance results do not usually include the last several months of a hedge fund’s existence, which is when a fund is most likely to fail (pretty much by definition). The point here is that while the risky strategies employed by many hedge fund managers can consistently produce strong returns over long periods, many lose large sums and close down in remarkably short periods following long periods of success. Sixty consecutive months of market-beating returns followed by a single month with a return of  $-100\%$   is obviously a disaster for investors. For example, consider the long-running successes of Long Term Capital Management and Amaranth, after which both suffered spectacular meltdowns (see  Hosking, 2006 ).  
# 4.4 BEST EXECUTION, EXECUTION COSTS, AND PRICE IMPROVEMENT  

“ Best execution  refers to traders receiving the most favorable terms available for their trades” ( Macey and O’Hara, 1997 ). Brokers have a responsibility to provide their clients best execution, though, as we will discuss in the next chapter, this obligation has largely been replaced by best price. Unfortunately, because many factors are needed to define the most favorable terms, best execution is not an easy concept to quantify, evaluate, or enforce. Suppose, for example, that the best quotes are available in one market, but trades are more likely to execute between quotes in another market. Which market will provide for the best execution? What if one market normally executes at a better price than another market, but takes longer with more risk? Regardless, execution costs are an important factor in evaluating best execution. Execution costs might be considered to be the sum of (1) order processing costs and (2) market impact costs.  

Measuring  order processing costs  is normally fairly straightforward. These costs will normally include brokerage fees, which might account for other processing costs as brokers normally provide these services as well. However,  market impact  or slippage costs (introduced in Sections 1.6 and 2.5) measurement is more problematic. The price or market impact of a transaction, the effect that a given transaction has on the market price of a security, is particularly important for a large transaction or in an illiquid market. When institutions execute large transactions, their buy or sell activities affect security prices, typically in a manner that increases execution costs. While substantial, especially for large orders, these costs are not explicit, and might be considered hidden.  
# Spreads  

Investors, particularly more active institutional investment managers need to track execution quality to measure the trading performance of their investment brokers. Brokerage firms have traditionally used bid  offer spreads as a basis for charging commissions to their customers. That is, buyers frequently bought at the offer and sellers sold at the bid, with brokers pocketing the difference (spread) as their commission. This tradition is one reason that spreads are an important factor for gauging transaction costs.  

While this spread-based commission model has changed somewhat in many markets, many studies concerned with execution costs have used the  quoted spread  (offer minus bid) or  half-spread  (quoted spread/2) to measure execution costs. However, when transactions are executed inside spreads, these measures can overstate execution costs ( Macey and O’Hara, 1997 ). In this case, the  effective half-spread , the absolute value of the difference between the actual transaction price and the mid-point of the spread may be a more accurate measure of the cost of the transaction. However, none of these measures are likely to capture the  market impact  of a transaction or series of transactions, often referred to as  slippage . That is, each transaction is likely to force the price in some direction, upwards for purchases and downwards for sales. This is the market impact of the transaction. The  realized half-spread , also called the  perfect foresight half-spread , is the absolute value of the difference between some future price and the trade price. This realized half-spread might be particularly relevant when the transaction was executed as part of a series of transactions. Here, the assumption is that the subsequent or future price is the fundamental value of the security and its difference from the prior price reflects the price impact of the transaction or series of transactions. The “look-ahead window” for the subsequent price might be defined as one execution subsequent to the relevant transaction, some other number of executions subsequent, one or more of a different investor’s executions subsequent to the relevant execution, or a given length of time subsequent to the relevant execution. Presumably, the subsequent price reflects the “intrinsic value of the security” whereas the relevant execution occurs at a price that reflects the slippage caused by the relevant investor’s order. Again, this perfect foresight half-spread is particularly relevant to the trader if the trade was part of a series of trades.  

Suppose, for example, that your stock purchase transaction was executed at 5.03 when it was quoted at 5 bid and  $5.05\;\mathrm{ask,}$   and that someone else’s subsequent transaction executed at 5.04. The quoted spread was  $5.05-5=0.05,$  , the half spread was   $(5.05-5)/2=0.025,$   and the effective half-spread was   $\mid(5.03-5.025)\mid=0.005$  . The realized half-spread, based on the immediately subsequent transaction,   $\ensuremath{|\,5.04-5.025\,|}$   was 0.015. For research and analysis purposes, sometimes spreads are computed as proportions of transaction prices or mid-points.  

Since spreads represent potential sources of income to brokers and market-makers, it is important to know what their determinants are. Among the factors that affect spreads are liquidity, volume, volatility, skewness, and information asymmetry. These factors and their effects on spreads are discussed with more detail in Chapter 6.  

Some efforts at measuring market impact have focused on examining prices of consecutive transactions. For example, what if we want to see how a series of our 80 buy orders for a stock in one day have impacted the price of that security? Presumably, each of our buy executions moved or could have moved the security price. An analysis of this series of trades with associated volumes might indicate the relationship between order sizes and market impact. We might be able to use a regression analysis of price changes on transaction sizes to infer a relationship between security price movements and transaction sizes. We might be able to improve this understanding by adding appropriate control variables to the regression analysis. We will discuss such relationships in the next section.  
Numerous academic and regulatory studies have compared execution costs of different markets. Many older studies (e.g.,  Huang and Stoll, 1996 ) found that execution costs on NASDAQ were substantially higher than on the NYSE and that other equity markets did not compare favorably to the NYSE.  Christie and Huang (1994)  found that NYSE effective half-spreads averaged 7.9 cents compared to 18.7 cents on NASDAQ and that trading costs fall for firms that switch listings from the NASDAQ to either the AMEX or the NYSE. Similarly,  Huang and Stoll (1995)  found that  $26.7\%$   of trades on the NASDAQ were inside the spread, compared to   $37.9\%$   of trades on the NYSE. Thus, NYSE transactions were more likely to exhibit price improvement.  

Price improvement occurs when an order is executed a price better than the prevailing bid or offer. Exchange specialists and market makers had or have an exchange resp on sibi lity to seek to improve markets for securities that they trade. Price improvement typically occurs when a specialist or market maker allows market orders to execute inside the spread, either by improving their quotes or by allowing market orders to execute against other submitted market orders inside the spread.  

# Illustration: Slippage and the Perfect Foresight Half Spread  

Table 4.1  depicts a series of 20 historical transaction prices that a hypothetical brokerage firm paid for a given stock’s purchases.  Table 4.1  also depicts subsequent transaction prices, from which perfect foresight half-spreads are computed. The sizes of the purchases follow, so that the broker can analyze the relationship between the perfect foresight halfspread and the transaction size based on 20 of the broker’s own purchase transactions for the same stock. For example, the first transaction has the broker purchasing 1000 shares for  $\S50.00$  . The next transaction, by another investor, was at a price of   $\S50.30$  , implying a perfect foresight half-spread of 0.30. Purchases by other investors are omitted in the “Purchase Price” column. Note that larger purchase orders tend to lead to higher perfect foresight half-spreads in  Table 4.1 . This suggests that larger orders lead to greater slippage, just as we would expect. What might be less apparent in  Table 4.1  is that the proportional increase in slippage increases as the proportional size of the transaction increases. That is, the relationship between slippage and transaction size is concave up.  

We can analyze the relationship between the perfect foresight half-spread and transaction sizes with an ordinary least square (OLS) regression. Suppose the broker expects that this relationship will not be linear because the effect of transaction size on the perfect foresight half-spread is expected to be concave up. That is, for example, the broker might expect that a single purchase transaction for 1000 shares will cause more slippage than 10 purchase transactions for 100 shares each. To analyze this nonlinear relationship, we will conduct a log-log regression of the following form:  

$$
l o g(P e r f e c t\;F o r e s i g h t\;H a l f-S p r e a d)_{t}=l o g b_{0}+b_{1}l o g(T r a n s a c t i o n\;S i z e)+\varepsilon_{t}
$$  
TABLE 4.1 Transaction Size and Slippage

This implies the following estimated relationship between the perfect foresight halfspread and transaction size:  

$$
P e r f e c t\;F o r e s i g h t\;H a l f-S p r e a d=v(T r a n s a c t i o n\;S i z e)^{m}
$$  

where  $b_{0}$   serves as an estimate for    $v$   and    $b_{1}$   serves as an estimate for    $m$  . These parameters  $b_{0}$   and    $m$   characterize slippage, which is positive when    $v$   is positive and    $m$   exceeds 1. Higher values for    $b_{0}$   and m indicate increased slippage.  

Table 4.2  presents  log  values (base 10) for the perfect foresight half-spreads and transaction nd depicts regression results. The log-log regres on implies that    $b_{0}=-4.96$  and  b  $b_{1}=1.48.$   1.48; that is,    $v$   is approximately equal to 0.00001 and  m  is approximately equal to 1.5 (use anti-logs of    $b_{0}$   and    $b_{1}$   to obt in    $v$   and    $m$  ). Thus, slippage,    $S=v c^{m}\,{\approx}\,\dot{0}.00\dot{0}001c^{1.5}$  where  $c$   is transaction size. Regression  t -statistics, the F-statistic, and the adjusted  $\mathbf{r}\cdot$  -square value all suggest that these results are statistically significant.

# 4.5 ALGORITHMIC TRADING  

Typical transaction sizes in many markets such as the NYSE are very small relative to the order sizes placed by institutional investors. Average transaction sizes have dropped from 1477 shares in 1998 to approximately 400 shares in 2008 to below 300 in 2011. This means that the much larger institutional trades can have a significant and unwanted impact on execution prices. This unwanted price impact, which works against the trader, is referred to as  slippage . Slippage occurs when the market impact of a trader’s buy orders forces security prices to rise and sell orders force prices down.  Algorithmic trading  refers to automated trading with the use of live market data and rule-driven computer programs for automatically submitting and allocating trade orders among markets and brokers as well as over time so as to minimize the price impact of large trades. Algorithmic trading executes orders without direct human intervention, using computers to directly interface with trading venues. Algorithmic trading models seek to determine strategies for trade amounts, prices, timing, and venues of orders, in many cases, to avoid slippage. When brokers rely on algorithms to break up client orders (in this context, referred to as parent orders) into smaller slices (child orders) so as to avoid slippage, their algorithm-based trading is called  agency algo trading . Algorithmic trading is a response to market imperfections (e.g., asymmetric information availability), and may contribute to market imperfections as well. Agency-only execution firms (e.g., CF Global Trading and Wallach Beth Capital) and other brokers employ algos to implement the best executions for their clients. Many institutional traders employ algorithmic trading (also called  automated trading ,  black box trading , and  rob o trading ) or agency execution services to break up large parent orders into smaller child orders to reduce execution risk, preserve anonymity, and to minimize trade slippage. Rooted in  program trading  (defined by the NYSE as computer-initiated trades involving 15 or more stocks with value totaling more than   $\mathbb{S}1\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{)}$  , which dates back to the 1980s, algorithmic trading now accounts for between  $30\%$   and  $80\%$   of trade volume in many markets.  

While algorithmic trading frequently refers to the trade execution models referred to above, the term is also used in a more general sense to include  alpha models , which are used to make trade decisions to generate profits or control risk. More generally, algorithmic trading can be defined as trading based on the use of computer programs and sophisticated trading analytics to execute orders according to predefined strategies. Thus, algorithmic trading can be generalized to include program trading. Regardless, algorithmic trading is usually highly dependent on the most sophisticated technology and analytics.  

Algorithmic trading does have risks, such as leaks that might arise from competitor efforts to reverse engineer them. Designers of algorithmic trading models seek to ensure that trading schedules and behavior cannot be predicted. However, many algorithms lack the capacity to handle or respond to exceptional or rare events. In addition, any malfunction, including a simple lapse in communication lines, can cause the system to fail. Thus, human supervision of algorithmic trading and appropriate use of filters are crucial.  

# Algo Strategies  

Strategies used by algorithms vary widely. Sometimes, algorithmic trading results from mathematical models that analyze every quote and trade in the relevant market, identify liquidity opportunities, and use this information to make intelligent trading decisions. This type of strategy is sometimes called  smart order routing . Some algorithmic trading models seek to trade at or better than the average price over a day (e.g.,  VWAP , volume weighted average price, or  TWAP , time weighted average price—both are discussed in Chapter 10) and others seek to execute slowly so as to have minimal price impact. For example, with  simple time slicing , orders are split up and sent to markets at regular time intervals. Some strategies are more competitive, such as  iceberging  where small parts of orders are revealed to determine their impact and  pegging  where orders are sent to execute at the best bid or offer to test whether the order moves the market. Algorithms sometimes are set to produce more volume at market opens and closes (e.g.,  MOC , market on close) when volume is high, and less during slower periods such as around lunch. They can seek to exploit any arbitrage opportunities or price spreads between correlated securities.  
Newsreader algorithms  employ high-speed text mining and statistical techniques to analyze news sources, blogs, tweets, and other data to obtain relevant trading information and infer its impact on security prices. Essentially, data are mined and read and content is mechanically analyzed for trading decisions. More generally,  information algorithms  search and filter information and news flow in an effort to locate trading opportunities and trigger trades. These algorithms can be structured to alert human traders or structured to execute automatically based on rules provided by the user.  

In addition, some algorithms seek opportunities in options and other derivatives markets. Algorithmic trading can also account for and seek to balance trading costs such as commissions and taxes as well as regulatory issues such as those associated with short selling. Algorithms are created to account for the relative importance of the tradeoff between the order’s speed of execution and its price impact. Many algo strategies are highly dependent on trading venue selection and on speed. We will discuss strategies of venue selection in Section 4.6 and algorithms used by High Frequency Traders in Section 4.8.  

# Illustration: Slicing the Large Transaction  

Earlier in this chapter, we discussed best execution, slippage, and the perfect foresight half-spread. Suppose that a client of the agency-only XYZ brokerage firm seeks to have her purchase order of  $X=80{,}000$   shares completed with the best possible execution; that is, she wants to slice her 80,000-share order so as to realize the lowest possible total execution costs    $B$  . These execution costs    $B$   will include both order processing costs  $F$   per transaction and market impact (slippage) costs that are increasing in the size  $c$   of each of    $n$   equal-size transactions. Broker XYZ works with a market impact model that estimates the slippage cost  S  of each of    $n$   equal-sized executions    $c=X/n$   with function  $\boldsymbol{S}=\boldsymbol{v}\boldsymbol{c}^{m}.$  , where the coefficient 4    $v$   and exponent  $m$   are related to the liquidity of the security to be purchased or sold. In this case, the per-transaction cost  $B/n$   is estimated to have a fixed component  $F$   (order processing costs) and an increasing variable cost component    $v c^{m}=v(X/n)^{m}$    (this is the market impact component of the execution costs):  
$$
B/n=F+\upsilon(X/n)^{m}
$$  

Suppose that broker analysts have estimated  $F$   to be  $\S0.03$   per order, based on knowledge of order processing costs, and    $v$   and    $m$   to be 0.00001 and 1.5. What are the optimal number of transactions and transaction sizes? To answer these questions, we will set up a total transaction cost function as follows:  

$$
B=n F+n v\left({\frac{X}{n}}\right)^{m}=0.03n+0.00001{\frac{80,000^{1.5}}{n^{0.5}}}=0.03n+226.27n^{-0.5}
$$  

We find the derivative of total transaction costs    $B$   with respect to the total number of transactions    $n$  , set this derivative equal to zero and solve for    $n$   as follows:  

$$
=\frac{d\left[n F+n v\left(\frac{X}{n}\right)^{m}\right]}{d n}=F-(m-1)v\frac{X^{m}}{n^{m}}=0.03-0.5(0.00001)\frac{X^{m}}{n^{m}}=0.03-\frac{113.1}{n^{1.5}}
$$  

$$
n=\sqrt[m]{\cfrac{(m-1)\upsilon X^{m}}{F}}=\sqrt[1.5]{\cfrac{0.5(0.00001)\bullet80,000^{1.5}}{0.03}}\,{=}\,242.28
$$  

Thus, we find that the optimal number of stock transactions for this order is    $n=242.$  , each with a transaction size of  $X/n$   equal to   $80{,}000/242=331$   (subject to rounding).  

The algorithm that we have just illustrated is very simple. Many potential enhancements could be developed to enrich the model. For example, the model provides no guidance on spacing trades through the day or time frame. First, we might expect that the amount of time elapsing between trades executing at time    $t$   and time    $t\!+\!1$   would be inversely related to market impact costs. That is, as more time elapses between the broker’s transactions, slippage will be reduced. Second, many securities might be expected to be more liquid during the earliest and latest parts of the day, and least liquid in the middle. That is, one might expect liquidity during the day to be   $\mathrm{{}^{\prime\prime}U^{\prime\prime}}$  -shaped, and market impact costs to resemble an upside-down U. Trade urgency, competing market venues are among the many other potential factors were not considered here. Clearly, the analyst developing algorithmic programs has many factors that she can consider when designing the optimal cost or trade-slicing functions.  

# 4.6 DARK POOLS  

Sometimes, all or parts of orders generated by algorithmic traders are hidden from the eyes of the public as opposed to orders quoted in “lit” markets such as exchanges. Lit markets display quotes and execution prices to the public while dark pools display only prices after order executions to the consolidated tape, and then normally, only after a delay. These intentionally obscured portions of orders are generally referred to as  dark liquidity pools  because they are hidden from public view until after they execute. These dark pools help traders with large order sizes maintain anonymity and avoid slippage while attempting to execute their large transactions. Orders are often partially revealed, in which case they are called  icebergs  (hidden-size orders are generally completely hidden), with brokers instructed not to reveal the full size of their orders. Hidden portions of orders do not contribute to the display of market depth. In many markets, the fully revealed portion of the order will normally have priority over the hidden portion.  Mittal (2008)  reported that dark pools represent about   $7\%$   of total equity market volume in 2006; more recently, this  $15\%$  figure has risen to about  .  
Dark pools also refer to alternative trading systems (ATSs) that do not post quotes and transaction prices in the traditional sense. In some cases, this information (often referred to as alerts) can be transmitted to certain traders such as those who can potentially provide for a match; in other cases, information is tightly restricted. These dark pools function in a parallel fashion with traditional markets, executing transactions within the national market bid/offer (NBBO) spread, usually at the NBBO mid-point. Citadel and KG Holdings Inc. are among the firms that offer such confidential execution services. The Investment Technology Group (ITG) and  Mittal (2008)  characterize five basic types of dark pools:  

1.  Public Crossing Networks : Usually created by brokerage firms to act on an agency basis for the purpose of generating trading commissions on large trades, such as ITG’s POSIT and Liquidnet. They normally cross buy and sell orders, frequently at the spread mid-point.

 2.  Internal iz ation Pools : Usually created by brokerage firms for internalizing the broker’s trade flow, such as Credit Suisse’s Cross finder, and Goldman Sach’s Sigma X (operated by NASDAQ as of late 2016). Internal iz ation of order flow means that the broker provides both the buy and sell flow from its own proprietary desk and its customers, maintaining complete control over the transaction and reducing transaction costs.

 3.  Ping Destinations : These pools, operated by hedge funds and electronic market makers, accept only immediate or cancel (fill or kill) orders. Such markets usually provide for low transaction costs and can facilitate flash trading (discussed in the upcoming section on high-frequency trading).

 4.  Exchange-Based Pools : ATSs created by exchanges, such as ISE Midpoint Match, NASDAQ Cross, and NYSE Matchpoint. In many cases, suppliers of liquidity will receive rebates for providing liquidity, while buyers of liquidity will pay higher commissions for the liquidity that they receive.

 5.  Consortium-Based Pools : Operated by multiple broker partners and function as a hybrid of public crossing networks and internal iz ation pools, such as LEVEL and BIDS. In a sense, a consortium-based pool acts as a sort of second-step internal iz ation pool. If a broker cannot internalize an order, it seeks to execute the order within its consortium of partners before sending it out to the public.  

Trader anonymity and reduced slippage are clear advantages to trading in a dark pool. Most trades are executed within the bounds of the NBBO. While anonymity is essential to the dark pool trading venues, traders have learned to game the pools. For example, in Chapter 13, we will discuss  fishing , the practice involving gamers sending small orders to dark pools to determine whether they can be executed, in which case they often infer that larger numbers of shares await in the pool. Gamers can use this information to set their own trading strategies and game the market. Fishing activities obviously impact market prices, as does the removal of orders from display markets to dark pools. If dark pools drain significant volume from public display markets, the price discovery process might become significantly impaired, and market efficiency (the ability for markets to fully reflect available information) would be adversely affected.  
Menkveld, Yueshen, and Zhu (2017)  introduce a theory of and offer empirical support for pecking orders for trading venues. They argue that investors rank trading venues based on low-cost-low-immediacy versus high-cost-high-immediacy. When trade urgency is low, low-cost mid-point dark pools rank first, followed by other dark pools and lit (high-transparency) markets such as exchanges at the bottom. Lit markets are the most costly in that they provide the least protection against information leakage and slippage. However, when trade urgency is high, investor rankings are reversed, with lit markets at the top despite their higher information and slippage costs and mid-point dark pools at the bottom due to execution uncertainty. Thus, for example, when market volatility increases, or when there are earnings announcement surprises, trade urgency increases and lit markets become the preferred trading venue due to their certainty of execution.  

# 4.7 STEALTH AND SUNSHINE TRADING  

As we discussed earlier in the context of algorithmic trading, investors with private information should trade gradually to disguise their intentions and to realize trading profits before their trades fully reveal valuable information. They fragment their orders, routing them to different markets and at different times to disguise their intentions. This is the purpose of stealth trading.  

To motivate discussing the need for stealth trading to avoid slippage, consider the extent to which small, uninformed investors cause stock prices to change versus the effects of large informed traders pushing prices towards their fundamental values.  Barclay and Warner (1993)  argue that if informed investors’ trades are the main cause of stock price changes, large trades by informed traders would reveal their information because traders can easily discern those who execute large transactions. However, small trades executed repeatedly will incur excessive transaction costs. Thus, informed traders will tend to fragment orders into medium-sized trades sufficiently small to disguise themselves but large enough to maintain fairly small transaction costs. This should lead medium-sized transactions to have the most significant impact on stock prices. Thus, medium-sized orders (500 to 9999 share orders) will be most likely to move stock prices if stealth traders are most active. Several empirical studies support this argument, including that of Barclay and Warner who find that   $99.43\%$   of the cumulative price changes on the NYSE result from medium-sized trades, which comprise   $38.12\%$   of total NYSE trades.  Chakra var ty (2001) confirms that the bulk of price changes are due to medium-sized trades, finds that the bulk of these price-moving trades are executed by institutions, and determines that the bulk of stealth trades are executed by institutions.  Chakra var ty, Kalev, and Pham (2005) found that institutional investors appear to be more informed than individual investors, enabling them to function more appropriately as stealth traders.  

In contrast,  Campbell, Ramadorai, and Vu ol teena ho (2009)  found that institutions tend to execute larger and smaller transactions rather than medium-sized transactions. This differs from earlier studies cited above that suggest that institutions execute medium-sized transactions. However, the  Campbell et al. (2009)  study was more recent and the exchanges have consistently been reporting smaller average transaction sizes. Perhaps significantly reduced transaction costs have made execution of smaller transactions less costly, leading institutions to execute an increased number of smaller transactions. Furthermore, Campbell et al. also found that institutions prefer medium and small size trades on high volume days and larger size trades on high volatility days. Furthermore, larger transactions move prices more on high volatility days. This suggests that stealth trading increases when liquidity is high, but when volatility is high, traders act more quickly with larger size trades, engaging less in stealth trading, causing their trades to move prices more.  
Chakra var ty et al. (2005)  found that stealth trading occurs differently in bear markets from how it occurs in bull markets. While they did find that informed traders execute smaller trade sizes when selling than when buying, informed investors fragmented their trades more when buying in rising markets and when selling in falling markets. Furthermore, some stealth trading algorithms seek opportunities in options and other derivatives markets. In fact,  Chakra var ty, Gulen, and Mayhew (2004)  demonstrate that informed traders trade across both stock and options markets and that a significant level of price discovery occurs in options markets.  

Sunshine trading  is the opposite of stealth trading, as sunshine traders announce their intentions. The sunshine trader announces its intentions when doing so might be expected to increase the competition to act as counter parties on the same transactions, but when additional competition on the same side of the transaction won’t hurt the institution. Sunshine trading is most effective when the market for the security is elastic, that is, when a larger number of competitors on the same side of the transaction might be expected to have little long-term impact on the price of the security. Even if the announcement produces a short-term impact, in an elastic market, the price will bounce back. If information motivating a trade has already been leaked, the institution might publicize its intentions in an effort to obtain a larger number of providers of liquidity. That is, the institution might prefer to execute its transactions in a more liquid market. If forthcoming trades are not motivated by information, pre announcing the motivations of the trade may result in better trade prices than stealth trading. In fact, the signaling effect of sunshine trading might actually “scare off” potential competitors on the same side of the transaction, leading to reduced trading by competing informed traders.  

Consider, for example, the 2011 scenario when the U.S. government announced its intent to sell bank shares accumulated in its efforts to mitigate the effects of the 2008 banking crisis. The market was well aware of the U.S. government’s holdings and its intent to eventually sell the shares. Hence when these shares ultimately were sold, the government’s announcement of the anticipated sales prevented suspicions leading to unwanted negative information effects.  

# 4.8 HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING  

High-frequency trading refers to the practice of rapid executions of multiple transactions for securities followed by extremely short holding periods, perhaps as short as fractions of seconds. High-frequency traders typically use their technology and trading algorithms to exploit market inefficiencies in market making, price effects of news, and market movements. High-frequency traders focus on small price changes and discrepancies, often “ticks.” Obviously, high-frequency trading requires sophisticated technology, communications, and computing resources costing millions or even tens of millions of dollars. Several studies have indicated that high-frequency trading accounts for more than half of all U.S. equities trading volume and over   $45\%$   in Europe,   $40\%$   in Japan,   $27\%$   in Australia, and   $12\%$   in the rest of Asia as of the end of 2012 ( Australian Securities and Investments Commission, 2015; Popper, 2012 ). This means that high-frequency trading has the potential to add liquidity to the marketplace. High-frequency trading obviously depends heavily on execution speed. In fact, the prevalence of HFT implies that at least half of all trades are not motivated by liquidity, the need for portfolio diversification, fundamental analysis, or technical analysis. These trades are motivated by latency. Many markets measure  latency , the delay between an order signal and its execution in milliseconds. For example, the NYSE SDBK system has reduced latency to approximately 5 milliseconds (0.005 seconds) for most of its high-frequency transactions. KCG LLC is one of the major firms focused in the high-frequency execution services industry, and hedge funds such as Citadel Investment Group and Renaissance Technologies LLC are also major participants as HFT traders.  Wah (2016)  estimates the 2014 industry-wide total profits for HFT trading to be  $\S3.03\$   billion.  
In recent years, major commercial and investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and have lost ground in the HFT arena to smaller proprietary trading firms and hedge funds that specialize in the practice, including Virtu Financial, KCG, Hudson River Trading, and Jump Trading. Nonetheless, a high-frequency program requires significant data, technological, and personnel resources. In addition to the ability to obtain, transmit, and analyze the most recent and complete quote and execution data, a high-frequency trader (HFT) needs to be able to develop and implement trading strategies. These strategies will require historical tick data (trade-by-trade price data) along with quote data for testing in a data repository and data-cleansing capabilities. Second, appropriate personnel and tools need to be available to develop and test appropriate trading models under real-world conditions (see Sections 12.3 and 12.5). Such testing capabilities will include back-testing models. Third, the high-frequency trading system will require highly reliable trade-execution services that will execute on signals as prescribed by model developers.  

Some HFTs, specifically  liquidity rebate traders , rely heavily on payment for order flow

 (introduced in Section 2.4). Exchanges and many electronic communications networks

 (ECNs) offer rebates of about  $1\!\bigtriangledown_{4}$   penny per share to certain broker dealers that execute orders. These executed orders supply liquidity in the market, and the payments or rebates for this order flow might be regarded as payment for supplying liquidity. Brokers and traders using this liquidity might be expected to pay higher fees to the exchange or ECN. These rebate programs have led to trading strategies designed to capture these rebates. A dealer purchasing shares at 50.00 and quickly reselling them for 50.00 may still make a  $1/_{2}$   penny profit per share from the liquidity rebate. Buy-side traders pay this fee through higher exchange/ECN fees, but these fees might be regarded as the cost of using liquidity in the market. Some market centers maintain an explicit pricing scheme called  maker-taker pricing: brokers who make liquidity through limit orders receive a payment; takers of liquidity through market orders pay a small fee. This pricing system is designed to encourage market participants to supply orders that enhance the liquidity of the market. We will discuss controversies associated with payment for order flow in Section 13.5.  
Interestingly, high-frequency trading not only relies heavily on algorithms to provide rules and strategies for trades, but many algorithms are designed specifically to anticipate and exploit the algorithms used by other institutions. Hence, some HFT algorithms are designed to detect (“sniff out”) and exploit competitors’ algorithms. For example, a small sell order for 100 shares on a particular exchange placed by a given broker might imply a much larger latent sell order awaiting execution. Sniffing algorithms are designed to detect such latent orders.  

High-frequency trading has gained significant importance, particularly in equity and exchange markets. Major brokerage houses, trading firms, and hedge funds often invest tens of millions of dollars into their high-frequency trading technologies and capabilities. For example, many firms engaging in high-frequency trading have co-location facilities, where they rent space from market centers, such as from the major exchange ECNs and other ATSs. The purpose of co-location where their servers are located next to the market center’s data servers is to reduce latency. This co-location (also called proximity hosting) provides significant millisecond and even microsecond advantages, and enables institutions to better serve their clients and obtain and react to competitors’ trading behavior more quickly.   However, the fairness of this high-cost practice has been questioned and remains under SEC scrutiny.  

# Latency Arbitrage  

Latency is concerned with the speed of quotation display or order execution after an order has been placed. Different technologies and resources (such as co-location, locating trader computing and order routing facilities in the buildings where markets are located) provide opportunities for some traders to obtain quote and order information faster than others. For example, HFT SIPs simply process faster than the SIPs maintained by the exchanges on which customer orders are based. This HFT speedy access to information enables them to exploit their information advantage over their competitors through  latency arbitrage . Arbitrage is a series of simultaneous or nearly simultaneous transactions to exploit price differences in securities or portfolios producing identical or nearly identical cash flows across multiple markets. Latency arbitrage typically involves an HFT trader “picking off” orders in one market before other traders have a chance to respond to orders in another market, sometimes offsetting the transaction in another market.  

Exchanges disseminate regular updates of their best bids and offers; NBBOs on stocks are compiled from these and routed to clients. However, many dark pools, or anonymous electronic markets such as Liquidnet that don’t publish bids and offers, don’t contribute to the NBBO. Delays between the appearance of bids and offers on direct feeds and the processing of the NBBO provide arbitrage opportunities as do the abilities of institutions to synthesize NBBOs before they are even available to most traders. Consider the following illustration of a HFT whose automated trading facility enables it to exploit its information advantage:  
1.  The initial market for Stock X is 50.00 bid/offered at 50.01.

 2.  The HFT’s superior technology and location enables it to pick up a new institutional bid for 50.01 for Stock X that is deemed likely to be followed by more and higher bids. This bid arrives in the HFT’s computer 10 microseconds before most competing traders’ computers.

 3.  The HFT’s computer buys all available shares offered at 50.01 before competing traders act.

 4.  The institutional buyer is unable to purchase at 50.01.

 5.  The NBBO for the stock changes to 50.01 bid/offered at 50.02.

 6.  The HFT sells shares to the institutional buyer for 50.02, locking a 0.01 profit per share.  

While the profit seems small, HFTs seek profits on a high volume of transactions. In addition, their profits may well be enhanced by market rebates.  

Consider a second example described in the  Wall Street Journal . In July 2009, Intel, the computer chip giant, reported robust earnings and some traders considered the semiconductor company Broadcom to be a buying opportunity. Many of these traders, to disguise their interest, split their orders into small batches. Broadcom began trading that day at  $\S26.20$  . HFTs with faster access to quotes were able to see that there was a strong interest in Broadcom. The HFTs began buying Broadcom shares and then reselling them to the slower investors at higher prices. The price of Broadcom quickly rose to  $\S26.39$   as HFTs began offering to sell hundreds of thousands of shares. The  Wall Street Journal  reported that slower-moving traders paid  $\S1.4$   million for about 56,000 shares, or  $\S7800$   more than if they had been able to move as quickly as the HFTs.  

# Other HFT Strategies  

Many HFT strategies, including the latency arbitrage strategy illustrated above, are quite simple. For example, many HFT desks are largely replacing the more traditional dealers as market makers by relying on simple  passive market-making , placing quotations in large quantities. Here, the HFT strategy seeks to profit through a simple high volume based on having its own bids and offers taken. In many instances, the firm may be using its quotations to seek liquidity rebates (payment for order flow, in this instance, known more specifically as liquidity rebating) by providing liquidity in markets’ maker-taker models of pricing. As discussed earlier, these markets pay HFT firms for limit orders that they can cross against counter party market orders.  

Other HFT strategies involve seeking profits through cross-asset or cross-market arbitrage strategies or by accessing information or executing trades more quickly than their competition. Co-location, the most rapid data feeds and trade execution abilities, are crucial here.  
Many HFT desks seek to anticipate order flow (including sniffing out competing algorithms, a practice discussed in Chapter 13), and to use superior technology to trade ahead of this flow. For example, by studying the markets for particular securities, their trading histories, the ways that orders are placed in the various exchanges and ATS’s, HFT’s can often anticipate which small orders are merely parts of larger orders. The HFTs then seek to trade ahead of the anticipated slices of larger orders, in many instances, selling at a profit to the traders whose trades they sniffed out. Sometimes, these order antic ipa tors are referred to as “parasitic traders” in that they use traders’ and markets’ costly information acquisition without contributing to price discovery or enhancing liquidity themselves.  

There are a variety of other HFT strategies. Many simply seek arbitrage opportunities trading offsetting positions in EFTs and underlying securities. Even though most HFTs seek to hedge or neutralize their positions (be flat by the end of the trading day), some do seek profits through speculation or by making other directional trades.  

Trading firms can engage in high-frequency trading by obtaining direct market access (DMA) to exchanges and other appropriate trading venues and by obtaining hardware and software necessary for strategy implementation. Software and even strategies can be obtained through brokerage firms, purchased through consulting firms and other developers, or created in-house. For example,  InfoReach  is a provider of broker-neutral software and systems for electronic, algorithmic, and high-frequency trade analysis, management, and execution through its  HiFREQ  algorithmic engine. It is designed to enable traders to create and deploy proprietary, complex trading strategies as well as access algorithms from brokers and other third-party providers. InfoReach also supplies its internal  FIX Engine  as a routing system.  

# HFT Impact on Market Quality  

Market quality might be gauged by the ability of investors to quickly access and trade based on new information in liquid markets. Clearly, equity markets are more liquid and transactions costs are lower than they were 15 years ago before the advent of HFT. While this does not necessarily demonstrate a causal effect between HFT and improved market quality, the volume of trades associated with high frequency trading certainly has the potential to increase liquidity and reduce trading costs. Of course, by definition, HFT is associated with increased trading speed. In fact, substantial empirical evidence does suggest that HFT, in general, increases market liquidity (e.g.,  Hasbrouck & Saar, 2013 ), reduces trading costs ( Harris, 2013 ), enhances price discovery ( Conrad, Wahal, & Xiang, 2015 ), and reduces trading spreads ( Brogaard, Hagstromer, Norden, & Riordan, 2015 ). Brogaard, He nder shot t, and Riordan (2014)  find that HFT firms enhance price discovery by trading in the direction of permanent price changes and in the opposite direction of transitory pricing errors, which might have the effect of decreasing market volatility. Based on his review of approximately 30 empirical papers,  Jones (2013)  summarizes that HFT in competing markets does “improve market quality, reduce[s] trading costs, and make[s] stock prices more efficient.”  

However, this empirical evidence has not been entirely supported by other studies. For example,  Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi, and Tuzun (2017)  found that during the extreme volatility period known as the “Flash Crash” in May, 2010 (see Chapter 13: Trading Gone Awry, later in this book), HFT’s did draw down liquidity as the crash worsened. Loss of liquidity when the market needs it most is known as market fragility; its opposite is market resilience or robustness. While such liquidity draw downs probably did not cause this particular crash, liquidity draw downs can exacerbate volatility in an already fragile market.  
There is no question that spreads have decreased during the period of HFT existence, to roughly   $.003\%$   in equity markets today relative to   $.9\%$   in the mid-1990s. But, how much of this spread reduction is due to HFT, and how much of this reduction is real rather than illusory? Most quotes can be withdrawn nearly instantly by HFT traders, which renders many quotes rather meaningless if they cannot be taken by other investors. Over   $95\%$   of quotes in stock markets are ultimately cancelled. For example, there is evidence that some market liquidity and market spreads are illusory ( Eggington, Van Ness, & Van Ness, 2016 ;  Coffee, 2014 ), in large part due to flash trading and quote stuffing, the potentially unethical practice of placing and withdrawing large numbers of quotes (see Chapter 13: Trading Gone Awry, for details on these and other problematic practices often associated with HFT shops).  

Most HFT activity is based not on costly and time-consuming fundamental research but on simply observing and anticipating the order flow. That is, HFT traders do not normally conduct the costly and time-consuming firm-based research needed to ensure efficient market pricing. Instead, some observers (e.g.,  Brogaard, He nder shot t, & Riordan, 2014 ) argue that many HFT traders free-ride on the costly efforts of analysts and investors by observing and anticipating the order flow of informed investors, and then use their superior technology to advance ahead of the informed trader order flow. Eventually, the inability of slower informed traders to compete might be expected to reduce their incentives to trade, thereby reducing their willingness to conduct the valuable research that is required for market efficiency and optimal capital allocation.  

HFT is a drain on trader resources. The largely socially wasteful “technological arms race” ( Budish, Cramton, & Shim, 2015 ; Section 1.8 earlier in this book) associated with HFT imposes a substantial cost on the HFT trader that seeks the fastest response to new information. In addition, it imposes an external it y on the rest of the industry as each HFT competitor makes similarly large investments to win the race (winning, not placing second or third is key in an efficient market), resulting in a suboptimal ly large industry investment in technologies ultimately rendered obsolete. Winning the race is not the only issue for traders; they need extraordinary speed to avoid having their stale quotes (quotes not based on the newest information or transactions) picked off (taken by faster traders before they can be canceled). Evidencing this assertion of socially suboptimal investments in faster technology, the Tabb Group estimated that trading firms spent approximately   $\S1.5$   billion in 2013 alone to increase trading speeds ( Patterson, 2014 ), also supporting the financial iz ation argument in Section 1.8 of this book. While HFT has enjoyed a profitable run, numerous sources (e.g.,  McNamara, 2016 ) observe that a number of HFT shops are closing as profitability drops and risks remain high.  

# Reaction to HFT: The IEX  

The Investor’s Exchange (IEX) was recognized by the SEC to operate as an exchange in June 2016, after functioning as an ATS as of October 2013. The IEX claims that its rules and technology impede latency arbitrage and “electronic front running,” thereby offering “simple, fair and transparent markets” for its participants.   The exchange was designed to impede the HFT’s ability to exploit slower traders. The IEX forgoes the “fast lane, slow lane” model of order executions, slows down transaction executions and reduces broker conflicts of interest by  
•  prohibiting colocation with the IEX

 •  refusing to make payment for order flow, instead charging a flat fee of  $\S.0009$   per share traded

 •  installing a “speed bump” with approximately 38 miles of coiled cable in front of its order processing system to slow down order entry by a minimum of   $350~\upmu s$   and

 •  accepting only a small number (5) of specific order types: market orders, limit orders, primary peg orders (described below), midpoint peg orders (orders that execute at the midpoint of the NBBO, subject to any limit) and its own discretionary peg orders (described below).  

The speed bump is intended to protect IEX traders from having their orders picked off by HFT traders when the NBBO is transitioning. Without the speed bump, the fastest traders can react to a change in the NBBO, which might be the change in a quote in another market, and then pick off a slower trader’s stale quote placed in the IEX before the slower trader has an opportunity to respond to the new NBBO. The delay also allows a large trader executing on the IEX sufficient time for the remainder of its orders to arrive at other exchanges before other market participants (e.g., HFT) discover the IEX execution and react.  

After contesting the registration of the IEX with the SEC as an exchange on the grounds that its speed bump conflicts with rules that require price quotes to be immediately accessible, the NYSE has initiated a somewhat similar speed bump on its NYSE American Exchange for smaller issues. The much smaller Chicago Exchange has also installed a speed bump.  

Peg orders or quotes are pegged at the NBBO and rise and fall with the NBBO. The IEX primary peg order is essentially a non displayed limit order pegged to the NBBO that executes at or better than the client’s unrevealed limit price. That is, unlike typical limit orders, this limit (bid or offer) does not display as part of the primary pegged order. In effect, the order displays at the NBBO rather than at its limit. Because the primary peg order limit is not displayed, its entry to the order book reveals less limit order information leading to predatory behavior by other traders before it executes. When the IEX “Crumbling Quote Indicator” indicates that the security price is stable, primary pegged orders can execute at the NBB or NBO if the limit condition is fulfilled. However, if the Indicator indicates that the price is unstable, the order will execute only at a price one tick less aggressive than the NBB or NBO, assuming that the limit condition is fulfilled.  

Complicating matters, the NBBO is not a constant, nor does it reflect the best quotes for all traders with different order sizes in different markets. First, a transitioning NBBO might render a slower trader’s quote stale (a stale quote does not reflect the latest information) and vulnerable to being picked off by HFT traders. The discretionary peg order acts as a primary peg order or, when an IEX algorithm (the IEX Signal, also known as the “Crumbling Quote Indicator”) identifies a scenario characterized by a transitioning NBBO or crumbling quotes (identical quotes on multiple exchanges at the NBBO, but, one at a time, rising or falling to a less aggressive range – falling bid or rising offer, until the NBBO itself becomes less aggressive), the algorithm triggers an execution algorithm set by the IEX.   This execution algorithm adjusts as the NBBO and certain other quotes (e.g., quotes that might be competitive with the NBBO given their order sizes or markets) varies. This discretionary peg order is intended to foil predatory behavior by HFT traders. Other exchanges have developed or are developing variants of this order type. For example, the NYSE American Exchange and the TSX Alpha Exchange have imposed delays only on liquidity takers. In some cases, the exchange delays are for fixed periods (e.g., IEX, NYSE American) and in others, they are randomized (e.g., TSX Alpha, Eurex Exchange, Germany).  
The overall impact of IEX innovations is not yet clear. As we have discussed, it is clear from the more general empirical literature that HFT has reduced spreads and reduced transactions costs in equities markets. However, IEX supporters argue that most of these gains have accrued to exchanges and to institutional traders. Empirical findings by  Chow, Lahtinen, and Lawrey (2021)  suggest that the IEX speed bump has further reduced realized half-spreads and trading costs, benefiting individual investors. On the other hand, Aoyagi (2019)  argues that poorly designed speed bump installations can backfire, widen spreads, and lead to increased HFT domination.  Shkilko and Sokoloc (2020)  find that temporary weather-related disruptions in microwave communication networks (see Section 1.8 earlier for a related discussion) that slow HFT reduce both picking-off activity (stale quoterelated exploitation and adverse selection) and trading costs, suggesting that “natural speed bumps” might serve as a short-lived protection for non-HFT investors.  

# 4.9 FLASH TRADING AND SPONSORED ACCESS  

The  Quote Rule , formally referred to as SEC Rule 602 of Regulation NMS, requires that all market centers publicly disseminate their best bids and offers through the securities information processors (such as the Consolidated Tape, Consolidated Quotations System, and the Inter market Trading System discussed in Section 2.6). However, an important exception to this Rule involves quotes that are immediately executed or canceled, defined as occurring within 500 milliseconds of the original quote. These quotes need not be publicly displayed, but may be displayed only to select clients. Such displays are referred to as  flash orders .  Flash trading  refers to trading motivated by private or select market participant receipt of quotes (flash orders) in advance of the public quote stream (also called prerouting displays). Most exchanges have facilitated flash trading at some point, although several have stopped the practice. Flash orders, in effect, briefly (up to 500 milliseconds, but often for as few as 30 milliseconds) display an order that is better than the national best bid or offer (NBBO) in order to solicit NBBO-priced responses. Traders requiring the fastest execution may respond, but the flash trader obtains market information from the flash order regardless. In addition, the flash trader might be enhancing the liquidity of the market, perhaps enabling herself to secure a market trading rebate (payment for order flow). In fact, one might argue that flash orders merely provide an exchange of an opportunity to reduce trading costs for investors by executing on that particular exchange rather than distributing the order to the wider market. Furthermore, most broker clients can opt out of having their orders flashed by informing their brokers of their wishes.  
On the other hand, the NYSE and others have argued that flash orders essentially provide private quotes for select participants competing with the public quote stream, impairing the importance of the NBBO and weakening the market by detracting the pursuit of best execution or best price. While the NYSE did not explicitly permit flash trading prior to 2010, some observers noted that NYSE specialists had the opportunity to act on quote information in advance of the public, although this seems like less of a problem since they were replaced by designated market makers. The SEC and the U.S. Congress have considered banning flash trading. For instance, in its 2009 proposal to ban flash trading, the SEC stated that it was concerned flash orders might create a two-tiered market in which the public does not have best price information access through the consolidated quotation data streams.  

But, flash orders and flash trading might provide opportunities for traders who do not want to make their interest public to participate in the market, thereby enhancing liquidity of that market. In addition to providing enhanced liquidity, the flash trader may simply be satisfying other trader needs for immediacy. While the trader who places a limit order might be regarded as a patient provider of liquidity, the trader who places a flash order might be regarded as an impatient provider of liquidity. Either may serve to improve markets for long-term investors, particularly through the potentially reduced costs of liquidity. Nevertheless, flash orders do provide the flash trader special access to initial trader’s order information as we discuss in the illustration below, potentially impairing the market as we discuss in Chapter 13.  

# Illustration: A Flash Trade  

At 10:00.00.00, a pension fund submits a buy order for 10,000 shares of ABC stock. The NBBO at this time is 10.00  10.05, both quotes on Nasdaq, the offer for 1000 shares. The pension fund’s broker routes the order to Nasdaq, which has the best price, and at 10:00.00.10, the pension fund purchases 1000 shares for 10.05. No more shares are available at this 10.05 offer as Nasdaq’s best offer increases to 10.10. The NBBO changes to 10.02  10.07, with the best offer now being for 9000 shares on Direct Edge at 10.07. Before routing the order to Direct Edge where the best offer is, the pension fund’s broker flashes for 100 milliseconds the order to select Nasdaq HFT traders at 10.06, slightly better than the best offer on Direct Edge. Nasdaq HFT Flash order recipients have an option to react to this flash order by selling 9000 shares at 10.06.  

Scenario 1:  Flash order recipients sell 9000 shares of stock to the pension fund by taking its bid for 10.06. In this scenario, the pension fund saves  $\S90$     $(9,\!00\bar{0}\times(\S10.07-\S1\bar{0}.06)=\bar{\S}90)$  relative to taking the 10.07 Direct Edge offer for its 9000 shares.  

Scenario 2:  Suppose, instead, Nasdaq HFT traders exposed to this flash order react by withdrawing all their offers (Note that  Arnuk and Saluzzi (2012)  report that approximately  $95\%$   of all quotes are canceled) and by nearly instantly buying all 9000 available shares on Direct Edge for 10.07. At 10:00:00.60, HFT traders are offering their shares at 10.09 on Direct Edge, with the NBBO now at  $10.05-10.09,$   with the 10.09 offer on Direct Edge for 9000 shares. The pension fund’s order is routed to Direct Edge, which has the best price, where the fund buys all 9000 shares from HFT traders for 10.09. We see in this scenario that HFT traders made a profit of   $\S180$     $(9000\times(\S10.09-\S10.07)=\S180)$  ) in less than one second by acting on the advance flash order information. Correspondingly, the pension fund paid an additional   $\S180$   due to its order being flashed.  
Clearly, the first scenario above would have been preferred by the pension fund. Actually, this scenario has the possibility of working to the pension fund’s further advantage in a maker/taker payment system; the fund stands to receive a liquidity rebate (unless its broker takes it) should the order be taken at the flash. However, the second scenario, with the share demand being flashed to HFT traders is an example of why flash trading has caused so much controversy, as we will discuss further in Chapter 13. Of course, almost nobody likes a market in which one tier of traders seems to have a consistent informational advantage over everyone else.  

# Sponsored Access  

Another concern to many high-frequency trade critics is the practice of registered brokerdealers providing  sponsored access , where brokers loan their  Market Participation Identification Numbers  (MPIDs) to HFTs, enabling them to gain faster, direct access to markets by bypassing the broker’s trading systems. Normally, brokers and traders must be registered members or licensed to have direct access to a trading venue such as an exchange. Sponsored access enables nonmembers to access trading venues.  Naked access , where orders do not pass through the sponsor’s pretrade risk controls, is of particular concern, since such algorithmic orders could lead to runaway executions.   Naked access might speed the transaction execution from as much as 750 microseconds when the trade is routed through risk controls to as little as 250 microseconds with unfiltered access. Tracking down de stabilizing naked access trades run amok can be tricky because exchanges cannot know where they originated, and the sponsoring brokerage firm must be involved in the identification. While as much as two thirds of equities volume may involve high-frequency orders, perhaps as much as half of these trades might involve sponsored access. In 2011, the SEC implemented a ban on naked access, expressing concerns about “the potential that financial, regulatory, and other risks associated with the placement of orders are not being appropriately managed. In particular, there is an increased likelihood that customers will enter erroneous orders as a result of computer malfunction or human error, fail to comply with various regulatory requirements, or breach a credit or capital 10   limit.” We will discuss problems originating with “unfiltered” trading in Chapter 13.  
Some market observers argue that high-frequency trading enhances market liquidity, bringing into the market pools of securities when other traders need trade counter parties, and providing over half of the total volume in some markets. However, many are also concerned about risks of this high-volume, “trigger-happy” trading, perhaps fed by algorithmic, technological, or trading errors that could trigger massive one-sided order flows leading to failures, contagion, and market meltdown.  

# Additional Reading  

Harris (2003) , Chapters 13 to 18, is a very useful guide for understanding market mechanisms and trading institutions, although it has become somewhat dated.  Kim (2007)  offers excellent explanations of electronic and algorithmic trading technology in Chapters 1 to 3 and 6 to 7.  Schwartz (1988)  provides a dated but very readable discussion focused on equity markets in Chapters 1 to 15.  Lewis (2014)  is a very lively and popular book concerning the conflicts between financial industry participants, particularly those engaged in high frequency trading, and the investing public. The book introduces dark pools, HFT and algo trading in a nontechnical and very readable fashion.

# 4.10 EXERCISES  

1.  Suppose that you are a trader at a large trading firm. You have just received a sell order from a mutual fund for 1,000,000 shares of stock that has an average daily  
volume of 250,000 shares. What alternatives do you have to complete this client order by the end of the trading day?  

$X$  2.  Suppose that Investor  executed a sale transaction at 4.22 when the stock was quoted at 4.21 bid and 4.27 ask, and that another investor’s subsequent transaction executed 4.23. Calculate the quoted spread, the half spread, the effective half-spread and the realized half-spread for Investor  $X^{\prime}s$   execution.  

3.  Suppose that a client of the ABC brokerage firm seeks to have her order of  $X=500{,}000$  shares executed within three hours with the best possible execution; that is, she wants to realize the lowest possible total execution cost B. ABC works with a market impact model that estimates the cost of each of    $n$   equal-sized executions,    $B/n$   to have a fixed component  $F$   and a variable cost component  $v(X_{i}/n)^{2}.$  , where    $X_{i}/n$   is the number of shares traded in any given execution    $i$  :  

$$
B/n=F+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}
$$  

Broker analysts have estimated  $F$   to be   $\S10_{i}$  , based on the order processing costs of each transaction. Market impact costs are estimated with the square root function with  $v$   equal to 0.0001.  

a.  What are the optimal number of equal size transactions and what are the optimal transaction sizes? b.  What are the total market impact or slippage costs associated with the 500,000 share order? c.  Suppose that  $F$   in the market impact model is interpreted differently. Rather than representing fixed administrative costs of a transaction,  $F=r n^{s}.$  , where coefficients  $r=0.1$   and  $s=0.5$   were determined as part of a new OLS regression that still determined numerical values for    $v=0.0001$   and  $m=2,$  , the function  $F$   is now considered to reflect the total slippage associated with  $n$   transactions for stock per hour. Thus, the market impact model is now estimated as follows:  

$$
B/n=F+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}=r n^{s}+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}=0.1n^{0.5}+0.0001(500,000/n)^{2}
$$  

Based on this new market impact model, what is the optimal number of equal-sized transactions and what are the optimal transaction sizes?  

4.  Sniffing algorithms often attempt to discern competitors’ algorithms. In some instances, mere observations of competitor trading activity can reveal information as to competitor strategies, latent demand (icebergs or dark pools), and so on. Beagle Trading is a proprietary trading company that seeks to sniff out its competitors’ trading algorithms in an effort to detect their likely order flows. In an effort to sniff out trade slicing models used by brokers, Beagle intends to rely on the following market impact model estimated from an OLS based on its own trading experience:  

$$
B/n=F+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}
$$  

where Beagle estimates the cost of each of    $n$   equal-sized executions,    $B/n$   to have a fixed component  $F=10$   and a declining variable cost component    $v(X/n)^{2},$  , where  $v=0.0001$  and  $X_{i}/n$   is the number of shares traded in any given execution    $i$  . Beagle observes a particular broker repeatedly placing buy orders of    $c=214$   shares of Stock GMNX in various equities marketplaces. Beagle assumes that these order sizes are optimal given its market impact model.  
a.  Based on the observed order sizes  $c=X/n=214,$   what can Beagle infer about the latent demand for this stock? That is, is Beagle able to sniff out the total number of shares that the broker seeks to purchase based on its market impact model and observed order sizes? Why or why not?  

$F$  b.  Suppose that  in the market impact model is revised to be interpreted and calculated differently. Rather than representing fixed administrative costs of a  $F$   $r n^{s}.$   $r=0.1$   $s=0.5$  transaction,  will equal   , where coefficients    and  were determined as part of the same OLS that determined numerical values for    $v=0.0001$   and    $m=2$  . The function  $F$   is now considered to reflect the total slippage associated with    $n$  transactions for stock per hour. Thus, this revised market impact model is now estimated as follows:  

$$
B/n=F+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}=r n^{s}+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}=r n^{s}+\upsilon(X/n)^{2}=0.1n^{5}+0.0001(X/n)^{2}
$$  

Suppose that Beagle observes that a broker has submitted orders of  $c=214$   shares. Based on these observed order sizes, and with its revised market impact model, what can Beagle infer about the latent demand for this stock? That is, is Beagle now able to sniff out the total number of shares that the broker seeks to purchase based on its market impact model and observed order sizes? Why or why not? If Beagle can infer a latent demand, how many shares does the broker intend to purchase, including transactions already observed?  

5. a.  Prepare an argument to support the view that the practice of payment for order flow diminishes the liquidity of markets. b.  Prepare an argument to support the view that the practice of payment for order flow enhances the liquidity of markets.  

6.  Critics of high-frequency trading often complain that the practice is unfair because most investors do not have the technical ability to compete with the larger, betterfinanced institutions. For example, some institutions pay substantial sums to co-locate trading facilities in exchange buildings to reduce latency. Exchanges have argued that co-location and HFT activities are fair because the fractions of seconds shaved off order routing and execution times are not meaningful. However, Arnuk and Saluzzi (2009) point out that “some of the exchanges make sure that each co-located customer receives equal amounts of connecting cable, so that a server at the northeast corner of a facility has the same latency as one at the southwest corner.” What might this mean about the exchanges’ opinions with respect to transaction speed and unfair advantages in trading?  

7. a.  Prepare an argument to support the view that securities markets benefit from high frequency trading (HFT). b.  Prepare an argument to support the view that securities markets are impaired by HFT.

 8.  Explain how and why a “speed bump” in a particular market might be beneficial to slower traders competing against HFT traders.

 9.  What is the difference between an “immediate or cancel” order (described in Chapter 2) and a flash order?  

10.  Front-running is an unethical and often illegal practice in which a broker, with the knowledge of a client’s order, places her own order ahead of the client’s, seeking to profit from the client’s order, perhaps affecting the market price at which the client executes, or even transacting with her own client at a profit. Describe why many flash order critics regard much flash trading to be a form of front-running.  
11.  How are slow traders’ quotes picked off by HFT traders when the NBBO shifts?

 12.  What are “crumbling quotes”?  

13.  Pegged orders are created to follow the NBBO as it moves. In addition to the installation of the “speed bump,” the IEX has provided the primary peg order, which is intended to protect small or retail traders without the fastest access to markets from traders who can react more quickly to changing market conditions. Why might such orders run afoul of the NMS and the SEC’s efforts to provide traders continuous access to the NBBO?  

14.  When the NYSE reduced the typical minimum tick size (also known as a Minimum Price Variant—MPV) from 1/8 to 0.01, spreads and transactions costs were reduced, resulting in, according to most observers, a better quality market. Suppose that the minimum tick size were further reduced to 0.0000001 for all stocks. How or why might such a small tick size worsen markets and impede quote posting?
