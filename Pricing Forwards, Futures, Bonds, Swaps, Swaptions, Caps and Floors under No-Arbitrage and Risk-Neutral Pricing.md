# **Introduction**

In modern financial theory, **no-arbitrage pricing** and **risk-neutral valuation** form the cornerstone for valuing derivative instruments. _No-arbitrage_ means there are no opportunities to make a riskless profit with zero net investment – put simply, markets adjust so that no “free lunch” is possible . Under this principle, the price of any financial instrument is constrained by the _law of one price_: two portfolios with identical future payoffs must have the same current price. The **fundamental theorem of asset pricing** formalizes this: a market is arbitrage-free if and only if there exists at least one **risk-neutral probability measure** (also called an equivalent martingale measure) under which discounted asset prices follow a martingale (have _fair game_ expected changes) . Intuitively, a _risk-neutral measure_ is a set of probabilities such that all assets earn the risk-free rate $r$ – investors are “indifferent to risk” under this measure, so expected returns in the pricing model equal $r$. Pricing derivatives in an arbitrage-free market can thus be done by taking _expected payoffs under the risk-neutral probabilities and discounting at the risk-free rate_. This is the essence of **risk-neutral pricing** .

  

**Risk-Neutral Valuation:** If $X_T$ is a payoff at future time $T$, and $B(0,T)=e^{-rT}$ is the discount factor (for constant $r$), then the no-arbitrage price at time 0 is given by the discounted risk-neutral expectation: $$V_0 = B(0,T);\mathbb{E}^Q[X_T] = e^{-rT},\mathbb{E}^Q[X_T],,$$ where $\mathbb{E}^Q$ denotes expectation under the risk-neutral measure $Q$. For example, the no-arbitrage forward price $F_0(T)$ of an asset for delivery at time $T$ must equal $\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T]$ grown at $r$, so $F_0(T)=S_0 e^{rT}$ (we will derive this shortly). Similarly, the no-arbitrage price of a call option is $C_0 = e^{-rT},\mathbb{E}^Q[(S_T - K)_+]$ . These results hold _regardless of investors’ risk aversion_, relying only on arbitrage arguments and replication. In a **complete market** (one where every payoff can be replicated by trading underlying securities), the risk-neutral measure is unique, and thus derivative prices are uniquely determined by no-arbitrage.

  

**Replication and Pricing:** No-arbitrage pricing can be approached via two dual perspectives: (1) constructing a **replicating portfolio** that perfectly replicates the derivative’s payoff and equating its cost to the derivative’s price (the classic approach used in the Black–Scholes derivation), or (2) directly computing the **risk-neutral expected payoff** and discounting. Both approaches yield the same result when markets are arbitrage-free. In continuous time, replication leads to a **pricing PDE** (e.g. the Black–Scholes equation), while risk-neutral valuation uses probabilistic tools (e.g. martingales and expectation under $Q$). In practice, risk-neutral pricing is often more convenient for complex derivatives: one assumes the underlying asset’s **drift** under $Q$ is the risk-free rate $r$, simulates or analytically evaluates the payoff’s expectation, then discounts. Below, we will apply these principles to price a range of instruments: forwards, futures, bonds, swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, and related derivatives. We develop formal pricing formulas with **step-by-step derivations**, using consistent notation and an academic tone. Key results from foundational texts (Hull, Shreve, Duffie, etc.) and seminal papers (Black–Scholes 1973, Black 1976) are highlighted along the way.

  

**Notation:** We let $S_t$ denote the spot price of an underlying asset (stock, commodity, etc.) at time $t$. $P(t,T)$ denotes the price at time $t$ of a zero-coupon bond paying $1 at maturity $T$ (so $P(0,T)=e^{-rT}$ if $r$ is constant). We write $B(t)$ for the **money-market account** (bank account) accruing at the risk-free rate, so $B(t)=e^{rt}$ under continuous compounding. For stochastic interest rates, $P(t,T)=e^{-\int_t^T f(t,u),du}$ is determined by the yield curve or short-rate model (we assume deterministic $r$ for simplicity unless stated). Expectations $\mathbb{E}^Q[\cdot]$ are under the risk-neutral measure $Q$. For options, $(x)^+ = \max{x,0}$ indicates the positive part. We use $\Phi(\cdot)$ for the standard normal CDF, and will present formulas in **LaTeX** for precision. Each section ends with a summary of key results, and a final section provides further reading from classic references for deeper study.

  

**No-Arbitrage and Risk-Neutral Foundations**

  

Before diving into specific instruments, we review the theoretical foundation that underpins all pricing results: **no-arbitrage arguments** and **risk-neutral pricing**. In an arbitrage-free market, every derivative’s price can be derived by assuming the existence of a risk-neutral measure $Q$ under which all asset prices (when discounted) are martingales. Formally, if $V(t)$ is the price process of any tradable asset, then $$\frac{V(t)}{B(t)} \text{ is a martingale under } Q, ;\text{i.e.}; \mathbb{E}^Q!\left[\frac{V(T)}{B(T)} \Big| \mathcal{F}_t\right] = \frac{V(t)}{B(t)}$$ for all $T \ge t$. This implies $\mathbb{E}^Q[V(T)] = V(t)\frac{B(T)}{B(t)}$, meaning the expected growth of $V$ is the risk-free rate. In particular, for any **forward price** $F_t(T)$ (the price at time $t$ for future delivery at $T$), we must have $F_t(T) = \mathbb{E}^Q[S_T,|,\mathcal{F}_t]$ (because entering a forward requires no initial outlay, so its discounted value is a martingale). And since $\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T] = S_t e^{r(T-t)}$ under $Q$ when $r$ is constant, we get the classic forward pricing formula $F_t(T)=S_t e^{r(T-t)}$ . More generally, the _First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing_ guarantees that _no arbitrage $\iff$ existence of a risk-neutral measure_ , so we can confidently use risk-neutral expectations for pricing as long as we rule out arbitrage.

  

**State Prices and DF:** Another useful viewpoint is via **state-price deflators** or **Arrow–Debreu prices**. Let $\pi(t,T)$ be the time-$t$ price of a security paying $1 if a specific state of the world at time $T$ occurs (and 0 otherwise). The collection of these prices (for all states) defines a **state-price density** (or stochastic discount factor) $\xi_T$ such that any payoff $X_T$ has price $V_0 = \mathbb{E}[\xi_T X_T]$. In a risk-neutral world, $\xi_T = e^{-rT} \frac{dQ}{dP}$, and $\mathbb{E}[\xi_T X_T]$ reduces to $e^{-rT}\mathbb{E}^Q[X_T]$. Thus risk-neutral pricing is effectively a change of measure that embeds the discount factor. All methods – replication, state prices, risk-neutral expectation – yield the same no-arbitrage price if applied correctly.

  

**Pricing Algorithm (Monte Carlo):** While analytical formulas will be derived for each instrument, it’s worth noting a general algorithm for pricing via simulation, to illustrate risk-neutral valuation in practice:

```
**Algorithm: Monte Carlo Risk-Neutral Pricing**
1. Simulate $M$ independent sample paths for the underlying risk factors under the risk-neutral measure $Q$ (e.g. simulate $S_T$ such that its drift = $r$).
2. For each simulation $i$, compute the payoff $X_T^{(i)}$ of the derivative at maturity $T$.
3. Take the average payoff across simulations: $\overline{X}_T = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M X_T^{(i)}$.
4. Discount this average at the risk-free rate: $V_0 \approx e^{-rT}\,\overline{X}_T$.
```

As $M \to \infty$, $V_0$ converges to the true no-arbitrage price $e^{-rT}\mathbb{E}^Q[X_T]$. This algorithm underscores that once we specify dynamics under $Q$, pricing is “just” an expectation – albeit one often computed via elegant math rather than brute force.

  

With these foundations in mind, we now proceed to analyze and derive pricing formulas for specific instruments, starting with forward and futures contracts.

  

**Forward and Futures Contracts**

  

**Forward Contracts:** A **forward contract** is an agreement entered at time $t$ to buy or sell an underlying asset for a fixed **forward price** $F_t(T)$ at a specified future date $T$. For example, a gold forward might lock in the purchase of 1 oz. of gold at $F_0(T)$ dollars, with delivery in 3 months. Importantly, no money changes hands initially for a forward (ignoring any collateral), so the contract’s initial value is set to zero by no-arbitrage. We consider a forward from the perspective of the **long** side (buyer at maturity) unless stated otherwise.

  

**Forward Price Derivation:** To find the arbitrage-free forward price $F_0(T)$ at inception, we use a classic arbitrage argument under the assumption of constant risk-free rate $r$ and no carrying costs or income on the asset. Let $S_0$ be the current spot price of the underlying. Consider two strategies starting at time 0 and ending at time $T$:

• **Strategy A (Synthetic Forward):** Borrow $S_0$ dollars at the risk-free rate $r$ (so owe $S_0 e^{rT}$ at $T$) and buy one unit of the asset now for $S_0$. This results in owning the asset at $T$ with a net outflow at maturity of $S_0 e^{rT}$.

• **Strategy B (Forward):** Enter a long forward contract to buy one unit at time $T$ for the forward price $F_0(T)$. No cash flow now, and pay $F_0(T)$ at $T$ to receive the asset.

  

At time $T$, both strategies yield the same asset. Strategy A’s net cost at $T$ is $S_0 e^{rT}$ (loan repayment), while Strategy B’s net cost is $F_0(T)$. For no arbitrage, these total costs must be equal – otherwise one could profit by choosing the cheaper strategy and shorting the more expensive one. Thus we require: $$F_0(T) = S_0 e^{rT},.$$ If $F_0(T)$ were higher, one could short the forward (lock in selling at $F_0$), and execute Strategy A (borrow and buy asset) to deliver into the forward, pocketing a riskless profit $F_0 - S_0 e^{rT}$ . If $F_0(T)$ were lower, one could do the opposite: short-sell the asset and invest the proceeds $S_0$ at $r$, and take a long forward to buy back at $F_0(T)$, yielding arbitrage profit $S_0 e^{rT} - F_0$ at $T$ . In summary, **the forward price must equal the future value of the spot price** under no-arbitrage (when the asset has no income or storage cost).

  

More generally, if the underlying asset provides cash flows or has storage costs, the forward pricing formula adjusts for the **cost of carry**. For instance, if the asset pays a continuous dividend yield $q$ (or foreign interest rate in the case of a currency), then the forward price is: $$F_0(T) = S_0 e^{(r - q)T},,$$ which subtracts the present value of dividends from the cost . If the asset yields a known cash income of present value $I$ over $[0,T]$, then $F_0(T) = (S_0 - I),e^{rT}$; whereas if there are known storage costs with present value $U$, then $F_0(T) = (S_0 + U),e^{rT}$. All of these are derived by constructing arbitrage strategies that include the income or cost streams appropriately (treating dividends like a negative cost, and storage as a positive cost). As a special case, a **forward rate agreement (FRA)** – a forward contract on an interest rate – will have a forward rate determined by the difference between borrowing and lending (we discuss FRAs implicitly when covering swaps, as a swap is essentially a string of FRAs).

  

**Forward Value During the Contract:** Once a forward is entered at the fair price $F_0(T)$, its **value** at inception is zero to both long and short. However, as the underlying price moves and time passes, the forward contract acquires a non-zero **mark-to-market value** (the amount one side would pay to exit the contract). Suppose at time $t$ (before maturity) the underlying spot is $S_t$ and the forward price for maturity $T$ (for a new contract) is now $F_t(T)$. Consider a forward contract struck at the original price $K=F_0(T)$. The **forward contract value** to the long at time $t$ is the difference between locking in purchase at $K$ and the current fair price $F_t(T)$, appropriately discounted. Specifically, the long forward’s time-$t$ value $V_t^{(forward)}$ is:

$$V_t = S_t - K e^{-r(T-t)},,$$

assuming continuous compounding. This can be derived by recognizing that a forward can be replicated by holding the underlying ($+S_t$) and borrowing $K e^{-r(T-t)}$ (so that $K$ with interest will be paid at $T$) . The difference $S_t - K e^{-r(T-t)}$ is the net value. When $K = F_t(T)$ (forward price is reset to fair), this value is zero (as expected). If $K$ is less than the current fair forward price, the long forward is “in the money” (positive value), since they locked in a cheaper purchase than the market forward; if $K$ is above market $F_t$, the forward has negative value to the long.

  

**Example:** If you entered a 6-month forward to buy a stock at $K=100$ and after 3 months the stock price is $S_{3m}=105$ with 3-month remaining forward price $F_{3m}(6m)=106$ (assuming some dividends or rates), then the value of your forward contract at 3 months is $105 - 100e^{-r(0.25)} \approx 105 - 100e^{-0.25r}$. If $r=0$, that’s simply $+5$ (you’d have a $5 gain, since you locked in at 100 while a new forward costs 105).

  

**Futures Contracts:** A **futures contract** is similar to a forward in that it obligates the purchase or sale of an asset at a future date for a set price. However, futures are exchange-traded, standardized, and **marked-to-market daily**. Mark-to-market means that gains and losses on a futures position are settled in cash each day, and the futures price is reset to a new level until delivery. Despite these differences, if interest rates are constant and there are no other frictions, the **forward price equals the futures price** for the same maturity . Intuitively, with deterministic $r$, the interim cash flows from marking-to-market can be reinvested at the risk-free rate, leaving no difference in present value.

  

When interest rates are **stochastic**, forward and futures prices can diverge slightly. The daily settlement feature of futures means that if asset price movements are positively correlated with interest rate changes, a long futures tends to earn gains when rates are high (which can be reinvested at a high rate) and losses when rates are low, making the futures more attractive than a forward. Conversely, negative correlation makes forwards slightly more valuable. In fact, **if $\text{Corr}(S_t, r_t) > 0$ then futures price $>$ forward price; if $\text{Corr} < 0$ then futures $<$ forward** . These differences are second-order in many cases, and practitioners often assume forward $\approx$ futures price unless dealing with long-dated contracts or significant rate volatility. We will generally not distinguish between forward and futures prices in the formulas below (taking that assumption, or using $F$ for both), unless noted.

  

**Pricing via Risk-Neutral Expectation:** The forward pricing result can be alternatively obtained by risk-neutral valuation. Under the risk-neutral measure $Q$, the **expected spot price** at time $T$ grows at rate $r$: $\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T]=S_0 e^{rT}$. Because a forward contract has zero initial cost, its forward price must satisfy $F_0(T) = \mathbb{E}^Q[S_T]$ (otherwise an arbitrage via long/short forward vs. underlying would exist). Thus $F_0(T)=S_0 e^{rT}$, consistent with our arbitrage derivation. In fact, we can express the _time-$t$ forward price_ as $$F_t(T) = \frac{\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T,|,\mathcal{F}_t]}{\mathbb{E}^Q[B(T)/B(t),|,\mathcal{F}_t]} = \frac{\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T,|,\mathcal{F}_t]}{e^{r(T-t)}},$$ which again yields $S_t e^{r(T-t)}$ in the simple case. For futures, because of daily settlement, one shows $\displaystyle F^{\text{fut}}_t(T) = \mathbb{E}^Q[S_T,|,\mathcal{F}_t]$ (the expectation under $Q$ without discounting, since each day’s gains are realized immediately). If $r$ is constant, this equals the forward price after accounting for discounting day by day, but if $r$ is random, $\mathbb{E}^Q[S_T] e^{-r(T-t)} \neq \mathbb{E}^Q[S_T]$ in general, hence forward $\neq$ futures in that scenario.

  

**Summary (Forwards/Futures):** A forward contract’s no-arbitrage delivery **price** at inception is $F_t(T)=S_t e^{(r+c-q)(T-t)}$ (where $c$ is storage cost and $q$ yield). The **value** of an existing forward (long position) is $V_t = S_t e^{-q(T-t)} - K e^{-r(T-t)}$, which at $t=0$ reduces to $0$ when $K=F_0(T)$. Futures prices are generally equal to forward prices under the simple assumptions of constant interest rates and no correlations. Both forward and futures pricing illustrate that the expectation under the risk-neutral measure – adjusted for any cost-of-carry – determines the fair price. These instruments have linear payoffs and thus are easier to price; we now move to fixed income instruments where interest rates play a central role.

  

**Zero-Coupon Bonds and the Term Structure**

  

A **zero-coupon bond** (or **discount bond**) maturing at date $T$ is the simplest fixed-income instrument: it pays a single unit of currency (e.g. $1) at $T$ and nothing before. Let $P(t,T)$ denote the time-$t$ price of this bond. By definition, $P(T,T)=1$ (at maturity it’s worth its face value). Absent default risk, a bond is essentially a risk-free asset if held to maturity. However, when interest rates are not constant, $P(t,T)$ will fluctuate as rates move – it’s a traded asset whose price reveals the **term structure of interest rates**. The _continuously-compounded yield_ $y(t,T)$ for maturity $T$ is defined via $P(t,T)=e^{-y(t,T),(T-t)}$. In particular, $y(0,T)$ is the **zero-coupon yield** for maturity $T$. The function $T \mapsto y(0,T)$ is the initial yield curve.

  

**No-Arbitrage for Bonds:** Bonds with different maturities are linked by no-arbitrage: there should be no way to use short-term bonds to arbitrage long-term bonds and vice versa. In practice, an entire yield curve is fitted to market prices of bonds, Treasury bills, swaps, etc., to ensure consistency. A common procedure is **bootstrapping**: starting from the shortest maturities (where yields are directly observed) and solving for longer-term discount factors that match observed coupon bond prices. A **coupon bond** paying semiannual coupons, for example, can be seen as a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds (each coupon and principal is a cash flow at a known date). No-arbitrage demands that the bond’s price equals the sum of the present values of each cash flow using the appropriate zero-coupon rates for each period. If not, an arbitrageur could strip the bond into zeros or reconstitute it to exploit mispricings. Thus, _coupon bond pricing requires a consistent set of discount factors $P(0,T_i)$ for all cash flow dates ${T_i}$_.

  

In a deterministic interest rate environment, $P(0,T)=e^{-rT}$ (with $r$ constant) or more generally $P(0,T)=e^{-\int_0^T r(u),du}$ for a time-varying rate $r(u)$. Under stochastic interest rates, the price is given by a risk-neutral expectation:

$$P(t,T) = \mathbb{E}^Q!\bigg[\exp!\Big(-\int_t^T r(s)ds\Big)\Big|,\mathcal{F}_t\bigg],,$$

which is the discounted expected value of $1. This formula comes from considering a money-market account as numeraire (the _Girsanov theorem_ can be applied to show bond prices are martingales under the appropriate measure). In practice, specific **short-rate models** (Vasicek, Cox–Ingersoll–Ross, etc.) or **forward rate models** (HJM) are used to model $P(t,T)$. But without delving into those, we will assume we know the term structure $P(0,T)$, or equivalently zero rates, as inputs.

  

**Forward Rates:** A useful derived quantity is the **forward interest rate** for borrowing between $T_1$ and $T_2$ as seen today. Denoted $f(0;T_1,T_2)$, it is defined via the relation

$$P(0,T_1) = P(0,T_2),\exp!\big(-f(0;T_1,T_2),(T_2-T_1)\big),,$$

so that $f(0;T_1,T_2)$ is the rate that makes an investment from $0$ to $T_2$ equivalent to investing until $T_1$ then rolling into a loan from $T_1$ to $T_2$. Solving, $f(0;T_1,T_2) = \frac{\ln P(0,T_1) - \ln P(0,T_2)}{T_2 - T_1}$. If interest rates are continuous, this is also related to the instantaneous **forward rate** $f(0,T)$ via $P(0,T)=\exp(-\int_0^T f(0,u),du)$. In a no-arbitrage setting, forward rates extracted from bond prices are consistent with forward contracts on interest rates (FRAs). Indeed, the no-arbitrage price of a **forward rate agreement** that fixes the rate for $[T_1,T_2]$ at $K$ can be found by considering lending/borrowing strategies in bonds: one can show the present value of the payoff is $(f(0;T_1,T_2)-K),(T_2-T_1)P(0,T_2)$ (which is analogous to the forward contract value formula $S - K e^{-rT}$, with $S$ replaced by forward rate and discount by $P$). We won’t derive FRA pricing in detail, as it will be subsumed by the discussion of swaps.

  

**Risk-Neutral Pricing for Bonds:** By treating the bond as the asset and the money-market account as numeraire, one can derive that _each $P(t,T)$ must equal the risk-neutral expectation of its payoff 1, discounted by $B(T)/B(t)$._ This yields the earlier expectation formula. It also implies that trading strategies involving bonds must satisfy no-arbitrage; for instance, a **rolling over strategy** of short-term bonds cannot outgun a long-term bond if the forward rates are set properly.

  

**Summary (Bonds):** Zero-coupon bond prices $P(0,T)$ encode the discount factors for future cash flows and determine the term structure of interest rates. Arbitrage considerations enforce that coupon bond prices equal the sum of zero-coupon bond equivalents. Forward interest rates are derived from zero prices and coincide with FRA rates under no-arbitrage. We now use these concepts as building blocks for pricing **interest rate swaps**, which are essentially exchanges of fixed and floating cash flow streams and heavily depend on the term structure.

  

**Interest Rate Swaps**

  

An **interest rate swap** is a derivative in which two parties exchange cash flows of two different types of interest payments on a notional principal amount. The most common type is a **plain vanilla interest rate swap**: one party pays a fixed interest rate $R_{\text{fixed}}$ on the notional and receives a floating rate (such as LIBOR or SOFR) from the other party (who does the opposite). These payments occur periodically (e.g. semiannually) over a term of the swap. No principal is exchanged in a vanilla swap; only the net interest difference is paid each period. Swaps allow conversion between fixed-rate and floating-rate exposures and are fundamental in interest rate risk management.

  

**Swap as Exchange of Bonds:** A useful way to conceptualize a fixed-for-floating swap is as the difference between two bond positions. Consider a **payer swap** (the party who pays fixed and receives floating): this position can be replicated by (i) **short** a fixed-rate bond (paying coupons $R_{\text{fixed}}$ and principal) and (ii) **long** a floating-rate note of the same notional and maturity. A floating-rate note (FRN) typically pays the benchmark rate (e.g. LIBOR) each period and is reset such that it always trades at par at coupon dates (assuming no credit risk). Thus, at coupon reset dates, the FRN’s value returns to the notional. If we assume the floating leg is tied to a risk-free benchmark, the present value of receiving floating over each period plus getting back notional at end is just the notional amount (because one could just hold that cash risk-free). In fact, at swap initiation (time 0), the **present value of the floating leg** (for the full swap term) equals the notional principal _by construction_ when using the current forward rates. Meanwhile, the present value of the fixed leg is the present value of a fixed coupon bond paying $R_{\text{fixed}}$ per period plus principal. For the swap to have zero initial value (a **par swap**), these two present values must be equal. Therefore, the fixed rate $R_{\text{fixed}}$ is chosen such that the _fixed leg PV = notional_ (since the floating leg PV is notional). This unique rate is called the **swap par rate** $S(0,T)$ for the swap’s maturity $T$.

  

**Swap Pricing (at Initiation):** Suppose the swap pays fixed $R$ at times $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_N = T$ (with $T_0=0$) and floating payments of the prevailing forward rate for each period (so effectively the floating leg will realize forward rates in expectation). Let $\Delta_i = T_i - T_{i-1}$ be year-fractions for each period. The present value of the fixed leg (per notional $1) is:

$$PV_{\text{fixed}} = R \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i,P(0,T_i) + P(0,T_N),,$$

which is the coupon payments plus the notional returned at $T_N$. (We include $P(0,T_N)$ as the PV of receiving $1 at maturity, if the swap is structured to exchange notional at the end – in a plain vanilla interest swap typically notional is not exchanged, but conceptually the floating leg’s final interest plus return to par can be viewed as receiving notional; equivalently, one of the $P(0,T_i)$ terms could be interpreted as including the principal.) The present value of the floating leg is:

$$PV_{\text{float}} = P(0,T_0) - P(0,T_N) + \sum_{i=1}^N P(0,T_i) - P(0,T_{i}),,$$

which telescopes to $P(0,T_0) - P(0,T_N) = 1 - P(0,T_N)$ (since $P(0,T_0)=1$). In other words, $PV_{\text{float}} = 1 - P(0,T_N)$ for $1 notional (this result holds if the first floating payment is known or negligible; a more precise approach shows it equals the difference between par at start and discount factor to end, effectively the same). Setting $PV_{\text{fixed}} = PV_{\text{float}}$ for a par swap, we solve for $R$:

$$R,\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(0,T_i) + P(0,T_N) = 1 \implies R,\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(0,T_i) = 1 - P(0,T_N),. $$

Thus the **par swap fixed rate** is

$$R^* = \frac{1 - P(0,T_N)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i,P(0,T_i)},.$$

This $R$ is the_ **_swap rate_** _that makes the swap’s initial value zero_ _. Each $P(0,T_i)$ is readily obtained from the zero curve. For example, if $T_N=5$ years with semiannual payments, $R$ is such that the PV of five years of semiannual $R_{2}$ payments plus $P(0,5)$ equals 1. If yield curve is flat at, say, 3% continuously, then ${} R \approx 3\%$ as expected. If the yield curve is upward sloping, $R^*$ will be higher than the short rate but lower than long-term rates, roughly an average.



**Swap Valuation (After Initiation):** Once a swap is in place, its value may become positive or negative to a party as rates change. The **value of a swap** at time $t$ (to the fixed-rate payer) can be computed as the difference between the present value of remaining floating payments and remaining fixed payments. Let $R_{\text{fixed}}$ be the original fixed rate on the swap, and let $R_{\text{new}}(t)$ be the current par swap rate for the remaining term (i.e. the swap rate one would get on a new swap from $t$ to $T_N$). Then the **swap value** to the fixed payer (who pays $R_{\text{fixed}}$) at $t$ (per $1 notional) is:

$$V_t^{\text{payer}} = (R_{\text{new}}(t) - R_{\text{fixed}}),\sum_{i=k+1}^N \Delta_i P(t,T_i),,$$

where $T_k$ is the last payment date passed (so payments $k+1$ to $N$ remain) . Here $\sum_{i=k+1}^N \Delta_i P(t,T_i)$ is the **annuity factor** (present value of \$1 paid each period over remaining dates). If the payer locked in a higher rate than current ($R_{\text{fixed}} > R_{\text{new}}$), then this value is negative (the fixed payer is paying above-market, a disadvantage). If rates have risen ($R_{\text{fixed}} < R_{\text{new}}$), the payer swap gains value (positive $V_t$). Equivalently, one can compute the value for the fixed-rate **receiver** as $V_t^{\text{receiver}} = (R_{\text{fixed}} - R_{\text{new}}(t)) \sum \Delta_i P(t,T_i)$ – the opposite sign. This formula comes directly from considering a portfolio of bonds: after initiation, the fixed leg is like a bond with coupon $R_{\text{fixed}}$, and the floating leg is like a FRN that is worth par. So the swap’s value is like long a bond with coupon $R_{\text{new}}$ and short a bond with coupon $R_{\text{fixed}}$, scaled by notional. This results in $(R_{\text{new}} - R_{\text{fixed}})$ times the bond’s **duration-weighted PV**, which is exactly the annuity factor $\sum \Delta_i P(t,T_i)$ .

  

Another way: one can imagine terminating (or initiating an offsetting swap) at time $t$. To do so, one would pay/receive the net present value difference. Thus $V_t$ can be found by computing $PV_{\text{fixed,old}}(t) - PV_{\text{fixed,new}}(t)$ (for the same floating leg), which yields the above result since $PV_{\text{fixed,new}}(t)$ would equal the floating leg’s PV.

  

**Example:** Suppose two years ago you entered a 7-year swap to pay fixed 3% and receive 6-month LIBOR, on $100 million. Now 2 years have passed (5 years remaining). Using today’s discount factors, you find the annuity $\sum_{i=1}^{10} \Delta_i P(0,T_i) = 4.8161$ (for 10 semiannual periods left) . Also, the current 5-year swap rate is calculated as ${} R_{\text{new}} = (1 - P(0,5))/4.8161 = 1.59\%$ . Your swap’s value as fixed payer is $(0.0159 - 0.03) \times 4.8161 \times \$100\text{M} = -  6.79\text{M}$ . It’s negative because you are paying 3% which is high relative to the new 1.59% market rate – you’d have to pay $6.79MM to transfer your swap to someone else (i.e. to receive fixed at 3% when market is 1.59%, the counterparty would demand compensation). Conversely, the fixed-rate receiver has a +$6.79MM position.

  

**Risk-Neutral View:** Under a no-arbitrage pricing measure, each forward LIBOR rate (the underlying for each floating payment) has an expectation equal to its forward value. A par swap initially has zero value because the fixed leg’s promised payments are set exactly equal to the sequence of implied forward floating payments. As time evolves, the realization of interest rates will make the fixed leg too high or too low relative to forward rates, creating value. One could price a swap by modeling the joint evolution of the short rate or forward rates and taking expectations of the net present value of payments, but the linearity of swap payoffs allows the simpler “deterministic PV” approach above. Indeed, a vanilla swap has _no optionality_, so its price is just the difference of two bond portfolios, and one can compute it by deterministic cashflow discounting with the current zero curve (no need for complex optionality modeling). This is why swaps are often used to infer the _risk-free zero curve itself_ from swap rates in the market.

  

**Summary (Swaps):** The fixed leg of a swap is priced as an annuity whose rate is set such that its initial PV equals the notional (the floating leg’s PV). The swap par rate $S(0,T)$ is given by the ratio of “1 minus last discount factor” to “sum of discount factors” . The mark-to-market value of a swap during its life is proportional to the difference between the original fixed rate and current par rate, times the remaining annuity factor . Swaps are thus very convenient to price given a yield curve, and they facilitate the market’s bootstrapping of that curve. Next, we turn to **swaptions** – options on swaps – which introduce optionality and require a further step of risk-neutral valuation (often using the Black model).

  

**Swaptions (Swap Options)**

  

A **swaption** is an option granting the right, but not the obligation, to enter an interest rate swap at a specified future date. There are two types: a **payer swaption** gives the right to _pay fixed, receive floating_ (i.e. become the fixed-rate payer in a swap), while a **receiver swaption** gives the right to _receive fixed, pay floating_. For example, a 5Y5Y payer swaption is an option (exercisable in 5 years) to enter a 5-year swap as fixed payer. Swaptions are widely used to hedge or speculate on future interest rate moves and to add optionality to swap-based products.

  

**Swaption Payoff:** Consider a payer swaption expiring at time $T$ on a swap that would run from $T$ to $T_N$ (with coupon dates $T_{j}$, $j=1\dots N$, $T_0=T$). Let $K$ be the agreed fixed rate (swaption strike). At exercise (time $T$), if the swaption holder chooses to exercise and enter the swap as fixed payer, they will pay fixed $K$ and receive floating. The _market swap rate_ $S(T)$ for that $T$–$T_N$ swap (par rate at $T$ for maturity $T_N$) will determine whether exercise is favorable. The **intrinsic value** of a payer swaption at expiry is the present value of the difference between the swap at the market rate $S(T)$ and the swap at the strike $K$, floored at zero (since one wouldn’t exercise if it’s negative). In other words, the payoff is the **swap’s value to the payer** at $T$, clipped at zero:

$$\Pi_{payer}(T) = \Big( S(T) - K \Big)^+ \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(T, T_i),,$$

times the notional. Here $\sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(T,T_i)$ is the **annuity factor at $T$** (present value at $T$ of $1 per period over the swap, essentially $= \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i e^{-r(T_i-T)}$ under deterministic rates). This factor converts a rate difference into a monetary value. If $S(T) > K$, the payer swaption is in the money (payer can enter a swap paying $K$ when market demands a higher rate $S(T)$, a favorable deal), and the payoff equals the PV of receiving $(S(T)-K)$ over each period. If $S(T)\le K$, payoff is zero (better not to enter the swap). A **receiver swaption** similarly has payoff $\Big(K - S(T)\Big)^+ \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(T,T_i)$ (nonzero when $K >$ current swap rate, since receiver would then get above-market fixed rate).

  

**Pricing Swaptions:** Swaptions are more complex to price because the payoff depends on the entire set of interest rates at $T$ (through $S(T)$ or the collection of bond prices $P(T,T_i)$). A full treatment requires an interest rate model (e.g. Black’s model, Bachelier model, or a short-rate/forward-rate model like Hull–White, LIBOR market model, etc.). However, a common market approach is to use an analog of the Black–Scholes formula known as **Black’s 1976 model** for swaptions . Black’s model assumes the **forward swap rate** $S(t)$ for the underlying swap follows a lognormal process under its appropriate forward measure (with a certain volatility $\sigma$). Under these assumptions, the swaption price can be expressed in closed form, similar to a call option on a forward asset.

  

In Black’s formula for a **payer swaption**, the price at time 0 is given by:

$$V_0^{\text{payer swaption}} = A(0),\Big[,F_S \Phi(d_1);-;K,\Phi(d_2)\Big],,$$

where:

• $F_S$ is the **forward swap rate** (today’s par rate for the swap starting at $T$), essentially $R^*$ for that swap starting in future;

• $A(0) = \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta_i P(0,T_i)$ is the **annuity factor** (present value of $1 per swap period, from 0);

• $\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF;

• $d_{1,2} = \frac{\ln(F_S/K) \pm \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}},$;

• $\sigma$ is the implied **swaption volatility** (assumed constant);

• $T$ is the swaption expiration.

  

This formula is directly analogous to Black–Scholes: $A(0)$ plays the role of a discount factor and size scaling, $F_S$ is like a forward price, and $K$ the strike. In fact, it can be derived by noting the swaption payoff is $A(T)(S(T)-K)^+$ for payer, and treating $A(T)$ as approximately constant (or using the annuity as numeraire, which leads to $S(t)$ being martingale under the _swap measure_). Black’s 1976 paper originally presented the formula for options on futures , but it’s applied to swaptions by analogous reasoning. If we account for discrete compounding conventions, a more precise formula is:

$$V_0^{\text{payer}} = \frac{1 - (1+F_S/m)^{-mN}}{F_S};e^{-rT}\big[F_S\Phi(d_1) - K\Phi(d_2)\big],,$$

where $m$ is payments per year (this factor $\frac{1-(1+F_S/m)^{-mN}}{F_S}$ is essentially $A(0)$ in another guise) . The receiver swaption price by put-call parity is

$$V_0^{\text{receiver}} = A(0),\big[K\Phi(-d_2) - F_S \Phi(-d_1)\big],,$$

or simply the payer formula with $K$ and $F_S$ swapped in sign inside the $\Phi$ arguments.

  

**Modeling Considerations:** The risk-neutral pricing of swaptions can also be done using _Jamshidian’s trick_ in one-factor models (decomposing a swaption into a portfolio of bond options), or Monte Carlo under a LIBOR market model where each LIBOR forward rate is lognormal (the industry standard for consistent caplet and swaption volatilities). The Black swaption formula is widely used to quote swaption implied volatilities. It assumes lognormal swap rate distribution; in low-rate or negative-rate environments, sometimes a normal assumption (Bachelier model) is used instead.

  

**Cap/Floor Parity with Swaptions:** Interestingly, there is a connection between swaptions and interest rate caps/floors (described next) via parity relationships. A payer swaption (right to pay fixed) can be shown to be equivalent to a portfolio of caplets (a cap) with the same strike, and a receiver swaption equals a portfolio of floorlets (a floor), under certain assumptions. Alternatively, one can say: **Cap – Floor = Swap**, which implies by arbitrage that **Cap price – Floor price = PV of fixed-floating difference** . Indeed, if you hold a cap and short a floor (same strike $K$), you will receive payments whenever LIBOR $- K$ is positive (from the cap) and pay when $K - \text{LIBOR}$ is positive (due to the short floor), which net replicates paying floating vs $K$. This is exactly a swap with fixed $K$. Thus, **Cap(K) – Floor(K) = PV(\text{receive floating – pay fixed $K$})**, which is the par swap value if $K$ equals the par rate (zero at inception) . If $K$ differs from par, the difference in cap and floor prices equals the market value of a payer swap with rate $K$. These relationships ensure consistency across the pricing of caps, floors, and swaptions.

  

**Summary (Swaptions):** Swaptions add optionality to swaps, with payoffs contingent on future swap rates. They are commonly priced via the **Black-76 model**, treating the swap’s fixed rate as the underlying instrument . The payer swaption formula resembles a call option on the forward swap rate, scaled by the annuity factor. While we provided Black’s formula (ubiquitous in practice), rigorous pricing can be done with term structure models under the risk-neutral measure. Swaption contracts allow hedging of interest rate volatility and are closely related to caps and floors, which we discuss next.

  

**Caps and Floors (Interest Rate Options)**

  

An **interest rate cap** is essentially a portfolio of call options on a short-term interest rate, often designed to limit a borrower’s floating interest payments. Conversely, an **interest rate floor** is a portfolio of put options on a rate, limiting a lender’s minimum received rate. Caps and floors are quoted in terms of their strike rate $K$ (the cap rate or floor rate) and typically reference a LIBOR-like index over a schedule of reset dates.

  

**Cap Definition:** A cap provides payoff in each period the reference interest rate exceeds $K$. For example, consider a cap on 3-month LIBOR with quarterly reset dates $T_1, T_2, \dots, T_N$. At each reset $T_i$ (when the new LIBOR $L_{i-1}(=L(T_{i-1},T_i))$ for $[T_{i-1},T_i]$ is determined), the cap will, at the next payment date $T_i$, pay the excess interest: $(L_{i-1} - K)^+ \Delta_i \cdot \text{Notional}$, where $\Delta_i$ is the day-count fraction for that period . In other words, if LIBOR ends up higher than $K$, the caplet pays the difference * times the period length and notional (the additional interest cost). If LIBOR $\le K$, the caplet pays zero (the borrower’s rate is at or below the cap). The collection of these call-option-like payoffs for $i=1$ to $N$ constitutes the cap. Each individual option is called a **caplet**.

  

**Floor Definition:** Similarly, a floor pays $(K - L_{i-1})^+ \Delta_i$ on each period $i$ – paying out when LIBOR falls below $K$, thus guaranteeing a minimum rate $K$ to the investor. Each piece is a **floorlet** (put option on the rate).

  

**Caplet Pricing:** Each caplet is effectively a European call option on the interest rate $L_{i-1}$ set at time $T_{i-1}$ for payment at $T_i$. To price a caplet, one usually uses a **forward measure**: for caplet on $L(T_{i-1},T_i)$, it is convenient to use the $T_i$-forward measure (with numeraire $P(t,T_i)$). Under this measure, the forward LIBOR for that period, $F_{i-1}(t) \approx L(t;T_{i-1},T_i)$, behaves like a martingale. Black’s model assumes $L_{i-1}$ (or equivalently $F_{i-1}$) is lognormal under this forward measure with volatility $\sigma_i$. Then the **Black formula for a caplet** (at time 0) is:

$$V_0^{\text{caplet}} = P(0,T_i),\Delta_i,\big[,F_{i-1}(0)\Phi(d_1) - K\Phi(d_2),\big],,$$

where $F_{i-1}(0)$ is the current forward rate for $[T_{i-1},T_i]$, and

$d_{1,2} = \frac{\ln(F_{i-1}(0)/K) \pm \frac{1}{2}\sigma_i^2 T_{i-1}}{\sigma_i \sqrt{T_{i-1}}},$ (assuming caplet decision is effectively at $T_{i-1}$). We also multiplied by $\Delta_i$ because the payoff is $(L-K)\Delta_i$ . This formula is directly analogous to an option on a forward rate agreement. The factor $P(0,T_i)$ is the discount to the payment date. In practice, market quotes cap implied volatilities for different maturities and strikes, and uses Black’s formula to price each caplet accordingly (with interpolation for intermediate).

  

A key point: Because each caplet payoff occurs at $T_i$ but is determined by $L$ fixed at $T_{i-1}$, using $T_i$ as numeraire simplifies the payoff to something like $\frac{1}{1+L\Delta}$ times a simple difference . The standard Black formula accounts for the required convexity adjustment via the $\Delta_i$ factor and discounting.

  

**Cap = Sum of Caplets:** The total cap price is the sum of the present values of all its caplets:

$$V_0^{\text{cap}} = \sum_{i=1}^N V_0^{\text{caplet, }i}, = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P(0,T_i),\Delta_i,\big[F_{i-1}(0)\Phi(d_{1,i}) - K\Phi(d_{2,i})\big],,$$

with appropriate $d_{1,i}, d_{2,i}$ for each caplet expiring $T_{i-1}$ . Similarly a floor price is the sum of floorlets:

$$V_0^{\text{floor}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P(0,T_i),\Delta_i,\big[K\Phi(-d_{2,i}) - F_{i-1}(0)\Phi(-d_{1,i})\big],.$$

The decomposition into caplets/floorlets is possible because LIBOR resets for different periods are independent under their respective forward measures (in a one-factor setting), and because the payoff is linear in these separate pieces. In multi-factor models, one must be careful, but by definition of a cap as a series of individual options, this additivity holds for pricing.

  

**Cap-Floor Parity:** As mentioned earlier, a long cap and long floor with the same strike $K$ on the same dates replicate a fixed rate guarantee: cap pays when rates above $K$, floor pays when below, so together they ensure you effectively always either receive or pay adjustments to achieve rate $K$. In fact, **Long Cap + Long Floor = Interest Rate Collar** that locks the rate at $K$. The cost of this collar equals the cost of a swap that would pay fixed $K$ (because achieving exactly $K$ payments is a fixed-rate bond). Thus, $V_0^{\text{cap}}(K) - V_0^{\text{floor}}(K) = V_0^{\text{payer swap}}(K)$ (the value of paying fixed $K$ vs floating) . If $K$ is set to the current swap par rate, $V_0^{\text{payer swap}}(K)=0$, so the cap and floor have the same price. This is an important consistency check in interest rate models.

  

**Use Cases:** A cap can protect a borrower with a floating-rate loan by capping the maximum interest rate they pay (beyond which the cap payouts compensate the extra interest). A floor can ensure a minimum interest income for a lender on a floating-rate investment. Caps and floors are often structured with notional amortization schedules to match specific loan principals. They trade actively in the derivatives market (e.g. caps on 3M LIBOR for various maturities), and their implied volatilities form the **volatility surface/skew** for interest rates.

  

**Summary (Caps/Floors):** An interest rate cap is equivalent to a series of European call options on the interest rate for each period (caplets), and a floor is analogous with put options. Under no-arbitrage, the cap’s price is the sum of caplet prices, often computed with Black’s 1976 model . The Black model formulas for caplets are akin to Black–Scholes, with forward LIBOR as underlying and discount bond as numeraire. Caps, floors, and swaps satisfy parity relationships (cap – floor = swap) that must hold to avoid arbitrage. These instruments allow market participants to trade and hedge interest rate volatility and to tailor risk profiles (e.g. a collar strategy, which is long a cap and short a floor, can set an interest rate band).

  

**Conclusion and Further Reading**

  

In these notes, we’ve systematically derived the pricing of various financial instruments – forwards, futures, bonds, swaps, swaptions, caps, and floors – using the twin principles of no arbitrage and risk-neutral valuation. We started from the foundation that in an arbitrage-free market there exists a risk-neutral measure enabling simple expected-value pricing of discounted payoffs . We applied this to determine forward and futures prices, seeing that forward prices are essentially expected future spot prices grossed-up at the risk-free rate. We then covered bond pricing and the term structure, emphasizing how discount factors ensure consistency across maturities. Building on that, we priced interest rate swaps by equating fixed and floating-leg present values , and showed how a swap’s value evolves with changes in the swap rate . Swaptions introduced optionality on swaps, and we presented Black’s formula as a convenient closed-form solution . Finally, we detailed caps and floors, breaking them into caplets/floorlets and again leveraging Black’s model for tractable pricing . Throughout, we highlighted arbitrage strategies and intuitive reasoning (e.g. constructing replicating portfolios or using parity relations) to reinforce why the pricing formulas take the form they do.

By consulting these materials, one can deepen their understanding of both the practical formulas and the theoretical mechanisms behind them. Each of the instruments discussed has further nuances (credit risk, collateralization, multi-curves for different interest rate benchmarks, etc.) which become important in real-world contexts. However, the no-arbitrage, risk-neutral pricing paradigm remains the unifying theme that ensures different market prices all fit into a coherent, arbitrage-free framework.
