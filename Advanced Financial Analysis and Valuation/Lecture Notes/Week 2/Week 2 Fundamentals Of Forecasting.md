## FUNDAMENTALS OF FORECASTING

## INSIDE VS. OUTSIDE VIEW

### COMMON BEHAVIORAL BIASES AND MISTAKES

- Humans exhibit a large number of biases in their decision making and forecasting
	   - Rely heavily on mental shortcuts
- Forecasting is central to fundamental analysis and valuation
	   - Estimating the intrinsic value of a company requires longer-term forecasting
		   - Here is where biases matter the most
	   - Event-driven strategies forecast near-term EPS or events
		   - No fundamental analysis necessary
- Kahneman and Tversky highlighted two biases that are particularly relevant for forecasting
 - Tendency to ignore base rates (i.e., unconditional or prior probabilities)
		   - Representativeness heuristic
	   - Tendency to ignore mean reversion
- Analyst forecasts exhibit these biases as well
	   - Competition and market forces do not eliminate them

## COMMON BEHAVIORAL BIASES AND MISTAKES (CONT.)

- We seek patterns and causal relations, even where none exist
- We put too much weight on information that comes to mind easily (or is recent)
	   - Salience and availability heuristic
- We often fail to consider a sufficient range of alternatives
	   - Overconfidence
- Confirmation bias
	   - We underappreciate opposite views and are reluctant to update our beliefs

## FORECASTING AND 'INSIDE VIEW'

- Inside view forecast:
	   - Inside view considers the specifics of a situation, the details of the case at hand
	   - Detailed forecasting of the future based on the history of the project and by extrapolating current trends
- Outside view:
	   - Considers a larger reference class and the statistics of that class
- The problem: Inside view is overwhelmingly preferred in intuitive forecasting
	   - It is natural to bring to bear all one knows about a firm
	   - This is essentially what fundamental analysis encourages you to do
- One of the most common forecasting mistakes:
	   - Relying too much on the inside view
- Representativeness heuristic means that people extrapolate from experience or a case, which they take as representative

## MEAN REVERSION

- Mean reversion occurs whenever chance is involved, i.e., correlation in outcomes is not perfect
 - Implies that mean reversion tends to be stronger in more volatile industries
 - Serial correlation in outcomes is proxy for how quickly reversion should occur
- Thus, mean reversion in sales growth or profitability is not just a result of competition and market forces
	   - Volatility would create it as well
- Mean reversion applies to the population
	   - Doesn't apply necessarily to an individual company (inside view)
	   - But reversion to the mean should be part of your consideration
		   - Last year's numbers might be high simply because of luck
	   - Why does it matter?
		   - Well, if it was chance, then it will not persist into the future

## OUTSIDE VIEW

- Approaches forecasting problem with a reference class
	   - Baseline statistical guidance
 - Much depends on the "quality" of the reference class (similarity)
- Example: Outside view for profit margin
	   - Look at historical time series of the margin in the industry
		   - Say it has rarely exceeded 20% for any company in the industry for 20 years
		   - Well, then you probably don't want to estimate 23% unless you have further info
	   - Base rates are often most useful in telling you that an outcome is unlikely
		   - It is about putting constraints on your estimates
	   - The point is not that outside view is better
		   - But it reduces the likelihood of relying too much on the inside view
- Base rates can be used as a sanity check on inside view
	   - Combine inside and outside view
Suggestions
- Combine the inside and the outside view
	   - Start with statistics and add intuition (rather than the other way around)
 - When we face ambiguous information, we naturally interpret it in a way that is
favorable to our belief
	   - "Statistical info is routinely discarded when it is incompatible to one's personal
impression of a case." (Daniel Kahneman)
- Try to find a larger reference class
	   - Find a base rate for your forecasting variable
	   - In accounting & finance, we often have data to compute base rates
		   - ROIC, sales growth, earnings growth patterns for peer companies
		   - Past M&A deals
	   - See Base Rate Book on Canvas (Useful Material folder)
- Appropriate weight on inside and outside view depends on the situation
	   - The more chance plays a role, the more weight you should put on the outside
view

## ANALYST FORECASTS ANALYSTS' FORECASTS ARE TOO OPTIMISTIC

- Most robust finding in the literature
- Not just true for earnings but many line items (except taxes)
	   - Optimism is especially pronounced in long run forecasts
		   - Hand and Martin (2018): 5-yr ahead EPS are 43% too high
	   - "Walk down" to beatable forecasts towards the end of fiscal year
		   - So short-term forecasts can be too pessimistic
- Sales forecasts are less biased
	   - Easier to forecast
 - Most time spent on sales forecast
- Analysts also tend to be overconfident in their forecasts
	   - Range of forecasts tends to be too narrow

### OVERCONFIDENCE IN SALES GROWTH FORECASTS

### OVERCONFIDENCE IN EARNINGS GROWTH FORECASTS

Where Does Optimism Come From?

- Forecast biases
	   - Overreliance on "inside view"
		   - Analysts typically start with a particular firm in focus
	   - Forecasts tend to be less accurate in industries with high ROA mean reversion
		   - Suggests they insufficiently account for mean reversion
	   - Uncertainty together with motivated reasoning (i.e., buy recommendation)
- Incentives and conflicts of interest
	   - Trade and fee generation
 - Investment banking fees
 - Currying favor with management
 - Institutional investor relationships
 - Career incentives
- Self-selection (and resulting data truncation)
	   - Analysts do not forecast when they have pessimistic views
- Analyst forecasts exclude one-time items which tend to be negative

## LTG ESTIMATES

- Long-term growth estimate
	   - Annualize growth rate (in percent)
 - Typically 5-year horizon
	   - Available in IBES or Bloomberg
- LTG forecasts are overly optimistic
	   - Large forecasts tend to have larger errors
	   - Forecasted long run growth on average 7% (p.a.) higher than its realization
- LTG around equity offerings
	   - Systematically too optimistic
	   - Analysts affiliated to the lead bank most optimistic

## LTG FORECASTS AND STOCK RETURNS

Source: BGLS 2017

- One-year ahead returns to stocks with the lowest LTG forecasts are substantially higher than returns to stocks with the highest LTG
- Possible explanation: Analysts (and investors) inflate the probability of (future) earnings growth for firms whose recent earnings have increased the most
- After exceptionally high earnings growth, analysts think a stock is a Google, but they imagine too many Googles relative to reality (representativeness heuristic)
