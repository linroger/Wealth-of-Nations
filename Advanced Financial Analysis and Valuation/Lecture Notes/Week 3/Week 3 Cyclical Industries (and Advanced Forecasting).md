## ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF GLOBAL FIRMS

Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)

Today

- Industry analysis for cyclical companies
	 - Important and classic industries
- Cyclicality poses problems when forecasting
- While cyclical industries are special, the underlying forecasting problems are more broadly relevant
	 - Base‐year fixation or issues with trend extrapolation arise all the time
	 - Market sentiment cycles & bull/bear markets
	 - Terminal value in your model
- Shenanigans: Often about portraying a trend
- Westlake case - Terminal value considerations

## CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES
- Cyclical companies exhibit a repeating pattern of increases and decreases for sales, earnings, investments
- Examples
	 - Basic materials (e.g., steel, aluminum, chemicals, pulp & paper)
	 - Industrial materials & equipment (e.g., specialty chemicals, construction equipment, machinery, trucks, agricultural equipment)
	 - Airlines, energy
- Why are these industries cyclical?
	 - Fiercely competitive (firms tend to be price takers)
		  - Prices for products change as demand changes
	 - High‐fixed costs
		  - Capacity choices are response to fierce competition (efficiency)
	 - Investments are often cyclical
		  - Managerial choices exacerbate the demand cycles

Example: Truck OEM

## TRUCK OEM: CLEAR CYCLICALITY IN SALES

![](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073117669.png)

- Analysts Carefully Analyze The Cycle Length
	 - In this case, the cycle is about 2‐4 years up and 1‐2 years down

## TRUCK OEM: TRUCKER PROFITABILITY AND TRUCK SALES

![](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073123670.png)

## TRUCK OEM: TRUCKER PROFITABILITY DEFINES DEMAND (CONT.)

![|500](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073128568.png)

## TRUCK OEM: SAME CAN BE SEEN FOR FREIGHT LOADS

![](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073137447.png)
Note: TTM = trailing twelve months = last twelve months TLFI (Truck load freight index) is an index that measures the supply and demand for truck load services Class 8 truck = Heavy truck

## TRUCK OEM SALES AND FLEET AGE

![](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073146565.png)

- Truckers (TL) delay purchasing in bad times and scrap less equipment, extending the average life of the fleet
	 - Exacerbates cyclicality
- How can you estimate average life of equipment in financials?

## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

## COMPETITIVE (AND MOAT) ANALYSIS

- Many cyclical companies operate in fiercely competitive markets
	 - Price takers
	 - Demand‐driven cycle (as illustrated for truck OEMs)
- There are companies with somewhat differentiated products
	 - Specialty chemicals
	 - Equipment manufacturers
- Main source of competitive advantage is being a (or the) low‐cost producer
	 - Economies of scale create a barrier to entry
	 - Few other moats
	 - In rare cases:
		  - Patents or intangibles
		  - Switching costs due to highly concentrated industry (few choices)

## COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS (CONT.)

- Efficiency is key
- Important concept: Operating leverage
	 - What do we mean by it?
		  - High fixed costs  Operating profits increase with volume
- Profitability (And Hence Operating Leverage) Drives Capacity Investment
	 - Trucker example (and next slide)

## CAPITAL ALLOCATION IN CYCLICAL COMPANIES

![](Z.%20Clippings/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073158076.png)

## SUPPLY‐SIDE CYCLICALITY: CAPITAL ALLOCATION

- This Investment Behavior Exacerbates Demand‐Driven Price Cycles
	 - Capacity expansions tend to come in large chunks
	 - Large expansions at the peak translate into excess capacity in the downturn
	 - Expensive to shut down an operation/facility once started
	 - Thus, supply‐side effects make the industry even more cyclical
- Why do cyclical companies tend to invest at the "worst" time?
	 - Easier to get approval or buy‐in with profitability
		  - E.g., board approval is easier
	 - Easy access to financing in booms (bank lending is cyclical too)
	 - Uncertain when cycl competitive pressure

## MOATS IN VARIOUS CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES

## BUILDING MATERIALS

![|500](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073209020.png)
Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- Cost advantages and intangible assets (often regulatory barriers to entry) are main sources
- Companies that produce cement or aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel) with low value‐weight ratio compete in local rather than global mkts
	 - High shipping costs mean that local producers have a cost advantage
- Moats are rare because barriers to entry are usually surmountable
	 - Economic profits are often scant enough to question sustainability for 15‐20 years
- High capital inte small but tenuous spread between ROIC and WACC

## MOATS IN VARIOUS CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES

## COMMODITY PROCESSORS

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073235333.png)
Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- Commodity processor moats are generally built on switching costs, cost advantages, and intangible assets
- Wide economic moats are hard to come by for commodity processors. Cost advantages often prove unsustainable, rarely leading to a moat
- For the other moat sources, we look at how successful competitors have been at replicating a product, process, or technology … The less successful rivals have been, the wider the moat
- Downstream companies nstantly strive to innovate. However, innovation is not easy or free. Thus, we rarely grant wide moats to commodity processors

## MOATS IN VARIOUS CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES

## NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION

![|500](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073249531.png)
Morningstar Moat Analysis:

- A sustainable low‐cost advantage is the main (potential) source of economic moat
- As these companies produce undifferentiated commodities, switching costs, network effect, brands or patents, and efficient scale aren't competitive advantages
- Low‐cost producers with multi‐decade reserve lives are the only potential candidates for a wide moat, but these are rare
- Geological deposits are finite, meaning new resources must be acquired or found and developed. This can be capital‐intensive
- Moats based solely on cost advantage are hard to sustain

## MOAT EXAMPLE: "VERBUNDSTRATEGIE" AT BASE

- Basf'S Unique "Verbund" Structure Generates A Cost Advantage
- What Is A "Verbund"?
	 - Moniker to describe large‐scale chemical production complexes
	 - "Verbund" groups chemical production plants together and vertically integrates production
		  - By‐products of one plant can be used as raw material at another
		  - Heat from production captured and used as energy elsewhere
	 - German Verbund site: 160 chemical production plants, 35K employees, 10 square kilometer area
- Cost advantage:
	 - Lower transportation cost, less energy use, higher production yields
	 - "Verbund" structure generates cost reduction of EUR 1bn (relative to 6.7bn in operating income)
	 - Unique in how they (vertically) link numerous plants together at the same scale

## KEY VALUE DRIVERS

## PRODUCTION COSTS AND MARGINS

- Thin margins aremodity cyclicals: Important to understand production costs
- Example: Alcoa is world largest alumina producer outside of China
	 - Production costs at various Alcoa alumina refineries relative to global cost curve
	 - Curve shows industry capacity and that several Alcoa refineries have relatively low cash costs
	 - Cost curve is quite flat: What does this imply?
![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073304232.png)
## ASSET TURNOVER

- Given thin margins, efficiency is key
	 - Remember the tradeoff between margins and turnover
- Best players are often companies that utilize their asset base more efficiently
	 - Analysts often focus on margins given their focus on EPS and PE multiples
		  - Westlake case
	 - But asset utilization is key to the business model for many cyclicals
- Moreover, asset turnover is key for economic profit & value creation
	 - Recall from pre‐recording:
		  - Economic profit = NOPAT – WACC * Invested Capital
	 - Higher turnover means firm produces the same NOPAT with fewer assets
		  - Implies lower capital charge

## ASSET TURNOVER LE: NUCOR VS US STEEL
	 - US Steel relies on traditional blast furnaces
	 - Nucor uses electric arc furnaces, which require less investment per unit of installed capacity

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073317459.png)

## OPERATING AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE

- High fixed costs (or operating leverage) amplify revenue volatility for cyclicals
	 - Cost stickiness and adjustment costs
- Due to large fixed investments, cyclicals often carry substantial debt
	 - Interest is a fixed cost
	 - Creates substanrisk
- Cyclicals face a dangerous combination of operating and financial leverage
	 - Financial risk analysis is important
- Example: Airlines
![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073327727.png)
Forecasting for and Valuations of Cyclical Companies

## WHAT ARE KEY CHALLENGES?

- Volatile historical earnings makes projections more difficult
- Business and hence revenues and profits often depend on macro factors (commodity price or GDP growth)
	 - Potential problem for analysis: Commingling macro factors and firm factors
		  - Separating view on the company from view on macro and commodity prices
- Difficult to know where we are in the cycle (or how long it lasts)
- Fixation on base year in creating forecasts for future years
	 - Extrapolating past trends for cyclicals could lead to big valuation errors
	 - Current cash flows and earnings depend on where we are in the cycle
		  - Exxon Mobile t slides)

## EXAMPLE: EXXON IN MARCH 2009 (CONT.)

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073343676.png)

## EXAMPLE: EXXON IN MARCH 2009 (CONT.)
- Normalize oil price: Choose midpoint of the cycle and express operating income as a function of normalized oil price
	 - Regress operating income on oil price per barrel over the period to obtain:

		  $$\text{Operating Income} = \frac{-6,395 + \frac{911.32}{\text{(Average Oil Price)}}}{(2.95)} - \frac{\text{(14.59)}}{(14.59)} \quad R^2 = 90.2\%$$

	 - By March 2009, oil price had dropped to $45/barrel. Treating this price as the midpoint of the cycle results in normalized operating income of -6,395 + 911.32($45) = \$34,614
	 - Using a return on (new) capital of 21%, growth rate of 2%, marginal tax rate of 35%, and CoC of 9.44% results in enterprise value of $279.05bn and equity value of $301.66bn:

		  $$\text{Value of operating assets} = \frac{\text{Operating Income} (1 + g)(1 - \text{tax rate})(1 - \frac{g}{\text{ROC}})}{\text{(Cost of capital - g)}} = \frac{34.61(1.02)(1 -)(1 - \frac{}{})}{(0.0944 - 0.02)} = \$279.05 \text{billion}$$

- Subtracting net debt to arrive at equity value:

	 $$\text{Value of equity} = \text{Value of operating assets} + \text{cash} - \text{debt} = \$279.05 + \$32.01 - \$9.4 = \$301.66 \text{billion}$$

- After this adjustrket cap of $320bn seems reasonable

## VOLATILITY OF DCF VALUE AND FCF

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073359284.png)

- For a cyclical company, a time series of DCF values should exhibit lower volatility than earnings and cash flows: Why?

## CYCLICAL VALUATIONS

- Looking at price ustrates why multiples expand and contract
- Still, share prices of cyclical companies tend to be more volatile than what DCF would predict
	 - Potential reason: Analysts and investors do not fully adjust for the cycle

## CYCLICAL VALUATIONS (CONT.)

- Possible Explanation: Anchoring On Current Earnings
- Cognitive biases in forecasting
	 - Anchoring: We (humans) use readily available "anchors" as a starting point when creating forecasts
	 - Cognitive psycholot people insufficiently adjust forecasts from this anchor
		  - Recall: Pre‐recording on Fundamentals of Forecasting
- Analysts do not seem to predict the cycle
- Consensus forecasts current level plus some growth

## IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT CYCLES, ESPECIALLY INFLECTION POINTS

![500](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073738671.png)

## POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS

- "Normalized" Numbers Or Multiples:
	 - Base value on a "normalized" level of profits (e.g., not the peak or trough)
	 - Ask: What earnings, reinvestment and cash flow a company would generate in a normal year?
		  - Essentially use mid‐point of the cycle (see Exxon example)
- "Adaptive growth"
	 - Since cycles can last for long periods, normalization may take a long time
	 - "Compromise" Solution:
		  - Assume normalization in the long‐term (i.e., for TV)
		  - Allow earnings/cash flows to follow the current cycle for the short term
		  - Then, fade growth rate to normalized value for TV
	 - This essentially is a three‐stage valuation model (recall Week 1)
- Scenario Analysis
	 - Create scenarios for different trends

## SCENARIO ANALYSIS

- This approach avoids a single forecast and allows exploration of a wider range of outcomes and their implications
- For example: Use scenarios to develop at least two cycles:
	 - A "normal cycle" based on long‐term trends of profits and ROIC
	 - A new trend line scenario based on a recent trend line
- Steps:
	 - Construct and value the normal cycle scenario, using information about past cycles
	 - Construct and valuenario based on company's recent performance
	 - Develop economic rationale for each of the two scenarios
	 - Assign probabilities to the scenarios using the economic rationale
	 - Combine by comped value

Accounting Analysis

## REVENUE GROWTH (AND NON‐GAAP METRICS)

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073844537.png)
Westlake Case

## CASE QUESTIONS

- Understanding Westlake Operations
	 - How do they create value?
	 - How are they affected by price volatility and industry cycle?
	 - What are the key risks for their business?
- Impact of the cycle
	 - Is the current situation good or bad news for its future performance?
- Forecast future EPS at peak of cycle
	 - Forces you to think about the impact of the cycle
- Would you use this estimate in a forward PE multiple?
	 - Connects it to valuation

# TERMINAL VALUE CONSIDERATIONS

## INFLATION

- With nominal forecasting, expected inflation is embedded in the forecasts
	 - Your growth forecasts reflect your inflation expectations
	 - Individual line‐items can increase above or below the general inflation rate
- In high inflation environments, it can make sense to forecast in real terms
	 - Discuss more in Week 8
- Nominal forecasting also applies to growth rate in TV (e.g., in constant growth formula)
	 - It should include (or account for) inflation
- If g in terminal value is set equal to inflation rate, do I still need new investment?

## MAINTENANCE VS. NEW INVESTMENT

- How do we capture replacement investments in the TV?
- Implicit assumpticing existing assets allows the company to maintain its status quo
	 - Not always obvious
	 - Think about the energy transition and car companies
		  - Would simply replacing existing manufacturing capabilities be enough?
- "Maintenance" investment is not just required for fixed assets
	 - Think about keeping existing clients in a subscription business
![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073908827.png)
## SELECTING THE LENGTH OF THE FORECAST HORIZON

- What have you used in the past? Or what do you see in analyst reports?
- Forecast horizon length is often recommended to be the time over which the firms is expected to achieve a 'steady state'
	 - In steady state, we have constant growth, constant profitability, constant investment rate, etc.
	 - We can then apply simple perpetuities
- In principle, you can pick an arbitrary forecast horizon
	 - Multiples have very short forecast horizons
	 - Hard part is to adjust the FCF accordingly

## SELECTING THE LENGTH OF THE FORECAST HORIZON (CONT.)

- Ideally, the trajectory of forecasts shows growth rates that gradually diminish over the forecast horizon, rather than drop abruptly in the terminal value year
	 - Why diminish?
- You can partition the model into several sub‐periods with different assumptions regarding growth and returns on investment
- ROIC at the end of the forecast horizon should be sustainable given expected competition, industry conditions, etc.
- Ultimately, the kt the length of forecast horizon but to determine normalized FCF (or economic profit) in steady state

## RECALL: THREE‐STAGE MODEL

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073921954.png)

- Use varying levels of detail
	 - Line‐items, then key drivers and fading, then TV perpetuity
- Three‐stage model fades the FCF to sustainable level before using perpetuity
	 - Use value‐driver formula to implement: FCF(1+g)/WACC‐g
- With a short foreu have to work hard on normalization of FCFT+1

## ZOOM (CREDIT SUISSE, INITIATION REPORT)

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073927743.png)
Note in this model, the analyst does not normalize for growth in 2035E:
FCFT+1 = 3,616,092 = FCFT * (1+g) = 3,477,012 * 1.04

## TERMINAL VALUE: FCF ESTIMATE (NUMERATOR)

- You need to spend time on the FCF in your terminal value calculation
	 - FCFT+1 =  FCF in the year after the (explicit) forecast horizon
	 - This is a critical step and often forgotten
	 - This issue is similar to the problem of adjusting 'E' in PE ratios
- How do you estimate FCFT+1?
	 - Adjust SalesT+1 to mid cycle
	 - Use sustainable operating profit margin (industry analysis)
	 - Use sustainable long‐term tax rate (tax credits rarely last forever)
	 - Do not forget replacement investments:
		  - As otherwise how could the firm continue to exist in perpetuity
- This is why it isextend the forecast horizon: It helps you forecast a "normalized" operating profit and the necessary investments

## ILLUSTRATING VALUE DRIVER FORMULA FOR TV (OR CV)

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073936103.png)
Note: In this case there is no spread beyond year 6. You could ignore growth altogether (and CV = NOPAT/WACC).

- Why are we usingis formula?
- Why are we using (1 – g/RONIC)?

## INTUITION FOR VALUE DRIVER FORMULA FOR TV

![](Z.%20Clippings/Attachments%201/Week%203%20Cyclical%20Industries%20(and%20Advanced%20Forecasting)-20240428073943471.png)

- We can show: g/RONIC = (re)investment rate (IR) in steady state (see Appendix)
- Intuitively: The larger g and the smaller the RONIC, the larger the fraction of NOPAT that needs to be reinvested
## RELATION BETWEEN GROWTH AND INVESTMENT

- $$\text{Continuing Value}_t = \frac{NOPAT_{t+1}}{WACC - g} - \frac{g}{RONIC} \quad \text{Allows for adjustment of long-run profits}$$
- Distinction between RONIC and ROIC (new vs. existing invested capital)
- Fundamental relation between growth and investment:

  $$\text{Reinvestment rate} = \frac{\text{Growth rate (stable)}}{\text{Return on capital (stable)}}$$

- Common mistake is to forecast revenue and earnings growth without considering the investment necessary to support such growth:

  1. $$ TV = \frac{FCF_{t+1}}{(WACC-g)} = FCF_{T} * \frac{(1+g)}{(WACC-g)} $$
  2. $$ TV = \frac{FCF_{t+1}}{(WACC-g)} = \frac{NOPAT_{T}}{(WACC-g)} $$

	 - No. 1: High reinvestment rate in T that is not adjusted to lower growth in TV
		- TV is too small (see earlier Zoom example)
	 - No. 2: Positive growth rate without new net investment
		- TV is too large (my point on slide re inflation)
## GROWTH AND INVESTMENT: EXAMPLE
- Example: Valuing high‐growth company ‒ 20% growth rate for next 5 years and 4% thereafter
	-Year 0: $10MM in  operating income)
	- Current re‐investment of $1MM (year 0)
			-So re‐investment rate = 10% (of NOPAT) ‒ 10% cost of capital
- Do you think the reinvestment rate is reasonable?
