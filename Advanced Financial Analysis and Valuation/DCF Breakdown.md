# DCF Breakdown

### 1. PREPARATION AND ASSUMPTIONS
1.1. **Gather Financial Statements**
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Cash Flow Statement
1.2. **Historical Analysis**
- Analyze past performance to understand trends.
1.3. **Assumptions for Future Projections**
- Revenue Growth Rate
- [[Operating Margin]] Improvements
- Capital Expenditures
- Changes in Working Capital
- Tax Rate

### 2. FORECASTING FREE CASH FLOW
2.1. **Forecast Revenue and Expenses**
- Project future revenues and expenses based on historical trends and assumptions.
1.2. **Calculate Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)**

- $$ \text{EBIT} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Operating Expenses} - \text{Depreciation} $$

2.3. **Adjust for Taxes to Get NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Taxes)**

- $$ \text{NOPAT} = \text{EBIT} \times (1 - \text{Tax Rate}) $$

2.4. **Non-Cash Adjustments**
- Add back non-cash expenses (e.g.,  Depreciation & Amortization).
1.5. **Changes in Working Capital**
- Calculate the change in working capital and adjust the cash flow accordingly.
- $$ \Delta \text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Year Working Capital} - \text{Previous Year Working Capital} $$

2.6. **Capital Expenditures (CapEx)**
- Subtract capital expenditures to get Free Cash Flow (FCF).
- $$ \text{FCF} = \text{NOPAT} + \text{Depreciation} - \Delta \text{Working Capital} - \text{CapEx} $$

### 3. DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINATION
3.1. **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) for Firm Valuation**

- $$ \text{WACC} = \frac{E}{V} \times Re + \frac{D}{V} \times Rd \times (1 - Tc) $$
- Where:
	- $E$ = Market value of the equity
	- $D$ = Market value of the debt
	- $V$ = $E + D$
	- $Re$ = Cost of equity
	- $Rd$ = Cost of debt
	- $Tc$ = Corporate tax rate
1.2. **Cost of Equity (Using CAPM)**

- $$ Re = Rf + \beta \times (Rm - Rf) $$
- Where:
		- $Rf$ = Risk-free rate
		- $\beta$ = Beta of the stock
		- $Rm$ = Expected market return

### 4. FORECASTING AND DISCOUNTING CASH FLOWS
4.1. **Forecasting Cash Flows**
- Project the free cash flows over a 5 to 10 year period based on the assumptions.
1.2. **Terminal Value Calculation**
- Gordon Growth Model: \(\text{TV} = \frac{\text{FCF}_{n+1}}{(WACC - g)} \)
- Where:
- \(g\) = growth rate to perpetuity
- \(FCF_{n+1}\) = Free cash flow in the first year beyond the forecast period
1.3. **Discount Cash Flows and Terminal Value to Present Value**

- $$ \text{DCF} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1+WACC)^t} + \frac{\text{TV}}{(1+WACC)^n} $$

### 5. VALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
5.1. **Calculate Enterprise Value**
- Sum of the present values of forecasted Free Cash Flows plus the present value of the Terminal Value.
1.2. **Adjust for Non-Operating Assets**
- Add value of non-operating assets (e.g.,  investments).
1.3. **Subtract Debt and Add Cash**
- To find Equity Value: \(\text{Equity Value} = \text{Enterprise Value} - \text{Debt} + \text{Cash} \)
1.4. **Sensitivity Analysis**
- Vary key assumptions (WACC,  growth rates) to test the sensitivity of the valuation.
### 6. CONCLUSION AND REPORTING
- Present your findings,  including the valuation range based on the sensitivity analysis.
- Discuss key assumptions and their impact on the valuation.
