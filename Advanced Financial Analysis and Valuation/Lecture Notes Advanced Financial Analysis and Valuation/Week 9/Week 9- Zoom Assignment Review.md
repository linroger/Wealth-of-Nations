# ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF GLOBAL FIRMS

Zoom  - Valuing a SaaS Business

## SAAS AND ZOOM
 - Bernstein Research (Feb 2021): With low interest rates bulk of DCF value is in TV and "quasi-unforecastable"
 - Example: Zoom valuation
	- JPM in Nov 2020

## SAAS VALUATION (USING SALES MULTIPLE)
 - Common method for valuing SaaS firms is using a multiple based off of ARR:
	- ARR x Multiple = Value
 - Key factors for adjusting the multiple:
	- Growth, TAM (total addressable market), revenue retention, CAC (customer acquisition cost), gross margins
 - TAM estimates:
‒S-1 estimated unified communications (UC) market @ $43bn by 2022
	- J.P. Morgan estimates TAM of ~40bn
‒TAM could increase with use case expansions (education, phone)
	- Morgan Stanley estimates TAM of $100bn+ due to a combination of
traditional UC market + combined education and UC market
 - Stock price went from $207 in June to $337 in December 2020

## ZOOM VALUATION USING VALUE DRIVER MODEL
 - Use long-term estimates of ARR, TAM, and NOPAT margin to calculate valuation 10 or 15 years out
	- Like a TV calculation
	- "Starting with the future" (Week 4)
 - Key assumptions:
	- Long-term TAM range of $40-$100bn
	- Long-term Zoom market share range of 30% to 50%
	- Long-term NOPAT margin of 15% to 20%
		- Based on more established SaaS companies
	- Asset turnover around 2
		- Currently below 1.5, but SaaS model allows for economies of scale
 - Remember ROIC = NOPAT margin x Asset turnover
	- Above assumptions imply RONIC = 30-40%
	- Salesforce 8%, Workday 65%, Servicenow 34%, Oracle 28%

## ZOOM: FUNDAMENTAL VALUATION

 ![500](849ae76a3a9a8dc7b58678ba4e5b783c.png)
Share price in Dec 2020 = $337

## ZOOM VALUATION: SUMMARY
 - Scenario analysis to estimate range of implied price per share
 - It is hard to justify the $337 price with our analyst-based range of assumptions, even fixing long-term assumptions at the high end of range
 -  ![500](2ed2e990b4f8d2c5d375b60367140122.png)
 - TAM estimates have not changed much
	- Still at $86bn in August 2021

## JPM VALUATION (NOV 2020): PRICE TARGET ($450)

 - Note that the NOPAT is smaller than FCF  - why?
	- We add back D&A, but there is also CAPEX
	- Use FCF = OCF  - CAPEX
	- What about stock-based compensation?
		- OCF is adjusted for stock compensation
		- You should treat it as if it were cash

## HOW DID THE ANALYST TREAT SBC?
- Note the future dilution:

## JPM: TAM CLAIM
 - JPM: $40bn TAM estimate
 - Claim: "…only needs to see that penetration get to roughly one-third."
	- Revenue = $40bn x 1/3 = 13.3bn     - NOPAT estimate implies revenue of $28.8bn or 72% market share
		- 28.8 = 5.7bn @20% margin
	- Alternatively, NOPAT estimate and 20% margin imply much larger TAM
		- TAM = 28.8/0.333 = $86bn
 - You cannot get to their price target of $450 with $86bn TAM or 70% market share
	- Not even close (try it with the assignment spreadsheet:)
