# Week 5 Accounting RecapR&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill
- Assuming a useful life of 5 years:

#### DOES CAPITALIZATION MATTER? (CONT.)
- Note Reversal In Profits:
 ![500](362ef8d8cf2d5b0e3a9af9f015e5acfe.png)

#### WHEN DOES CAPITALIZATION MATTER?
- Firm growth,  so R&D keeps growing:
-  ![500](f3e598114304fa21a358caf916b8b665.png)

#### CONSEQUENCES FOR VALUATION

- Capitalization doesn't matter in steady state
	- But with growth (differences),  we have systematic effects on profits and assets
	- Affects profitability ratios
- Accounting creates additional inconsistencies depending on firms' growth strategies
	- Organic growth and self‐generated assets are not capitalized
	- Acquiring these assets brings them on the balance sheet
	- Creates inconsistencies across peer firms

# M&A ACCOUNTING 101

##### M&A ACCOUNTING 101
- Once the acquisition closes,  acquirer must allocate the purchase price
- Step #1 = Identify assets & liabilities @ fair value
	- Identifiable acquired assets & assumed liabilities from target's balance sheet
	- Identifiable [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets (e.g.,  value of brand name)
		- There are likely more newly recognized [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangibles]] (both finite‐lived and infinitely‐lived) for intangible‐intensive targets/industries
		- Valuation usually done with help of external consultants
- Step #2 = Assign rest of purchase price to [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]]
	- Goodwill = purchase price less identified assets & liabilities at fair value
	- Goodwill is tested annually for impairment

##### M&A ACCOUNTING 101: ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE
- Assume Big Buys Little For $50Mm. Little Has Net Assets Of $15Mm
	- Little has net assets of $15M: $5M cash,  $5M A/R,       $10M PPE,  $5M debt
		- Big determines that the value of Little's PPE should be stepped up by $5M to meet fair value of the assets
		- Big identifies that Little has [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets worth $5M
	- Therefore,  Big books [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] of $50MM – ($15MM + $5MM + $5MM) = $25MM

#### HISTORY OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

- Goodwill used to be amortized over long horizon
	- M&A transactions created permanent "earnings drag"
	- One could argue the amortization assured that managers had to earn what they paid in the acquisition
- There were two ways to account for M&A transactions
	- Purchase method
	- Pooling of Interest method (no [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]])
	- Firms had strong preference for pooling (to avoid amortization)
- FASB eliminated pooling but stipulated that [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] is reviewed for impairment
	- More details on next slide,  but involves determining if FV of [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] declined
	- In principle,  good idea
	- But it gives massive discretion to firms

#### GOODWILL WRITE‐DOWN AT KRAFT HEINZ

- 15.4 billion write down on brands
	- Due to changing consumer taste
	- Kraft and Oscar Mayer trademarks
	- Assets less valuable than at merger in 2015
- Leading to SEC reaction:
	- Subpoena for policies,  procedures and internal controls related to procurement
- Poor fourth quarter earnings
	- $12.6 billion net loss (in fourth quarter)
	- Kraft missed analysts' estimates
	- Dividend cut (by 22.5 cents to 40 cents)
- Key point:
	- It is not [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] per se that matters but what we learn from write‐down about future of the company
	- In this case,  write down signaled considerable issues

# INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP

[[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]]

##### PE VS. EBITA MULTIPLES IN PHARMA

 ![500](d30041ded7cc0ce53aaa99538462f1a9.png)

- Remember: Koller et al. (Chapter 16) recommend EBITA multiple
- They exclude acquisition-related amortization from EBIT: Why?
	- Makes firms that grow organically vs. through M&A more comparable
	- Amortization related to other [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D,  Intangibles,  M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangibles]] related to operations (e.g.,  software) should be left in EBIT
- Forward‐looking operating multiples reflect long‐term prospects
	- Implied growth rates and cost of capital seem fairly similar
