### MOAT SOURCES IN HEALTH CARE SECTOR

- Frequency of moats is high in health care sector
	 - Substantial entry barriers and start‐up costs
	 - But moat sources depend on type of industry (within sector)

### DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE FIRMS AND BUSINESS MODELS
- Pharmaceuticals
	 - Tend To Have (Wide) Moats Based On Intangibles (I.E.,  Patents; Usually 20 Years)
	 - But Long Research And Approval Process Implies That Effective Patent Protection is shorter than 20 years
 - Key considerations:
	   - Diversity of drug portfolio and patent expiry
	   - Development and pipeline of new drugs
	   - Size of pharma company (e.g.,  funding,  ability to manage and sustain long process)
	   - Market size (heart disease,  cancer) & substitutes – disease websites (e.g.,  cancer.gov)
- Biotech companies (biologic drugs as opposed to be chemical)
	 - Tend to be smaller and riskier,  more like options
	 - Biotech risk is often idiosyncratic
	 - Again,  size of the market is a key consideration
 - Valuation often requires decision trees or scenario analysis

### DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE FIRMS & BUSINESS MODELS (CONT.)
- Medical Device Companies
	 - Make implantable hardware for human body
	 - Moat sources tend to be intellectual property (intangibles) but also physician relationships (switching costs)
		   - Marketing and sales force
		   - Training and tools for implants
 - Compared to pharma,  innovation tends to be more evolutionary rather disruptive or revolutionary
	   - Though lately pharma is characterized by lots of "me‐too" drugs
- Managed care & insurance companies
	 - Subject to intense regulatory pressure
	 - Economies of scale can provide cost advantages
	 - Network effects

# PHARMA VALUE DRIVERS

#### VALUE DRIVERS AND FORECASTING IN PHARMA

![](84b7320739ff37f30e441c5fba72f077.png)

- High profit margins
	 - Patent protection
- Substantial investments
	 - R&D
		 - Low turnover (if capitalized)
- Evaluation of drug pipeline
	 - Patent expiry
	 - New patent applications and clinical trials
- Substantial medical expertise is required
- Analysts model revenues of key drugs and pipelines separately
	 - See illustrations below

# CF SHENANIGANS HEALTH CARE & PHARMA

##### SINOPHARM: FINANCING PAYABLES

![](e44581f0a2284d081ed2538702ba4c2d.png)

- The company appears to report borrowings as AP to boost OCF

##### CF SHENANIGANS: CITI AND ENRON

![](6486f3f856683857ff32d06b08654741.png)

- From 1998 to 2001 Citi and Enron engaged in a series of transactions to "create" operating cash inflows for Enron
- A large share of these transactions was structured as prepay transactions
	 - Each transaction seemingly transfers commodity risk
	 - Jointly,  no commodity risk is transferred and Enron essentially receives a short-term loan,  but it classifies the cash inflow as operating cash flow
		   - Future fixed payment of $255.6 million
		   - Upfront payment of $249.5 million

# IMPORTANCE OF INTANGIBLES
#### IMPORTANCE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

![](a33303a2ea6bca83e2ccd75601c0f3e4.png)

- Shift from manufacturing to service & technology
- Many key assets of firms are intangibles:
	 - R&D and patents
	 - Brands and advertising
	 - Training and human capital investments

#### R&D SPENDING AND INTANGIBLE INTENSITY BY SECTOR

![](a9087ef70cbec01209e8c577be2c5322.png)

#### ECONOMICS OF INTANGIBLES

- What makes intangibles special?
	 - Non‐rival: Can be consumed by many
	 - Non‐excludable: Hard to prevent the use by others
- Scalability
	 - Large upfront costs,  few costs later (e.g.,  drug molecule or biologic)
	 - Network effects
- Sunkenness
	 - Tangible assets retain more resale value due to their standardization
- Spillovers
	 - Non rival and non excludable leads to imitation
- Synergies
	 - Innovation arises from combining technologies that already exist
- Intangible investments often yield extreme outcomes
	 - Complete loss (ROI = ‐100%)
	 - High or even monopolistic profitability (ROI >> 15%)

# ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF INTANGIBLES
#### INTANGIBLES ON THE BOOKS

![](369a08ee4574b383447f21d87e898435.png)

#### ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF INTANGIBLES

- Core idea behind the accounting treatment of investments:
	 - Any expenditure that creates benefits over many years is an investment (or asset)
	 - Expenditures that generate benefits only in current year are operating expenses
	- Therefore,  capital expenditures for PP&E are investments
- But intangibles also generate future benefits and require capital expenditures:
- Accountants have treated these expenditures as operating expenses
	 - Unless they acquired in market transaction
	 - Acquired intangibles (e.g.,  via M&A,  etc.) are capitalized and amortized
- Since the TCJA,  IRS also requires amortization of R&D (5 years)

#### INTANGIBLE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT JUST R&D

![](df7f85cf2a126f51f4e00cd2d16e3620.png)

#### EVIDENCE FROM SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS

![](f950b800375105f320c2b472a4b97477.png)

 - Source: Dechow,  Ge,  Larson,  and Sloan (2008)

#### IMPROPER CAPITALIZATION
- Improper capitalization of costs goes straight to the bottom line
	 - Could be used to increase profits
- American Italian Pasta Company (AIPC):
	 - From 2002 through 2Q04,  AIPC met EPS targets due to improper capitalization
	 - For example,  AIPC capitalized more than $10 million of internal pasta manufacturing costs as long‐lived manufacturing assets
	 - AIPC also capitalized $1.4 million of labor costs related to internal management information systems (MIS) to long‐lived IT assets
	- Illustrates the concern that companies "make up" assets

#### DOES THE MARKET TREAT R&D EXPENDITURES AS EXPENSES?
- Even though many intangible investments are not capitalized,  there is info in 10‐K:
	 - R&D expenses are disclosed:
		   - Income statement,  cash flow statement and R&D footnote
		   - But recall: R&D expenses can be buried in COGS and SG&A
- Academic evidence suggests that investors understand the "investment" nature of these expenditures
	 - Market pricing of R&D and marketing expenses is positive (but also hampered by lack of detailed information)

# ONCOMED ‐ AN EXAMPLE

### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED)

![](c024a455c4435622cb42b8a1c46fe48e.png)

- OncoMed is a clinical‐stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel therapeutics for cancers
	 - In April 2019,  acquired by Mereo Biopharma (no longer listed)
- Four internally discovered anti‐cancer therapeutic candidates:
	 - Navicixizumab
	 - Anti‐TIGIT
	 - GITRL‐Fc
	 - Rosmantuzumab

#### R&D EXPENSES (AND STOCK COMP)

- Note: They had a large A/R that Celgene owed them as a result of a safety milestone in a trial. Payment in 2016 reduced assets (A/R) and hence NOA.
 - Source: OncoMed Pharmaceutical Annual Reports

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED): SUMMARY

- From 2011‐2017 OncoMed has recorded revenue of $222.6M and has spent $468.9M in R&D
	- Over same period,  accumulated increase in NOAs of just $72.6M
	- Their financials are more affected by payments due to strategic alliances than their operations
- Cash and short‐term investments represent the bulk of their assets
	- No financial debt at this stage of the life‐cycle
	- Most of the capital is raised via equity
- Accounting numbers do not make much sense
	- In 2016,  OncoMed reports negative NOA
	- Very low (or even negative) reinvestment rates (as a percentage of revenue)
	- This contrasts with the high R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue

### CONSEQUENCES FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & VALUATION

- How does lack of capitalization affect profits and ROIC?
	- Effect on profit depends on growth
	- Regardless,  book value/invested capital is understated
	- Thus,  ROIC is overstated
- How does lack of capitalization affect valuation?
	- In principle,  no effect on DCF or Economic Profit models
	- Cash flows are not affected
- So why do we care?
	- Capitalization can influence your view of true economic profitability (and hence your forecasting)
	- Link between investments and value creation (future benefits)

#### CONSEQUENCES FOR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS & VALUATION (CONT.)

- Relative valuation and terminal value calculations become even trickier:
	- Reinvestment is buried in operating expenses
	- Recall: Reinvestment is a function of RONIC and growth (Week 3 & 4)
- Accounting treatment can distort RONIC in TV formula
	- Conceptually,  you expect a higher RONIC without capitalization of intangible investments (see previous slide)
- Recall pre‐recording: Accounting treatment creates incomparability depending on firms' growth strategies

# ECONOMIC PROFIT MODEL AND THE EFFECT OF INTANGIBLES

#### REVIEW: ECONOMIC PROFIT MODEL

![](33054fb774fdb70541a85aeccbca903b.png)

- Covered the EP model in Week 3 (see also Chapter 8 in Koller et al.)

#### TERMINAL VALUE FOR ECONOMIC PROFIT MODEL

![](a16d8537389ad7507453417cc5b39d02.png)

- What is a reasonable prediction for the terminal value in economic profit model?
	- Think about the numerator of the TV equation
- By their very definition,  economic profits (EP) are hard to sustain:
	- Positive EP → Competitors enter
	- Negative EP → Takeover,  management fired,  restructuring,  etc.
	- Thus,  small or zero terminal value after several years is not unreasonable
- We should see decay in economic profits

#### WHY MIGHT ECON PROFITS PERSIST (EVEN WITH COMPETITION)?

- Economic Profit Is Based On Accounting Numbers
	- We measure true economic profits only if invested capital is valued properly
- But consider how operating assets (or book value of equity) are valued:
	- What happens if IC is incorrectly measured?
	- Why might IC be typically too low?
		- Self‐generated intangibles: Our topic of the week
- If book value does not capture intangible assets:
	- Accounting‐based EP is too high (as cost of capital charge given IC is too low)
- Thus,  there are two sources of accounting‐based economic profits
	- True economic profits & accounting measurement
- As noted earlier,  this insight also has implications for the terminal value:
	- Accounting‐based EP (based on understated IC) may persist beyond the point where true economic profits are zero

#### TERMINAL VALUE FOR ECONOMIC PROFIT MODEL (CONT.)

- Does EP model still work for valuation?
	- Equality with DCF holds for any (clean‐surplus) accounting system
		- EV(DCF) = EV(EP) → See pre‐recording
- Thus,  it does not matter for value whether or not a firm capitalizes R&D
	- Bias in accounting does not invalidate accounting‐based valuation
	- But: Accounting measurement matters for the magnitude of TV

#### ILLUSTRATING R&D CAPITALIZATION IN EP MODEL

- Assume two companies that are identical except,
	- Firm A expenses R&D;
	- Firm B capitalizes R&D,  and amortizes it over two years
- Firm A's accounting is said to be more conservative,  but does it matter for valuation?
	- Core idea: Accounting just allocates cash flows through time; it does not change them
	- Over the life of an asset or a firm: Sum CFs = Sum Profits
		- Follows from "clean surplus"
- To illustrate make following assumptions:
	- Assume cost of capital = 10%
	- Beginning book value = $200 (i.e.,  end of prior year)
	- Useful life of R&D is 2 years

#### ILLUSTRATING R&D CAPITALIZATION IN EP MODEL (CONT.)

![](a7e275cb3ea5b7879e7a034f551a1b68.png)
Note: Sum of total profits is 117.6 in both cases and taxes are based on IRS,  not GAAP profits

#### BENEFITS OF EP APPROACH IN PRACTICE

- EP and DCF should give the same answer!
	- So what does EP add beyond DCF?
- EP helps us better understand value creation and economic performance
	- It can improve our forecasting (i.e.,  understanding of the firm)
	- It makes you think more critically about TV and long‐term value creation
- EP model provides a link to market‐to‐book ratio
	- Difference between book value and market value: PV of future EPs
- EP model lends itself to reverse engineering
	- Analysts provide earnings forecasts that you can use directly as inputs
- Using both DCF and ABV should help the internal consistency of your model and the plausibility of your assumptions

# ADJUSTING FOR INTANGIBLES IN INTRINSIC VALUE MODELS (DCF & EP)

#### ADJUSTING FOR INTANGIBLES IN DCF (OR EP) MODELS
- Irrespective Of The Accounting Standards,  You Could Capitalize R&D Expenses
	- Could do the same with other operating expenses that are really investments
	- FCF does not change,  but adjusting for intangibles likely provides more meaningful profitability and reinvestment rates
	- Again: It is about the insights you gain into the economics of the firm and how that affects your forecasts!
- Assumption needed: How long does it take for R&D to be converted,  on average,  into commercial product?
	- Useful life of research asset = amortization period
	- R&D expenses (or research assets) at a pharmaceutical company should have fairly long lives
	- R&D expenses (or research assets) at software firms should have shorter lives

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED) – CONT

- Adjusting earnings,  reinvestment rates,  and book value:
- Let's assume that R&D is amortized over a life of 10 years
	- Research stage lasts between 5-15 years
	- Post-approval protection period often not much longer than 10 years
	- Koller recommends 8-12 years
- From OMED's 424(b)4 filing (form filed prior to IPO on NASDAQ) and later SEC filings,  we collect R&D expenses from 2007-2017
	- OMED went public in July 2013,  but was incorporated in 2004

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED) – CONT

![](e61dcf5663021e15a18582a054e9d511.png)

- Perhaps easier to understand if you read backwards from 2017:
	- R&D from 2007 is now fully amortized (fraction = 0; last A = 2.8; no value left)

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED) – EBIT

- EBIT is adjusted by treating R&D as capital expenditures (like for PP&E)
- This implies:
	- 1) adding back all R&D expenditures
	- 2) subtracting the periodic amortization of the research asset(s)
- Companies with growing R&D expenditures will have a higher EBIT after the adjustment
	- In this case,  the difference in EBIT is not huge:
	- ![](db7b4d11286cdc6efa032b2b7cbb8b80.png)

```latex
Adjustment for Operating Income       EBIT  
                                      -41.0
(+) R&D expenditures                   59.8
(-) Amortization of research asset     53.8
                                     ------
Adjusted EBIT                         -34.9
```

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED) – NOA

![](587e83eac4b73d3093c9dd5c7c3a6ab4.png)

- NOA is also adjusted adding the estimated value of the research asset(s)
	- In thisContinuing from where I left off:

#### ONCOMED PHARMACEUTICALS (OMED) – NOA

- NOA is also adjusted adding the estimated value of the research asset(s)
	- In this case = $373.5m
- NOA is now positive,  and profitability numbers make (much) more sense
	- Pre‐tax ROIC remains negative as OMED is quite early in the life‐cycle of the research process/drug development
- To adjust BV of equity,  you would also add the value of research asset

### ROIC ADJUSTED FOR INTANGIBLE INVESTMENTS

![](254343db2cb880bd1bf181aa328d4875.png)

# ADJUSTING FOR INTANGIBLES IN RELATIVE VALUATION

#### INTANGIBLES AND RELATIVE VALUATION

- Treating R&D investments as operating expenses affects EPS,  EBIT or EBITDA
	- Systematically affects multiples
	- Stock price reflects the value of R&D
	- PE ratios or EV/EBITDA ratios are likely upwardly biased
		- But exact effect is hard to predict
- If all the companies in the sector operate under the same accounting rules (expensing R&D),  why should we adjust for intangibles?
	- Life‐cycle: Effects of capitalization are generally much greater at young companies vs. mature companies
	- Different companies pursue different strategies (e.g.,  in‐house R&D vs. acquiring patents or small companies)
	- Different intangible investments have different useful lives (or amortization periods)
- Bottom‐line: Systematic effects in multiples that do not wash out

# MEDFIELD CASE
##### PURPOSE OF CASE

- Useful intro to the pharmaceutical industry
	- Discusses trends (e.g.,  to biologics)
	- Increasing costs to bring drugs to market
	- Consolidation of the industry
- Key issues for drug companies
	- Patent expiration
	- Competition from generics
- Valuation exercise
	- Valuing existing pipeline (forecasting by product line; components)
	- Valuing a new strategy
	- Assessing the acquisition offer
- There is also an ethical or CSR dimension (important too)
	- "Tricks" to extend patents

# HOW TO TREAT GOODWILL AND FUTURE M&A?

#### PHARMA HAS SEEN LOTS OF M&A

![](4b5ac5ff2b15592ead5dea72512cfb55.png)

#### FORECASTING FUTURE M&A
- Should You Forecast (Potential) Future M&A Activity?
	- M&A gives rise to goodwill and intangibles on the balance sheet
- Key question: Are we trying to forecast a "realistic/accurate" future balance sheet? Is this necessary in order to get the valuation (roughly) right?
	- Forecasted BS is a means to an end
	- We need to capture investment (but it doesn't matter if via acquisitions)
- Ultimately,  we need to forecast the value created by future M&A
- What is the value of future acquisitions?

#### VALUE CREATION BY TYPE OF GROWTH

#### VALUE CREATION WITH (MANY) SMALLER DEALS?

#### M&A VALUE CREATION: EXPERIENCE AND SERIAL ACQUIRERS

![](9207d04799b1629e165b0ead739fd613.png)

#### WHO CAPTURES VALUE (IF ANY IS CREATED)?

![](13fa66a74418650e4b473df697295524.png)

### PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

- If future M&A is close to zero NPV,  then you can ignore it in DCF or EP model
	- Hold existing goodwill constant in forecasted BS
- But what if the firm likely creates value through its acquisitions?
- Your forecasted growth in sales and assets can be organic or through M&A
	- You can be agnostic about the way in which the firm creates value
	- The key is to get the value creation roughly right (in DCF or EP)
- But: Past acquisitions and resulting goodwill can affect your ratios (e.g.,  ROIC and turnover) and hence your forecasts
	- Take out amortization due to past M&A (if not replaced)? (see pre‐recording)
- Note: You cannot take the same "comfort" in relative valuation/multiples:
	- Relative valuation or multiples are affected for sure
	- Organic growth vs. growth via acquisitions distorts multiples
- Illustrates again that multiples are very sensitive to accounting effects
