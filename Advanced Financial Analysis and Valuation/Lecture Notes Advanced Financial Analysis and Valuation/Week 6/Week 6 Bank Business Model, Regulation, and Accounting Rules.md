Banks: Business Model, Regulation and Accounting Rules

## BUSINESS MODEL BANKS: MAIN ACTIVITIES AND FUNCTIONS

- Deposit taking
- Lending
- Underwriting and placement of securities
- Brokerage and asset management
- Payment services
	   - Money transmission
	   - Checks and credit cards
- Monitoring and information-related services: e.g.,
	   - [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]]
- Risk-sharing services
	   - Liquidity insurance (e.g., demand deposits)
	   - Risk management
- Proprietary trading (restricted under Dodd Frank)
- Obviously, not all banks offer all functions or services

## ECONOMICS OF BANKING: LENDING

- Banks are financial intermediaries
	   - Receive funds from customers (deposits) or investors (e.g., short-term debt)
	   - Lend funds to customers (e.g., mortgages, consumer and corporate loans,
credit cards)
	   - Earn interest rate spread
		- Given their business model, banks are highly leveraged
- Banks normally have a duration mismatch:
	   - Duration of assets is longer than the duration of liabilities
	   - E.g., mortgages vs. checking or savings accounts
- Given the duration mismatch, banks hold positions in fixed-income securities
 - Bank lending involves basically three risks
	   - Credit, liquidity and interest rate
- Banks also provide other services and earn fee or non-interest income

## BANKS ARE VERY DIFFERENT

- Equivalent to a top line in banking is interest income (or combined interest and
non-interest income)        - Equivalent to COGS is interest expense
- Think of deposits as raw material
	   - If they were debt, then [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Operating Income]] should before interest expense
- Banks largely have financial assets
	   - Loans are not at fair value
- Fixed (or tangible) assets are not important
	   - Depreciation tends to be minor
- Bank invest heavily in [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets
	   - At the core, banks are a mix of brand & reputation, human capital, and
technology (or IT)

## PRIMER ON BANK REGULATION BANKING REGULATION 101

- Providing a detailed exploration of banking regulation goes beyond the scope of
this lecture, but I will introduce some important concepts
- Due to the duration mismatch between banks' assets and liabilities, banks are
prone to runs (e.g., demand deposits)        - Banks also have a central role for credit and payments in the economy
- This "vulnerability" together with their central role in the economy are the
primary reasons for bank regulation & deposit insurance
	   - Explicit & implicit government guarantees provide a subsidy to banks
		   - Lower cost of capital as otherwise
	   - Regulation as the quid-pro-quo for guarantees
- Bank regulation broadly consists of:
	   - Capital requirements & leverage restrictions
	   - Supervision & reporting requirements        - New: Liquidity requirements

## REGULATORY CAPITAL

- Banks are required to hold minimum amounts of (equity) capital
	   - As shown on earlier slide, the ratio of equity to total assets for U.S. banks is
about 11%
- What is the idea of a regulatory capital requirement?
	   - Regulators think of it as a 'buffer' to absorb losses
	   - Imagine a bank with $5 in equity capital and $100 in assets
	   - An 10% impairment on the value of the assets wipes out shareholders' equity
- Rules create "buckets" for regulatory capital:
	   - Core Tier 1 capital: Common stocks and retained earnings
	   - Additional Tier 1 capital: Non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred stock
	   - Tier 2 capital: Certain reserves, general provisions, hybrid instruments, and
long-term subordinated debt
- Main criteria to qualify as "high-quality" capital are:
1) loss-absorption; 2) perpetuity; 3) residual nature of claim

## RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS (RWA)

- Not all assets are equally risky
	   - Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has issued rules on how to calculated
risk-weighted assets
	   - Assets are weighted according to their credit/counter-party risk
	   - Depending on the bank, RWA are determined based on standard model or
develop their own internal models, which require approval
- For example, investments in U.S. treasuries have a weight of 0%, but consumer
mortgage loans have positive and much higher weights        - Aside: Lack of risk weights for sovereign debt is a major flaw of bank regulation
- In addition to credit/counter-party risk, banks consider the value-at-risk (VaR) for
market risk in their securities portfolio when computing RWA        - p VaR is defined as the probability of a loss greater than VaR is (at most) p
- Capital ratios are expressed in terms of RWA
	   - E.g., Tier 1 capital ratio = Tier 1 capital over total RWA

### KEY BASEL III RATIOS
- Common Tier 1 ratio: CT1 / RWA > 4.5%
- In addition, banks are required to maintain a capital conservation buffer:
	   - CT1/RWA >= 2.5%
- Countercyclical buffer of 0
 - 2.5% of common equity can be applied when credit
growth is judged to result in an unacceptable build-up of systemic risk        - If the regulator identifies the bank to be systemically important, the capital
requirements are even more stringent
- Basel III also includes a (simple) [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] of equity to assets (including offbalance sheet exposures): Equity/Total assets > 3%        - Not based on risk models
- Liquidity ratios
	   - LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio)
	   - NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio)
		   - "Stable funding" excludes *short-term* wholesale funding (also from interbank lending)

## LOAN LOSS ACCOUNTING

### PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES

![](1d36ad45092793858aca191474bc44a0.png)

- Banks maintain reserve accounts to offset losses they incur on bad loans
- A loan loss provision is an expense creating an allowance for uncollected loan
payments

## LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS (LLP)

- Banks are required to build provisions for potential future loan losses
	   - Most important accrual for banks
- Banks have flexibility in setting provisions
	   - Size of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) relative to loans
	   - Timeliness of LLP
		   - What happens if the ALLL is too small?
- Loan loss provisioning tends to be cyclical
	   - As loan portfolios deteriorate during downturns, provisions increase
- Most banking jurisdictions are moving from provision models based on "incurred
losses" to models based on "expected losses" (CECL):        - IFRS 9
	   - U.S. GAAP (ASC 326)

## HIGH-LEVEL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IFRS AND US GAAP
 - Fasb And Iasb Both Adopted An Expected Credit Loss Approach And Replaced The Incurred Loss Approach. However, Some Differences Remain:

Does not specifically require either a single economic scenario or multiple economic scenarios
Reversion to unadjusted historical information at the input or output level is required Should not recognize any expected credit losses if the commitment can be unconditionally cancelled by the issuer

## EMPIRICAL PATTERNS IN LOAN LOSSES

- Loan losses are cyclical
	   - Cyclicality can pose systemic risk
- Recognition of loan losses is often delayed
	   - Incurred loss model
	   - Reluctance of banks to recognize losses
		   - Managing the loan losses
- Delay in loss recognition is also a function of loan types
	   - Homogeneous loans showed less delay
		   - Based on statistical assessments
	   - For heterogeneous loans, the provision and impairment are determined on a
case-by-case basis

## CYCLICALITY IN LOAN LOSSES

![](a13c861ec8b9402bb5ee9727649fb742.png)

### DELAY IN LLPS AND NET CHARGE-OFFS
- During 2007-2008, banks increased their LLPs to catch up with rising charge-offs
	   - LLPs should be cover future loan losses (not current ones)
	   - LLPs increase in a middle of a crisis (procyclicality)
![](ac5a761bac8def01fcff19415b5000c5.png)
## THE INCURRED LOSS MODEL IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS

- In the U.S.:
	   - "**The financial crisis revealed a distinct flaw in the incurred loss model.** By requiring banks to
wait for an "incurred" loss event to recognize the resulting impairment, the model precludes banks from taking appropriate provisions for emerging risks that the bank can reasonably anticipate to occur. The result too often has been the need for banks to make large loan loss provisions in the midst of a credit downturn, often when earnings and lending capacity are already stressed. **This leads to pro-cyclicality and results in delayed loss recognition**."
Comptroller of the Currency: Remarks by Thomas J. Curry, before the AICPA Banking Conference
(September 16, 2013)
- IFRS:
	   - "By now it seems clear that the overall value of these assets has not been understated
 - but
overstated. **The incurred loss model for loan loss provisioning** and difficulties in applying the
model
 - in particular, identifying appropriate trigger points for loss recognition
 - in many
instances has delayed the recognition of losses on loan portfolios."
IFRS Foundation: Report of the Financial Crisis Advisory Group (2009)

## FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH: THE EXPECTED LOSS MODEL
 - Reform Of The Accounting Standards Are The Crisis:

       - "The accounting standard setters
 - the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the SEC
 - should review accounting
standards to determine how financial firms should be required to employ more forwardlooking loan loss provisioning practices that incorporate a broader range of available credit information. " (Department of Treasury, 2009)
- GAAP: Current Expected Credit Loss(CECL) Estimation
	   - To estimate expected credit losses, information about past events, current conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts relevant to assessing the collectability of the cash
flows of financial assets will be used. (Joint Statement by FRB, FDIC, NCUA, and OCC, 2016)
- IFRS: Expected Credit Loss(ECL) Calculation
	   - Expected Credit Losses are calculated based on the following components: Exposure at
Default, Loss Given Default, **Marginal Probability of Default**, and Discount Factor (KPMG,

## RECENT CHANGES: COVID DELAY IN IMPLEMENTATION

- Original CECL implementation schedule (October 2019):
	   - Effective for most public banks starting in January 2020 (smaller public banks
and private banks starting in January 2023)
	   - Banks adopting CECL have three-year transition period, during which CECL's
effect on regulatory capital is delayed.
- COVID-19 delayed the implementation of CECL (March 2020)
	   - CARES Act: Banks originally required to adopt CECL in 2020 have the option to
delay implementing CECL until December 31, 2020, or until the end of the coronavirus national emergency, whichever comes first
	   - CECL interim final rule: Banks adopting CECL have the option to extend threeyear transition period by another two years (i.e. can have a transition period up to five years)
- Many large banks adopted CECL in 1Q2020 anyway
