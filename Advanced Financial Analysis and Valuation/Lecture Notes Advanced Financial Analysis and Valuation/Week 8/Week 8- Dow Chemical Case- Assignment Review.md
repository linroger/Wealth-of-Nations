# ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF GLOBAL FIRMS

## DOW'S BID FOR THE PRIVATIZATION OF PBB
 - In Nov 1995, Dow Chemical is considering bidding on PBB, which is being privatized by the Argentine government
 - Base-case cash flows for the project that include some operational efficiency improvements have been prepared
 - Case requires the valuation of an international project
 - Key questions:
	- Think about international risks
	- How to incorporate risks into the valuation model?
	- What risk premium and cost of capital would you use?
	- Two scenarios:
		 - Expropriation
		 - Currency crisis

## BACKGROUND ON DOW AND PBB
 - Running a plant complex such as PBB is exactly what Dow does (see Table B, Exhibits 1A and 1B)
	- By 1995, it had 94 plants in more than 30 countries
 - Dow's first Latin American investment was in 1957
	- Investments in Colombia, Chile, Brazil, and Argentina
	- Largest investment is in Brazil where it has a petrochemical complex
 - What spurred the privatization of PBB?
	- In 1995, all trade restrictions between members of Mercosur were lifted
	- As a result, competition was going to increase
		 - Brazilian producers had a larger scale and were more efficient
		 - PBB facilities require upgrading
 - On Oct, 2 1995, Argentina announced intent to sell 51% of PBB

## PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT OF PE BUSINESS IN ARGENTINA
 - Vignart (VP business development for LatAm) believed bringing all of Bahia Blanca's PE activity under Dow's control would be consistent with Dow's business model
 - There are 3 project stages:
	- Stage 1: PBB acquisition (1 ethylene facility, 1 polyethylene facility) and upgrading of facilities to make them internationally competitive
		 - Dow would need to bid against Copesul and Perez Companc, regional players who teamed up to bid for PBB
	- Stage 2: Polisur acquisition (2 polyethylene facilities)
		 - Dow would need to negotiate with Ipako, the private owner of Polisur
	- Stage 3:Expansion of capacity (construct new ethylene facility (or cracker) and a new polyethylene plant)
		 - Dow would need to secure supply of additional ethane and find a reliable partner
 - Question: Should you evaluate all three stages for the bid or only the first one?

## EVALUATING ALL PROJECT STAGES FOR VALUATION
 - Argument for considering the value of cash flows from all 3 stages:
	- Think about the business rationale of the second and third stage
	 - Unlikely Dow would invest in any one of these stages as a standalone project
	- Vignart: "If wewere to get into the privatization, the project would require the modernization of existing facilities and … expansion of existing plants and the construction of new plants, in order to become internationally competitive."
 - Obviously, Dow would not necessarily bid the entire NPV from all three stages
- But to decide whether bidding is worth doing, Dow has to consider all three stages
	- Bid will be for 51% stake only
 - We have cash flows for entire complex (all three stages)

## STAGE 1 FORECASTS REFLECT INTERDEPENDENCIES
 - Stage 1 already includes some upgrading and two separate cash flows:
	- 1) Ethylene cracker
		 - Forecast assumes cracker's operating rate improves from 90.2% to 100%
		 - Dow will operate cracker more efficiently due to the $72.9MM capital investment
		 - Ethaneratio remains constant: Plant's efficiency can't be improved, which is why Dow needs to build a more efficient cracker in Stage 3
	- 2) Polyethylene plant
		 - Forecast assumes plant's operating rate increases from 65% to 100% driven by investments

## WHAT RISKS DOES DOW FACE? (QUESTION 1)
 - Given the cash flow estimates, the next step is to think about potential risks
 - What risks does Dow face in Argentina from PBB investment?
	- We need to diagnose the critical risks of this investment
	- Business risks and country risks
 - Thereafter: How should the risks be incorporated into the valuation analysis?
	- Discuss whether these risks are captured in the cash flows or need to be added to the discount rate

## WHAT ARE CRITICAL BUSINESS FACTORS AND RISKS?
 - Conversion rate (i.e., operating efficiency)
	- Depends on equipment, operating conditions
 - Utilization of cracker
	- Massive fixed cost/capital investment
 - Estimating demand  - Selling locally is ideal
	- Avoids transportation costs, tariffs, duties, etc.
	- PE is a commodity with thin margins
 - Price taker on input prices (Ethane)
 - Output price determined by market (little pricing power)
 - Question: Are these business factors specific to Argentina?
 - Have they built them into the cash flows?
	 - Forecasted cash flows are expectations and include planned operational changes
	 - Cyclicality of demand and various prices built into the forecasts
	 - Are there other risks?

## POTENTIAL COUNTRY RISKS
 - Currency risk
	- Argentina has a long history of sovereign defaults and currency crises
 - Expropriation risk
	- Argentine government takes all or part of investment
 - Tax risk
	- Government could increase taxes (on sales, profits, inputs, etc.)
 - Repatriation risk
	- Government could restrict access to cash flows or ability to repatriate profits
	- Capital controls are common in crises
 - Regulatory risk
	- Could impose pricing or supplier restrictions

## HOW SHOULD WE INCORPORATE THE VARIOUS RISKS?
 - Do the forecasted cash flows capture these risks?
 - In U.S., Dow uses a discount rate of 8-10% (already captures beta)
	- Would anyone use a discount rate of 10% for Argentina in 1995?
	- What risk premium would you add to debt, equity or WACC (as in Goldman model)?
 - Let's take a poll
 - What information do we have in the case to adjust the discount rate?
	- Sovereign spread between Argentina and the U.S. (Exhibit 12)
	 - About 1000 bps (or 10%)
	- Sovereign spread reflects various country risks

## VALUATION WITH DISCOUNT RATE ADJUSTMENTS SCENARIO ANALYSIS

 ![500](0fcf9582a96f3d845e65d42bb1cabc48.png)

## SCENARIO
 - Core idea: Consider explicit risks
	- Bad outcome: Expropriation or currency crisis and drop in demand
 - Scenario 1: Argentina experiences serious economic turmoil at the end of 2002
	- Government expropriates Dow, which has to abandon the facilities
 - Scenario 2: Assume a currency crisis
 - How did you handle these?
 - Scenario 1: Could be handled in the cash flows
 - Scenario 2: Currency risk is tied to Argentina's sovereign and difficult to model in the cash flows
	- Discount rate adjustments for currency risk are common
	- But let's think some more about the currency risks

## RISKS REVISITED: CURRENCY CRISIS
 - What would be the impact of a currency devaluation in this case?
	- Inputs and outputs are all international commodities with prices in dollars
	- Variable costs of plant are in local currency
	 - So, variable costs would even decrease
 - More generally: During a currency or financial crisis, would you rather own a sovereign bond or a plant in Argentina?
	- Relevant risks are quite different
 - What might we be missing?
	- Currency crisis likely affects local demand negatively
	- What option would Dow have?
	 - Export backstop
	 - Impact on profitability?
 - What discount rate did you use for the scenarios?

## SCENARIO 1: 2003 EXPROPRIATION

## SCENARIO 2: 100% EXPORTS

## VALUATION IN DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

 ![500](5563f29043f6bcf33f2a8527036c8424.png)

 - Note that a discount rate of 20% implies risks that are much greater than no sales
in Argentina and 50% tax on repatriated profits
 - Useful reverse-engineering exercise: Ask how big the implied CF haircuts of
discount factor adjustments are

## OUTCOME OF DOW'S BID FOR PBB
 - Dow won bid for 51% of PBB with an offer of $357.5M
	- Dow reportedly used 10% as discount rate
	- If you scale 51% up to 100% they bid close to first-stage NPV
	- Proceeded to execute all 3 stages
 - In 1996: Dow bought remaining stakes in PBB & Polisur; began construction of an ethylene cracker and polyethylene plant
 - In 2001: Polyethylene production began in new plant
 - Dow's total investment in the Bahia Blanca complex, including all three stages of the project, was $1.5 billion
 - In 2002, Argentina faces currency crisis:
	- Argentina abandoned fixed exchange rate and peso fell sharply
	- However, Dow's PE business performed extremely well throughout and subsequent to the crisis in Argentina
	- Key to Dow's success was that Dow could export PE that it could not sell locally
	- In general, exporters with local costs did well subsequent to depreciation

## MNCS DURING CURRENCY CRISES

Desai, Foley and Forbes (2007, RFS)

## WHAT ELSE COULD ONE CONSIDER?

 ![500](bf2edba51466d0411b7f026b860dedd3.png)

 - Dow treated it like a capital budgeting project from the parent shareholder
perspective, and not like buying a private company

## SURVEY OF WHAT PEOPLE DO
 - Discount rate adjustments are common (see table below)
	- Risks need to be handled consistently, either in cash flows or the discount rate
	- Double counting is a major issue
 ![500](d7534315a50473230d6d89450bde670e.png)
## SUMMING UP

 - Be explicit about what certain risks would do to your business or target
	- Crises often create winners and losers
 - In many settings, foreign investors (FDI or portfolio) are better positioned because of their access to global product or capital markets
	 - Export backstop
	- Foreign multinationals are often not expropriated because they would be a "prominent victim"
 - Thus, some of the typical country risks might not apply to your investment
	- Think specifically about "bad" outcomes rather than simple adjustments to discount rates

## SUMMING UP (CONT.)
 - At a minimum, assess whether implied CF consequences and valuation discount seem plausible
 - Increasing the discount rate penalizes long-term investments and skews incentives in favor of short-term ones
 - Given how difficult it is to properly adjustthe discount rate, try hard to first handle risks in the expected cash flows using scenarios
	- It might be better to have "messy" conversations about specific risks that your foreign investment faces
	- Modelling risks in the cash flows brings people in operations into the conversation
	- But: Remember to then "dial-down" discount factor (double counting)
