## Advanced Financial Analysis and Valuation of Global Firms

Fundamentals of Forecasting (using Retail)

Today

- Retail industry analysis
	 - Serves as an example for industry analysis
	 - Key to understanding the business model
- Value drivers in retail
- Revenue forecasting
	 - Retail is a good industry to illustrate revenue forecasting
	 - Building revenue forecasts bottom up and top down
- Financial shenanigans in retail
- Dollar General case

## VALUATION PROCESS

 ![500](30d768641aab2cf71ff7587874108fa3.png)

- Part I is historical
- Part II is prospective,   but hinges critically on historical analysis
- Two parts are closely connected

## RETAIL COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

### PRICE GAP ANALYSIS: KROGER VS. WALMART COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES

 ![500](cffedda1962d54d82e3faae68366fd72.png)

## COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES
- Both Cost Leadership And Differentiation Strategies Exist In Food Retail
	 - Earlier Slide Comparing Kroger And Walmart
	 - Hard Discount (Aldi):
		  - Small assortment (i.e.,  low numbers of products or so‐called SKUs)
		  - Focus on high‐turn merchandise & private labels
		  - Almost no customer experience (no frills)
	 - Upscale Grocery Retailing (Wholefoods):
		  - Products
		  - In‐store experience
		  - (Since Amazon acquisition: E‐commerce strategy)

## PROMOTIONAL ANALYSIS TO STUDY RELATIVE PRICING POWER

 ![500](73ad193e4552d43a52dcdca9229eafba.png)

## COMPETITION AND LOCATION

- Analysts also gauge competitive rivalry in retail using measures of proximity and overlapping of footprint
‒ Same analysis can be conducted for other industries such as restaurants
- Example of overlap between Whole Foods and other retailers

## THREAT OF ENTRY
- Threat Of Entry In Retail Is High:
	 - Costs of opening a store are relatively low
	 - However,  larger retailers have economies of scale in buying and distribution that allows them to lower costs
		  - Scale and distribution networks present significant entry barriers
-  ![500](69ac3da75b824872f68c7a478a93f76d.png)
## SUBSTITUTES
- Threats from substitutes in retail is generally high
	 - Narrow vs. broader perspective
	 - What is a broad substitute in food retail?
- Example: Private labels are primarily used by discounted formats
 ![500](004690ac5722794a2738831f548184b1.png)

- Alternative channels for 'how to buy' can viewed as 'substitute'
	 - Online shopping & home delivery service
- E‐commerce is a major threat for many retailers
	 - Share of digital retailing keeps rising
	 - Specialty retail (e.g.,  toys) have been particularly threatened by e‐commerce
- Groceries had been more resilient
	 - Pandemic has changed this
- Retailers have responded to the digital threat with:
	 - Optimization of footprint
	 - Improvements in shopping experience
	 - Multi‐channel strategies (e.g.,  walmart.com,  WFM & Amazon Prime)

## PANDEMIC GAVE E‐COMMERCE A BIG BOOST

 ![500](d87db4540fce23b19ff79303d8572144.png)

## EVEN PRE‐PANDEMIC,  PHYSICAL STORES CLOSED AT HIGH RATES
- Despite strong consumer economy,  U.S. store closures of 9,  000+ in 2019 beat the previous record of 8,  000 in 2017
- Early in 2020 (pre‐pandemic),  retailers announced 1,  200+ planned closures
- Big Box stores play important role (e.g.,  Costco,  Sam's Club)
 ![500](2faf549b690bc9b0fb6c360201f6b2a5.png)
## BARGAINING POWER: CUSTOMERS & SUPPLIERS

- Consumers typically have no bargaining power,  but:
	 - Consumers have practically zero switching costs,  especially in specialty retail
	 - For groceries/general merchandise,  variety in assortment could create switching costs (i.e.,  shopping for all needs in one trip vs. multiple)
- Depending on size,  retailers may have bargaining power in their relationship with vendors and suppliers
	 - Classic example is Walmart
	 - Where do you see this in the financials of the vendors?

## RETAILERS' SHARE OF VENDOR REVENUE

Kraft Heinz (10‐K for FY ended Dec‐2017)

Our largest customer,  Walmart Inc.,  represented approximately 21% of our net sales in 2017,  22% of our net sales in 2016,  and approximately 20% of our net sales in 2015. All of our segments have sales to Walmart Inc.

PepsiCo (10‐K for FY ended Dec‐2017)

We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers,  including Walmart. In 2017,  sales to Walmart (including Sam's) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue,  including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers,  which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers.

## SUMMARY OF RETAIL INDUSTRY ANALYSIS

- Retailers face a complex and fiercely competitive environment,  low barriers to entry and clear substitutes,  in particular,  in the form of e‐commerce,  which is gaining market share
- Fiercely competitive environment and secular changes are also evident in many [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] filings:
	 - Bed Bath and Beyond (2023)
	 - Paper Source (2021)
	 - Christopher & Banks (2021)
	 - Century 21 (2020)
	 - Sur La Table (2020)
	 - The Bon‐Ton Stores (2018)
	 - Toys "R" Us (2017)
	 - Gymboree (2017)
	 - Sports Authority (2016)
	 - Circuit City (2009)

## STILL,  SOME RETAILERS HAVE CARVED OUT DECENT MOATS

- Tractor Supply (TSCO) operates rural lifestyle retail store in the U.S.
- This is a very specific niche that few other retailers serve
- Very healthy profitability

## RETAIL VALUE DRIVERS

### RETAIL : LOW MARGIN,   HIGH TURNOVER

 ![500](87afc2fa732d137fe0dc564d70fe36e7.png)

Numbers are from Industry Ratio Spreadsheet posted on Canvas (Useful Material) – See GICS 2550 (Retailing)

## KEY VALUE DRIVERS IN RETAIL

 ![500](8da354733f53ce60171112e23c52ca5f.png)

### KEY VALUE DRIVER (OR KPI) IN RETAIL

- Asset or inventory turnover
- Gross margin; operating margin - Same‐store sales (SSS):
- Sales per square foot
- Traffic and ticket
 ![500](1e01d977ed0e33cb465594f23dbb4b82.png)
## TURNOVER AND CASH CONVERSION CYCLE

- Turnover is essentially an efficiency measure
- Cash conversion cycle (or net operating cycle):
	 - Days in inventory + days in receivables – days in payables
	 - Captures how quickly a firm sells inventory,  collects payments from customers for the inventory sold,  and how long it can wait to pay its suppliers
- Goal: high inventory turns + high A/R turns – low A/P turns
- Ideally: sell inventory & collect cash from customers before paying to suppliers
	 - Negative cash conversion cycle (in days)
	 - A/P turns depend on the bargaining power with vendors and suppliers
- Low inventory turns likely indicate merchandise that is out of favor,  leading to excess inventory,  clearance sales,  etc.
	 - Leading indicator of future problems
- A/R turns are usually less important – Why?

## MARGINS

- Close link between competitive strategy analysis and this value driver
	 - Gross margin indicates pricing or bargaining power
	 - Gross margins depend on format,  mix,  and strategic decisions,  such as private label offerings
	 - Composition effects are important to understand
		  - Different brands
		  - Brands vs. private label
- Gross margins in retail tend to be reasonably stable
	 - Most retailers pass cost savings on to consumers
	 - But they tend to adjust pricing to inflation
- Operating margins
	 - Brings in other costs: SG&A
	 - Payroll,  store layout and footprint efficiency

## SAME STORE SALES (SSS)

- Same store sales growth measures sales at locations open for at least a year and excludes sales from new stores
	 - Also known as comparable store sales or [[Comps Definition,   How They're Used in Analysis,   and Example|Comps]]
	 - Organic growth of comparable footage
	 - New store openings are linked to capex and asset turnover
- Same store sales depends on traffic and ticket size
	 - Traffic growth: Growth in customers entering the store and purchasing merchandise
	 - Ticket size growth: Changes in the average purchase in dollars
- What happens if a new store doesn't fully mature in 12 months?
	 - Some of the same store sales comes from maturing stores
	 - Creates correlation between SSS growth and growth from new stores
## FORECASTING AND MODELING PROCESS

 ![500](63124dd3142b9d1fa45078a3a08c6036.png)

- Story line creation,  including
	- Perspective on industry evolution
	- Perspective on company's positioning within the industry
	- Develop model structure - Decision on level of detail to put into forecasts
	- Translation of story line into key value drivers
	- Make forward‐looking financial statements work:
		 - Economic links between value drivers
		 - Accounting links between financial statements
- Review for technical correctness
- Review for consistency with past performance
- Could use multiples as plausibility check
-  ![500](a514669a4e730196c7d9b2314cc32042.png)
## BUILDING DETAILED FORECASTS

- Revenue (growth) is likely the most important forecast in your model
- Try to "ground" your forecast in data
	 - Outside view (base rates)
	 - Detailed bottom‐up metrics (use KPI or disaggregated data)
- Generally,  it is a good idea to derive the revenue forecast by segment (if there are several segments)
	 - This approach allows you to capture different dynamics in different segments
	 - Different segments likely have different growth rates

## AMAZON SEGMENT DISCLOSURES

 ![500](e32a82f9fcf22fd58eac2f3d665179c5.png)

- Note different growth rates for each segment
- Operating income growth primarily driven by AWS not retail

## AMAZON SEGMENT DISCLOSURES: SALES BREAKDOWN

 ![500](33a937b3ef9019761db468323693386d.png)

- Physical stores stagnating
- Strong growth in third‐party seller services
-  ![500](a23a1363e745682f1d9880d3920a7943.png)
- Large heterogeneity in growth rates → matters for revenue forecasts

## VISIBLE ALPHA

- Backed By Leading Investment Banks
	 - Banks Are Contributing Content (Full Models)
	 - In essence,  you get "valuation‐implied" consensus for specific value drivers
 ![500](8e0a8d56e71195f7f4d748a8d221a665.png)

 ![500](54eef9a01dfd15cee9a7efd3504ebb62.png)

## TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET: ZOOM

- TAM estimates (as of June 2020):
	 - S‐1 (at IPO) estimated unified communications (UC) market to have a TAM of $43bn by 2022
		  - J.P. Morgan estimates TAM of roughly 40bn
- However,  TAM could increase with use case expansions (education,  phone)
	 - Morgan Stanley estimates TAM of $100bn+
		  - Traditional UC market + combined education and UC market
- TAM estimates (as of November 2022):
	 - Morningstar considered TAM to be $35 billion when Zoom issued its S‐1
	 - In Nov 2022,  Morningstar updated Zoom's TAM to approximately $100 billion
		  - "In particular,  we believe Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center will contribute significantly to revenue growth over the next decade. We see this substantial market as being able to support multiple winners,  and double‐digit growth for years to come."

## FORECASTING COSTS

- Many other forecasts are derived relative to sales
	 - Costs are typically estimated as a fraction of sales
	 - Asset turnover forecast essentially "fixes" investment relative to sales
- What about fixed costs?
	 - Does it make sense to predict margins (or COGS) relative to sales?
	 - Let's take a quick vote
 ![500](e44588ff458c7a940d8527e363153195.png)
## ILLUSTRATION: SG&A FOR STARBUCKS

 ![500](03f25d6982769a64bd2c63235c3e8d58.png)

Estimating the relation between **SG&A** and Sales FY 2008 and FY 2009

included special charges

## WHAT ABOUT FIXED COSTS? (CONT.)

- Turnover forecasts are relative to revenues
	 - What does this imply?
	 - Is this reasonable? Let's consider UPS or Fedex (trucks,  planes,  etc.)
- Fixed costs can matter for your capex forecasting some industries or firms
	 - Pulp and paper
	 - Semiconductors
	 - Tesla (Gigafactory)
- Other situations when costs do not behave linearly
	 - "Sticky" costs when firms face declines in business
	 - Turnaround situation (costs do not expand as fast)
	 - Scale effects in [[Week 4 Valuing Young and High‐Growth Companies|high growth companies]] (efficiency gains as they grow)

## BOTTOM UP: "UNIT ECONOMICS"

- **Unit economics** help us better understand the underlying drivers of a business
	 - How much revenue does a single unit generate?
	 - What are the costs to generate a single unit of business?
- Looking at a business in an atomistic manner helps clarify its profitability (or value creation)
- Once a unit is understood,  it can be scaled up to value the entire business
	 - Existing "units" can be valued with a DCF
	 - Appropriate growth rates can be estimated by determining the number,  cost,  and value of future units
	 - Leads to simplified valuation model
		  - Will come back to such a model in later week

## UNIT ECONOMICS FOR DIFFERENT BUSINESSES

 ![500](2f6fb2d2417a43bdbd92c90abde803e5.png)

## HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHAT UNIT LEVEL TO LOOK AT?

- Business Can Have A Variety Of Units
	 - Demand side: Customer Store Region Country
	 - Supply side: Employee Team or Equipment Factory
- Benefits To Further Decomposition
	 - Each successive level down will help simplify the economic analysis
	 - It is much easier to understand a customer than a neighborhood,  or a neighborhood than a city or a country
- Drawbacks To Further Decomposition
	 - Firm disclosures do not not always provide info at the most granular level
	 - False precision when re‐aggregating lower levels of units into overall firm value
- Given This Tradeoff: No Need For Further Decomposition,  If We Can Understand The Value Drivers Of A Business At A Higher Level

## UNIT ECONOMICS FROM VISIBLE ALPHA

 ![500](6b61bbbe033f25fbaf17ff302c488f1a.png)

## HIGH‐LEVEL SUMMARY

- Revenue forecast is likely the most important one
- Understand the product/service of the specific business
	 - Focus on the key drivers of revenue and revenue change
	 - Identify the "units" to focus on
- Consider macro trends and addressable market
	 - Build top down forecasts
	 - As a driver of aggregate demand,  GDP is often not enough
	 - Consider explicit links to customer demographics and spending patterns
- Combine with bottom‐up forecasts
	 - Consider detailed transaction/customer‐level data

## ACCOUNTING ANALYSIS AND SHENANIGANS IN RETAIL

## FINANCIAL SHENANIGANS

- How Can Managers Use Accounting And Financial Reporting To Create The Desired Picture Of Firm Performance Or Trend In Financial Numbers?
	 - Use discretion in the accounting rules
- Three types of shenanigans:
	 - Accounting shenanigans
	 - Cash flow shenanigans
	 - Non‐GAAP reporting (or KPI) shenanigans
		 - For retail: e.g.,   same‐store sales growth

## UNDER ARMOUR: CHANNEL STUFFING

- Over six consecutive quarters beginning in 2015 Q3,   Under Armour pulled
forward sales orders of about $408 million that customers had requested be
delivered in future periods
‒ Goal was to meet quarterly analyst targets
- To induce wholesale customers to accept sales orders,   the company to offer
incentives such as discounts or extended payment terms 
- The SEC investigated UA in 2019 alleging that the company misled investors by
not disclosing a significant portion of its revenue and revenue growth resulted
from the practice
- UA agreed to pay $9 million to settle regulatory claims

## UNDER ARMOUR: REVENUE RECOGNITION

- Since going public,   Under Armour has emphasized its consistent revenue growth,   and
regularly reported revenue growth exceeding analysts' consensus forecasts
- SEC charged Under Armour for misleading investors regarding:
	- ‒ Bases of its revenue growth
	- ‒ Uncertainties concerning future revenue prospects
- In Q3 and Q4 2015:
- ‒ Revenue and revenue growth forecasts fall short of analyst forecasts
- ‒ E.g.,   slower sales of more expensive winter apparel due to warm weather
	- Under Armour "pulls forward" $408 million in existing orders customers requested to be
	shipped in future quarters (over six quarters)
	- Reliance on "pull forwards" increases over time as the gap between actual and projected revenue gets bigger
- Under Armour agreed to cease and desist from further violations and to pay a $9 million penalty

## VENDOR REBATES AT TESCO
- LARGE RETAILERS RECEIVE REFUNDS/REBATES FROM VENDORS
	- ‒ These cash inflows to the retailer should be recognized as an adjustment to cost of inventories or COGS
- Tesco boosted revenues and earnings by recognizing rebates and refunds as revenue
‒Tesco announced on September 22,   2014 that it had overstated its expected H1 profit by £250MM or 23%. Four senior employees were asked to step down during the course of the investigation

## VENDOR REBATES AT TESCO (CONT'D)

 ![500](bbeb2183e16cd8a050f0464defbf13d6.png)

- ANALYSTS RESPONDED BY IMMEDIATELY CUTTING FORECASTS (E.G.,   DEUTSCHE BANK BELOW) KPI: SAME STORE SALES AT COACH
- SSS is one of the most used KPI in retail
	- ‒ Especially important when a company is growing though store openings as it separates organic from inorganic growth
- It is a non‐GAAP metric
	- ‒ Management has substantial discretion in its definition
- Coach,   Inc.
	- ‒ SSS definition in FY2012:
	- ‒ SSS definition in FY2013:

## KPI: SAME STORE SALES AT COACH (CONT.)

- Rationale for old definition:
‒ Growth related to large store expansions should not be considered same‐store
sales
- When did they make this change?
‒ Company launched multi‐year plan to expand the most productive stores
‒ SSS growth was decreasing before the change
