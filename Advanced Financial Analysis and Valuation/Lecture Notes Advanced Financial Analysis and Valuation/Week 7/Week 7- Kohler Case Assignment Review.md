# ADVANCED FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND VALUATION OF GLOBAL FIRMS
## KEY CASE FACTS
 - Kohler Co.:
	- 3rd generation family-owned plumbing fixture business
	- One of the oldest and largest privately held firms in the US with 17,500 employees and $2bn+ in sales at the timeof the case
 - Recapitalization event
	- Herbert Kohler recapitalized Kohler Co. in May 1998 to buy out all outside shareholders at $55,400
	- Over 100 owners of 811 shares sued, arguing their shares were worth $273,000, almost 5 times the price offered by the company
	- As the trial is about to be begin in 2000, Herbert Kohler must decide whether to settle and at what price
 - Statutory valuation has to follow certain standards
	- Valuation in legal settings is not necessarily the same as for financial decisions
## HERBERT KOHLER VS. MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS

 - Herbert Kohler's motivations for pursuing the recapitalization:
	- Preserve family control (but he already controls 90%)
	- Aversion to publicity and public disclosure (as revealed by past actions)
		 - Are these good reasons? Tradeoffs?
	- Attempt to put an end to speculation that the company may go public
		 - Kohler fears that continued speculation and high share prices might prompt family members to sell shares to outsiders
	- Outside shareholders are a nuisance to Kohler
 - Minority shareholders:
	- Consider proposed price of $55,400 per share too low
		 - Concerns about private benefits and being squeezed out unfairly
	- Book value per share above $100K and OTC prices above $100K
	- Hold-up to increase proposed price?
		 - Dividends are only 10% of retained earnings (DDM about $10K per share)
		 - Why is Kohler paying such low dividends?

## PROS AND CONS OF BEING PRIVATE
- Pros
	- Avoid having to make required public company disclosures:
		 - Would expose proprietary information to competitors, customers, suppliers
		 - Could subject management to short-termism and distract management focus
		 - But public markets also provide monitoring of management
	- For Herbert Kohler: He gets private benefits by making company decisions that are more beneficial to him and his family rather than minority shareholders
 - Cons
	- Restricts access to financing, forcing the company to rely on retained earnings and bank debt (or private equity)
		 - Reduced access to financing may cause the company to forgo valuable investment opportunities
	- Not having a public stock lowers liquidity for shareholders, leading to a discount
		 - Having a price also allows to create more powerful incentives (stock-based comp)

## APPROXIMATING HERBERT KOHLER'S OFFER: STEP 2  - BETA CALCULATION

 ![500](62e53159d171dbd6c7ba831db6146d95.png)

## RISK OF DEBT TAX SHIELDS
 - Two different assumptions: Affects how you unlever and relever equity betas
##### ALTERNATIVE 1

$$\beta_A=\beta_E\times\left[\frac1{1+^D/_E}\right]=\beta_E\times^E/_V$$
	- This formula assumes that the risk of the debt tax shields is equal to the risk of the assets
	- WACC is used to discount the tax shields

## ALTERNATIVE 2

$$\beta_A=\beta_E\times\left[\frac1{1+(1-T_C)^D/_E}\right]$$
	- This formula assumes that the risk of the debt tax shields is equal to the risk of the debt (interest payments)
	- The cost of debt is used to discount the tax shields

## APPROXIMATING HERBERT KOHLER'S OFFER: STEP 3
- Cost Of Equity
 ![500](29bca100d7530292541629532b7cea72.png)

(a) Assumes debt beta = 0 (because leverage is not high)

$$\mathrm{Market~\beta_{i}~=~\frac{cov(r_{i},r_{m})}{var(r_{m})}=\frac{\sigma_{i}\times\sigma_{m}\times\rho_{im}}{\sigma_{m}^{2}}=\frac{\sigma_{i}\times\rho_{im}}{\sigma_{m}}\quad+\frac{Market~\beta_{i}}{\rho_{im}}\neq\frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sigma_{m}}}$$

 - Changes in NWC (positive numbers are uses of cash)
 ![500](c95fc222d576a99c4e7bb9a3246825a5.png)
 - Note:
	- Calculations for 1998 are for 8 months. They are for 12 months in all subsequent years
	 - See Exhibits 3a and 6a (balance sheets) to compute the 8-month cash flows consistently
	- What would you do differently if the "Other Assets" were non-operating?

# APPROXIMATING HERBERT KOHLER'S OFFER: STEP 7 (ADJUSTED)

 ![500](b3f47e11a9d74a50b08ae9d0341b956e.png)

## ADJUSTMENTS TO VALUATION?
 - What discounts or premia would you apply in this situation?
 - Whose perspective is relevant?

## APPROXIMATING HERBERT KOHLER'S OFFER: STEP 7
 - Apply minority discountand liquidity discount to arrive at Herbert Kohler's offer of $55,400 per share (using typical WACC)
 ![500](b4dbfdd6ea5a6b4e7b2aed6693d66ecc.png)
## APPROXIMATING HERBERT KOHLER'S OFFER: STEP 7
 - Using total beta and adjusted WACC of 14.18% to reflect lack of diversification
 ![500](c0a1b1d6c2cd330b199f275b6febcec5.png)
 - With total beta approach, a lackof marketability discount of 20% (less than on previous slide) brings value already below $55,400
 - This calculation could be viewed as the "value to Kohler"
	- He would argue that he is not diversified

## MULTIPLES ANALYSIS
 - Based on financials of comparable companies (Exhibit 7b), calculate:
	- EV / Sales, EV / EBITDA, EV / CF, EV / EBIAT
 - Given Kohler Co.'s distribution of business across Kitchen & Bath and Power Systems, one option is to take the average and/or median multiples of the Kitchen & Bath and Power Systems comparables separately
 - Apply multiples to Kohler LTM financials (most current numbers)
	- We use the weighted 80% Kitchen & Bath and 20% Power Systems multiples for the equity value calculation
	- Then use the median of the enterprise values implied by the 4 multiples (EV to Sales, EBITDA, CF, and EBIAT)
 - This gives us the value per share on a marketable minority basis
	 - Why is this the basis?
	- Apply appropriate premiums or discounts

## EXHIBIT 7B

## MULTIPLES VALUATION

 ![500](d33a2e5dd9654d0d89e1267452b09e83.png)
Applying a control premium (25%) to this number based on legal doctrine would get you close to $200K

## "DESIRED" VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS

 ![500](2dcc08fbe6d06436f8df3bf14f533134.png)

 - Perspective matters
	- There are "consistent" combinations depending on the perspective
 - Legal doctrine of fair value essentially takes the "value to Kohler" perspective

## STANDARDS OF VALUE
 - Fair market value = "The net amount that a willing purchaser would pay for the interest to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell."
	- Standard for statutory valuation, taxation, and bankruptcy
 - But different standard for dissenting shareholders according to corporate law
	- Model Business Corporation Act prescribes "fair value"
 - Fair value = "The value of the shares immediately before effectuation of the corporate action to which dissenter objects, excluding any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action."
- MBCA was revised in 1999 to clarify that it does not incorporate discounts for lack of marketability or lack of control (i.e., essentially the "value to Kohler")
 - Trial was scheduled for April 2000 (but Wisconsin had not yet ratified the amendment)
- There was ambiguity as to how the courts would decide

## EPILOGUE
 - On April 11, 2000, one day after the hearing started, Kohler Co. settled at a price of $135,000/share plus $5,000 to cover legal fees and $8,000 in interest expenses
 - A separate lawsuit alleging Kohler Co. breached its fiduciary duties owed to shareholders was dismissed as part of the settlement
 - In 2005, the IRS sued the estate of Frederic Kohler over estate taxes
	- In this case, the relevant standard is FMV, so all discounts apply
	- In 2006, a court ruled that the FMV of the shares was 48K per share
 - Kohler Co. has remained privately held by the Kohler family
	- Its Executive Chairman is Herbert V. Kohler, Jr. and its President and CEO is now David Kohler (son of Herbert)

## A FEW TECHNICAL NOTES RE DISCOUNTING
 - Issue 1:
	- The valuation date is not the first day of the first year of the forecast horizon
	- Example: Fiscal year is the calendar year (FYE 12/31) but valuation date is Feb 28 (59 days intoyear +1)
 - Solution:
	- Value is first estimated as of FYE and then adjusted (i.e., shifted) to estimated value on Feb 28
	- Estimated Equity ValueFeb 28 = Estimated Equity ValueFYE x  (1+Re)59/365
	- Important: Use the cost of equity as you are shifting equity value
 - Issue 2:
	- Cash flows do not "arrive" on the last day of the fiscal year  - they usually accumulate over the entire year
 - Solution: Mid-year adjustment
	- Discount cash flows by half a year only (for example)
