Dollar General’s performance:

1. **Based on information in Exhibits 5, 6, and 7, what is your assessment of Dollar General’s performance over time and relative to its peers? Back up your answer by pointing to a few key ratios and numbers.**

Dollar General boasts higher profit margins than all its peers, with the exception of Dollar Tree, which enjoys profit margins of 5.1% and 4.8% for 2006 and 2007 respectively, as compared to Dollar General’s 4.1% and 1.5% for the same years. This is likely the result of Dollar Tree’s strategy of offering bundled goods at higher price points that appeal to the middle and lower income segments. While the company has historically enjoyed a dominant market share in the deep discount market, with around 25% of the total market, the JP Morgan report also reported that Dollar General’s stores were by far the least attractive of all the deep discount retailers, noting that “the overall store appearance was lackluster and ranked the worst of the five stores visited during the day. Along these lines, the merchandise was disorganized with many racks missing displays/pricing. In addition, the sight lines of the store were poor with many products stacked on top of aisles and toys located around the perimeter of the store atop wall displays.” In contrast, JP Morgan notes the advancements Dollar General’s competitors are making in offering a better customer experience and in attracting new customers through their “wow” bargains. Thus, we can reasonably expect that absent significant changes, Dollar General will begin to lose market share in the coming years as the competition adopts new strategies to better meet the needs of the local market, cut down on costs, and improve margins by offering bundled goods at higher price points. 

As the deep discount retail industry matures to slower growth going forward, the competition for market share and customers will only grow. While Dollar General’s size gives it an advantage by allowing it to consolidate smaller rivals, it must also seek new ways to improve its product offering both to retain existing customers, and to attract new ones. Signs of the industry’s maturity are arguably present in the declining profit margins for all the companies examined. The compression in profit margin is caused by Dollar General’s Costs of Goods Sold and SG&A expenses growing faster than its net sales on both an absolute and a relative basis.

For FY 2006, Dollar General underperforms its peers in profitability ratios like return on asset and return on equity, though on its solvency ratio, it ranks similar to its peers. Dollar General has a relatively higher Price / Earnings (P/E), Dividend yield, Market to book and EV/EBITDA compared to Family Dollars and Dollar Tree. Dollar General’s asset turnover decreased from 2.9 to 3.0, but it remains higher than the peer average, indicating it is more effective at using its assets to generate sales. Dollar General has a current ratio of 2.1, which is higher than the average of the four companies, suggesting better short-term liquidity. The P/E ratio increased from 18.5 to 35.2, which is much higher than the peer average. This was likely the result of the company’s repurchase of 4.5 million shares of its own stock, it’s surprise earnings beat of 4.9% total sales increase against the forecasted 4.6% expected by analysts in February 2007, and KKR’s announcement of its intention to acquire Dollar General at a premium.

Management’s overhaul of the company’s strategy in 2007 has caused the company’s profit margin to drop from 4.1% in 2006 to 1.5%, with similar declines of more than 50% on its ROA and ROE. These shocks have cumulatively caused Dollar General to lose its lead over most of its competitors, and has resulted a company becoming a laggard in the industry. Given these steep declines, if management’s overhaul of the company’s operations fall short of delivering increased growth in the coming years, then the company will find itself in trouble. 

1. **Explain the sources of Dollar General’s performance decline during the year that ended February 2, 2007.**

The decline in the fiscal year ending February 2, 2007, was largely driven by a strategic decision by management to overhaul the company’s operations to better position the company in the long run. The changes implemented included ending the packaway model and sale of the excess inventory at a total markdown of$279.1 million in 2006, as compared to$106.5 the year before; and a realignment of the real estate strategy through the closure of 400 underperforming stores and remodelling or relocation of 300 existing stores. The large upfront cost of these measures explains why despite an increase in net sales from 2006 to 2007, the company’s net income fell by 60%. The company experienced a substantial increase in COGS, rising by$684.2 million, which outpaced the revenue increase of$587.6 million. This discrepancy indicates that Dollar General faced higher costs associated with the goods it sold, which could be attributed to various factors including inventory management changes, purchasing costs, and the impact of markdowns to clear excess inventory.

While intended to refresh inventory and improve future sales, these markdowns reduced the value of inventory sharply. directly decreased the profitability for the year. The company recorded substantial inventory impairment charges totaling$70.2 million in fiscal 2006. These charges, which reduce the book value of inventory to its market value, directly impacted the gross profit, further contributing to the overall decline in performance.

 Additionally, the strategic real estate adjustments, though aimed at improving store efficiency and customer experience, may have temporarily impacted sales and incurred costs related to store closures and relocations. The capital expenditure cost of installing refrigerated coolers in 3,800 existing stores likewise added to the extraordinary expense incurred by the company. While these moves were aimed at enhancing customer experience and operational efficiency, they also contributed to the financial downturn through closure-related expenses and potential disruptions in sales during the transition. Together, these factors contributed to the sharp decline in net income for the year, income from operations, EBITDA, and profit margins.

The company faced increased SG&A expenses, which rose both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales (from 22.2% in 2005 to 23.1% in 2006). This increase was due to a variety of factors, including:

- An impairment charge of$1.4 million on improvements to leaseholds and store fixtures.
- A 12.1% increase in store occupancy 
- An increase in debit and credit card transaction fees.
- Higher labor costs owing to the expansion of the executive team 
- A 198.3% increase in advertising costs aimed at reaching new customers.

**2. Offer evaluation:**
**a. To evaluate the multiple and the KKR offer, construct a pro-forma income statement for the year that ended Feb 2, 2007 and a forecasted income statement for the year ending Feb 2, 2008.**

**Adjusted IS:**

**Forecasted IS**
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407064757263.webp)

**b. Briefly explain any adjustments that you make in creating the pro forma and forecasted income statements.**
For Pro Forma
1. Adjust COGS based on the change in accounting policy about impairment and markdown.
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407064849291.webp)
- The amount of adj. impairment is according to the case statement “The inventory impairment estimate related to the initiatives discussed above totaled$70.2 million in fiscal 2006 and reduced 2006 gross profit by a corresponding amount.”
- The amount of adj. markdown is calculated based on the following form:
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407064912750.webp)
2. The adjustment of SG&A
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407064921904.webp)
- We adjusted the SG&A charges associated with the inventory and real estate initiatives at approximately$104.6 million, approximately$33.4 million of which was reflected in its results of operations during 2006
- We also adjusted the insurance proceeds of$13 million which partially offset the increase of SG&A

For Forecasted IS:

1. Net sales forecast is based on the revenue breakdown and the assumption of revenue growth drivers. According to the reading materials, we can infer that number of stores will decrease in FY2008. And we assume that the population structure will not change in a short period (1 year here), so we just assume that the number of households served remain the same. Since DG has changed its merchandise to a more appealing and fresher product line, people tend to go more often than before, so we increased the number of household trips per year.
2. Regarding the expenditure per trip, the income level and consumption habit does not change in a short time and the overall average price in DG will not change dramatically, so we keep the expenditure unchanged here.
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407065011557.webp)
4. As presented in the case, we assume the gross margin for FY 2008 is 28% and calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) based on this figure.
5. SG&A is forecasted as a % of sales
6. For Interest income and interest expense: 

- We assume the minimum cash balance at the end of the fiscal year is$200 million and calculate the interest income based on the ending cash balance. 
- The debt consists of a combination of long-term obligations (resulting from the buyout transaction) and short-term debt (used to address the financing gap in the cash balance). 
- When calculating the effective interest rate, considering the market rate in Feb 2007 is a little bit higher than what was in Feb 2006, so we just assume that the effective interest rate is 13.5%, a little bit higher than the rate in the previous year, which was 12.9%. (Interest rate = Interest expense / Current & Non-current Obligations)

7. **How do you evaluate KKR’s offer as a shareholder? How does your evaluation relate to your analysis in a) and b)?**
![](Z.%20Clippings/Untitled%208-20240407065033893.webp)
KKR offered a relatively high price with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 17.2x, based on the pro forma for 2007. If we examine the original financial statements for FY 2007, the EV/EBITDA multiple would be 16.3x. Compared with industry peers whose multiples were 10.7x and 10.3x on average for FY 2007 and FY 2006 respectively, KKR's offering price obviously provides a high premium to DG.

If we consider the forward EV/EBITDA of DG to evaluate KKR's purchase price, the ratio would be 11.0x, which is closer to the market average level. This analysis suggests that the performance improvement of DG makes KKR's purchase price seem more reasonable. However, it still remains slightly higher than the market valuation level of industry peers.

On the other hand, shareholders could argue that the premium is attractive primarily due to the company’s decision to incur a short term hit to profitability in exchange for higher growth in the medium to long run. The 40% decline in EBITDA, on which the control premium is based, is likely a one-time shock, and does not reflect the future cash flows the firm is likely to generate. If anything, we should expect the future EBITDA of the firm going forward to return to, or even exceed its pre-restructuring levels, and any takeover bid should reflect this expectation of higher earnings going forward. Having incurred the costs of restructuring their business operations, it would be unwise to sell the company now, just when the company was poised to compete more aggressively, and before shareholders had a chance to be rewarded for forbearance during the restructuring. From this perspective, the 17.2x multiple appears far less generous.
