## CITIGROUP 2007: FINANCIAL REPORTING AND REGULATORY CAPITAL

In early 2008, Jake Merando was trying to understand the implications of the deepening U.S. housing crisis for the financial health of Citigroup, one of the world's largest banks.  Merando, a banking analyst at an investment firm, was considering Citigroup's future as the financial crisis continued.  The fourth quarter of 2007 was shaping up to be the worst in Citigroup's 196-year history (see **Exhibit 1**), and tremendous uncertainty surrounded both the firm and the industry.

## HISTORY OF CITIGROUP

Citigroup was established in 1812 as City Bank of New York.  During its history, the firm attained numerous milestones within the banking industry, in the early years of the 1900s playing a key role in the establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in 1919 becoming the first bank with more than $1 billion in assets, in the 1960s introducing the certificate of deposit, and by the 1990s holding the titles of largest U.S. bank and largest credit card issuer in the world.
In 1998, the then-named Citicorp merged with Travelers Group, a deal intended to bring a wide range of financial services under a single umbrella.  The merger made Citigroup the largest financial services firm by assets in history and brought a number of Travelers' organizations into the corporate fold, including the investment banking and brokerage services of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, as well as Primerica's distribution of insurance and financial services.  Citigroup continued to grow rapidly after the merger, increasing its domestic and international operations, most notably through its acquisition of Mexico's Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival in 2001. As of December 2007, Citigroup operated in more than 100 countries with more than 200 million customer accounts, employing approximately 160,000 fulland part-time employees in the United States and another 227,000 employees internationally.

## OPERATING STRUCTURE

As of 2007, Citigroup operated four primary business segments: Global Consumer Group (GCG);
Citi Markets & Banking (CMB); Global Wealth Management (GWM); and Citi Alternative Investments (CAI).  A smaller, fifth segment, Corporate/Other, included corporate treasury services, operations and technology, corporate expenses, and costs incurred through discontinued operations (see **Exhibits 2a, 2b**, and 2c for Citigroup's financial statements, and **Exhibit 3** for its segment data).

## GLOBAL CONSUMER GROUP

GCG was responsible for banking, lending, insurance, and investment services for individual customers and small and medium-sized enterprises. It was further segmented into U.S. and international consumer operations. In the U.S., GCG operated Citigroup's credit card services, including MasterCard, Visa, Diners Club, American Express, and private-label cards. GCG also made loans for real estate, autos, and education, and operated Citigroup's retail banking services through Citibank branches, CitiFinancial, and Primerica Financial Services.  Internationally, GCG offered similar services through local retail branches providing investment and retirement services, real estate and personal loans, and sales financing.  Broken down by service, 30% of GCG [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] came from U.S. credit card services, 28% from international retail banking, 22% from international credit card services, 14% from U.S. retail distribution, and 6% from U.S. commercial banking.

## CITI MARKETS & BANKING

CMB served Citigroup's largest customers worldwide, including corporations, governments, large institutions, and other large investors, offering investment banking, debt and equity market operations, and lending through its Securities and Banking division. CMB also provided cash management, trade services, custody and fund services, clearing services, and agency/trust services through its Transaction Services branch.  In 2007, CMB reported a net loss of $5.25 billion on revenues (net of interest expense) of $10.5 billion. The revenue figure included $20.4 billion in write-downs and losses related to deterioration in the mortgage-backed and credit markets.  Of this amount, $18.9 billion came from subprime-related exposures, of which approximately $14.2 billion was related to exposures in the most senior tranches of collateralized debt obligations.  At the end of 2007, Securities and Banking had $37.3 billion in remaining U.S. subprime net direct exposure.

## GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT

GWM provided Citigroup's private banking, brokerage and investment advice, and financial planning services for high-net-worth individuals, companies, and nonprofit institutions. GWM was composed of three elements. Smith Barney offered clients investment advice, financial planning, and brokerage services; Private Bank supplied wealth management services to wealthy private banking clients; and Citigroup Investment Research conducted market research, mainly for Smith Barney and CMB's Securities and Banking division.

## CITI ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

CAI oversaw private equity, hedge funds, real estate, and structured products, and managed futures investments of both the bank itself and of high-net-worth individuals and other third-party clients.

## REGULATORY CAPITALC

Regulatory capital was capital that the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) required banks in the U.S.

to set aside to offset credit, market, and operational risks.  The Fed maintained discretion to adjust these standards as appropriate. Under rules initially issued in 1989, three primary ratios were used to assess capital adequacy: the Tier 1 capital ratio, the total capital ratio, and the [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] (see Exhibit 4 for an overview of regulatory capital calculations, and **Exhibit 5** for related Citigroup disclosures). Of particular note, the Tier 1 capital ratio was calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital was broadly defined as a bank's "core capital," comprising common stockholders' equity, qualifying perpetual preferred stock, and minority interests, and excluding most [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets. Risk-weighted assets reflected asset categories multiplied by the "risk weight" assigned to that asset as defined by regulators: riskier assets required higher levels of capital to provide a cushion against potential declines in value.

Generally, the Fed used regulatory capital measures to constrain the riskiness of lending by banking organizations.  Accordingly, banking regulators assessed minimum values for each of these key measures. In 2007, "adequately capitalized" (i.e., minimum) levels were 4% for the Tier 1 capital ratio, 8% for the total capital ratio, and 3% for the leverage ratio; "well-capitalized" levels were 6% for Tier 1 capital, 10% for total capital, and 5% for leverage. Well-capitalized banks qualified for, among other things, lower premiums assessed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Undercapitalized banks (e.g., below the 8% minimum required total capital) received a warning from the FDIC, and continued violation of capital requirements triggered further regulatory costs, including intervention or (in the extreme) takeover by government regulators.

## SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS AND CITIGROUP FINANCIAL REPORTING

Economists and market analysts often referred to the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 as the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Although a number of factors contributed to the spread of the crisis, its making was rooted in the downturn of the U.S. housing market.  During the 1990s, the number of loans sold to people with poor credit or low income rose as lenders took on more risk. The subsequent collapse of the subprime market sent a chain reaction of economic hardships throughout the global markets. The consequences were particularly severe for financial institutions, which were required to write down the values of subprime assets such as mortgage and mortgage-backed securities to reflect the current prices in the depressed markets.  Critics of new fairvalue accounting guidelines argued that firms were forced to record excessively low values for their troubled assets.

#### VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The assets and liabilities carried at fair value included fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, investments, trading assets, and resale and repurchase agreements. The amount of judgment involved in measuring the fair value of a financial instrument was affected by many factors, such as the type of instrument and the liquidity of the markets for the instrument. Citigroup used quoted market prices where these were available.  When there was no active market for a financial instrument, the company used internally developed valuation techniques. The selection of a technique to measure fair value for each type of financial instrument depended on both the reliability and the availability of relevant market parameters, such as interest rates, currency rates, and options volatility. Citigroup used more than 800 valuation models that were periodically reviewed and validated by qualified personnel independent of those who sourced them. During 2007, the market illiquidity caused by the credit crisis rendered some observable data difficult to measure. As a result, more items were devalued to the lowest observable input or value driver. Approximately 38.9% and 35.2% of assets and 23.1% and 8.9% of liabilities were subjected to fair-value estimates for the years ended December 2007 and 2006, respectively.

#### RESERVES FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Lending impairment allowances represented management's best judgment of losses incurred in the loan portfolio on the date of the balance sheet as well as offbalance sheet lending commitments. The loan portfolio, which was measured at amortized cost less impairment, was comprised of assets presented on the balance-sheet line item Loans, net of unearned income.  An impairment loss on a loan portfolio occurred when there was a difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated recoverable amount. Citigroup conducted regular internal reviews of the underlying estimates and models used when determining the loan loss reserves, which depended upon its current view of relevant external and internal economic factors. This included management's estimate of certain macroeconomic factors such as unemployment, GDP, changes in the portfolio size, and credit metrics, e.g. mortgage delinquency trends and any weaknesses in the housing market.

#### SECURITIZATIONS

Citigroup engaged in securitization activities related to various types of mortgage, student and car loans, credit card receivables, and corporate debt instruments.  These securitized assets were used to increase the company's balance sheet liquidity and secure better financing rates in the market. Special purpose entities were typically used in such securitization transactions.  Under this process, assets were transferred at fair value into a trust, and any changes in fair value were recorded as a gain or loss on sale. In determining the gain or loss, management measured the net present value of future cash flows based on factors such as expected credit losses and the discount rate on these estimated cash flows.

## RESULTS FOR 2007 AND EXPECTATIONS FOR 2008

On January 15, 2008, Citigroup issued a press release with its fiscal 2007 results.  While [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] for the year was $3.6 billion, the fourth quarter was the worst in the firm's history, with a net loss of $9.8 billion.  The loss primarily reflected an $18.1 billion write-off due to losses on subprime-related exposures, as well as a $4.1 billion increase in credit costs related to higher current and estimated losses on consumer loans. Following the press release, significant uncertainty remained regarding Citigroup's expected performance for the upcoming year. Forecasts for industrywide subprime losses varied widely, from $265 billion (S&P) to in excess of $600 billion (UBS).d  Geraud Charpin, head of European credit strategy at UBS, stated: "We have to recognize the risk that the economy will suffer more damage than what consensus suggests. All the investment schemes that have been built on the basis of a strong and resilient economic backdrop have to be unwound."e Against this backdrop, Merando pondered what further losses Citigroup could be facing, and the implications these might have for its operations and regulatory requirements.

**Exhibit 5** Excerpts on Regulatory Capital from Citigroup 2007 10-K
Citigroup is subject to risk based capital and leverage guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). Its U.S. insured depository institution subsidiaries, including Citibank, N.A., are subject to similar guidelines.

Capital is generally generated via earnings from operating businesses. This is augmented through issuance of common stock, convertible preferred stock, preferred stock and subordinated debt, and equity issued as a result of employee benefit plans. Capital is used primarily to support asset growth in the Company’s businesses and is sufficient to absorb unexpected market, credit or operational losses. Excess capital is used to pay dividends to shareholders, fund acquisitions and repurchase stock.

Citigroup’s capital management framework is designed to ensure that Citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with the Company’s risk profile, all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines, and external rating agency considerations. The capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the entity and country level.

**Exhibit 6** Excerpts from Citigroup 2007 Management Discussion and Analysis

**ACCOUNTING CHANGES** **Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157)** The Company elected to early-adopt SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157), as of January 1, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, expands disclosure requirements around fair value and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

- Level 1 – Quoted prices for _identical_ instruments in active markets.
- Level 2 – Quoted prices for _similar_ instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
- Level 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable_._ This hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. For some products or in certain market conditions, observable inputs may not always be available. For example, during the market dislocations that occurred in the second half of 2007, certain markets became illiquid, and some key observable inputs used in valuing certain exposures were unavailable. **

**Valuations of Financial Instruments** T
The Company holds fixed income and equity securities, derivatives, retained interests in securitizations, investments in private equity and other financial instruments. In addition, the Company purchases securities under agreements to resell and sells securities under agreements to repurchase. The Company holds its investments, trading assets and liabilities, and resale and [[Class Note 12 Part 2 Repos|repurchase agreements]] on the balance sheet to meet customer needs, to manage liquidity needs and interest rate risks, and for proprietary trading and private equity investing. Substantially all of these assets and liabilities are reflected at fair value on the Company’s balance sheet.

**Allowance for Credit Losses** Management provides reserves for an estimate of probable losses inherent in the funded loan portfolio on the balance sheet in the form of an allowance for loan losses. In addition, management has established and maintains reserves for the potential credit losses related to the Company’s offbalance sheet exposures of unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit and guarantees. These reserves are established in accordance with Citigroup’s Loan Loss Reserve Policies, as approved by the Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors.
