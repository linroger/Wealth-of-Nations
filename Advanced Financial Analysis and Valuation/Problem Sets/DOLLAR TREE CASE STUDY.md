# DOLLAR TREE CASE STUDY
## 1. DOLLAR GENERAL’S PERFORMANCE

a. Based on information in Exhibits 5,  6,  and 7,  what is your assessment of Dollar General’s performance over time and relative to its peers? Back up your answer by pointing to a few key ratios and numbers.

- Over the period from 2003-2007,  Dollar General's revenue growth slowed from double-digits in the early years to only 6.8% in 2007. Profit margins also declined significantly,  from 4.3% in 2003 to only 1.5% in 2007. Return metrics like ROA and ROE deteriorated as well. Compared to peers in 2007,  Dollar General had the lowest profit margin at 1.5% vs. a peer average of 2.5%. Its ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0% were also below the peer averages of 6.1% and 10.1% respectively. Dollar General's revenue growth of 6.8% in 2007 was in the middle of the peer group range. So Dollar General's financial performance weakened considerably in recent years,  both on an absolute basis and relative to its key competitors. The company went from being an industry leader to a laggard.
- Dollar General's deteriorating performance is evident across multiple metrics over the 2003-2007 period. The company's revenue growth rate steadily decelerated from double-digits to mid-single digits,  indicating challenges in driving same-store sales and new store productivity. Even more concerning is the significant compression in profitability,  with operating margins falling from 6.5% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2007 and net margins declining from 4.1% to 1.5% over the same period. This led to a sharp reduction in returns on capital,  with ROA nearly halving from 12.4% to 5.2%. Relative to peers,  Dollar General went from being one of the most profitable companies to the least profitable. Its 1.5% profit margin in 2007 was well below the peer group average of 2.5% and at the bottom of the range. Similarly,  Dollar General generated ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0%,  again at the low end of the peer group. While Dollar General's revenue growth was in line with peers,  its profitability significantly lagged,  indicating potential issues with expense control and pricing.

b. Explain the sources of Dollar General’s performance decline during the year that ended February 2,  2007.

- Dollar General experienced a significant decline in financial performance from 2003 to 2007,  with several factors contributing to the deterioration in profitability and overall performance. The company's revenue growth slowed from double-digits in the early years to only 6.8% in 2007,  while profit margins compressed from 4.3% in 2003 to 1.5% in 2007. Return metrics such as ROA and ROE also deteriorated during this period. Compared to its peers in 2007,  Dollar General had the lowest profit margin at 1.5% versus a peer average of 2.5%,  and its ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0% were below the peer averages of 6.1% and 10.1%,  respectively. The company's revenue growth of 6.8% in 2007 was in the middle of the peer group range,  indicating that while its topline performance was in line with competitors,  its profitability significantly lagged.

The primary sources of Dollar General's 2007 performance decline can be attributed to the following factors:

	  1. Gross margin erosion: In 2007,  while revenues increased by$587.6 million,  cost of goods sold increased by an even higher$684.2 million,  significantly compressing gross margins. The gross margin decline was driven by much higher inventory markdowns and impairment charges ($279.1M in 2007 vs.$106.5M in 2006) as Dollar General changed its inventory management practices,  shifting away from its packaway inventory model. This change resulted in the company taking substantial markdowns to clear older merchandise,  which weighed heavily on gross profitability. The decline in margins on an operating basis,  even after excluding one-time charges,  raises concerns about potential issues with pricing,  shrink,  or distribution costs.

		 2. SG&A expense deleverage: SG&A expenses rose sharply as a percent of sales,  increasing from 22.2% in 2006 to 23.1% in 2007. The deleverage was driven by several factors:

			- Higher store occupancy costs (+12%): Dollar General likely faced pressure from rising rent expenses as it expanded its store base and renewed leases at higher rates.

			- Increased labor expenses (+30%): The company invested in additional store labor hours and faced wage inflation,  which weighed on profitability.

			- Higher advertising spend (+198%): Dollar General significantly increased its marketing efforts,  likely in an attempt to drive traffic and sales,  but the magnitude of the increase suggests an inefficient allocation of resources.

			- Store impairment charges: The company recorded impairment charges related to underperforming stores,  which further pressured SG&A expenses.

	3. Inventory management issues: As mentioned earlier,  Dollar General's shift away from its packaway inventory model resulted in substantial markdowns and inventory impairment charges. The analyst report provides additional color,  noting that management indicated they were about 2/3 complete in clearing$300 million of "packaway" inventory,  with markdown activity visible in stores via 25-50% discounts on apparel and seasonal items. This supports the financial statement analysis showing abnormally high inventory impairments weighing on gross margins. The inventory challenges suggest issues with merchandising,  assortment planning,  and supply chain efficiency.

	4. Operational underperformance: The store tour observations in the analyst report suggest that Dollar General may be lagging peers operationally. The analyst ranked Dollar General's in-store experience and appearance the worst among the dollar stores visited,  citing disorganized merchandise,  poor sightlines,  and an overall "lackluster" impression. In contrast,  Family Dollar and Dollar Tree's stores were described more positively. This operational underperformance likely contributed to Dollar General's weaker financial results and highlights the need for investments in store experience and merchandising.

## 2. OFFER EVALUATION

a. To evaluate the multiple and the KKR offer,  construct a pro-forma income statement for the year that ended Feb 2,  2007 and a forecasted income statement for the year ending Feb 2,  2008.

b. Briefly explain any adjustments that you make in creating the pro forma and forecasted income statements.

c. How do you evaluate KKR’s offer as a shareholder? How does your evaluation relate to your analysis in a) and b)?

1a. Dollar General's performance over time and relative to peers:

The$22 per share offer represents a significant premium to Dollar General's depressed valuation prior to the deal announcement. Based on my pro forma 2007 EPS estimate of$2.87,  the offer price translates to a multiple of 7.7x,  which is a 28-54% premium to the company's pre-deal trading multiple of 5-6x. This suggests that KKR is already factoring in some level of earnings growth and operational improvement in its bid.

However,  if management is able to successfully execute its turnaround plans,  there could be significant upside potential for Dollar General's stock price. Using the 2008 EPS forecast of$3.41 and applying peer average trading multiples of 7.5-10x,  the implied stock price would be$26-34,  representing a 18-55% premium to the$22 offer price. This suggests that the current bid may undervalue Dollar General's long-term earnings potential if the company can close the performance gap with peers like Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.

The analyst report provides some additional context to consider when evaluating the KKR offer:

1. Minimum wage increase: The report highlights that the recent minimum wage hike could provide a modest boost to dollar store sales,  as the last three increases led to a 110-150 bps lift in retail [[Comps Definition,  How They're Used in Analysis,  and Example|Comps]] in the following 6-12 months. With 57% of its stores in states following the federal minimum wage,  Dollar General has above-average exposure to this tailwind. If the higher wages drive improved spending by low-income consumers,  it could provide a boost to Dollar General's turnaround efforts and potentially justify a higher valuation.
1. Industry risks: However,  the report also notes some risks to the dollar store industry's growth prospects,  including a maturing store base and increased competition from e-commerce players. Given Dollar General's operational underperformance relative to peers,  the company may need to invest heavily in store experience,  technology,  and supply chain capabilities to remain competitive. Failure to adapt to these challenges could leave Dollar General further behind and limit its long-term earnings potential.
1. Flexibility as a private company: As a private company under KKR's ownership,  Dollar General may have more flexibility to make the necessary investments and manage the business for the long-term without the short-term earnings pressure of the public markets. KKR's retail expertise and financial resources could also be valuable in accelerating the company's transformation. However,  the flip side is that shareholders would have limited liquidity until an eventual IPO or sale.

Ultimately,  the attractiveness of the KKR offer depends on whether or not shareholders believe in Dollar General's turnaround potential and management's ability to execute. Shareholders who believe the company's issues are temporary and that the strategic initiatives will be successful may prefer to reject the deal and participate in the potential upside. However,  those who view Dollar General's challenges as more structural and are skeptical of management's ability to close the performance gap with peers may find the certainty of the$22 cash bid more appealing.
