Week 6 Assignment (Individual) Week 6: Evaluating bank balance sheets and loan portfolios

Case: Citigroup, Blackstone, and the Sale of a Loan Portfolio Please review the following materials to prepare for the case:

1. Read “Citigroup 2007: Financial Reporting and Regulatory Capital”
2. Read “Blackstone and the Sale of Citigroup’s Loan Portfolio” case.
3. Use “Week 6 Student Spreadsheet” to complete the assignment (Canvas).

Use the materials in “Citigroup 2007: Financial Reporting and Regulatory Capital” to answer the following questions. If there are questions in the case materials, please ignore and answer only the questions below.

1. What are the primary line items within Citigroup’s balance sheet and income statement? Considering Citigroup’s balance sheet, what happens during a “run on the bank”?
	1. The primary items on Citigroup's balance sheets are its loans, total assets, deposits, equity, and total liabilities. The primary items on its income statement are its interest income and interest expense, which are used to calculate the net interest income, the operating expense, income tax, and net income.
	2. Primary balance sheet and income statement line items:
		1. Balance Sheet:
			- Cash and due from banks
			- Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell
			- Trading account assets
			- Investments
			- Loans (consumer and corporate)
			- Goodwill and intangible assets
			- Deposits (non-interest and interest bearing, domestic and international)
			- Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase
			- Trading account liabilities
			- Short-term and long-term debt
		2. Income Statement:
			- Net interest income (interest income less interest expense)
			- Non-interest income (e.g. trading account profits, investment income, commissions and fees)
			- Operating expenses
			- Provision for credit losses
			- Income taxes
			- Net income
	 - During a run on the bank, the bank's deposits falls rapidly as people pull their money out of the banks, signfiicantly increasing the bank's short term liabilities. To fund these withdrawals, Citigroup would need to sell assets, such as investments and trading account assets. If it has to sell these assets quickly and at firesale prices, it could incur substantial losses.
	 - The bank run would also make it difficult for Citigroup to rollover its short-term borrowings, putting further strain on liquidity. If Citigroup is unable to meet all the withdrawal requests, it could face a liquidity crisis and potential insolvency, with creditors possibly putting the bank into bankruptcy.
2. What are the main US regulatory capital requirements, particularly for the Tier 1 Capital ratio? Using Citigroup, what are the main factors that determine its 2007 Tier 1 Capital ratio?
	1. The main US regulatory capital ratios are the Tier 1 Capital ratio, Total Capital ratio, and the Leverage ratio.
		1. The Tier 1 ratio calculated as: $$\text{Tier 1 Capital Ratio} = \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital}} {\text{Risk-Weighted Assets}}$$
			1. Tier 1 Capital includes common equity, retained earnings, and certain preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. It represents the bank's core capital.
			2. Risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning different risk weights to assets based on their perceived riskiness. For example, cash has a 0% risk weight while corporate loans have a 100% risk weight.
			3. Banks must maintain a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 4% to be considered adequately capitalized. Well-capitalized banks generally have Tier 1 ratios of 6% or higher.
		2. For Citigroup in 2007, the key factors determining its Tier 1 ratio were:
			- Net income: Additions to retained earnings increase Tier 1 capital
			- Dividends: Payments reduce retained earnings and Tier 1 capital
			- Changes in risk-weighted assets: Growth in risky assets like loans and trading account assets increases the denominator and lowers the ratio
			- Issuance or repurchase of common stock and qualifying preferred stock
			- Goodwill and intangibles: Increases from acquisitions reduce Tier 1 capital
3. Assume Citigroup experiences continuing losses in its trading account assets in 1Q 2008, requiring it to decrease the fair value of these assets by $50 billion (net of taxes). How would this fair value decline be recognized in the financial statements? How would this affect the Tier 1 capital ratio?
	1. A \$50 billion dollar loss would show up as a loss from sale of investments, reducing revenues. The bank would have to take a write down on its trading account assets, which would fall from \$ 538,984 million to \$488,984 million at the end of Q 1 2008. This decline in assets will reduce the book value of the bank, with shareholder's equity absorbing the losses. The bank's Tier 1 capital ratio would decline due to the diminution of shareholder's equity. With total Tier 1 common capital of \$118,758,000,000 and total risk weighted assets of \$996,247,000,000 as of the end of FY 2007, a \$50 billion dollar loss would reduce the tier 1 capital to \$68,758,000,000. This would reduce the Tier 1 Capital ratio to just 6.9017\%, which would still be above the 6% Tier 1 Capital Ratio requirement.

Suppose Citigroup decides to sell a leveraged loan portfolio to Blackstone. Use the materials in “Blackstone and the Sale of Citigroup’s Loan Portfolio” to answer the following questions. If there are questions in the case materials, please ignore and answer only the questions below.

1. Briefly explain the structure of the deal.
	- Citigroup sells a $6.11 billion portfolio of leveraged loans to Blackstone and TPG at 83 cents on the dollar.
	- Citigroup provides $3.81 billion in non-recourse debt financing at LIBOR + 100 bps, secured by the loan portfolio
	- Blackstone and TPG contribute $1.26 billion in equity and hold the first loss position.
	- The financing includes a recycling provision, allowing Blackstone to reinvest proceeds from loan sales in other assets.
	- A margin call provision requires Blackstone to post additional collateral if the loan portfolio value falls below 66.4% of face value.
1. Does this transaction make sense for Blackstone?
	1. The deal would make sense for Blackstone since they would be buying debt as a 17% discount which other investors were not willing to hold due to excessive risk aversion. If they held the loans to maturity, and if the loans continued to perform, then Blackstone would get paid the full face value of the debt.
2. Does this transaction make sense for Citigroup?
	- For Citigroup, selling the loans reduces their exposure to a risky asset class during a highly uncertain time in the credit markets. The loans require significant regulatory capital to hold (100% risk-weighting), so selling them improves Citigroup's capital ratios. Recognizing some loss on sale now may be preferable to holding the assets and potentially experiencing further losses if the market continues to deteriorate. By providing 75% financing, Citigroup is able to reduce their risk while still maintaining some potential upside exposure if the loans perform well. They are shifting the first-loss exposure to Blackstone. However, the non-recourse nature of the loan means Citigroup is still exposed to losses if defaults are high enough to erode through the 25% equity cushion.

	 1. Why is Citigroup seeking to sell the portfolio of leveraged loans?
		 - Risk reduction: As market conditions deteriorated in 2007-2008 due to the subprime mortgage crisis, leveraged loans became increasingly risky assets. Citigroup had a total exposure of $43 billion to leveraged loans ($22 billion funded, $21 billion unfunded commitments). Selling a portion of these loans allowed Citigroup to reduce its risk exposure to potential defaults in a uncertain economic environment.
		 - Capital relief: Under Basel I capital rules, leveraged loans had a 100% risk-weighting, meaning Citigroup had to hold capital equal to 8% of the loan amount to protect against potential losses. By selling the loans, Citigroup could free up capital and improve its capital ratios, which were under pressure. This was especially important as Citigroup had already experienced significant losses and write-downs in 2007.
	 1. How does the deal change Citigroup’s exposure to defaults in the loan portfolio? How will it affect Citigroup’s Tier 1 capital ratio?
		 - Citigroup transfers the first-loss exposure to Blackstone, who is providing 25% of the purchase price ($1.26 billion) in the form of equity. This equity tranche will absorb the first 25% of any losses in the portfolio.
		 - However, Citigroup is still exposed to losses beyond the 25% equity cushion, as it is providing 75% of the financing ($3.81 billion) in the form of a non-recourse loan secured by the assets. If defaults are severe enough, Citigroup could experience losses on this loan.
		 - Citigroup's potential loss is capped at $3.81 billion because the loans are non recourse, whereas holding the loans directly meant Citigroup was exposed to potential losses on the entire $6.11 billion amount.
1. Using the data in the case on default and recovery rates, what is the value of the deal for Blackstone (and its partner) on a discounted cash flows basis? In answering this question, you should provide the following:

| 1998-2004 Average Recovery Rates |          |
| -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Loans                            | 77.65    |
| Senior Secured Notes             | 53.96667 |
| Senior Unsecured Notes           | 35.76667 |
| Senior Subordinated Notes        | 32.31667 |
| Subordinated Notes               | 22.4     |
| Junior Subordinated Notes        | 20.8     |

 1. Briefly explain your default probability assumptions.
		 1. The portfolio consists of 75% senior secured debt and 25% senior unsecured debt. The average recovery of 49.2\% is just the weighted average of the two components of the portfolio. The default probability of 5.91\% was computed as the average annual default probability for the whole 1998-2004 period.
	 2. Determine the present value of expected cash flows.
	 3. Determine the implied IRR.
		 - The initial equity investment per 100 USD face value is 20.69 (100 - 62.31 debt per 100 USD face value - 17 haircut), implying the IRR is 10.94%.
1. How sensitive is your result to default probability and beta assumptions?
	- If the default probability is doubled to 11.82% each year, the IRR decreases to 6.42% whereas if the default probability is halved to 2.96% each year, the IRR increases to 15.38%. A higher default probability leads to lower cash flows and a lower IRR, while a lower default probability leads to higher cash flows and a higher IRR.
	- If we increase the discount rate to 8% (vs. the 6% used), the total PV of expected cash flows decreases to 6,264.56, and the IRR decreases to 9.63%. If we use a lower discount rate of 4%, the total PV of expected cash flows increases to 7,101.74, and the IRR increases to 12.32%.
1. Based on your calculations, how attractive is this deal to Blackstone?
	1. With an IRR of 10.94%, the deal appears attractive for Blackstone, but still poses signfiicant risks, especially if a loan in the portfolio defaults.
