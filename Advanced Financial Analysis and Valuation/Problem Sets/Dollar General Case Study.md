# DOLLAR GENERAL CASE STUDY

1a. Dollar General's performance over time and relative to peers:

- Over the period from 2003-2007,  Dollar General's revenue growth slowed from double-digits in the early years to only 6.8% in 2007. Profit margins also declined significantly,  from 4.3% in 2003 to only 1.5% in 2007. Return metrics like ROA and ROE deteriorated as well. Compared to peers in 2007,  Dollar General had the lowest profit margin at 1.5% vs. a peer average of 2.5%. Its ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0% were also below the peer averages of 6.1% and 10.1% respectively. Dollar General's revenue growth of 6.8% in 2007 was in the middle of the peer group range. So Dollar General's financial performance weakened considerably in recent years,  both on an absolute basis and relative to its key competitors. The company went from being an industry leader to a laggard.
- Dollar General's deteriorating performance is evident across multiple metrics over the 2003-2007 period. The company's revenue growth rate steadily decelerated from double-digits to mid-single digits,  indicating challenges in driving same-store sales and new store productivity. Even more concerning is the significant compression in profitability,  with operating margins falling from 6.5% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2007 and net margins declining from 4.1% to 1.5% over the same period. This led to a sharp reduction in returns on capital,  with ROA nearly halving from 12.4% to 5.2%. Relative to peers,  Dollar General went from being one of the most profitable companies to the least profitable. Its 1.5% profit margin in 2007 was well below the peer group average of 2.5% and at the bottom of the range. Similarly,  Dollar General generated ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0%,  again at the low end of the peer group. While Dollar General's revenue growth was in line with peers,  its profitability significantly lagged,  indicating potential issues with expense control and pricing.

Dollar General experienced a significant decline in financial performance from 2003 to 2007,  with several factors contributing to the deterioration in profitability and overall performance. The company's revenue growth slowed from double-digits in the early years to only 6.8% in 2007,  while profit margins compressed from 4.3% in 2003 to 1.5% in 2007. Return metrics such as ROA and ROE also deteriorated during this period.

Compared to its peers in 2007,  Dollar General had the lowest profit margin at 1.5% versus a peer average of 2.5%,  and its ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0% were below the peer averages of 6.1% and 10.1%,  respectively. The company's revenue growth of 6.8% in 2007 was in the middle of the peer group range,  indicating that while its topline performance was in line with competitors,  its profitability significantly lagged.

The primary sources of Dollar General's 2007 performance decline can be attributed to the following factors:

1. Gross margin erosion: In 2007,  while revenues increased by$587.6 million,  cost of goods sold increased by an even higher$684.2 million,  significantly compressing gross margins. The gross margin decline was driven by much higher inventory markdowns and impairment charges ($279.1M in 2007 vs.$106.5M in 2006) as Dollar General changed its inventory management practices,  shifting away from its packaway inventory model. This change resulted in the company taking substantial markdowns to clear older merchandise,  which weighed heavily on gross profitability. The decline in margins on an operating basis,  even after excluding one-time charges,  raises concerns about potential issues with pricing,  shrink,  or distribution costs.
1. SG&A expense deleverage: SG&A expenses rose sharply as a percent of sales,  increasing from 22.2% in 2006 to 23.1% in 2007. The deleverage was driven by several factors:
	- Higher store occupancy costs (+12%): Dollar General likely faced pressure from rising rent expenses as it expanded its store base and renewed leases at higher rates.
	- Increased labor expenses (+30%): The company invested in additional store labor hours and faced wage inflation,  which weighed on profitability.
	- Higher advertising spend (+198%): Dollar General significantly increased its marketing efforts,  likely in an attempt to drive traffic and sales,  but the magnitude of the increase suggests an inefficient allocation of resources.
	- Store impairment charges: The company recorded impairment charges related to underperforming stores,  which further pressured SG&A expenses.
1. Inventory management issues: As mentioned earlier,  Dollar General's shift away from its packaway inventory model resulted in substantial markdowns and inventory impairment charges. The analyst report provides additional color,  noting that management indicated they were about 2/3 complete in clearing$300 million of "packaway" inventory,  with markdown activity visible in stores via 25-50% discounts on apparel and seasonal items. This supports the financial statement analysis showing abnormally high inventory impairments weighing on gross margins. The inventory challenges suggest issues with merchandising,  assortment planning,  and supply chain efficiency.
1. Operational underperformance: The store tour observations in the analyst report suggest that Dollar General may be lagging peers operationally. The analyst ranked Dollar General's in-store experience and appearance the worst among the dollar stores visited,  citing disorganized merchandise,  poor sightlines,  and an overall "lackluster" impression. In contrast,  Family Dollar and Dollar Tree's stores were described more positively. This operational underperformance likely contributed to Dollar General's weaker financial results and highlights the need for investments in store experience and merchandising.

The $22 per share offer represents a significant premium to Dollar General's depressed valuation prior to the deal announcement. Based on my pro forma 2007 EPS estimate of $2.87,  the offer price translates to a multiple of 7.7x,  which is a 28-54% premium to the company's pre-deal trading multiple of 5-6x. This suggests that KKR is already factoring in some level of earnings growth and operational improvement in its bid.

However,  if management is able to successfully execute its turnaround plans,  there could be significant upside potential for Dollar General's stock price. Using the 2008 EPS forecast of $3.41 and applying peer average trading multiples of 7.5-10x,  the implied stock price would be$26-34,  representing a 18-55% premium to the$22 offer price. This suggests that the current bid may undervalue Dollar General's long-term earnings potential if the company can close the performance gap with peers like Family Dollar and Dollar Tree.

The analyst report provides some additional context to consider when evaluating the KKR offer:

1. Minimum wage increase: The report highlights that the recent minimum wage hike could provide a modest boost to dollar store sales,  as the last three increases led to a 110-150 bps lift in retail comps in the following 6-12 months. With 57% of its stores in states following the federal minimum wage,  Dollar General has above-average exposure to this tailwind. If the higher wages drive improved spending by low-income consumers,  it could provide a boost to Dollar General's turnaround efforts and potentially justify a higher valuation.
1. Industry risks: However,  the report also notes some risks to the dollar store industry's growth prospects,  including a maturing store base and increased competition from e-commerce players. Given Dollar General's operational underperformance relative to peers,  the company may need to invest heavily in store experience,  technology,  and supply chain capabilities to remain competitive. Failure to adapt to these challenges could leave Dollar General further behind and limit its long-term earnings potential.
1. Flexibility as a private company: As a private company under KKR's ownership,  Dollar General may have more flexibility to make the necessary investments and manage the business for the long-term without the short-term earnings pressure of the public markets. KKR's retail expertise and financial resources could also be valuable in accelerating the company's transformation. However,  the flip side is that shareholders would have limited liquidity until an eventual IPO or sale.

Ultimately,  the attractiveness of the KKR offer depends on whether or not shareholders believe in Dollar General's turnaround potential and management's ability to execute. Shareholders who believe the company's issues are temporary and that the strategic initiatives will be successful may prefer to reject the deal and participate in the potential upside. However,  those who view Dollar General's challenges as more structural and are skeptical of management's ability to close the performance gap with peers may find the certainty of the$22 cash bid more appealing.

1b. Sources of Dollar General's 2007 performance decline:

- From 2003 to 2007,  Dollar General experienced a significant decline in financial performance. Revenue growth slowed from double-digits in the early years to only 6.8% in 2007,  while profit margins compressed from 4.3% in 2003 to 1.5% in 2007. Return metrics such as ROA and ROE also deteriorated during this period. Compared to its peers in 2007,  Dollar General had the lowest profit margin at 1.5% versus a peer average of 2.5%,  and its ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0% were below the peer averages of 6.1% and 10.1%,  respectively. The company's revenue growth of 6.8% in 2007 was in the middle of the peer group range,  indicating that while its topline performance was in line with competitors,  its profitability significantly lagged.

The sources of Dollar General's 2007 performance decline can be attributed to several factors. The company experienced gross margin erosion primarily due to a$172.6 million increase in inventory markdowns and impairment charges as it shifted away from its packaway inventory model. This change in inventory management practices resulted in cost of goods sold increasing at a higher rate than revenues,  compressing gross margins. Additionally,  SG&A expenses rose sharply as a percentage of sales,  driven by higher store occupancy costs (+12%),  labor expenses (+30%),  and advertising spend (+198%) as Dollar General invested in store upgrades and marketing. The magnitude of the SG&A increase and deleverage suggests that the company struggled with both topline growth and expense control.

The decline in margins on an operating basis,  even after excluding one-time charges,  raises concerns about potential issues with pricing,  shrink,  or distribution costs. The fact that Dollar General went from being an industry leader to a laggard in terms of profitability highlights the severity of its performance deterioration and the need for strategic initiatives to address the underlying causes of the decline.

In 2007,  while revenues increased by$587.6 million,  cost of goods sold increased by an even higher$684.2 million,  significantly compressing gross margins. The gross margin decline was driven by much higher inventory markdowns and impairment charges ($279.1M in 2007 vs.$106.5M in 2006) as Dollar General changed its inventory management practices. SG&A expenses also rose sharply as a percent of sales due to store impairment charges,  higher occupancy and payroll costs,  and increased advertising spend,  partially offset by an insurance gain. The biggest driver of Dollar General's profit decline was gross margin erosion,  primarily caused by a$172.6 million increase in inventory markdowns and impairment charges as the company shifted away from its packaway inventory model. The fact that margins declined on an operating basis as well,  even after excluding one-time charges,  is concerning and suggests potential issues with pricing,  shrink,  or distribution costs.

SG&A expenses deleveraged,  rising from 22.2% of sales in 2006 to 23.1% in 2007,  driven by higher store occupancy (+12%),  labor (+30%),  and advertising costs (+198%) as Dollar General invested in store upgrades and marketing. The magnitude of the increase and deleverage is concerning,  suggesting the company is struggling with both topline growth and expense control.

2a. Pro forma and forecasted income statements:

See attached spreadsheet for detailed pro forma 2007 and forecasted 2008 income statements. Key assumptions:

- Sales grow 5% in 2008,  as strategic initiatives start to take hold
- Gross margins recover to 27% in 2008 as guided by management
- SG&A expenses decline as a % of sales due to cost controls
- Interest expense increases based on additional LBO debt
- Tax rate of 37.4% maintained

2b. Pro forma adjustments:

- Excluded one-time charges related to inventory markdowns and store impairments to better reflect ongoing earnings power
- Adjusted interest expense based on pro forma debt levels
- Assumed modest sales growth and margin recovery in 2008 forecast based on management's guidance and turnaround initiatives

2c. Evaluation of KKR offer:

The$22 per share offer represents a multiple of 7.7x my pro forma 2007 EPS estimate of$2.87. This is a meaningful premium to Dollar General's depressed trading multiple of 5-6x prior to the offer. However,  if management is able to successfully execute its turnaround plans,  the 2008 EPS forecast of$3.41 implies the stock could be worth$26-34 in a year based on peer average trading multiples of 7.5-10x. Given the potential for significant upside if the turnaround takes hold,  the current$22 offer may undervalue Dollar General's earnings potential. Long-term shareholders may be better off rejecting the deal and participating in the company's recovery. However,  this carries execution risk if the strategic initiatives do not yield results. Thus,  while the offer represents a healthy premium to Dollar General's current depressed valuation,  it may not fully reflect the company's long-term earnings power if management's plans are successful. However,  the takeover bid provides the certainty of cash,  which should be weighed against the uncertain success of management's plan.

The analyst report highlights that the minimum wage increase could provide a modest boost to dollar store sales,  as the last three hikes led to a 110-150 bps lift in retail [[Comps Definition,  How They're Used in Analysis,  and Example|Comps]] in the following 6-12 months. With 57% of its stores in states following the federal minimum wage,  Dollar General has above-average exposure to this tailwind. If wage gains drive improved spending by low-income consumers,  Dollar General's turnaround efforts could get a boost,  potentially justifying a higher valuation than the current offer. However,  the report also notes risks to the industry's heady growth,  including a maturing store base and increased e-commerce competition. With Dollar General already lagging peers operationally,  failure to adapt could leave it further behind. The company likely needs heavy investment in store experience,  technology,  and supply chain to keep pace. As a private company under KKR,  Dollar General may have more flexibility to make these investments and manage the business for the long-term vs. quarterly earnings. The flip side is limited liquidity for shareholders until an eventual IPO or sale. Ultimately,  the attractiveness of the KKR offer depends on one's conviction in management's ability to close the performance gap with peers like Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The analyst's store tour observations aren't encouraging on this front,  and initiatives like SKU rationalization and private label could take years to bear fruit. For shareholders who believe Dollar General's issues are more structural vs. temporary,  the certainty of the$22 cash bid may be appealing. Those more optimistic on the turnaround potential and industry tailwinds from minimum wage hikes may prefer to stay invested and participate in the upside.

 To evaluate the KKR offer,  I compared the$22 per share bid to Dollar General's earnings potential and relative valuation. Using management's projections,  Dollar General could earn over$3.40 per share next year,  which at peer average trading multiples of 7.5-10x,  would imply a stock price of$26-34. This suggests the$22 offer may undervalue Dollar General's standalone potential.

However,  it's important to consider a range of scenarios. My 2008 forecast assumes management can hit its targets for sales growth and margin expansion. If the turnaround falters,  earnings may be lower. For context,  at the current$22 offer price,  KKR is paying 7.7x pro forma 2007 EPS of$2.87. This is a 28-54% premium to Dollar General's pre-deal trading multiple of 5-6x,  indicating that KKR is already factoring in some earnings growth. If management falls short of its goals,  the deal multiple could look more attractive.

Shareholders should weigh the relative certainty of the$22 per share cash offer against the potential for greater upside if management executes. Rejecting the deal means taking on added risk that the turnaround may disappoint. The board and its advisors likely have more insight into the probability of success and the company's standalone value in different scenarios.

At the end of the day,  the KKR offer looks reasonable but not overly compelling compared to Dollar General's go-forward potential. Shareholders bullish on the turnaround may prefer to stay invested,  while those skeptical of management's ability to reverse the negative operating trends may opt for the certainty of the cash deal. It's a balanced risk/reward.

Sure,  I can provide more detail on each part of the analysis:

1a. Dollar General's deteriorating performance is evident across multiple metrics over the 2003-2007 period. The company's revenue growth rate steadily decelerated from double-digits to mid-single digits,  indicating challenges in driving same-store sales and new store productivity. Even more concerning is the significant compression in profitability,  with operating margins falling from 6.5% in 2006 to 2.7% in 2007 and net margins declining from 4.1% to 1.5% over the same period. This led to a sharp reduction in returns on capital,  with ROA nearly halving from 12.4% to 5.2%.

Relative to peers,  Dollar General went from being one of the most profitable companies to the least profitable. Its 1.5% profit margin in 2007 was well below the peer group average of 2.5% and at the bottom of the range. Similarly,  Dollar General generated ROA of 5.2% and ROE of 8.0%,  again at the low end of the peer group. While Dollar General's revenue growth was in line with peers,  its profitability significantly lagged,  indicating potential issues with expense control and pricing.

1b. A deeper look at the 2007 income statement reveals that the biggest driver of Dollar General's profit decline was gross margin erosion. Despite a$587.6 million increase in sales,  gross profit actually decreased because COGS rose by$684.2 million. This was primarily caused by a$172.6 million increase in inventory markdowns and impairment charges as the company shifted away from its packaway inventory model. The fact that margins declined on an operating basis as well,  even after excluding one-time charges,  is concerning and suggests potential issues with pricing,  shrink,  or distribution costs.

SG&A expenses also deleveraged,  rising from 22.2% of sales in 2006 to 23.1% in 2007. The main drivers were higher store occupancy (+12%),  labor (+30%),  and advertising costs (+198%) as Dollar General invested in store upgrades and marketing. While some of this is discretionary,  the magnitude of the increase and deleverage is concerning. Overall,  the company appears to be struggling both with topline growth and expense control.

2a/b. To better understand Dollar General's normalized earnings power,  I created a pro forma income statement for 2007 excluding one-time charges. I also built a 2008 forecast incorporating management's guidance for 5% sales growth and modest margin recovery as turnaround initiatives take hold.

For the 2007 pro forma,  I adjusted COGS to remove the$70.2 million inventory impairment charge,  which boosted gross margin by 80 bps to 26.6%. I also removed$33.4 million of one-time SG&A expenses related to store closures and other restructuring actions,  reducing SG&A to 22.7% of sales. Lastly,  I assumed a go-forward interest expense of$80 million based on a pro forma debt balance of$1.1 billion at a 7% interest rate. These adjustments resulted in pro forma EPS of$2.87.

For 2008,  I assumed 5% sales growth and a gross margin of 27% in line with management's guidance. I also forecast modest SG&A leverage of 40 bps to 22.3% of sales as cost savings initiatives ramp up. After factoring in higher interest expense,  this resulted in EPS of$3.41,  representing 19% growth.

2c. To evaluate the KKR offer,  I compared the$22 per share bid to Dollar General's earnings potential and relative valuation. Using management's projections,  Dollar General could earn over$3.40 per share next year,  which at peer average trading multiples of 7.5-10x,  would imply a stock price of$26-34. This suggests the$22 offer may undervalue Dollar General's standalone potential.

However,  it's important to consider a range of scenarios. My 2008 forecast assumes management can hit its targets for sales growth and margin expansion. If the turnaround falters,  earnings may be lower. For context,  at the current$22 offer price,  KKR is paying 7.7x pro forma 2007 EPS of$2.87. This is a 28-54% premium to Dollar General's pre-deal trading multiple of 5-6x,  indicating that KKR is already factoring in some earnings growth. If management falls short of its goals,  the deal multiple could look more attractive.

Shareholders should weigh the relative certainty of the$22 per share cash offer against the potential for greater upside if management executes. Rejecting the deal means taking on added risk that the turnaround may disappoint. The board and its advisors likely have more insight into the probability of success and the company's standalone value in different scenarios.

At the end of the day,  the KKR offer looks reasonable but not overly compelling compared to Dollar General's go-forward potential. Shareholders bullish on the turnaround may prefer to stay invested,  while those skeptical of management's ability to reverse the negative operating trends may opt for the certainty of the cash deal. It's a balanced risk/reward.

After reviewing the analyst report,  I can provide some additional insights and context to supplement my initial assessment of Dollar General's performance and the KKR offer:

1a. Dollar General's performance relative to peers:

The analyst report provides useful context on the overall dollar store industry,  which grew sales at an 8.2% rate in 2006 to reach$29 billion. Within this,  Dollar General maintained the highest market share at 31.7%,  ahead of peers like Family Dollar (23.2%) and Dollar Tree (13.7%).

However,  the report notes that industry growth has slowed in recent years from the 16%+ rates seen in the late 90s/early 2000s to under 9% in 2004-2006. This deceleration likely contributed to Dollar General's weakening financial metrics.

The store tour observations also suggest Dollar General may be lagging peers operationally. The analyst ranked DG's in-store experience and appearance the worst among the dollar stores visited,  citing disorganized merchandise,  poor sightlines,  and an overall "lackluster" impression. In contrast,  Family Dollar and Dollar Tree's stores were described more positively.

1b. Sources of Dollar General's 2007 performance decline:

The report provides additional color on Dollar General's inventory issues. Management indicated they are about 2/3 complete in clearing$300 million of "packaway" inventory,  with markdown activity visible in stores via 25-50% discounts on apparel and seasonal items. This supports the financial statement analysis showing abnormally high inventory impairments weighing on gross margins.

Looking ahead,  management cited private label expansion,  SKU rationalization,  and zone pricing as key strategic initiatives. While logical,  these represent longer-term efforts that may take 2-3 years to impact results. Near-term,  the inventory clearance activity could continue pressuring sales and margins.

2c. Evaluation of KKR offer:

The analyst report highlights that the minimum wage increase could provide a modest boost to dollar store sales,  as the last three hikes led to a 110-150 bps lift in retail comps in the following 6-12 months. With 57% of its stores in states following the federal minimum wage,  Dollar General has above-average exposure to this tailwind. If wage gains drive improved spending by low-income consumers,  Dollar General's turnaround efforts could get a boost,  potentially justifying a higher valuation than the current offer. However,  the report also notes risks to the industry's heady growth,  including a maturing store base and increased e-commerce competition. With Dollar General already lagging peers operationally,  failure to adapt could leave it further behind. The company likely needs heavy investment in store experience,  technology,  and supply chain to keep pace. As a private company under KKR,  Dollar General may have more flexibility to make these investments and manage the business for the long-term vs. quarterly earnings. The flip side is limited liquidity for shareholders until an eventual IPO or sale. Ultimately,  the attractiveness of the KKR offer depends on one's conviction in management's ability to close the performance gap with peers like Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The analyst's store tour observations aren't encouraging on this front,  and initiatives like SKU rationalization and private label could take years to bear fruit. For shareholders who believe Dollar General's issues are more structural vs. temporary,  the certainty of the$22 cash bid may be appealing. Those more optimistic on the turnaround potential and industry tailwinds from minimum wage hikes may prefer to stay invested and participate in the upside.

The analyst report provides valuable insights into the competitive dynamics and growth prospects of the dollar store industry,  which are relevant in assessing Dollar General's standalone potential and the merits of the KKR offer.

On the positive side,  the report highlights that dollar stores have gained significant market share over the past decade,  with household penetration rising from 59% to 65% and per-store visits increasing 18%. Dollar General has been a prime beneficiary of these tailwinds,  cementing its position as the industry leader with a 32% market share.

The company's everyday low prices and expanding consumables offering (now 45-65% of the merchandise mix) position it well to capture fill-in trips and trade-down behavior from grocery and drug store customers. The minimum wage increase could further boost this trend by putting more disposable income in the pockets of Dollar General's core low-income demographic.

However,  the report also raises some red flags about Dollar General's competitive positioning and execution. The store tour observations paint a picture of a concept that has fallen behind peers in terms of in-store experience,  merchandising,  and overall "wow" factor. While Dollar Tree and Family Dollar are innovating with multi-price points,  improved signage,  and compelling end-cap displays,  Dollar General's stores were described as "lackluster" and "disorganized."

This is particularly concerning given that Dollar General's store base is significantly larger than peers (8, 000+ locations vs. 6, 300 for Family Dollar and 3, 200 for Dollar Tree). With a more mature footprint,  comp sales will be the key driver of growth going forward. If Dollar General's in-store experience lags peers,  it may struggle to drive positive traffic and ticket momentum.

Management's commentary on strategic priorities like SKU rationalization,  private label expansion,  and zone pricing suggests they recognize the need for change. However,  executing a major merchandising overhaul across such a large store base will be complex,  time-consuming,  and likely require significant investment. It remains to be seen whether the current leadership team is up to the task.

This uncertainty around the turnaround timeframe and execution is central to evaluating the KKR offer. On one hand,  going private could give Dollar General the flexibility to make lumpy investments and manage the business for the long-term without the quarterly earnings pressure of the public markets. KKR's retail expertise and financial resources could also be valuable in accelerating the transformation.

On the other hand,  the$22 per share offer may undervalue Dollar General's earnings power if management is able to successfully narrow the performance gap with peers. The company's unmatched scale and strong market share position could enable it to disproportionately benefit from the industry tailwinds highlighted in the report (minimum wage increase,  trade-down behavior,  fill-in trips). There's also the question of timing - if a turnaround takes 3+ years to materialize,  shareholders may be better off taking the certainty of the cash offer now vs. waiting for an uncertain payoff down the road.

Ultimately,  the decision likely comes down to one's confidence in management and willingness to bear turnaround risk. Shareholders who believe Dollar General's advantaged position in the dollar store space is being obscured by temporary missteps may want to vote against the deal and participate in the potential upside. Those who view the company's issues as more structural and are skeptical of management's ability to close the gap with peers may prefer the certainty of the cash offer.

Importantly,  the analyst report suggests that even if the KKR deal is rejected,  status quo is not an option for Dollar General. The company will likely need to make significant investments in store experience,  supply chain,  and private label capabilities to remain competitive in an increasingly crowded dollar store landscape. Whether that transformation is better undertaken in the private or public markets is the key question for shareholders.
