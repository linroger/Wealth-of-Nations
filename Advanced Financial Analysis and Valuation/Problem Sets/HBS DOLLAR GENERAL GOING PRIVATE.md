## DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION (NYSE: DG)1 DOLLAR GENERAL CORPORATION (NYSE: DG)1

 Founded in 1939 as J.L. Turner & Son,  a wholesale business in Scottsville,  Kentucky,  DG was a Fortune 500® company and the leader in the deep-discount retail channel,  with more than 8, 000
	 stores in 35 states,  primarily in the southern and eastern United States,  the Midwest,  and the Southwest. The company pioneered the dollar-store concept in 1955,  opening retail stores that sold all items for$1. The format was extremely successful,  boosting the company's sales to$25.8 million by
	 1965. In 1968,  the company tendered an initial public offering (IPO) and changed its name to Dollar General.

.

## DOLLAR GENERAL'S BUSINESS STRATEGY

 To carry out its stated mission of "serving others, " DG pursued a business strategy of providing customers with a focused assortment of fairly priced,  consumable merchandise in a convenient,  small-store format.

        Customers

 DG served the basic consumable needs of customers primarily in the lowand middle-income brackets and on fixed incomes. In 2006,  approximately 41% of its customers had gross incomes of less than$30, 000 per year and approximately 24% gross incomes of less than$20, 000 per year.

### STORES

The traditional DG store had,  on average,  approximately 6, 900 square feet of selling space and generally served customers who lived within a five-mile radius. Of its 8, 260 stores,  4, 750 served communities with populations of 20, 000 or fewer. In 2003,  DG tested a Dollar General Market® store concept whereby 56 stores averaging 17, 250 square feet of selling space began to carry,  among other merchandise,  an expanded assortment of grocery products and perishable items.

### MERCHANDISE
    DG offered assorted consumable merchandise in a number of core categories such as health and beauty aids,  packaged food and refrigerated products,  home cleaning supplies,  housewares,  stationery,  seasonal goods,  basic clothing,  and domestics. This focused assortment of merchandise was meant to satisfy customers' everyday household needs. In 2006,  the average customer purchase was $9.31.
### PRICES

DG emphasized even-dollar prices on many items. In the typical store,  most products were priced at$10 or less,  approximately 30% at$1 or less.

### COST CONTROLS

DG aggressively managed its overhead cost structure by,  for example,  locating stores in neighborhoods in which rent and operating costs were relatively low. It also attempted to control operating costs by implementing new technology where feasible.

## 2005 SEC SETTLEMENT 2005 SEC SETTLEMENT

In 2005,  DG reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding an investigation of accounting restatements from 1998 to 2001 that reduced DG's pretax income by a cumulative amount of$143 million. The SEC alleged that DG had manipulated earnings and failed to maintain adequate internal accounting controls. Additionally,  the SEC claimed that DG executives knew about,  or even influenced,  practices employed to meet or beat analysts' expectations and maintain employees' bonuses. DG paid$10 million in civil penalties and incurred a permanent civil In 2005,  DG reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding an investigation of accounting restatements from 1998 to 2001 that reduced DG's pretax income by a cumulative amount of$143 million. The SEC alleged that DG had manipulated earnings and failed to maintain adequate internal accounting controls. Additionally,  the SEC claimed that DG executives knew about,  or even influenced,  practices employed to meet or beat analysts' expectations and maintain employees' bonuses. DG paid$10 million in civil penalties and incurred a permanent civil injunction against future violations but neither admitted nor denied the allegations. DG's then-CEO Hurley Cal Turner Jr. agreed to pay a$1 million fine

## RECENT STOCK PRICE RECENT STOCK PRICE

DG's stock price had declined steadily throughout the first three quarters of 2006,  finally hitting a 52-week low of$12.10 in September 2006. During this period,  DG reported reduced same-store sales and missed analysts' expectations several times. Uncertainty arising from takeover speculation and announced plans to close underperforming stores pushed the company's price down even further.

By the fall of 2006,  in an effort to restructure its business model,  DG abandoned its "packaway" inventory model,  whereby it kept unsold inventory instead of moving it through clearance markdowns,  and announced plans to open 535 new stores. The company also repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of its common stock. By February 2007,  DG reported a total sales increase of 4.9%,  beating Wall Street forecasts of 4.6%. When KKR announced its plan to acquire DG at a price representing more than a 30% premium,  shares went up$4.29 to close at$21.18.

## DEEP-DISCOUNT RETAIL CHANNEL DEEP-DISCOUNT RETAIL CHANNEL4

The deep-discount retail segment was broadly divided into the following categories:

Extreme value retailers such as Family Dollar,  Dollar General,  and Fred's sold deeply discounted merchandise at prices that typically ranged from$1 to$20.

Closeout stores such as Big Lots and Odd Jobs offered a wide variety of merchandise typically at
40%–80% below standard retail prices. These types of stores tended to carry more substantial or expensive items such as furniture,  home furnishings,  and seasonal merchandise.

Single-price stores such as 99¢ Only Stores and Dollar Tree sold merchandise only for the price advertised in the store's name (i.e.,  99 cents or$1). These retailers sold a wide selection of often namebrand closeout and regularly available consumable products including food,  household supplies,  and healthand beauty-care products.

The deep-discount retail channel was highly competitive. In addition to various local and independent operators,  deep-discount stores competed with mass-discount merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Walgreens and convenience stores. (Brief descriptions of DG's main competitors are provided in **Exhibit 2**.)

Between 2000 and 2005,  the deep-discount channel grew by$12.2 billion,  to$33.2 billion. This annual average growth of 11.8% was variously attributed to the mainstreaming and legitimization of the deep-discount store channel,  consolidation in the space,  and record numbers of new store openings. According to a Mintel research report,  total U.S. retail sales in deep-discount stores were predicted to exceed$48 billion by 2010.5

                The reputation of the deep-discount store channel improved as a consequence of more appealing store layouts,  higher overall product quality,  and the addition of national brands and more consistent merchandising mixes; a greater proportion of middleand high-income consumers began to frequent the channel in search of "treasure hunt" merchandise. According to a Mintel research report,  massive deep-discount store expansion was partially responsible for growing consumer appreciation of the channel,  which enabled large chains to realize economies of scale and produce well-functioning distribution networks
            But the pace of growth witnessed over the past few years in the deep-discount store channel was most likely unsustainable. That growth had been due almost entirely to new store openings,  since same-store sales had remained virtually flat. While the number of possible new outlets for deepdiscount stores declined and existing deep-discount store retailers (either independents or regionally But the pace of growth witnessed over the past few years in the deep-discount store channel was most likely unsustainable. That growth had been due almost entirely to new store openings,  since same-store sales had remained virtually flat. While the number of possible new outlets for deepdiscount stores declined and existing deep-discount store retailers (either independents or regionally strong deep-discount store chains) crowded out newcomers,  the major deep-discount store retail brands were likely to face decline. (The market share of various players in the deep-discount retail segment is shown in Exhibit 3; Exhibit 4 presents forecasts of total U.S. retail sales in deep-discount retail channel stores for the period 2006-2010.)
            ## Leveraged Buyout Transaction
            
## LEVERAGED BUYOUT

A leveraged buyout (LBO) involved the use of a significant amount of borrowed money or debt (e.g.,  loans or bonds) to acquire a company or division of a company. LBO transactions enabled private-equity firms and LBO investors to make large acquisitions without committing a great deal of their own capital. It was not unusual in a typical LBO transaction to see a ratio of 90% debt to 10% equity. The financing for such deals was usually borrowed in the public markets by issuing highyield,  high-risk debt instruments (sometimes called "junk bonds"). Thus,  the term "leveraged buyout." In many LBO arrangements,  private-equity firms or management bought up all the outstanding shares of a company's stock (sometimes referred to as "going private") and used the company assets as collateral for a loan to fund the purchase. These loans were later repaid out of future cash flows or with proceeds from the sale of the company's assets. In some [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]],  the continuing effort of the management team was central to the success of the offer,  while in other cases the management team was removed.

## LBO MARKET

LBO strategies became popular in the 1980s due primarily to growth in public debt markets that made it possible for greater numbers of borrowers to access large amounts of capital. When privateequity investors in LBO deals realized that they could achieve returns of 20% to 25%,  [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] really took off. By 1989,  the total revenue in LBO transactions in the United States exceeded$76.6 billion. In the late 1990s,  when several prominent buyouts led to the eventual [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of the acquired companies,  the industry experienced a setback. A number of precautionary measures were conceived to make corporations less vulnerable to [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]]. The most famous was the poison pill,  by means of which a corporation ensured that its valuation would fall dramatically in the event of a hostile takeover.

In the early 2000s,  macroand microeconomic indicators once again suggested that conditions In the early 2000s,  macroand microeconomic indicators once again suggested that conditions were ripe for buyout firms. Debt was available at historically record low interest rates,  and the market seemed more receptive to IPOs,  which promised greater exit opportunities. According to London-based financial information firm Private Equity Intelligence,  in 2004 LBO funds raised approximately$145 billion of private equity,  primarily from pension funds.

Enthusiasm for [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] peaked in 2005,  fueled by three forces: lots of cash in the hands of Enthusiasm for [[Note on LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]] peaked in 2005,  fueled by three forces: lots of cash in the hands of institutional investors and wealthy individuals who wanted higher returns; a growing number of investment firms with track records in finding underperforming or undervalued public companies or units within those companies; and a strong economy that had debt available at low interest rates.

Some 3, 000 private-equity funds held$150 billion in capital,  and approximately 9, 000 hedge funds had nearly$1 trillion in assets With trading and other short-term investment strategies becoming less lucrative,  even hedge funds such as Cerberus Capital Management and Highfields Capital were institutional investors and wealthy individuals who wanted higher returns; a growing number of investment firms with track records in finding underperforming or undervalued public companies or units within those companies; and a strong economy that had debt available at low interest rates.

## THE TRANSACTION

On March 11,  2007,  Dollar General's board agreed to a buyout offer of approximately$6.9 billion from affiliates of private-equity firm KKR. As part of the deal that would take the company private,  KKR would assume$380 million in debt.

As a private company,  DG would be controlled by affiliates of KKR,  its common stock would no longer be listed on any stock exchange or quotation system,  and the registration thereof and attendant reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would be terminated.

Under the agreement,  DG shareholders would receive,  per share, $22.00 in cash,  a 31.1% premium Under the agreement,  DG shareholders would receive,  per share, $22.00 in cash,  a 31.1% premium over DG's closing price of$16.78 on March 9,  2007,  and an approximately 29% premium over the average closing price during the previous 30 trading days. Moreover,  the proposed enterprise value over [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Operating Income]] multiple for DG was well above comparable retail transaction multiples in the past few years.

Consummation of the merger agreement,  approved unanimously by DG's board of directors,  was subject to approval by the shareholders. A special shareholders meeting was scheduled for June 2007. The deal was expected to be completed in the third quarter of that year.

## THE LAWSUIT

On March 12,  2007,  a few hours after the merger was announced,  DG shareholder William Hochman filed a complaint against the company,  its board of directors,  and KKR arguing that the merger was "pursuant to an unfair process and at a grossly inadequate price of$22"15 The plaintiff On March 12,  2007,  a few hours after the merger was announced,  DG shareholder William Hochman filed a complaint against the company,  its board of directors,  and KKR arguing that the merger was "pursuant to an unfair process and at a grossly inadequate price of$22."15 The plaintiff further argued that the board of directors rushed to complete a merger agreement prior to March 26,
2007 because DG was scheduled to announce its earnings for the year on that day,  and the financial results would have caused the company's shares to skyrocket. The lawsuit maintained,  "If that haque it ad cerat mang lament and ague at not hundreds,  of million of dellin mion to further argued that the board of directors rushed to complete a merger agreement prior to March 26,
2007 because DG was scheduled to announce its earnings for the year on that day,  and the financial results would have caused the company's shares to skyrocket. The lawsuit maintained,  "If that happens,  it could cost management and KKR tens,  if not hundreds,  of millions of dollars more to acquire Dollar General." The lawsuit also argued that the "no-shop" provision and termination fee totaling$225 million "effectively ensures the sale to KKR and KKR only … and also discourages other potential bidders from emerging."16

Shareholders' lawyers further argued that DG's recent strategic initiatives would likely boost its earnings and stock price and that shareholders should be getting more than the current offer.
In addition,  debt investors were not so keen. Debt financing provided for the deal by Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers would translate into additional payments owed by Dollar General in coming years. Moody's Investors Service put Dollar General's Bal debt rating on review for a possible downgrade,  explaining that the merger with KKR "will result in significant increase in the company's leverage and a corresponding weakening in credit metrics at a time when the company's operating performance has been weak."17

DG issued its annual report for the fiscal year ended February 2,  2007 at the end of March 2007.

Examining the income statement,  Sadayo was surprised to see a sharp decline in [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] during the year,  from$350.2 million in 2005 to only$137.9 million in 2006,  despite increased revenues.

The exhibit also contains selected excerpts from Dollar General's summary of critical accounting policies and estimates.) To better understand what happened,  Sadayo turned to the "management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations" (MD&A) section of the annual report,  where she read about the following recent strategic initiatives DG had implemented

## INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

In November 2006,  DG announced a plan to minimize the amount of store merchandise it carried over to subsequent periods ("packaway"). In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,  DG began a significant effort to sell through this inventory. By using end-of-season and other markdowns,  DG planned to eliminate,  by the end of fiscal 2007,  existing seasonal,  home,  and apparel packaway inventories in order to make way for newer,  fresher items and more appealing merchandise.

To maximize the financial returns of this initiative while accelerating the sell-through of targeted inventory,  DG developed a schedule for markdowns and established an oversight team to monitor its efforts. DG utilized television and radio advertising to increase awareness of its effort as well as to introduce potential customers to its brand and everyday product offerings.

DG discontinued its traditional inventory packaway management model in an attempt to better DG discontinued its traditional inventory packaway management model in an attempt to better meet its customers' needs and ensure an appealing,  fresh merchandise selection. Beginning in fiscal 2007,  DG was planning to increase levels of newer,  current-season merchandise by taking end-ofseason markdowns on virtually all current-year,  nonreplenishable merchandise. It believed that its revised strategy would enhance the appearance of its stores and have a positive impact on both customer satisfaction and store employees' ability to manage stores. DG expected these changes to yield higher sales and gross profit,  reduce employee turnover and inventory shrink and damage,  and improve inventory management,  resulting in more appropriate per store inventory levels meet its customers' needs and ensure an appealing,  fresh merchandise selection.

## REAL ESTATE STRATEGY

In November 2006,  DG announced significant changes to its real estate strategy. As part of a plan,  approved by the board of directors,  to enhance the store experience for customers,  DG announced that it would close,  by the end of fiscal 2007,  approximately 400 stores that did not meet its real estate criteria. Further,  it would remodel or relocate approximately 300 stores during fiscal 2007 and decelerate new store openings,  with the expectation of opening 300 new stores in fiscal 2007.

During fiscal 2006,  DG opened 537 new stores and closed 237 stores,  including the 128 store closings identified in its strategic review (see Table A below).

## IMPACT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

DG's accelerated implementation of a new inventory management policy led to substantially higher markdowns on inventory. Total markdowns,  including inventory impairment charges,  of$279.1 million at cost were taken during 2006,  compared with total markdowns of$106.5 million at cost taken in 2005.

Markdowns expected to reduce inventory below cost were recorded as the lower of cost or market inventory impairment The inventory impairment estimate related to the initiatives discussed above totaled$70.2 million in fiscal 2006 and reduced 2006 gross profit by a corresponding amount.

Markdowns that were not below cost also affected DG's gross profit in the period in which the markdowns were taken.

DG expected the higher level of markdowns to continue throughout 2007 and predicted gross profit margins to consequently be around 27% in 2007,  28% in 2008,  and 29% in 2009. DG further estimated total pretax selling,  general,  and administrative (SG&A) charges associated with the inventory and real estate initiatives at approximately$104.6 million,  approximately$33.4 million of which was reflected in its results of operations during 2006 (see Table B below).

The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of sales,  from 22.2% in 2005 to 23.1% in 2006,  was also due to the following factors:

- Additional$1.4 million impairment charges on leasehold improvement and store fixtures
- Higher store occupancy costs (increased 12.1%) due to higher monthly rents
- Higher debit and credit card fees (increased 40.6%) due to increased customer use of debit cards and acceptance of credit and check cards at all locations -
- Higher administrative labor costs (increased 29.9%) primarily related to recent additions to the executive team and expensing of [[Week 4 ESOs and Valuation|employee stock options]]
- Higher advertising costs (increased 198.3%)
- Higher incentive compensation primarily related to the$9.6 million employee discretionary bonus authorized by the board of directors

These increases were partially offset by insurance proceeds of$13 million received during the current-year period related to losses incurred as a consequence of Hurricane Katrina.

## SADAYO'S ANALYSIS

Sadayo began her analysis by computing the financial ratios for DG and examining the commonsize income statement and balance sheet. (See Exhibit 6 for Sadayo's ratios analysis for Dollar General.) To gain further insight into Dollar General's financials,  Sadayo calculated the financial ratios of several comparable firms in the deep-discount retail channel identified by DG as its main competitors Spread bets with [[Week 1 Ratio Analysis + Valuation Review|ratio analysis]],  keye provide a in hit i ine dise taement comparable transactions in the retail industry over the past few years (see Exhibit 8).

Finally,  Sadayo wanted to better understand what management would gain from the proposed LBO (as implied by the lawsuit). Due to the accelerated vesting and cashing out of certain equitycompensation items,  she estimated that DG Chairman and CEO David A. Perdue would realize about$28 million from the transaction. (See **Exhibit** 9 for excerpts from DG's 2007 schedule 14A regarding the interests of its directors and executive officers in the merger; **Exhibit 10** provides biographies of the members of DG's board of directors.)

### FAMILY DOLLAR STORES,  INC. NYSE: FDO

Founded in 1959,  Family Dollar,  the nation's number two dollar store,  targets women shopping for a family that earns around$25, 000 per year. Family Dollar operates around 6, 300 stores in 44 states. Consumables account for more than half of sales; the stores also sell apparel,  shoes,  and linens.

The company emphasizes neighborhood stores near its lowand middle-income customers in rural and urban areas. Most merchandise sells for less than$10.
The pace of new store openings has slowed in recent years. After opening some 275 stores (net of closings) in fiscal 2006,  Family Dollar Stores plans to open another 250 this year. Same-store sales rose from 2.3% in 2005 to 3.7% in 2006. In addition,  the discount chain has been increasing its retail presence in urban areas,  with 50% of the new stores added in 2006 in urban markets.a The pace of new store openings has slowed in recent years.

In addition,  the discount chain has been increasing its retail presence in urban areas,  with 50% of the new stores added in 2006 in urban markets.

As part of its 2005 "urban initiative, " Family Dollar employed more human resources and loss prevention specialists for urban markets than for similar numbers of stores in rural markets. In addition,  the urban initiative called for tailoring merchandise to the urban stores' clientele rather than stocking the same things found in rural stores.

Family Dollar also incorporated "zone pricing, " a practice of raising or lowering prices on given items in individual stores in response to demographic or competitive pressures. Some retailers,  including Dollar General,  used primarily a "uniform pricing" approach that called for keeping the price of a given item consistent from store to store.

The retailer is expanding its food offering to include milk and other perishables. To that end,  Family Dollar has installed refrigerated coolers in about 3, 800 stores. In addition to selling more groceries,  it will begin accepting food stamps to attract more low-income customers to its stores.

Eventually,  according to management,  Family Dollar would like to expand westward into California,  Idaho,  Montana,  Oregon,  and Washington. International expansion may also be on the horizon.

## FRED'S,  INC. NYSE: FRED

Fred's operates 675 discount stores in 15 mostly southeastern states,  primarily in small towns.

Nearly 45% of Fred's stores have full-service pharmacies (it also fills mail-order prescriptions). The retailer opened 55 stores last year and expects to increase its store count by as many as 40 new locations in 2007. Fred's is also anticipating adding 15 to 25 pharmacies to its stores this year.
Fred's responded to Wal-Mart's announcement in September 2006 that it was lowering prices on generic drugs to$4 per prescription by following suit in select stores. Fred's said it will evaluate the success of the program and possibly extend it to other markets as Wal-Mart did.

(Continued)Selected Excerpts Dollar General Corp.,  2006 Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. In addition to the estimates presented below,  there are other items within DG's financial statements that require estimation,  but are not deemed critical as defined below. DG believes these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However,  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used,  the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole.

Revenue and Gain Recognition Revenue and Gain Recognition DG recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.

DG recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise.

All sales are net of discounts and estimated returns and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed concurrent with those sales. The liability for retail merchandise returns is based on DG's prior experience. DG records gain contingencies when realized.

All sales are net of discounts and estimated returns and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed concurrent with those sales. The liability for retail merchandise returns is based on DG's prior experience. DG records gain contingencies when realized.

DG began gift card sales in the third quarter of 2005. DG recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption. The liability for the gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase. The liability for outstanding gift cards was approximately$0.8 million and$0.5 million on February 2,  2007 and February 3,  2006,  respectively,  and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other.

## MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES

Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the retail last-in,  first-out (LIFO) method. Under its retail inventory method (RIM) the calculation of gross profit and resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated costto-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales. The RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. Also,  it is recognized that the use of the RIM will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market (LCM) if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories.

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. DG groups its assets into relatively homogeneous classes and generally provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated average useful life of each asset class,  except for leasehold improvements,  which are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. The valuation and classification of these assets and assignment of useful depreciable lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates.

## IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

DG reviews the carrying value of all long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, " DG reviews for impairment stores open more than two years for which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease. DG's estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based on historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability,  which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired,  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset's fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily on future cash flows (discounted at credit adjusted risk-free rate)23
or other reasonable estimates of fair market value.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIESLEGAL MATTERS

Contingent Liabilities—Legal Matters DG is subject to legal,  regulatory and other proceedings and claims. DG establishes liabilities as DG is subject to legal,  regulatory and other proceedings and claims. DG establishes liabilities as appropriate for these claims and proceedings based on the probability and estimableness of losses and to fairly present,  in conjunction with the disclosures of these matters in its financial statements and SEC filings,  management's view of its exposure. DG reviews outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss. DG re-evaluates these assessments each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available to determine whether a liability should be established or if any existing liability should be adjusted. The actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded liability. In addition,  because it is not permissible under GAAP to establish a litigation liability until the loss is both probable and estimable,  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a liability prior to the actual incurrence of the loss (upon verdict and judgment at trial,  for example,  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement).

## LEASE ACCOUNTING AND EXCESS FACILITIES

The majority of DG's stores are subject to short-term leases (usually with initial or primary terms of 3 to 5 years) with multiple renewal options when available. DG also has stores subject to build-tosuit arrangements with landlords,  which typically carry a primary lease term of between 7 and 10 years with multiple renewal options. Approximately half of its stores have provisions for contingent rentals based on a percentage of defined sales volume. DG recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. DG recognizes rent expense over the term of the lease. DG records minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base,  The majority of DG's stores are subject to short-term leases (usually with initial or primary terms of 3 to 5 years) with multiple renewal options when available.

DG recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. DG recognizes rent expense over the term of the lease. DG records minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base,  non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that it takes physical possession of the property from the landlord,  which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent,  DG recognizes the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and records the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. DG also receives tenant allowances,  which it records as deferred incentive rent and amortizes as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. DG reflects as a liability any difference between the calculated expense and amounts actually paid. Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
