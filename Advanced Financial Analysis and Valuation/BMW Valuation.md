We consider BMW'
s peer companies to be Mercedes Benz Group, Volkswagen AG, Stellantis NV, Ford Motor Co, and Toyota Motor Corp. All of these firms share similar unit economics, compete in the same markets around the globe, and generally have a similar offering of different product lines ranging from the affordable car targeting price sensitive consumers to luxury automobiles appealing to more wealthy customers. Each of these firms moreover have a financial services operations that contribute directly and indirectly to the sale or leasing of their primary product-cars. We therefore consider any revenue or expenses incurred by the financial services business to be part of the company's core operations.

- We employ forward multiples instead of historical multiples in this peer comparison since forward looking multiples tend to be more stable and resilient to extraordinary changes to a company's financial statements than multiples based on historical data. Using a forward multiple allows us to adjust for one-off changes impacting a firm in a given year, and arrive at a cleaner multiple.
- The valuations we believe to be most salient to a comparison of auto brands are as follows.
	- Enterprise Value/ EBIT: This measures the total value of a firm, including debt, equity, and any cash, to its operating income. We believe this is a superior metric as compared to EV/EBITA in this scenario since fixed assets constitute a significant part of an auto manufacturer's core business, and thus, depreciation and amortization of these fixed assets must be taken into account. As highlighted below, BMW's EV/EBIT of 9.23 places it at the lowest amongst it peer group, right next to Mercedes Benz Group, which has an EV/EBIT of 10.17 and which has a very similar enterprise value, total revenue, EBIT, debt/EBIT, and operating margin. The higher ratio for Mercedes-Benz compared to BMW is explained by the larger gap between their enterprise values relative to their operating incomes. Ford, which has the highest EV/EBIT ratio, has a similar EV to BMW, MBG, and GM, but has far lower operating income.

| Company Name | Bayerische Motoren Werke AG | Mercedes-Benz Group AG | Volkswagen AG | Renault SA | General Motors Co | FORD MOTOR CO | Average    | Median     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Ticker       | BMWG_DE                     | MBG_DE                 | VOWG_DE       | RENA_FR    | GM                | F             |            |            |
| EV/EBIT      | 9.23720884                  | 10.1780479             | 10.3115615    | 15.0699885 | 11.9212829        | 14.7601544    | 11.1148214 | 10.8857246 |

- Debt/EBIT: This metric compares the amount of debt a company has on its balance sheet to the operating income it generates per year. It is indicative of how well a company can support the debt it has taken on with its earnings. Again, BMW has the lowest Debt/ EBIT ratio, with MBG coming  in second lowest due to its higher debt levels of \$120,447,000 vs BMW's $107,751.63
- Fixed Asset Turnover: Fixed asset turnover measures a company's efficiency in generating sales from its fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment. It is calculated by dividing total revenue by average fixed assets. This ratio is particularly relevant for auto companies since they heavily rely on capital-intensive manufacturing facilities and equipment to produce vehicles. A higher fixed asset turnover indicates that a company is using its assets more efficiently to generate sales. BMW has a fixed asset turnover of 4.10, which is higher than the median of 4.29 but lower than the average of 4.13. Mercedes-Benz Group AG has the highest ratio at 5.89, indicating that it is the most efficient in utilizing its fixed assets to generate sales. Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co also have relatively high ratios at 4.85 and 4.48, respectively. On the other hand, General Motors Co has the lowest fixed asset turnover at 2.13, suggesting that it may have excess capacity or underutilized assets.
- BMW's fixed asset turnover of 4.10 suggests that it is reasonably efficient in using its manufacturing facilities and equipment to generate sales. However, there may be room for improvement when compared to some of its peers, such as Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Volkswagen AG.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):
ROIC measures the return a company generates on its invested capital, indicating how effectively a company uses its capital to generate profits. For auto manufacturers, ROIC is an important metric for assessing the efficiency and profitability of its investments. High ROIC indicates effective use of capital. So long as the company can keep finding investments with ROIC greater than the cost of capital, it can continue growing.
Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Ford Motor Co have ROIC values close to the average and median, indicating that they are still have profitable investment opportunities.

BMW and Volkswagen have the lowest ROIC values among the group. For BMW, this could be due to:

1. Lower NOPAT: - BMW's NOPAT is $7,424.90 million. Comparing this with Mercedes-Benz ($11,979.91 million) and Volkswagen ($19,116.05 million), we see that BMW generates lower NOPAT. This suggests lower operating efficiency or higher tax expenses relative to its peers. Indeed, BMW's operating margin is 9.53%, which is higher than the average of 7.81% but lower than Mercedes-Benz Group AG's margin of 9.72%.
3. Higher invested capital: - BMW's invested capital amounts to $189,676.19 million, which is relatively high compared to Mercedes-Benz ($178,307.14 million) and Volkswagen ($128,847.28 million). The higher invested capital indicates significant investments in assets and infrastructure.
Volkswagenâ€™s low ROIC of 0.95% is attributable to its NOPAT of $3,457,515 which is the lowest in the group, and its higher than average invested capital of $364,647,060. The combination of high investment and low returns suggests an overinvestment in capital projects or acquisitions that have underperformed.

EV/Sales:
Enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) is a valuation metric that compares a company's enterprise value (market capitalization + debt - cash) to its total revenue. A lower EV/Sales ratio suggests that a company is undervalued, while a higher ratio may imply overvaluation.

BMW has an EV/Sales ratio of 0.88, which is slightly lower than the median of 0.89 and the average of 0.90. This suggests that BMW is valued relatively in line with its peers. Volkswagen AG has the highest EV/Sales ratio at 1.07, indicating that it may be overvalued compared to its peers. On the other hand, Volkswagen AG has the lowest ratio at 0.73, suggesting that it may be undervalued. BMW's EV/Sales ratio of 0.88 indicates that it is neither significantly overvalued nor undervalued relative to its peers. This suggests that BMW is likely trading at a fair price.

Debt/Assets (Debt Ratio):
Debt/Assets (Debt Ratio): The debt ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing its total debt to its total assets. A higher debt ratio indicates that a company is more leveraged and may be at a higher risk of financial distress if it faces challenges in meeting its debt obligations. Auto companies often have significant debt on their balance sheets due to the capital-intensive nature of their operations. BMW has a debt ratio of 37.14%, which is lower than the median of 42.20% and the average of 44.50%. This suggests that BMW is less leveraged than many of its peers. Renault SA and Ford Motor Co have the highest debt ratios at 54.28% and 52.62%, respectively, indicating that they are more heavily leveraged. Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Volkswagen AG have debt ratios closer to BMW at 40.98% and 38.56%, respectively.BMW's relatively low debt ratio suggests that it has a stronger balance sheet and may be more resilient during an economic downturn.
