The ratio is commonly used as a metric in manufacturing industries that make substantial purchases of PP&E in order to increase output. When a company makes such significant purchases,  wise investors closely monitor this ratio in subsequent years to see if the company's new fixed assets reward it with increased sales.

Overall,  investments in fixed assets tend to represent the largest component of the company’s total assets. The FAT ratio,  calculated annually,  is constructed to reflect how efficiently a company,  or more specifically,  the company’s management team,  has used these substantial assets to generate revenue for the firm.

m such investments. For this reason,  it is important for analysts and investors to compare a company’s most recent ratio to both its own historical ratios and ratio values from peer companies and/or average ratios for the company's industry as a whole.

Though the FAT ratio is of significant importance in certain industries,  an investor or analyst must determine whether the company under study is in the appropriate sector or industry for the ratio to be calculated before attaching much weight to it.

Fixed assets vary drastically from one company type to the next. As an example,  consider the difference between an internet company and a manufacturing company. An internet company,  such as Meta (formerly Facebook),  has a significantly smaller fixed asset base than a manufacturing giant,  such as Caterpillar.

A company's asset turnover ratio will be smaller than its [[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover R[[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio|Fixed Asset Turnover]]es and a subset of assets.

Manufacturing companies often favor the [[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover Ratio Explained With ExamplesFixed Asset Turnover R[[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio|Fixed Asset Turnover]] how other assets such as inventory are being utilized.

Because the fixed asset ratio is best used as a comparative tool,  it's crucial that the same method of picking information is used across periods.

## LIMITATIONS OF USING THE FIXED ASSET RATIO

Companies with [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] sales may have worse ratios in slow periods,  so the ratio should be looked at during several different time periods. Additionally,  management could be outsourcing production to reduce reliance on assets and improve its FAT ratio,  while still struggling to maintain stable cash flows and other business fundamentals.

Companies with strong asset turnover ratios can still lose money because the amount of sales generated by fixed assets speak nothing of the company's ability to generate solid profits or healthy cash flow. The fixed asset ratio only looks at net sales and fixed assets; company-wide expenses are not factored into the equation. In addition,  there are differences in the cashflow between when net sales are collected and when fixed assets are invested in.

Like other financial ratios,  the fixed ratio turnover ratio is only useful as a comparative tool. For instance,  a company will gain the most insight when the fixed asset ratio is compared over time to see the trend of how the company is doing. Alternatively,  a company can gain insight into their competitors by evaluating how their fixed asset ratio compares to others.
