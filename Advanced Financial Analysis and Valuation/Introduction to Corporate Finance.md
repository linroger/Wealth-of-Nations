# Introduction to Corporate Finance

“ The greatest competitive advantage Panera had,  the reason we produced these results we did,  is because we could think long term …. And the reason I took our company private is I’m increasingly worried about our ability to do that in a public market …. What’s driving today’s shareholding s are traders on the market …. We had large shareholders like Capital Research & Management,  Goldman Sachs,  Baron Funds,  but the reality is,  they don’t drive the price. What drives the price are the traders who are betting on next week’s comp. And that affects the entire organization …. Do you think this is good economic growth?” 1

# The Purpose of the Course Handouts

I intend for these handouts to augment whatever corporate finance (and capital markets) book you intend to utilize in this course. Thus,  think of these handouts as complementary rather than as substitutes to the various finance textbooks. Hopefully,  you will find them useful for the case preparation and for your class participation.

# The Role of Corporate Finance

This course is about financial decisions by corporate managers,  often from the viewpoint of the chief financial officer (CFO). It could just as easily be from the view of the CEO,  board member,  investment

Banker,  credit (and equity) research analyst,  strategy consultant,  investment manager,  proprietary trader,  and many other roles that require financial knowledge. At times,  the course will cross over into the study of capital markets due to the strong link in practice between corporate finance and capital markets. Many corporate finance decisions are often heavily influenced by what is currently occurring in capital markets,  and we will attempt to analyze the respective linkages when possible.

The course will focus on two primary areas in corporate finance:

1. Project valuation: which investments in real assets to accept or reject. 2. Financing the corporation and its projects: the optimal capital structure decision.

CFOs evaluate projects of all sorts including new plant construction,  marketing programs,  R&D,  joint ventures,  mergers & acquisitions,  and much more. CFOs look at these projects primarily from the viewpoint of whether they create value on behalf of the owners of the corporation: that is,  do they maximize shareholder wealth?

Consider Square Inc.,  for example,  which provides mobile payment solutions for smalland mid-sized businesses,  as well as orders and inventory,  employee management,  and tools for analytics and reporting. We can think of Square Inc. As a highly sophisticated technology firm which builds tools for businesses. In July 2021,  Square Inc. Announced Square Banking,  which would provide checking and savings accounts for small businesses. In business since 2010,  Square had acquired a banking charter in March 2021,  thus signaling intentions to move into banking products.

In some respects,  Square’s move into banking seems perfectly natural. Because Square was already providing various financial solutions to businesses,  it might seem obvious to add banking products to the mix to give a complete financial management solution to businesses. But launching a new bank is a major proposition,  even for a fintech entity such as Square that is already well immersed in financial services. Consider that during the period 1980 – 2009,  an average of 165 new bank charters occurred in the United States on an annual basis. But during 2010 – 2019,  the average annual number of new bank charters plummeted to roughly three,  largely in response to the Dodd – Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act enacted in 2010,  which imposed steeper compliance and regulatory restrictions as well as higher capital requirements on banks. Interestingly,  a big impact of the Dodd – Frank Act is the unintended protection from new entries for the existing large money-center banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. For years,  Amazon has supposedly been hankering for the opportunity to create a bank,  but the combination of regulatory forces and banking lobbyists have been largely successful at stymieing those efforts.

I have no insight as to the level of [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|financial analysis]]  that Square management conducted prior to its announced banking launch. But irrespective of the [[Week 1 Introduction to Financial Analysis|financial analysis]]  conducted by the finance team at Square,  the stock market certainly did its own analysis,  albeit based on incomplete data,  and adjusted the stock price accordingly. Intuitively,  market participants,  whether hedge funds,  mutual funds,  pension funds,  retail investors,  etc.,  evaluated Square’s announcement based on some expectation of the

Investment cost and the subsequent cash flows,  all adjusted for the riskiness and timing of such cash flows.

This course will discuss how financial models and tools can be used to assist management in making investments in real assets that impact value such as in the case of Square’s entry into the banking sector. And we will analyze how firms such as Square would finance their investments,  that is,  whether to use existing cash on the balance sheet or instead go to the external capital markets and raise debt or equity capital.

In addition to deciding on the most efficient means to finance a particular investment,  the CFO is also tasked with setting the firm’s target capital structure,  that is the optimal mix of debt and equity,  as well as other types of securities such as convertible and preferred securities. We commonly think of most value as being driven by the left-hand side of the balance sheet,  whereas decisions made on the right-hand side of the balance sheet are often made to support the value creation on the left-hand side. For example,  a young company such as Lyft is financed largely with equity due to the large cash burn and no clear timetable to profitability. On the other hand,  American Airlines has considerable debt in its capital structure due to large amount of tangible assets on its balance sheet.

We think of real asset markets as less efficient than financial markets and thus believe most of the value creation occurs on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. And CFOs can create some incremental value on the right-hand side of the balance sheet,  but capital market efficiency limits these gains. However,  value destruction can also occur on the right-hand side of the balance due to financial decisions that impair the left-hand side,  that is,  financial decisions which are disruptive to the real operations of the corporation. And we will keep in mind that many CEOs and CFOs consider themselves as having tremendous financial expertise allowing them to time markets,  irrespective of whether there is strong empirical support thereof.

The board of directors is also directly involved with certain corporate finance decisions: for example,  the choice to acquire another company or to be purchased itself. And the board has full authority to hire and terminate the CEO,  decisions which can be viewed from the context of corporate finance just like any other project. This is not to say that the board of directors is not involved in other corporate finance decisions,  but more so indirectly via their interactions with corporate management rather than via their own analyses. At times though,  a special committee of the board may hire a different investment bank to scrutinize a deal than the investment bank working on behalf of management. Obviously,  the board is always thinking about the strategic direction of the corporation,  which requires a good understanding of the financial tools covered in this course.

Throughout this course,  we will mainly assume shareholder wealth maximization is a top priority of corporate management. However,  we will discuss many decisions in which management does not maximize shareholder wealth. Failure to maximize shareholder wealth can be due to managerial malfeasance,  referred to as agency costs,  where there is a divergence of interest between management and shareholders. Or it can just be due to a world in which imperfect information prevails and

Management makes decisions they believe are ex ante wealth maximizing but turn out to be ex post failures. There are many institutional rigidities and market imperfections that result in decisions that do not maximize profits. Indeed,  these real-world imperfections is what makes corporate finance so interesting. In a world with perfect capital markets and complete information,  corporate finance is straightforward and involves no subjective judgment. Management simply moves forward on accepting all projects which maximize shareholder wealth because there are zero frictions to address. Here,  financing decisions are straightforward and unambiguous. However,  understanding financial decisions in this perfect world can significantly enhance our understanding of financial decisions in a world full of imperfections. And this is not just useful for corporate finance but also for most financial decisions,  including personal finance decisions we make every day.

Alternatively,  we can assume corporate management attempts to maximize overall stake holder wealth rather than a sole focus on shareholder wealth. Proponents of stake holder governance push for corporate chieftains to explicitly account for the interest of employees,  customers,  communities,  and suppliers in their decisions. In many instances,  maximizing shareholder wealth already accounts for the effects on other stakeholders. For example,  if Tesla batteries realize an excess number of design flaws,  thereby resulting in a high number of battery explosions,  consumer demand for new Tesla vehicles will likely plummet. Do [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] product markets,  for instance,  force Tesla to adopt the same safety measures under a model of stake holder wealth maximization versus shareholder wealth maximization?

Going back to Adam Smith and the classic Wealth of Nations (1776),  the standard argument in favor of the promotion of self-interest,  and likewise shareholder wealth,  is that it also benefits and promotes the public interest by providing new jobs,  better products,  and additional tax revenues. A major exception is a negative external it y such as pollution where the polluting firm does not internalize the cost of its pollution since there is often no direct harm to its customers,  employees,  or suppliers.

A famous essay (“The Social Responsibility Of Business Is To Increase Its Profits”) by Milton Friedman in the New York Times Magazine (1970) makes a similar point to that of Adam Smith. Friedman argues that to make sustainable profits,  firms must look out for the interests of other stakeholders,  else its cost of production will rise too high,  thereby extinguishing the desired level of profits. Friedman also suggests that a stake holder model of corporate governance gives free rein to managers to waste resources and pursue their own personal interests. Notably,  Friedman is not dismissive of the various stake holder issues,  rather,  that the manager works for the shareholders and not for society,  per se: it is the role of the government to decide the optimal spending of resources for various social interests.

In today’s world,  stake holder governance is front and center of corporate governance,  pushing hard against the views of Smith and Friedman for instance. Indeed,  the Business Roundtable,  which consists of CEOs of large corporations,  issued the Statement on the Purpose of the Corporation in 2019 which stated that corporations should move beyond a model of shareholder wealth maximization,  and instead deliver value for all stakeholders. Though in its early stages,  researchers are not finding that behavior has changed,  outside of more diversity on corporate boards for instance.

Notably,  Blackrock,  the enormous asset manager,  has spent the past few years pushing in favor of the environmental,  social,  and governance (ESG) movement which is largely aligned with the stake holder model of corporate governance. In its push for ESG,  Blackrock has been successful in building new funds which focus on sustainability and thus are attractive to many investors. However,  other investors of Blackrock funds have become concerned that the push for sustainability may come at the expense of reduced shareholder returns and thus have redeemed their investments. In many ways,  Blackrock has gotten caught in the middle due to taking a strong stand on hot political issues.

In this course,  we will primarily assume that managers act on behalf of shareholders,  yet mindful of the impact of decisions on other stakeholders. Moreover,  we consider how a more explicit model of stake holder governance will alter the decisions we observe relative to shareholder wealth maximization. Interestingly,  the concept of stake holder governance has yet to appear in the mainstream corporate finance textbooks with virtually no mention therein.

# Incorporating Human Behavior into Corporate Finance

Traditional corporate finance textbooks tend to assume that market rationality largely prevails,  and likewise that corporate managers also behave rationally,  even in a world with market imperfections and agency costs as noted earlier. That is,  corporate managers can mostly assume that markets are generally efficient with prices reflecting close to fundamental values. Similarly,  investors can assume that managers act rationally and pursue their self-interest,  subject to monitoring,  auditing,  and various incentive mechanisms designed to ensure that managers maximize shareholder wealth.

Recent academic work during the past 20 – 30 years,  however,  has produced empirical evidence and theoretical arguments that are inconsistent with rational markets and market efficiency. Many commentators,  including academics,  view the dot-com boom and subsequent bust during the late 1990 s and early 2000 s as prima facie evidence of irrational markets.

The initial behavioral finance research during the 1990 s primarily focused on investors and markets. Behavioral finance suggests investor irrationality can lead to stock prices that materially deviate from fundamental values. If arb it rage urs are not able to correct such mis pricing s,  then corporate managers could act to arbitrage the mis pricing s themselves. For example,  suppose that irrational investors undervalue certain firms. Rational corporate managers of these firms could exploit this mispricing by re purchasing their shares at a discount compared to the fundamental value,  thereby benefiting the remaining shareholders via arbitrage.

More recently,  academic researchers have begun to focus on cases in which corporate managers tend to react in predictable ways which are counter to rationality. Real-world managers appear to possess strong psychological biases that can either be overly conservative or overly optimistic and,  in either case,  result in decisions which deviate from the standard norm of shareholder wealth maximization. The crux here is that the manager believes he or she is indeed maximizing shareholder wealth. These managers don’t suffer from agency costs in that they are not slacking off,  shirking,  or otherwise pursuing projects which

Maximize their utility functions at the expense of shareholder wealth. For example,  suppose that a group of managers tends to be too confident in their abilities to create value. In effect,  they may rule out the extreme downside as a result of their making prior decisions which mostly turned out profitable. By ruling out the downside,  these managers assume a higher expected value for projects and thus will have an incentive to overinvest,  perhaps even to the point of investing in projects that reduce shareholder wealth.

In this course,  we will assume,  at least in most cases,  that rationality prevails on the part of markets and investors,  and on the part of managers. Nonetheless,  we will discuss instances of many mis pricing s and address whether corporate managers are equipped to engage in arbitrage. We will also note numerous cases in which managers seem to act in manners not predicted by basic rational models and analyze the resulting implications.

# CORPORATE FINANCE IN A WORLD OF CERTAINTY AND PERFECT CAPITAL MARKETS 3

Corporate finance is a difficult subject to master,  and mastery is impossible to attain in a single course. To fully understand corporate finance,  one first needs a good command of accounting,  asset pricing (investments),  microeconomics,  and statistics. And one needs to appreciate a combination of theory,  empirical evidence of both smalland large-sample studies,  and anecdotes and experiences from practice in the real world. Corporate finance is a subject that requires a healthy mix of both academia and practice because they are often intertwined.

As many of you will soon learn,  a frustrating feature of corporate finance is that there are multiple theories,  some of which are substitutes and others of which are complements. The empirical evidence is rarely clean,  and the interpretation of the empirical evidence is often subjective. And the practice of corporate finance by senior executives and board members is frequently at odds at what professors teach in economics departments and at business schools,  which can lead to considerable confusion and uncertainty in learning the material.

To enhance our understanding of corporate finance,  I have found from my experience,  whether doing research and teaching or practice as a board member and as an arb it rage ur,  that to understand the material it is useful to start from a base case in which capital markets are perfect. This base case is clearly unrealistic and at odds with the real world,  but you will find that by understanding corporate finance in a world with perfect capital markets,  you have a far better chance at understanding corporate finance in the real world with frictions,  rigidities,  etc.,  or else it can get overly complicated very quickly.

The assumption of perfect capital markets requires the following conditions:

1. All investors have access to the same information set,  that is,  information asymmetry does not exist. 2. Traders have no impact on prices. 3. There are no taxes or transactions costs. 4. Agency costs do not exist; there are no conflicts between management and investors. 5. Investors and managers are entirely rational.

During this course,  we will relax these assumptions and gauge their impact on managerial decisions. The relaxation of these assumptions is what makes corporate finance interesting.

In this lecture note,  we start not only by assuming perfect capital markets but also by assuming cash flows are certain,  ex ante,  a condition which doesn’t hold in the real world . Even short-term U.S. Treasuries aren’t certain,  though we can make the rough assumption that they are indeed certain given they are nearly certain.

To provide a brief illustration of corporate finance in a world with perfect capital markets and certain cash flows,  we use the fictional company,  PCM&C (Perfect Capital Markets & Certainty) Corporation. PCM&C has $\S\,  100$ million of cash (or marketable securities) on hand and has made a prior investment which will generate a cash flow of $\S200$ million at the end of the period. None of the existing $\S\,  100$ million in cash on hand is required to generate the future cash flow of $\S200$ million. Think of this as a one-period model with the period equal to one year. To account for the difference in the time value of the cash flows (that is,  we prefer receiving positive cash flows sooner to later),  assume a rate of interest of $5\%$ . Given the stated condition of certainty,  the $5\%$ rate of interest is equivalent to the prevailing risk-free rate.

Formulaic ally,  the value today of PCM&C is given as:

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{P C M\&C}}\,  =\mathsf{C}_{0}\,  +\frac{\mathsf{C F}_{1}}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}_{\!\mathrm{f}}]}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{P C M E C}}\,  =\!\S100\:\mathsf{m i l i o n}\,  +\frac{\S200\:\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{[1\!+\!0.\1]}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{V_{P C M\&C}}=\P290.48\,  \mathsf{m i l i o n}
$$

  \$290.48 million

where $\lor=$ wealth (or value),  $\mathsf{C}_{0}=\mathsf{c a s h}$ today,  ${\mathsf{C F}}_{1}=$ cash flow one year from today,  and $\mathsf{r}_{\mathsf{f}}=$ risk-free rate of interest. The term $\frac{1}{[1+r_{f}]}$ can be referred to as the discount factor because it indicates what price we can purchase future cash at today. Conversely,  the term $[1\,  +\,  r\nexists$ is the future value factor because it indicates how much a current amount is worth at the end of the period. This concept of moving dollars across time,  while intuitive and easy to compute,  is one of the most fundamental concepts in all of finance. In this example,  the cash is invested to earn a rate of $5\%,  $ that is,  the prevailing interest rate.

Another useful way to display the value of a company is via a market-value balance sheet representation as shown below.

PCM&C Market-Value Balance Sheet (millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/20acbab0e0959f10f274ca472f754bcde336e059eef1b9dfbce27a0f276cc054.jpg)

Here,  we can think of PCM&C as having two assets,  namely the $\S\,  100$ million of cash (or marketable securities) on hand and the investment worth $\S190.48$ million in current dollars. We refer to the investment as assets-in-place. Initially,  we can assume that PCM&C has no debt in its capital structure and the financing is $100\%$ equity. Thus,  the equity market capitalization of PCM&C is $\S290.48$ million,  which is equal to the value of the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. It is important to recognize that the balance sheet as constructed is based on market values,  rather than on book values,  as in the case of typical balance sheets found in financial statements for accounting purposes.

This course focuses on two primary decisions by corporate management,  namely which investments in real projects to make on the left-hand side of the balance sheet and the optimal capital structure on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. Also,  we will also discuss the distribution of cash to shareholders via dividends or share repurchase s. For now,  we can provide a brief preview of these financial decisions using PCM&C as our example. To start,  assume that PCM&C has $\S50.00$ million of debt in its capital structure as opposed to just being an all-equity firm. Everything else remains the same. If so,  we can represent the balance sheet as below.

PCM&C Market-Value Balance Sheet (millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/555589937ae53b3228abbe363bf353018b79c55c421bb0054249d4557dab435b.jpg)

Given the value of the debt is $\S50$ million,  the equity value is $\S240.48$ million,  that is,  the total firm value of $\S290.48$ million minus the $\S50$ million of debt. Obviously,  the equity value is the residual value of the total firm value less the value of the debt. But less obvious is that the swap of $\S50$ million debt was for an equal amount of equity. That is,  we made the underlying assumption that the total firm value didn’t change with this adjustment to the capital structure. Under certain restrictive conditions,  which don’t hold in the real world,  firm value is invariant to changes in the capital structure,  a proof that generated Nobel Prizes for the researchers,  Merton Miller (formerly a very influential figure at Chicago Booth) and Franco Modigliani. Rather,  firm value is driven by the value of all the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet — in this case,  cash and the present value of the investment project. That is,  alterations to the mix of debt and equity don’t have any impact on the value of these assets,  at least in a world with perfect capital markets.

As described so far,  PCM&C has two assets on its balance sheet,  the $\S100$ million cash and the existing assets-in-place,  which have a current market value of $\S190.48$ million. We next illustrate how management should evaluate a new investment project which we label as PROJECT to distinguish it from the existing assets-in-place. Assume that PROJECT can be undertaken under several different levels of investment as shown in Table 1.

Table 1: PCM&C Investment in PROJECT (millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/98c87e8739b133a5ff6756fc99815b7b5183f4a251d95dda3e6d59b7098006eb.jpg)

Management of PCM&C has the option to invest between $\S50$ million and $\S200$ million in PROJECT. The investment occurs today,  and the payoff is at the end of the year. For each level of investment in PROJECT,  Table 1 displays the corresponding payoff or cash flow at the end of the period,  the present value of each cash flow,  the net project value associated with each level of investment,  and the return on the investment. For example,  an investment level of $\S50$ million in PROJECT generates a future cash flow of

  $\S60$ million. With a discount rate (or cost of capital) of $5.0\%,  $ ,  this future cash flow has a present value of

  $\S57.14$ million. The net present value (NPV) is the summation of all cash flows discounted to the present and is equal to $\S7.14$ million. The NPV is shown formulaic ally for this one-period model as follows: 7

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=\mathsf{-C F_{0}}^{\mathrm{~+~}}\frac{\mathsf{C F_{1}}}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{r_{f}}]}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=\S7.14=-50+\frac{60}{[1+0.\1]}
$$  

In effect,  if management chooses to invest $\S50$ million in PROJECT,  the result is an increase in firm value of $\S7.14$ million,  namely the NPV of PROJECT. Given our assumption of perfect capital markets and certain cash flows,  the entire NPV accrues to the equity holder; the market value of equity increases by $\S7.14$ million. Stated differently,  the decision by management to invest $\S50$ million in PROJECT yields an immediate increase in equity value of $\S7.14$ million. This increase in value is because the return on the $\S50$ million investment in PROJECT is higher than the return on $\S50$ million at $5\%$ . That is,  with the $\S60$ million cash flow at the end of the year,  the return on investing in PROJECT is $20\%,  $ ,  far higher than investing in equivalent-risk securities that generate a $5\%$ return.

We refer to the $20\%$ return calculated previously as the internal rate of return (IRR). As we illustrate in a subsequent lecture note,  the IRR can be virtually impossible to calculate manually for multi period cash flows,  but it is easy to calculate for a single period model as assumed here. Formulaic ally,  the IRR for the one-period model is

$$
0=-\mathsf{C F}_{0}+\frac{\mathsf{C F}_{1}}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]}
$$  

Conceptually,  the IRR is the equation that sets the NPV equal to 0. Solving for IRR yields

$$
{\mathsf{I R R}}={\frac{{\mathsf{C F}}_{1}}{{\mathsf{C F}}_{0}}}\cdot1
$$  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{{\tt I R R}=\frac{60}{50}\mathrm{~-~}1=20.00\%}\end{array}
$$  

While the $\S50$ million investment in PROJECT yields $+\mathsf{N P V}$ to PCM&C Corporation and thus increases shareholder wealth relative to not investing in PROJECT,  larger levels of investment will yield even greater value. To maximize shareholder wealth,  management chooses to invest $\S125$ million in PROJECT,  which yields an NPV of $\mathbb{S}12.14$ million,  the maximum NPV across the various levels of investments. While the investment level of $\S125$ million generates the maximum NPV,  the resulting IRR is $15.20\%,  $ ,  thus considerably smaller than the $20.0\%$ IRR associated with the $\S50$ million investment level. If the objective is to maximize the IRR,  the optimal investment level is $\S50$ million.

When choosing among mutually exclusive projects or projects with different investment levels,  the shareholder wealth maximization rule is to accept the project that generates the highest NPV. In many cases,  selecting the project with the highest IRR yields the same recommendation as NPV,  but not always,  because it can produce a misleading answer as in the above example. To use the IRR rule correctly in this case,  one needs to consider the IRR on the incremental investment. For example,  the additional investment is $\S75$ million (\$125 million – $\S50$ million) which generates incremental cash flows of $\S84$ million $\mathfrak{S}144$ million – $\S60$ million),  thereby yielding an incremental IRR of $12.0\%$ . Because the incremental IRR exceeds the $5\%$ discount rate,  the modified IRR rule also recommends the investment level of $\S\,  125$ million. The point here is not that IRR can’t be revised to yield an identical conclusion to NPV,  but instead that it is more straightforward to just solve for the investment level that maximizes the NPV and report the associated IRR.

The recommended investment level of $\S125$ million exceeds the $\S100$ million of cash available on PCM&C’s balance sheet that can be used to fund projects. Thus,  an additional $\S25$ million will need to come from external sources. For this discussion,  we assume either debt or equity can fund the $\S25$ million gap,  though later in the course we discuss other available forms of financing,  convertible securities for instance. First assume management chooses to issue new equity to finance the funding gap for PROJECT. Given the assumption of assuming perfect capital markets,  it is not necessary to hire a team of investment bankers,  build new pitch books and presentations,  file prospectuses with the Securities & Exchange Commission,  and embark on a road show to convince investors to purchase shares of PCM&C.

At what price can PCM&C sell new shares to raise the $\S25$ million? Assume there are a total of 15 million shares outstanding. Recall the equity value of PCM&C is $\S290.48$ million and thus the stock price is $\S19.37.$ ,  as shown in Table 2.

Table 2: PCM&C Equity Market Capitalization

First,  suppose PCM&C raises $\S25$ million of new equity and then invest the proceeds in risk-free securities yielding $5\%$ . In this scenario,  PCM&C issues the new shares at the current price of $\mathbb{S}19.37$ ,  raising a total of 1.29 million shares as shown in the first column. The resulting firm value is $\S315.48$ million,  that is,  the original firm value of $\S290.48$ million plus the new equity of $\S25$ million. The number of shares increases from 15 million to 16.29 million,  and the stock price remains constant at $\mathbb{S}19.37$ .

However,  PCM&C can issue the new $\S25$ million of equity at a higher price to finance PROJECT than if merely to use the funds to invest in risk-free securities. That is,  management announces the new investment in PROJECT,  and the stock price of PCM&C will immediately reflect the new information about the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ of $\S12.14$ million,  resulting in an increase of equity value from $\S290.48$ million to $\S302.62$ million (not shown in Table 2). Correspondingly,  the stock price of PCM&C will increase from $\mathbb{S}19.37$ to $\S20.17$ as shown in the second column. Because we assume perfect capital markets,  there are no delays concerning the stock price in fully impounding the new information regarding PROJECT. And since management issues the new shares at a higher price,  PCM&C only needs to raise 1.24 million shares as opposed to 1.29 million shares. Finally,  and as will be discussed in more detail during the course,  there is no dilution in the sense of the equity issue resulting in a decreased stock price because PCM&C issued the stock at its fundamental value,  which thus reflects the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ resulting from PROJECT.

Alternatively,  management can raise additional debt of $\S25$ million. The debt matures at the end of the period and carries an interest rate of $5\%$ given the certainty of cash flows. Note the interest rate on the debt is identical to the discount rate for PROJECT. In a world in which cash flows are certain,  there is only one discount rate,  which happens to be the risk-free rate. The resulting stock price is 	  ,  the same as if equity finances PROJECT. Management is in different to using debt or equity to finance the funding gap with PROJECT because the value implications are identical due to the assumption of perfect capital markets. Obviously,  debt and equity issues can have different value implications due to various real-world frictions such as taxes and information asymmetry.

# The Separation of the Investment Decision from the Consumption Decision

As described previously,  management of PCM&C maximizes shareholder wealth by accepting all $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects and rejecting all – NPV projects. But shareholders have different utility functions in that some shareholders prefer to consume cash flows today more so than other shareholders who might have lower personal discount rates. That is,  to the extent that shareholders have different discount rates,  those shareholders who have a higher preference for consuming cash flows today will have higher discount rates than shareholders who are willing to consume cash flows in later periods. The question is whether managers need to take account of the consumption patterns desired by their shareholders when contemplating which projects to invest in.

Many CEOs (see Ron Shaich’s interview on CNBC’s Mad Money show referenced at the beginning of this lecture note),  legal academics,  judges,  and various business reporters hold strong views that shareholders are incredibly myopic and are willing to sacrifice profitable long-term projects for short-term earnings. As quoted in the October 16,  2017 Wall Street Journal article,  “Silicon Valley vs. Wall Street: Can the New Long-Term Stock Exchange Disrupt Capitalism?” 9 Margit Wen n mac her s of Andreessen Horowitz,  a wellknown venture capital firm in Silicon Valley,  stated,

“ the only thing that matters is what did you tell the Street and what does it make? … They don’t care about virtual reality or autonomous driving or what your long-term strategy is. ”

To combat this perception,  Andreessen Horiwitz and other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are funding a new stock exchange,  The Long-Term Stock Exchange,  which will provide greater voting power to shareholders with longer tenure,  link management incentives to long-term goals,  encourage strategy discussions in the boardroom,  etc. Also,  survey studies of CEOs document that managers feel pressured by shareholders to bypass value-enhancing projects to hit current earnings.

It is useful to address this issue in the setting of perfect capital markets. Consider a shareholder,  OWNER,  of PCM&C who has three assets in her portfolio,  $\S100,  000\;{\sf c a s h},  $ ,  a $\S3$ million bond that matures at the end of the period and pays a $5\%$ rate of interest,  and 300,  000 shares ( $2\%$ ownership) of PCM&C stock. Given the $\S19.37$ stock price of PCM&C,  OWNER has $\S5.81$ million in PCM&C stock,  as displayed in OWNER’s personal market-value balance sheet.

OWNER Personal Market-Value Balance Sheet (millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5b1ff942e83126bcfe36a55019ead58b44521169f821ea5bd6ca20ac062f6960.jpg)

As shown on OWNER’s balance sheet,  her current wealth is $\S8.91$ million. Assume that OWNER is restricted from selling the bond and from selling her shares in PCM&C stock before the end of the year. If OWNER chooses to consume at the end of the period rather than at the current time,  she will have $\S9.36$ million in wealth to consume due to each of her assets increasing at a rate of $5\%$ over the period. Alternatively,  OWNER can consume $\S8.91$ million of cash today via borrowing $\S8.81$ million collateralized by her bond position and ownership in PCM&C stock,  and then using the $\S8.81$ million from borrowed funds and the $\mathbb{S}100{,  }000$ cash on hand for consumption purposes. Given perfect capital markets and certainty,  OWNER is not subject to a haircut on the loan,  rather is subject to only the time value of money. With certainty,  we know that OWNER will receive the cash flows. And because of the perfect capital markets conditions,  we know that OWNER will pay no taxes on the proceeds,  will not pay any transactions costs on receiving the funds,  and will not engage in nefarious behavior — that is,  she will not divert the $\S9.36$ million elsewhere in one year upon the realization of that amount. Consequently,  OWNER will be able to borrow against the full amount because no haircut on the loan is needed to account for a possible loan default.

Capital markets facilitate the transfer of financial assets through time and allow OWNER to separate her consumption patterns from the timing of cash flows. Of course,  there are market imperfections in the real world,  and even in developed economies,  which deter the seamless flow of financial assets through time,  but even so,  these flows are still able to occur reasonably efficiently.

The next step,  an important one,  is to understand the relation between the investment decision by PCM&C and the consumption preferences of OWNER. What if OWNER prefers to consume all her wealth today versus at the end of the period? 13 How will OWNER view PCM&C ’s decision to invest in PROJECT? Moreover,  assume that PCM&C has decided to raise the entire $\$ 25$ million of the funding from its existing shareholders on a pro rata basis such that OWNER will need to contribute to the capital raise. Since

OWNER has a $2\%$ stake in PCM&C,  she will need to invest an additional $\$ 500{,  }000$ in PCM&C as part of the $\$ 25$ million capital raise. While OWNER has only $\mathbb{S}100{,  }000$ of cash on hand and is unable to sell part of her bonds to raise additional funds,  she will still have no issue in borrowing the incremental $\$ 400{,  }000$ to purchase additional shares in PCM&C to maintain her $2\%$ ownership. OWNER’s balance sheet ,  which reflects the acceptance and financing of PROJECT by PCM&C is:

OWNER Personal Market-Value Balance Sheet (millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/112270c6ce7ca7566598edb433112b93ca5d42d1fff74dfdb69f2d969125fd5b.jpg)

OWNER’s cash drops to zero because she used the $\mathbb{S}100{,  }000$ to provide some of the funds for the additional $\$ 500{,  }000$ investment in PCM&C shares. The balance sheet displays the Debt of $\$ 400{,  }000$ which accounts for the rest of the financing for the investment. I mportantly,  the value of OWNER’s stake in PCM&C stock increases from $\$ 5.81$ million to $\$ 6.55$ million,  an increase of roughly $\$ 740{,  }000,  $ ,  thus reflecting the $\$ 500{,  }000$ additional shares purchased plus the $+\,  \mathsf{N P V}$ resulting from PROJECT allocated to her shares.

The impact of PCM&C ’s investment in PROJECT to OWNER is an increase in wealth from $\$ 8.91$ million to $\$ 9.15$ million,  the wealth difference equivalent to the amount of the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ allocated to OWNER. Thus,  despite spending all available cash plus borrowing funds to finance her additional purchase of PCM&C shares,  OWNER has more consumption power today. That is,  whereas she was previously only able to consume $\$ 8.91$ million at the extreme,  OWNER can now consume $\$ 9.15$ million at the extreme.

Importantly,  capital markets allow not only the transfer of financial assets through time as we saw earlier but also the separation of the consumption decision from the investment decision,  an important concept and bedrock of corporate finance we will discuss throughout this course. In this perfect world,  both savers and spenders agree that the optimal investment level is $\S\,   125$ million,  which is not influenced by their spending habits and utility functions. Dividend policy is irrelevant in this perfect world setting. And the notion of forsaking valuable long-term profits for the benefit of less valuable short-term profits does not exist in this perfect world. But,  as we will show in this case ’ s course,  market frictions and imperfections result in deviations from optimal investment policy and thus capital structure policy becomes relevant.

A fundamental question is why shareholders would ever prefer short-run cash flows over higher riskadjusted long-term cash flows. That is,  a primary principle of economics is that individuals prefer more to less; thus,  the logic is that a shareholder would prefer a long-term cash flow distribution which has a present value of $\$ 21$ million over a short-term cash flow distribution with a present value of $\$ 20$ million. Indeed,  this is the underlying argument behind the separation of the investment decision from the consumption decision,  and the reason that both spenders and savers will vote the same concerning project selection,  at least under the assumption of perfect capital markets.

The preponderance of the empirical evidence in the academic finance journals shows that shareholders want managers to maximize shareholder wealth,  irrespective of whether the projects are longor shortterm. When CEOs announce long-term projects,  the stock prices of their respective firms increase on average in support of their project selection. For example,  when public firms announce new CAPX and R&D announcements,  the stock market generally approves. However,  in the real world,  exceptions can occur,  and it is the belief of many CEOs,  such as Ron Shaich of Panera Bread,  that today’s shareholders are far too myopic and focused on short-term earnings at the expense of long-term shareholder wealth maximization.

Part of the issue may be that CEOs,  legal jurists,  reporters,  etc.,  think more in terms of anecdotes,  rather than thinking in terms of the entire distribution of possible outcomes,  and thus may have biased views,  often based on their recent experience,  irrespective of their level of intelligence. On a personal level,  I have witnessed pushes for short-term profits over long-term profits,  and interestingly this often comes from privateequity investors where one would think that this conflict shouldn’t exist. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that,  on average,  corporations sacrifice long-term profits for short-term profits.

# MULTI PERIOD CASH FLOWS

In the PCM&C exercise,  capital markets are perfect and certainty prevails. Given all cash flows are known with certainty,  the discount rate reflects only the time value of money because there is no risk. In the real world,  we consider the short-term U.S. Treasury Bill as somewhat risk-free. While a subsequent lecture note focuses on established asset-pricing models by which to compute discount rates in practice,  for now,  we will assume,  rather than estimate,  a discount rate and consider it to reflect the time value of money plus some risk premium. That is,  we will assume uncertain cash flows,  but will continue to maintain the assumption of perfect capital markets. We will also assume multiple periods as opposed to the singleperiod exercise with PCM&C.

In a multi period world,  the formula for NPV is given by:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=-\mathsf{C F}_{0}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F}_{1}\right]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\right]}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F}_{2}\right]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\right]^{2}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F}_{3}\right]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\right]^{3}}+...\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F}_{\mathsf{T}}\right]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\right]^{\mathsf{T}}}
$$  

Where $\mathsf{r}=$ Risk-free rate $^+$ Risk premium.

Given the future cash flows are not known with certainty,  the $"\mathsf{E}"$ in front of the $"{\mathsf{C F}}"$ reflects the case the cash flows are expected. Note that there is no $"\mathsf{E}"$ in front of the cash outflow in Time 0 because it is a certain expenditure that is happening immediately.

When valuing long-lived assets,  corporate finance practitioners often produce detailed cash flow estimates over a forecast period,  e.g.,  5 – 10 years,  and then assume perpetual cash flows thereafter for ease of calculation. If we assume a stream of constant cash flows commencing at the end of the year and continuing forever with annual payments,  the formula to value the stream of perpetual cash flows is:

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\Bigl[1+\mathsf{r}\Bigr]}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\Bigl[1+\mathsf{r}\Bigr]^{2}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\Bigl[1+\mathsf{r}\Bigr]^{3}}+...\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\Bigl[1+\mathsf{r}\Bigr]^{\infty}}
$$  

Table 2: PCM&C Equity Market Capitalization

Using a few mathematical steps,  this series converts to a geometric progression,  the sum of which has a the following finite solution:

</table>

Using a few mathematical steps,  this series converts to a geometric progression,  the sum of which has a the following finite solution:

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{C F}]}{\mathsf{r}}
$$  

Which is our well-known perpetuity formula. Note that the value is as of today $(\mathsf{T i m e}=0)$ ) if we assume the first cash flow occurs one year from today. For example,  a stream of expected constant cash flows of $\$ 100$ million per year commencing at the end of the year yields a value of $\$ 1.25$ billion using a discount rate of $8\%$ .

$$
\P 1.25{\mathrm{~billion}}={\frac{\$ 100{\mathrm{~milliion}}}{. 08}}
$$  

And more generally,  we can allow the perpetuity to have positive or negative growth at a constant rate rather than merely assuming the cash flows are constant through time.

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigl]}{\Bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\Bigr]}\!+\!\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigl]\bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{g}\bigr]}{\Bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\Bigr]^{2}}\!+\!\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigl]\bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{g}\bigr]^{2}}{\Bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\Bigr]^{3}}\!+\!...\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigl]\bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{g}\bigr]^{\infty-1}}{\bigl[1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\bigr]^{\infty}}
$$  

Accounting for growth,  we can simplify to the following final solution:

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\bigl[\mathsf{r}-\mathsf{g}\bigr]}
$$  

Where g is growth,  which can be zero (as in the standard perpetuity formula),  positive,  or negative. As we will note from time to time in this course,  the estimates of value in the growing perpetuity formula are extremely sensitive to the non linearity in the equation driven by the difference between r and g in the

Denominator. If the expected cash flows in the preceding example are expected to grow at $3\%$ rather than remain constant,  the resulting value is $\$ 2$ billion rather than $\$ 1.25$ billion.

$$
\L_{\L}{\$ 2\mathrm{\bethillion}}=\frac{\$ 100\mathrm{\milde{u}l i o n}}{0.08\cdot 0.03}
$$  

In some cases,  the cash flows are fixed for a finite number of periods,  such as years,  a series which is referred to as an annuity. An annuity can be shown on a timeline as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\overbrace{\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c c}{\mathsf{C F}}&{}&{\mathsf{C F}}&{}&{\mathsf{C F}}&{}&{\mathsf{C F}}&{}&{\mathsf{C F}}&{}&{}&{}&{}&{}\\ {\rule{0.5 cm}{0 cm}}&{}&{1}&{}&{2}&{}&{\mathsf{T}}&{}&{\mathsf{T}+1}&{}&{\mathsf{T}+2}&{}&{}\end{array}}\end{array}
$$  

As shown on the preceding timeline,  an annuity consisting of T years is equal to the value of a perpetuity with cash flows beginning one year from today minus the value of a perpetuity with cash flows beginning at the end of Year $\mathsf{T}\!+\! 1$ . And for the perpetuity with cash flows starting in Year $\mathsf{T}+\mathsf{1}$ ,  the value is of the perpetuity is as of Year T. Thus,  the annuity formula is

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E[C F]}}{\mathsf{r}}-\frac{\mathsf{E[C F]}}{\mathsf{r}\mathsf{[1\!+\! R]}^{\dagger}}
$$  

Using the preceding inputs,  Eq. 7 yields the following:

$$
671.01=\frac{100}{0.08}\cdot\frac{100}{0.08\big[1.08\big]^{10}}
$$  

The first term is equal to $\$ 1.25$ billion and is merely the value of the perpetuity. The second term is also the value of a perpetuity,  but one which begins ten years later. It also has a value of $\$ 1.25$ billion,  but as of the end of the tenth year and thus needs to be further discounted by the term $1.08^{10}$ . With the discounting over the ten years,  the second perpetuity has a value of $\$ 578.99$ million as of today. Thus,  the difference between the value of the two perpetuities is simply the ten-year annuity with a value of $\$ 671.01$ million. Alternatively,  one can resort to a present value annuity table,  which indicates a value of 6.7101 corresponding to 10 years and an interest rate of $8\%,  $ ,  thus indicating the same value of $\$ 671.01$ million. Likewise,  one can also discount the ten payments of $\S\,   100$ million and sum the discounted cash flows as shown in Table 3.

Table 3: Annuity and Growing Annuity Valuations

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8fe29adb9e41e3474f5eb77c32681a5b88a784cd41f87c7148423ec0961e0287.jpg)

Lastly,  the value of a growing annuity follows the same logic; namely,  it is a growing perpetuity minus a growing perpetuity beginning in a subsequent period,  and the formula is

$$
\mathsf{V}=\frac{\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{C F}\bigr]}{\bigl[\mathsf{r}\cdot\mathsf{g}\bigr]}\times\left[1-\frac{\bigl (1\!+\!\mathsf{g}\bigr)^{\mathsf{t}}}{\bigl (1\!+\!\mathsf{r}\bigr)^{\mathsf{t}}}\right]
$$  

With a starting cash flow of $\S\,   100$ in one year,  growing $3\%$ annually,  and a discount rate of $8\%,  $ ,  the growing annuity has a value of $\$ 755.01$ million per the preceding formula. Alternatively,  as shown in Table 3,  the summation of the discounted cash flows growing $3\%$ annually generates the same value of $\$ 755.01$ million. Intuitively,  just as the growing perpetuity had a higher value than the constant perpetuity,  the growing annuity also has a higher value than a constant annuity with the same discount rate and number of years.

# CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

Corporate finance can get complicated much quicker than we often think. And it can get messy with lots of details and nuances. This is especially the case in the real world where agency costs and information asymmetry are prevalent,  when lots of players are involved,  and when markets are in turmoil. To this point,  we will cover messy cases in this class,  and I have picked cases which are realistic,  yet allows you to apply what you have learned in finance courses to settings you will experience down the road.

For most of you to get the maximum benefit out of this course,  it is crucial that you do not attack the cases in isolation,  instead you should also read the relevant lecture notes as they will assist you in the case preparation and likewise in the class discussion. Moreover,  reading the lecture notes should decrease the time you spend preparing your answers as you will have a better framework to attack the cases. These notes are written that that in mind,  that is,  think of them as refresher notes to your corporate finance and capital markets textbooks. Lastly,  if you happen to get stuck on a particular issue in the subsequent lecture notes,  it is generally advantageous to revert to a world of perfect capital markets which this introductory lecture stresses. Without knowing the value implications of decisions and events in perfect capital markets,  it is virtually impossible to master financial management in the real world.

# Financial Forecasting

# TRANSITION FROM FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING TO CORPORATE FINANCE

This brief lecture note covers short-term financial planning to accompany the Plainview case. It provides a simple exercise in forecasting financial statements with the purpose of assessing a short-term cash surplus or cash deficiency. Do not view this note as a comprehensive treatment of cash planning. Rather given that financial executives spend a lot of time with short-term planning and preparing budgets,  it is useful to have a rudimentary understanding of forecasting financial statements.

# FORECASTING AT GIDDY-UP CORPORATION

We consider the fictional company,  Giddy-Up Corporation,  in this cursory overview of financial forecasting. Giddy-Up manufactures western hats which are distributed through retail outlets such as Walmart and Neiman Marcus. Exhibit 1 displays the income statement for Giddy-Up during 2017 and 2018,  and GiddyUp’s pro forma income statement for 2019. Note that GiddyUp’s income statement is a sparse listing of accounts,  as income statements for most firms contain far more detail than as presented. Exhibit 2 displays the 2017 and 2018 balance sheet for Giddy-Up,  and the pro forma balance sheet for 2019. As the case for the income statement,  the balance sheet for Giddy-Up displays a limited number of accounts relative to that shown on the balance sheet of most large corporations. There are no unique line items on either GiddyUp’s balance sheets or income statements with which you should not be already familiar.

The exercise is to construct the 2019 pro forma income statement and balance sheet for Giddy-Up with the goal of assessing any financing needs. The starting point is the revenue line on the income statement.

Given the lack of macroeconomic,  industry,  and firm-specific data which can be used to assist in forecasting GiddyUp’s revenue for 2019,  we simply assume the same $4.12\%$ growth rate in revenue as realized from 2017 to 2018,  and thus estimate revenue at $\$ 60.948$ million.

For some of the subsequent line items,  such as cost of goods sold,  we assume that the 2019 estimate is the same percent of revenue as for 2018 which was $67.4\%$ . Alternatively,  we can assume the 2019 estimate for cost of goods sold is the average percent of revenue during 2017-2018 $(67.8\%)$ ). In many cases,  averaging over multiple years is preferable due to minimizing variability of the forecasted estimates. In this example,  there is minimal difference across the two years. Also,  due to the 2018 change in the corporate tax rate which impacts certain calculations,  we chose to look back to 2018 only. With respect to selling,  general and administrative expenses,  as well as to other operating expenses,  we also assume the 2019 line items are the same percent of revenue as for 2018.

The net interest expense drops sharply,  from $\mathbb{S}121{,  }000$ in 2017 to $\$ 56,  000$ in 2018. This decline in the net interest expense is primarily due to two factors: 1) a decline in the long-term debt of Giddy-Up and 2) a corresponding increase in cash balances. As shown on GiddyUp’s balance sheet in Exhibit 2,  GiddyUp’s long-term debt declined from $\$ 2.0$ million to $\$ 400{,  }000$ from 2017 to 2018,  and its cash balance increased from $\$ 861_{,  }000$ to $\$ 966{,  }000$ over the same period. Since the line item for net interest expense reflects interest earnings on cash held in addition to actual interest paid,  the combination of the substantially reduced debt amount and the increase in cash balances is expected to have a significant reduction in net interest expense as displayed. Looking forward to 2019,  it is likely the net interest expense will be minimal given the large reduction of debt in 2018,  and thus we assume zero net interest expense for 2019.

Whereas GiddyUp’s corporate taxes paid in 2017 were $37.0\%$ of profit before taxes,  the 2018 corporate taxes declined to $21.0\%$ due to the recent tax law change. For 2019,  we assume the same $21.0\%$ corporate tax rate as realized in 2018. The pro forma [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] in 2019 for Giddy-Up is $\$ 3.40$ million.

The process for forecasting the line items on the balance sheet is similar to forecasting the line items on the income statement. For most of the balance sheet items,  we estimate the 2019 values will have the same percent of sales as the 2018 values. On the asset side of the balance sheet,  we note one exception,  namely [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] (net),  as we keep [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] fixed at $\$ 4.1$ million,  thus assuming Giddy-Up plans no

Acquisitions for 2019 which would result in an increase to [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]]. Likewise,  we assume there is no impairment or write down of [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]] created by prior acquisitions.

On the liability side of the balance sheet,  we assume Giddy-Up will redeem its $\$ 400{,  }000$ remaining amount of debt outstanding in 2019 since it redeemed $\$ 1.6$ million in 2018 due to strong net income,  and 2019 forecasts to be even more profitable than 2018. In addition,  management does not intend to issue new common stock which will remain fixed at $\mathbb{S}182{,  }000$ .

Retained earnings are not calculated as a percent of sales as we did with many of the line items. Rather,  we calculate retained earnings via its link between the income statement and balance sheet as displayed in Exhibit 3. Retained earnings represent the sum of all prior net profits (or losses),  of a corporation,  excess of dividends paid. Giddy-Up had retained earnings of $\$ 6.919$ million in 2017 which increased to $\$ 8.755$ million in 2018. Since Giddy-Up realized [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] of $\$ 3.218$ million in 2018,  we can infer that it paid $\$ 1.382$ million in dividends during 2018. To be clear,  dividends paid do not appear on either the income statement or balance sheet,  rather,  we can deduce this value based on [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] on the income statement and retained earnings on the balance sheet.

To calculate the retained earnings for 2019,  the first step is to estimate GiddyUp’s 2019 dividends. Rather than forecasting dividends as a percent of sales,  we instead calculate the dividend payout relative to [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] for 2018 which is $42.95\%$ and assume it will be the same ratio for 2019,  thus generating the $\$ 1.459$ million $(\$ 3.397$ million $\times\,   42.95\%$ ) of pro forma dividends in 2019.

Based on the above assumptions for the 2019 income statement and balance sheet,  the value of the pro forma total assets on the balance sheet is $\$ 10.452$ million versus $\$ 11.775$ million for the pro forma total liabilities and shareholder equity. The difference of $\$ 1.323$ million reflects excess cash,  that is,  assuming GiddyUp doesn’t need a higher cash balance than the assumed cash amount of $\$ 1.006$ million for 2019. There are two options in terms of handling the $\$ 1.323$ million difference. The first is that it can go on the balance sheet under cash and equivalents which will increase to $\$ 2.329$ million from $\$ 1.006$ million,  and thus the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet equals the total liabilities and equity on the right-hand side. Alternatively,  Giddy-Up can issue a special and one-time dividend in the aggregate amount of $\$ 1.323$ million to its shareholders. After the payment of the special dividend,  the retained earnings are $\$ 9.370$ million as opposed to $\$ 10.693$ million. In this case,  total assets also equal total liabilities and equity at $\$ 10.452$ million.

Suppose the pro forma estimates for the total assets and total liabilities and equity were reversed. That is,  what if the pro forma total assets were $\$ 11.775$ million and the pro forma total liabilities and equity were $\$ 10.452$ million? In this case,  Giddy-Up will have a financing deficiency and thus requires external capital in the amount of $\$ 1.323$ million to support the higher level of assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. If management chooses equity to finance the required cash,  the new equity issue appears on the balance sheet via common stock of $\$ 1.505$ million,  thus $\$ 1.323$ million higher than the 2018 amount of $\mathbb{S}182{,  }000$ .

Alternatively,  Giddy-Up can utilize new debt to satisfy the financing deficiency of $\$ 1.323$ million. If debt rather than equity is employed to eliminate the financing deficiency,  the amount raised,  however,  will have to exceed the $\$ 1.323$ million deficiency. Assume for example that Giddy-Up raises $\$ 1.323$ million at an annual coupon rate of $6.8\%$ . This debt raise will result in interest expense of $\$ 90{,  }000$ which reduces [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] by $\$ 71{,  }000,  $ ,  after accounting for a $21\%$ tax rate. Thus,  there is less retained earnings due to the decline in [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] which results in a higher financing deficiency than $\$ 1.323$ million and so forth given to the inter dependency between the interest expense and the required external financing.

# CONCLUDING THOUGHTS

As indicated at the beginning of this lecture note,  the objective is to provide a brief overview of financial forecasting with the goal of assessing the excess cash or cash deficiency in future periods. It is largely intended to complement the Plainview case. For those who might want to take the Giddy-Up exercise a step forward,  you can also estimate the statement of cash flows for 2018 and the forecasted cash flows for 2019 as well,  using either the direct or indirect (starting with net income) method of computing cash flows.

While this note didn’t cover work ing capital management,  it is just an extension of short-term financial forecasting. With working capital management,  the cash cycle is important since for many corporations,  there is a lengthy delay between when they start expending funds on materials and when they are eventually paid by their customers. Firms which hold large amounts of inventory for long periods of time and firms which wait lengthy periods before getting paid must finance this working capital. Indeed,  when these firms grow rapidly,  the rapid growth can put huge stress on their near-term financing needs. Likewise,  firms subject to seasonal production will exhibit large swings in inventory and thus must be able to finance inventory build-ups. And when Covid-19 wreaked havoc on the world in 2020,  many manufacturers attempted,  though often without success,  to stockpile larger inventories of its basic supplied needed for production. The cost of the additional inventory is not simply the fact that it must be stored,  but also that it needs to be financed on the balance sheet. Indeed,  the logic behind just-in-time inventory management is to not only reduce storage costs,  but more importantly,  to reduce the amount of inventory on the balance sheet which requires financing.

# Using NPV to Make Investment Decisions

“Our ultimate financial measure,  and the one we most want to drive over the long-term,  is free cash flow per share. Why not focus first and foremost,  as many do,  on earnings,  earnings per share or earnings growth? The simple answer is that earnings don’t directly translate into cash flows,  and shares are only worth the present value of their future cash flows,  not the present value of their future earnings.” 1

# Measuring Cash Flows

Cash flows versus some measure of revenue,  profits,  etc.,  is what ultimately matters to shareholders. As Jeff Bezos stresses in Amazon ’s 2004 Letter to Shareholders referenced above,  “shares are worth only the present value of their future cash flows,  not the present value of their future earnings.” In contrast,  corporate management,  and the business press among others,  often tend to fixate on earnings per share as the optimal metric for corporate financial performance. This lecture note highlights differences between cash flows versus earnings,  and shows that while these measures are generally direction ally the same,  they can yield starkly divergent recommendations about which projects to move forward on.

Having a focus on cash flows,  and then discounting them correctly,  is essential. And it is not about the ability to proceed mechanically through the formulas and mathematics,  instead,  it is about the understanding of the risk and return. On the risk side,  it is about disentangling the systematic risk from

The idiosyncratic risk to compute the cost of capital. And this is not to downplay idiosyncratic risk as it is relevant to corporate management in their decision making,  just that idiosyncratic can be diversified away for free by the investor base and thus should not matter of fact enter the cost of capital calculations. On the return side,  that is,  the expected future cash flows,  the keyword is EXPECTED . It is not merely that we estimate cash flows,  the key point is that we estimate expected,  or unbiased,  cash flows. That is,  to properly value a project,  we need to provide our best estimates of weights associated with all future states of the world,  positive and negative. Otherwise,  the NPV calculation is useless if forecasts of cash flows are biased,  either high or low. Obviously,  while it is important as a corporate manager to optimally respond and have contingencies in place for both good and bad outcomes,  one should not think of certain states of the world as the only likelihood.

In practice,  the estimation of cash flows is a difficult assignment as the financial models can be overly complicated with dozens of assumptions which end up driving the resulting valuation. For example,  it is important to have estimates of product demand,  of supply input costs,  of competitor behavior,  of macro influences,  etc.,  and these estimates are all made with considerable error. And while it is difficult even to estimate one year out,  the difficulty in estimating cash flows compounds for distant periods. This complexity is crucial to keep in mind with the simple example below which illustrates the calculation of cash flows. The objective is to provide an intuitive and basic framework,  but mindful that it is far more complicated in practice to obtain realistic and unbiased estimates.

I tend to think that corporate finance textbooks are overly simplistic in their illustration of NPV. But at the other extreme,  a full-blown coverage of NPV via a real-world example simply provides way too many complexities,  which are important for the decision maker,  but detract in terms of presentation material in a textbook. It is impossible to achieve both. Below,  I adopt a fictional example used by Jeff Bezo’s in Amazon’s 2004 Annual Letter to Shareholders,  with additional modifications to add some more features into the analysis. Though the Amazon NPV example is fictional,  note that it is the sole focus of the 2004 shareholder letter and thus viewed as high priority by Bezos. Below is my adaptation of the example.

The Amazon shareholder letter considers a firm that invents a machine which can quickly transport people from one place to another. While the machine has already been invented,  it will cost another $\$ 160$ million to build and can generate revenues immediately. The machine will have the capacity to transport 100,  000 people annually and has a useful life of only four years as it will become surpassed by newer and better machines. Amazon further assumes that with a focus on earnings growth,  it will invest more capital to buy additional machines in Years 2 through 4,  all with the same attributes of the initial travel machine.

High demand exists for the new travel machine and management forecasts it will sell at full capacity of 100,  000 customer trips annually at a price of $\mathbb{S}1{,  }000$ . Each trip will cost $\$ 500$ ,  consisting of $\$ 450$ for energy and materials and $\$ 50$ for labor and other expenses. For accounting purposes,  Amazon will depreciate the machine via the straight-line method over its four-year useful life. Assume a corporate tax rate of $25\%$ whereas Bezos assumed a world without taxes. Also assume that net working capital (NWC) is necessary to operate Amazon’s new travel machine whereas Bezos simplified and assumed zero NWC would be required.

Table 1 displays the income statement for Amazon’s travel machine. The profits before taxes are $\$ 10$ million in Year 1 and increase to $\$ 80$ million by Year 4.

“It’s impressive,  $100\%$ compound earnings growth and $\$ 150$ million of cumulative earnings. Investors considering only the above income statement would be delighted. However,  looking at cash flows tells a different story .” 2004 Amazon Letter to Shareholders.

The Amazon letter makes the point that while earnings is accelerating at a rapid rate during the first four years,  cash flows over the same period are sharply negative. Note that by focusing on only the first four years,  the Amazon letter actually overstates the divergence between earnings and cash flows as a major part of the divergence is simply a timing issue. In order to compute the overall NPV of the space travel project,  it is important also to include Years 5-7 which capture the benefit of the subsequent investments in the new machine.

Table 1 – Discounted Cash Flow Analysis (in millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e2d431fa088d7d572cd9ec8f25f87574fd3e6eb0eebb8009281a30dec44c3465.jpg)

The revenue doubles in Year 2,  Year 3,  and Year 4,  respectively,  due to the investment in additional travel machines. Given the assumptions from the Amazon letter,  the after-tax profits also double in Year 2 through Year 4. Starting in Year 5,  the profits decline annually due to the decommissioning of the machines as a result of their four-year life,  and the last period of profits is Year 7. In total,  the space-travel project yields $\S_{ Ḋ }240 Ḍ$ million of after-tax profits.

While the travel machine investment is expected to generate attractive earnings growth,  investors are unable to reinvest or consume earnings; rather,  cash flows are the ultimate driver of shareholder wealth creation. A few adjustments are in order to convert after-tax profits to cash flows. The first adjustment is for the depreciation of the underlying investment. As noted above,  Amazon assumes the equipment has a four-year useful life and employs straight-line depreciation over that period. Thus,  the depreciation is $\$ 40$ million in Year 1 with respect to the initial $\$ 160$ million space-travel investment and we add back this $\$ 40$ million in depreciation expenses to the Year 1 after-tax profits. Depreciation is added back since it is not a cash flow per se,  instead it only impacts the cash flow via a reduction in taxes since depreciation is treated as an expense for accounting purposes.

Amazon used the straight-line method of depreciation to simplify the analysis,  but in practice while straight-line depreciation is often employed for the accounting statements,  corporations use accelerated depreciation to maximize the present value of the tax benefits from depreciating capital expenditures (CAPX) such as the travel machine investment. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allows corporations to accelerate depreciation over a period which is less in length than the actual projected life of the investment,  and importantly,  have been able to frontload the depreciation. Over the years,  and typically in response to a recession ary period,  Congress has provided bonus deprecation which is even more

Accelerated. Most recently,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 allows corporations to deduct $100\%$ of the investment cost for property with an expected life of 20 years or less and would run through 2022 and sunsets afterward,  reverting back im 2027 to the permanent tax rules as stipulated by the 1986 Tax Reform Act.

The second adjustment in Table 1 is to subtract the CAPX from the after-tax profits. As indicated above,  CAPX is a cash outflow that doesn’t fully hit the income statement simultaneous with the investment. I assume that the CAPX takes place at the beginning of the year for discounting purposes,  which in effect occurs at the end of the prior year. Thus,  for the $\$ 160$ million machine which generates revenue in Year 1,  assume the actual CAPX occurs in Year 0 which is effectively the beginning of Year 1. Table 2 provides the depreciation schedule for the investment in trael machines. Though not required,  I find it useful to create a depreciation schedule which tracks the book values of CAPX over its useful life. As shown in Table 2,  the book value of the travel machines increases to $\$ 1$ billion at the end of Year 3 and is completely written off by the end of Year 7 simultaneous with the final cash flows.

Table 2 – Depreciation Schedule (in millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/dc7cf3bff8ae2b2cadddb3afdd0aa451917b4ab99bf3d08feba774125444638d.jpg)

The third adjustment in converting after-tax profits to cash flows is to account for changes in net working capital (NWC). For our purposes,  NWC consists of cash required for operations,  accounts receivable,  and inventory,  and minus accounts payable. Increases in cash required for operations,  accounts receivable and inventory result in higher NWC,  whereas increases in accounts payable reduce NWC. The income statement does not capture changes in NWC,  and thus we adjust for changes in NWC below the [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] line. For example,  suppose the first-year revenue for a company was solely in accounts receivable,  none of which had been converted to cash by the end of the company’s fiscal year. While the income statement treats the accounts receivable as revenue for the year,  the adjustment to cash flows is necessary to reflect the fact that the accounts receivable had not yet converted to cash. Likewise,  the payment for purchased inventory is a negative cash flow which doesn’t hit the income statement. Typically,  NWC increases as revenue climbs in subsequent years and converts to cash flow when the project or venture terminates. As covered in the Financial Forecasting lecture note,  extraordinary increases in revenue can cause sharp short-run reductions in cash,  and thus a need for new financing due to the additional NWC.

As an aside,  most cash flow models prepared by investment bankers and other Wall Street professionals tend not to include cash in their NWC estimates. That is,  they assume all cash held by the corporation is excess cash when computing estimates of firm value. This assumption is often reasonable in that the required cash for operations tends to be low relative to the total cash held in the corporate coffers. However,  conceptually and in those cases where a relatively high level of cash is necessary to maintain the existing operations,  we should think of the required cash as being part of NWC.

The Amazon shareholder letter omitted changes in NWC in its adjustment from after-tax profits to cash flows,  most likely to simplify the analysis. I assume the travel machine will require $5\%$ of revenue for NWC. Thus,  for the revenue of $\S\,   100$ million in Year 1,  the NWC requirement is $\$ 5$ million and is advance of the revenue realized. Indeed,  we can think of this $\$ 5$ million as an upfront investment in Year 0 along with the $\$ 160$ million CAPX for a total negative cash flow of $\$ 165$ million. Table 3 below displays the NWC and the change in NWC for the travel machine investment. Similar to the CAPX schedule,  I find it is often helpful to have a separate NWC schedule which then feeds into the cash flow schedule. As shown,  the NWC increases through Year 3,  thus resulting in negative cash flows over this period,  followed by a reduction in NWC,  and thus increases in cash flows for the remainder of the project’s life. And as of the end of Year 7,  the NWC reverts back to zero.

Table 3 – Net Working Capital Schedule (in millions)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5f729a125a0376e8561d74f84843a868534c19f13649a4531de07bc6505dfd9b.jpg)

The three adjustments (adding back depreciation,  subtracting CAPX,  and subtracting the change in NWC) to the after-tax profits yields cash flows. For example,  the cash flow in Year 1 is $-\S\,   1\,   17.5$ million versus profit-after-taxes of $\$ 7.5$ million. Here,  the major source of the difference between profits and cash flows is the additional machine purchase of $\$ 160$ million at the end of Year 1 which generates revenues in Years 2-5. The cash flows are negative through Year 3,  that is,  during the investing phase,  and positive during Years 4-7.

The summation of the cash flows during Years 0-7 is $\S_{ Ḋ }240 Ḍ$ million,  the same as the previously referenced summation for the after-tax profits over the same period. However,  the timing of the cash flows over the life of the travel machines is far different than that of the after-tax profits. The next step is to discount the cash flows through time. The discount rate reflects the time value of money,  as proxied by the risk-free rate,  and a risk premium accounting for the fact that the travel machine cash flows are not known with certainty. We use a discount rate of $12.0\%$ the same as in the Amazon letter. The Cost of Capital lecture note will focus on the computation of the discount rate.

The next step is to convert the cash flows over time to discounted cash flows,  using the discount rate of $12.0\%,  $ dividing the cash flow in each year by the corresponding future value factor. Obviously,  for Year 0 which is the equivalent of today,  the future value factor is simply 1.0. The Year 1 future value factor is 1.12,  Year 2 future value factor is 1.25 due to compounding,  and so forth. The summation of the discounted cash flows yields a net present value (NPV) of $\cdot\S\,   1\,   1\,   1.2$ million for the travel machine project. Thus,  the project is expected to reduce overall shareholder wealth by $\$ 111.2$ million. And this is the important point made by Jeff Bezos in the 2004 Amazon Letter to Shareholders. That is,  a seemingly good project which might lead to high earnings growth is not necessarily wealth increasing for the corporation’s shareholders.

The travel project,  as discussed above,  is representative of many projects with specified lives,  in this case,  seven years. If valuing a project or investment with a perpetual life,  more specifically if valuing an entire corporation,  the discounted-cash-flow analysis will consist of two stages. The first stage is a forecast period,  with year-by-year cash flows,  for a specified number of years,  usually around five to ten years. The second stage is a terminal value calculation based on cash flows starting the year after the forecast period ends and going forever,  with cash flows growing at a constant rate,  sometimes zero. This terminal value is then discounted back to the current date to obtain the overall value of the project or corporation.

# NET PRESENT VALUE VERSUS OTHER INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE METRICS

NPV analysis is widely accepted today as the superior methodology for assessing the ex ante financial impact of project selection,  at least conceptually,  notwithstanding the concerns by many CEOs who believe that shareholders sometimes favor short-term profits over long-term cash flow and profits. But putting those issues aside,  given shareholders prefer greater wealth to less wealth,  they instruct the management team to accept all $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects and reject all – NPV projects. The basic approach to computing NPV is straightforward:

(1) Estimate all expected future cash flows (2) Obtain the opportunity cost of capital,  that is,  the return investors would expect to receive on equivalent-risk investments (3) Discount all future expected cash flows and compare to the initial investment.

While the basic approach to calculating NPV is straightforward,  it can often be difficult to calculate for numerous reasons such as in calculating the correct cost of capital or estimating cash flows,  etc. We will spend considerable time in this course building on the basic approach and a better understanding of the issues which influence the calculations. And even if all inputs are estimated correctly,  this does not of course guarantee a project’s success as ex-post realization s can be sharply different from exante expectations. Indeed,  the Amazon travel machine project,  if undertaken,  could end up delivering cash flows far higher than expected,  or far lower than expected. And even projects which are expected to generate a high $+\mathsf{N P V}$ can end up being disastrous mistakes.

The internal rate of return (IRR) is another method which can be used to evaluate projects and tends to provide the same conclusion as NPV in many applications. Moreover,  the IRR can be used in conjunction with NPV as it gives an estimate of the expected return on the project. In a simple oneperiod world,  that is where there is an investment at the beginning of the period and a single payoff at the end of the period,  the IRR is straightforward to calculate.

$$
{\mathsf{N P V}}={\mathsf{-C}}_{0}+{\frac {{\mathsf{C F}} _{1}}{[1+{\mathsf{r}}_{\mathrm {{f}} }]}}
$$  

In the lecture note,  Introduction to Corporate Finance,  we showed that the NPV was $\$ 7.14$ million for the $\$ 50$ million project by PCM&C which generated a future cash flow of $\$ 60$ million,  discounted at the $5\%$ cost of capital. The IRR is given by the equation which sets the NPV equal to zero as below:

$$
0=-\mathsf{C}_{0}+\frac{\mathsf{C F}_{1}}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]}
$$  

Solving for IRR yields:

$$
\mathsf{R R}\ =\frac{\mathsf C_{1}}{\mathsf C_{0}}-1
$$  

In the PCM&C example,  the IRR is equal to $20\%,  $ and since it exceeds the $5\%$ cost of capital,  the IRR rule makes the same recommendation as the NPV rule. That $\mathsf{i s},  $ if the IRR exceeds the opportunity cost of capital,  then the NPV is positive. Given there are only two cash flows,  the calculation of the IRR is straightforward. However,  if there are two periods and thus three cash flows,  one would have to use the quadratic formula,  the cubic formula for four cash flows,  the quartic formula for five cash flows,  and numerical methods for greater than five. In practice,  we generally use numerical methods,  solving iterative ly using Excel or similar platforms.

The NPV for a multi-period model is given by:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=\mathsf{\Pi}-\mathsf{C F_{0}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{1}}\right]}{\left[\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{r}\right]}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{2}}\right]}{\left[\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{r}\right]^{2}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{3}}\right]}{\left[\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{r}\right]^{3}}+...\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{\tau}}\right]}{\left[\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{r}\right]^{\mathsf{T}}}
$$  

And thus setting the NPV equal to 0,  the IRR for the multi-period model is given by:

$$
0=\,  \mathsf{-C F_{\circ}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{1}}\right]}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{2}}\right]}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]^{2}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{3}}\right]}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]^{3}}+...\frac{\mathsf{E}\!\left[\mathsf{C F_{\tau}}\right]}{\left[1+\mathsf{I R R}\right]^{\mathsf{T}}}
$$  

The IRR for Amazon’s fictional travel machine project is $6.92\%$ . With Amazon’s recommended discount rate of $12.0\%,  $ ,  the IRR rule indicates the project should not advance. In other words,  if shareholders of Amazon can expect to generate annualized returns of $12.0\%$ on other investments and projects of identical risk,  it is wealth reducing for corporate management to recommend the travel machine project yielding a positive IRR of $6.92\%,  $ and even if the firm has excess cash invested in Treasury bills.

A nice attribute of the IRR estimate,  used in conjunction with NPV,  is that it informs us how far off from the true cost of capital we can be with our estimate used in the NPV calculations. In the Amazon case,  the difference is quite large as the cost of capital would have to be 5.02 percentage points less than the $12.0\%$ cost of capital for it to be shareholder wealth maximizing. While we show in the Additional Considerations in Computing the Cost of Capital lecture note that cost of capital estimates are especially noisy,  it is very unlikely in the Amazon travel machine case,  the estimate would be as low as $6.92\%$ .

Conceptually,  the IRR is an elegant method for assessing projects,  but with numerous pitfalls in practice as it is not always calculable,  sometimes produces multiple estimates,  and can give misleading recommendations. Most corporate finance textbooks provide several examples of these pitfalls,  and they are worth understanding even though we don’t hav e sufficient time to address. According to McKinsey,  only about $20\%$ of finance managers are aware of the deficiencies with IRR calculations. Specifically,  corporate managers often choose to maximize the IRR which can lead to under investment. But as we will show throughout this course,  NPV always provides an unambiguous and correct recommendation.

There are other measures which many managers use to evaluate projects such as the payback rule,  but we will spend less time covering these methods. The payback period defines how long it takes before the cumulative cash flows offset the initial investment. In the case of the travel machine project,  the payback period is roughly three and a half years. That is,  we compare the initial investment of $\$ 165$ million (CAPX $^+$ initial NWC) for the first travel machine and then estimate the cash flows resulting from this single machine. It yields cash flows of $\$ 47.5$ million in each of Years 1-3 and cash flows of $\$ 52.5$ million in Year 4. Note the Year 4 cash flows are higher by $\$ 5$ million as a result of the recovery of the NWC set aside as of Year 0.

If the payback rule indicated that the payback period should be a maximum of four years for instance,  it would recommend the acceptance of the project. There are a couple of obvious problems if corporate management places a lot of weight on the payback rule. First,  the payback rule ignores cash flows after the cut-off date,  though I find it doubtful that many corporate managers would simply ignore cash flows after the cut-off date. Second,  the payback treats all cash flows before the cut-off date as the same,  thus ignoring any concept of discounting. Of course,  management could compute a discounted payback period to reflect the project’s cost of capital. In effect,  this method conveys how long it takes for the company to recover the initial investment on a risk-adjusted basis. I haven’t often seen this calculation in practice,  but it could be constructive in conjunction with computing the NPV.

Imagine how corporate management would explain the travel machine project on a conference call with equity analysts. She would not just state that the travel machine project would have a NPV of - $\S\,   1\,   1\,   1.2$ million and leave it at that. Instead,  she would likely convey the IRR of $6.92\%$ and the payback period of about three and a half years. Also,  she would probably indicate when it would be accretive on an earnings basis as analysts who build equity models tend to focus on the accretive/dilutive aspects associated with new projects and ventures.

# CONCLUDING REMARKS

NPV analysis is the workhorse for deciding whether a project merits an investment. There is no close runner-up. Its beauty lies in the fact that if the NPV is positive (negative),  management should advance (reject) the project for one straightforward reason: it is always consistent with maximizing shareholder wealth.

The textbook framework to compute the NPV of a project is clearcut. The analyst forecasts expected cash flows on a timeline and discounts the expected cash flows corresponding to each period back to the current time. Conceptually,  there is nothing more to it than that. Nonetheless,  NPV analysis is not well understood at a deep level and even by many successful corporate managers. The meaning of “expected” in expected cash flows seems to be a difficult concept for many practitioners to grasp. And typically,  the same practitioners have trouble understanding what the cost of capital represents. They recognize it is to capture the risk of a project,  yet they fail to comprehend what determines the risk of a project when it comes to computing the cost of capital,  specifically the systematic risk.

Obviously,  having a great understanding of NPV analysis does not make a great manager pe se. But it can certainly help a good manager improve their decisions,  and importantly,  in communicating their actions and decisions to external parties such as equity analysts,  business press,  and shareholders. Indeed,  a good CEO,  who fully understands NPV analysis,  will do a far better job at handling angry activist investors than a good CEO with less than a complete understanding

# The Cost of Capital

“Cost of capital is what could be produced by our second best idea,  and our best idea has to beat it. We don’t discount the future cash flows at 9% o $\mathbfit{70}\%;$ we use the U.S. Treasury rate. We try to deal with things about which we are quite certain. You can’t compensate for risk by using a high discount rate. Charlie and I don’t know our cost of capital. It’s taught at business schools,  but we’re skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can do with the capital we have. We measure against our alternatives. I’ve never seen a cost of capital calculation that made sense to me.”

# INTRODUCTION

Most major managerial investment decisions involve projects for which the initial investment outlay is expected to generate positive cash flows for several years. To assess the feasibility of these significant investments,  management needs to adjust the expected positive future cash flows by a discount rate,  namely the project’s cost of capital. Investors expect to earn risk-adjusted returns as they are not providing money for free. Estimates of the cost of capital not only often vary widely over time and across firms and industries,  but also vary widely at the same point in time by firms in the same industry depending on the type of project undertaken.

The cost of capital or discount rate for a project reflects two primary components. The first component reflects the time value of money as investors prefer near-term cash flows to latter-term cash flows. The risk-free rate reflects this time value of money. A commonly-used proxy of the risk-free rate is the

Expected return on short-term government securities in well-developed economies such as the United States. The second component of the discount rate reflects the riskiness of the project. A step is to calculate the risk premium that is necessary to compensate investors for the uncertain cash flows associated with the project.

Importantly,  investors do not derive the cost of capital or discount rate associated with a project in isolation; instead,  investors think in terms of opportunity cost and equilibrium. That is,  investors compare the risk of the project or firm with the risk of comparable investments. In economic terms,  the return which investors expected to receive on investments of similar risk is the opportunity cost associated with the project or firm under consideration. In equilibrium,  due to arbitrage,  investments of equal risk will have the same expected return.

This lecture note provides a broad overview of computing the cost of capital. The first part of the note goes through the methodological steps to calculate the cost of capital. The second part of the lecture note illustrates with a brief example of the cost of capital of Northrop Grumman. Lastly,  the Appendix provides the theoretical underpinnings to the cost of capital and also is a broad overview of some of the basic concepts you learned in Investments.

A caveat is in order. This lecture note assumes corporate managers behave rationally and adhere to theoretical models of asset pricing with respect to computing cost of capital estimates. In reality,  irrespective of rational behavior,  most corporate managers don’t necessarily adhere to models well grounded in academic theory. This is not to suggest that academia has not led to huge breakthroughs in the practice of finance as it has on many fronts. And even if many corporate managers completely disregard practices well grounded in finance theory and empirical evidence,  it is still useful to understand how asset pricing models can instruct us as to the best estimate of the discount rate for project valuation.

# MARKET RISK PREMIUM

As this lecture note will describe,  there are several steps in computing the cost of capital for a project. A good starting point is to assume the project has the same risk as that of the overall stock market. While the typical project will have a risk profile entirely different from that of the overall stock market,  it is useful to consider how corporate management discounts a project with risk identical to the aggregate stock market. The required return for this hypothetical project is the expected return that the firm could make if investing in the stock market rather than in the project itself. That is,  the shareholders of the firm can invest directly in the overall stock market,  and thus this is the opportunity cost or required return for the firm considering a real investment with identical risk to the stock market.

Discount Rate $=$ Risk-Free Rate $^+$ Market Risk Premium

Assume the project has an expected life of thirty years. Currently,  thirty-year U.S. Treasury bonds are yielding $3.7\%,  $ and thus the discount rate should exceed at least the thirty-year Treasury yield. Investors will not hold stocks with an expected return of only $3.7\%$ over the next thirty years if they expect to

receive a return of $3.7\%$ by investing in U.S. Treasury bonds. Thus,  the market risk premium is in addition to the current risk-free rate corresponding to the expected life of the project. The true risk premium for the stock market is unobservable and thus must be estimated:

Market Risk Premium $=$ E (R ) - R MARKET FREE

A universally accepted estimate for the market risk premium does not exist. Estimates range all over the board whether in academic articles,  corporate finance textbooks,  investment textbooks,  spreadsheet models prepared by investment bankers,  finance departments in corporations,  litigation consultants,  judges,  and many more. A commonly-used approach is to look at the ex-post realization,  that is,  a look back at how the stock market has performed relative to risk-free securities. The question though is how far back to examine the historical record. Simply using last year’s stock market return relative to the riskfree rate does not suffice,  else,  if last year’s market return were less than the risk-free rate,  this would imply that the market risk premium for the current year is negative which is illogical. Likewise,  using a few years of data is not sufficient as it gives a very imprecise estimate of the premium. Thus,  academics and practitioners generally propose a long historical record to obtain a reasonable estimate of the risk premium,  but there is considerable disagreement about the length of the estimation period.

Table 1 displays the average annual rate of return and standard deviation for U.S. Treasury bills,  Treasury bonds,  and stocks over the period 1900-2014.

Table 1 Average Annual Rate of Return and Standard Deviation (1900-2014)

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/394a4e909ece70e416d429f09163af372a74e591b59d18525f8777f2ee8c8c21.jpg)

As shown,  U.S. Treasury bills have generated an average annual rate of return of $3.8\%$ ,  whereas Treasury bonds have returned a higher $5.4\%$ . Stocks have returned $11.5\%$ annually,  thus an excess return of $7.7\%$ relative to Treasury bills and an excess return of $6.1\%$ to Treasury bonds. Assuming investor expectations turn out to be correct ex-post,  then we can use the realized historical excess return as the proxy for the ex-ante risk premium going forward. In this context,  if we assume a long-term project has the same risk as the stock market,  the project’s cost of capital is:

9.8% = 3.7% + 6.1%

That is,  the discount rate for the project is not the average historical return of $11.5\%$ for the stock market,  rather it is the current Treasury bond yield of $3.7\%$ plus the proxy for the forward-looking risk premium as measured by the historical excess return,  $6.1\%,  $ of stocks relative to bonds.

Is $6.1\%$ a good proxy of the market risk premium relative to bonds? Conceptually,  if risk aversion doesn’t change through time,  we should expect to see that the ex-post return realization is equal to the prior exante required return,  assuming we have a lengthy time series. We recognize that it is unproductive to use a short period by which to generate a proxy for the risk premium as there are often lengthy periods for which stocks under perform bonds. But it is also possible that risk aversion has changed over time and that today investors perhaps are less risk-averse than a century ago when the U.S. stock market was developing.

Influential theoretical work suggests the realized excess return is too large relative to that expected from economic models. If the risk premium were $6.1\%$ during the past century,  this premium implies an extremely high level of risk aversion by investors,  at least based on theoretical models. People invest to consume more,  as opposed to investing for the sake of it. However,  consumption has a low elasticity relative to the stock market. That is,  when the stock market declines substantially,  a contemporaneous decline in consumption does not occur which would be the case if investors were extremely risk averse. The stability of consumption through time,  at least relative to the excess return to stocks,  is consistent with the notion that the realized excess return is an upward biased estimate of the risk premium.

While there is valid logic in using ex-post realization s to construct ex-ante risk premia,  the logic assumes the draws from the distributions have been as expected. But if the economy has realized far more positive draws than expected (e.g.,  survived multiple wars,  benefitted from unexpected considerable increases in technology,  low level of natural disasters relative to expectations,  etc),  then the realized returns are biased positively. Had the U.S. instead been subject to a high preponderance of negative draws,  then stockholders may have been wiped out as the case in other countries. Moreover,  the U.S. stock market is in the top half of performance by country over long periods. Thus,  the realized excess return is likely biased high. It is also the case empirically that the excess return is lower in the last fifty years relative to earlier periods.

Corporate finance textbooks tend to suggest a range of $5\%$ to $6\%$ for the risk premium of stocks to longterm Treasury bonds. I assume a haircut of $0.50\%$ to the historical excess return of $6.1\%,  $ ,  thus an equity risk premium of $5.6\%$ of stocks relative to Treasury bonds. This assumed risk premium of $5.6\%$ is right around the midpoint of what is used in practice today. The haircut serve as an adjustment for the survivor ship bias and for the likely reduction in risk aversion in the last 50 years versus the prior decades.

Consider that the P/E Ratio today based on 2023 expected earnings for the S&P 500 is roughly 17.2,  and Treasury bonds are currently yielding $3.7\%$ . Thus,  we can crudely calibrate via the growing perpetuity model:

With Treasury bonds at $3.7\%,  $ the required return is $9.3\%$ $(3.7\%+5.6\%)$ ). Solving for $g$ yields $3.5\%$ . If we assume a discount rate of $9.3\%,  $ the model above implies the equity earnings of S&P 500 firms will grow $3.5\%$ annually in perpetuity which doesn’t seem unreasonable. Suppose instead that you assumed a much higher equity risk premium such as $8.0\%$ and thus a cost of capital of $11.7\%$ . This would imply high perpetual growth $(5.9\%)$ of equity earnings of existing companies which seems unlikely given [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] pressures. And if you assume a low market-risk premium such as $3.5\%$ and thus a cost of capital of $7.2\%$ this implies equity earnings growing at a $1.4\%$ rate,  which is less than that expected from inflation of $2.2\%$ as implied by the difference between Treasury bonds $(3.7\%)$ and Treasury inflation-protected bonds or TIPS $(1.5\%)$ .

We have no chance of knowing the true value of the market risk premium since it is unobservable,  but having a better understanding of what the market risk premium represents and the various complications arising in estimating it should not only improve our financial decisions,  but also our decisions to invest in real assets.

# THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF THE COST OF CAPITAL

The next step is to modify the estimate of the market risk premium to compute the cost of capital for an actual project or a firm. Generically,  the cost of capital is the required rate of return for an investment project of a given level of risk. Funds used for investment projects have an opportunity cost that depends on the riskiness of the particular investment. This section briefly discusses the theoretical foundations of the cost of capital which we will compute for firms and projects.

Investors are concerned with the tradeoff between risk and return of their portfolio. The measure of risk typically used in practice is the standard deviation. As we saw earlier,  the stock market is much more volatile than the treasury market. Investors thus demand and expect to receive a risk premium for holding common stocks relative to government securities.

While the overall stock market exhibits higher volatility than the treasury market,  individual stocks are even more volatile than the overall stock market. Portfolio diversification is the reason that the overall market is less volatile than the individual stocks in the stock market. While stocks generally tend to move together,  they do not always move by the same amount. Thus,  a portfolio of stocks will not exhibit movements as extreme as that of the individual stocks making up the portfolio. In finance terms,  there are two types of risks from holding individual stocks:

(1) systematic or non-divers if i able risk (2) Idiosyncratic or divers if i able risk.

Systematic risk cannot be diversified away and stems from the fact that specific economic phenomenon similarly affects all stocks. On the other hand,  an investor can eliminate idiosyncratic risk by holding a diversified portfolio. A diversified portfolio is merely a selection of stocks that are not perfectly correlated,  or that do not move in exact unison with one another. Thus,  while stocks such as Goldman Sachs,  Amazon,  Google,  Caterpillar,  and American Airlines all exhibit high volatility in isolation,  the risk associated with the portfolio of these stocks is lower than the risk of the individual stocks since they are in different lines of business and thus are not always affected similarly by economic shocks.

To build on this point,  since investors can easily diversify away idiosyncratic risk,  investors cannot expect to receive a higher expected return for holding an individual stock versus holding a portfolio of stocks,  keeping everything constant. However,  investors cannot diversify away systematic or market risk as any given stock or group of stocks will tend to vary positively with the overall stock market.

The issue for the individual stock,  is not how volatile it is in isolation,  but rather how much risk that stock contributes to the risk of the market portfolio? The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is the original theoretical model which addresses this question. According to the CAPM,  the risk contribution of an individual stock to the total portfolio risk is proportional to the covariance of the individual stock’s return with the return on the market portfolio. Beta is the CAPM term for this systematic risk of an individual stock. The beta of a stock captures the systematic relation between the movements of the stock and the movements of the overall market. If a firm has a beta of 1.0,  then that firm is said to covary directly with the stock market. Public utility firms tend to have low betas,  often less than 0.50. For a stock with a beta of 0.45,  when the stock market increases (decreases) by $1.0\%,  $ it will increase (decrease) by $0.45\%$ $(-0.45\%)$ on average. On the other end of the distribution,  high-end retailers,  such as Tiffany’s,  have high betas,  often over 1.5.

To summarize the above,  according to the CAPM,  the equity cost of capital for a given stock or security is equal to:

$$
\mathsf{E}(\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}})\!=\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\!+\!\mathsf{\beta}_{\mathsf{E}}\!\times\!\left[\mathsf{E}(\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}})\!-\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\right]
$$  

Thus,  high beta stocks have high required returns and hence high cost of equity capital,  and vice versa for low beta stocks. This,  of course,  does not mean that high volatility stocks,  such as gold mining stocks,  necessarily have high betas. While gold-mining stocks exhibit very high levels of volatility vis-à-vis the typical stock,  they have low betas. For example,  Newmont Mining has a beta of roughly 0.20 during the past ten years. That is to say that gold-mining stocks have high idiosyncratic risk,  but they do not move proportionately with the overall market. It is for this reason that many investors consider gold-mining stocks as an instrument to reduce the overall systematic risk of their portfolio. Despite their high volatility,  gold-mining projects have a low discount rate or hurdle rate when conducting project valuation which can be counter intuitive.

Before the final computation of the cost of capital for a company or a project,  it is necessary to adjust the equity betas to account for the capital structure of the firm or firms used to provide the equity beta estimates. The risk of common stocks,  as proxied by the beta,  reflects the business risk of the future cash flows and the assets held by the firm. To the extent that the firm issues debt to finance its investment opportunities,  shareholders bear financial risk as well. The more a firm relies on debt financing,  the riskier is its common stock. That is,  borrowing creates financial leverage,  and hence higher risk for the stockholders,  who have claims on the cash flows of the firm junior to the demands of debt holders.

The impact of the financial risk on shareholders via debt financing is a higher equity beta. Thus,  using the equity beta for a debt-financed firm will overstate the cost of capital estimate. Hence,  the equity beta should be unlevered. Stated differently,  the asset beta for the firm is a portfolio of the equity and debt betas as below: 6

$$
{\upbeta}_{\mathsf{A}}={\upbeta}_{\mathsf{D}}\times\left[\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}}\right]+{\upbeta}_{\mathsf{E}}\times\left[\frac{\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}}\right]
$$  

The underlying business risk is spread unevenly among the security holders. Most large corporations have debt that is of relatively low risk,  so that the bulk of the systematic risk falls on the stockholders. As long as the D/E ratio of the corporation is low,  we can assume that the debt does not have systematic risk,  that is,  the beta of the debt is close to zero. By assuming that the debt beta does not have systematic risk,  the asset beta formula collapses to:

$$
\upbeta_{\mathsf{A}}\,  {=}\,  \frac{\upbeta_{\mathsf{E}}}{\left[1{+}\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{E}}\right]}
$$  

This process is known as unlevering the equity beta to compute the asset beta. That is,  the relevant issue is calculating the systematic risk of the overall cash flows of the corporation,  not just the systematic risk of the cash flows going to the stockholders.

# THE UNLEVERED COST OF CAPITAL

The cost of capital for a firm is given by:

$$
\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}\right)\!=\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}+\mathsf{B}_{\mathsf{A}}\times\!\left[\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}}\right)\!-\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\right]
$$  

This equation is the familiar CAPM formula,  but here is employed to provide the expected return for the overall firm rather than merely for the equity of the firm as the asset or total firm beta is for the overall systematic risk of the firm. In computing the cost of capital for a particular project for a firm,  Eq. 7 will work for a project with the same risk as that for the overall firm. But projects within firms have systematic risk which can be materially different from the average systematic risk of the firm. Moreover,  there are many circumstances in which equity betas are not available for the firm undertaking the project. For situations such as those,  management should use the asset beta from publicly-traded firms with comparable risk to the project.

# ESTIMATING THE COST OF CAPITAL FOR NORTHROP GRUMMAN

This section provides a brief discussion of calculating the cost of capital for Northrop Grumman,  the global aerospace and defense technology firm. Note that the estimates are as of 2019. If you have access to Bloomberg,  you can easily re calculate and see if the cost of capital estimates has changed.

Suppose that in planning the 2019 budget,  the CFO of Northrop Grumman would like an estimate of Northrop’s cost of capital for its upcoming capital expenditures. Assume these capital expenditures are across the board in Northrop’s various businesses and are expected to be long-term in nature,  generating future cash flows which will stretch out several years. The way to think about this is that the systematic business risk associated with these capital expenditures is identical to the systematic business risk of Northrop Grumman as a whole company. In essence,  the exercise here is to estimate Equation 7 for Northrop Grumman.

Since the capital expenditures are expected to generate cash flows which will occur over several years,  it is more appropriate to use the long-term U.S. Treasury bond rate as opposed to the short-term U.S. Treasury bill rate. The U.S. Treasury bond rate was $2.9\%$ when the CFO of Northrop Grumman was planning the budget. Thus,  we assume the risk-free rate is $2.9\%$ to calculate Northrop Grumman’s cost of capital for its long-term projects. Importantly,  this means that the estimate we use for the market risk premium will reflect the expected return of stocks relative to U.S. Treasury bonds as opposed to U.S. Treasury bills. In practice,  CFOs tend to prefer to use the U.S. Treasury bond rate as the proxy for the riskfree rate for long-term projects. As indicated earlier in this lecture note,  we assume,  with a large standard error,  the market risk premium for stocks relative to U.S. Treasury bonds on a forward-looking basis is $5.6\%$ as of the current date.

Whereas the choice of the risk-free rate and the market risk premium does not rely on the identity of the underlying project or the company itself,  the asset beta does require an understanding of the risk,  specifically the systematic risk,  associated with the project and or the company. In the case of calculating the cost of capital for Northrop Grumman’s growth plans this year,  it will be the same as Northrop Grumman’s overall cost of capital since the proposed capital expenditure is intended to be across all of the business units at Northrop Grumman. Thus,  the starting point for estimating the asset beta is Northrop Grumman’s equity beta is displayed below from Bloomberg.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/bf25fc1d0ea32066848f1930e907c907ae80aff4f5d050f108a513e6a9244e69.jpg)

In the Bloomberg chart,  Northrop Grumman’s equity beta is 0.799. To replicate the output above,  the pertinent inputs are: (1) length of estimation period,  return interval frequency,  choice of market proxy,  mathematical model,  etc. The estimation period is five years using weekly return intervals,  hence the 260 observations. The S&P 500 Total Return (SPXT) index is the proxy for the overall stock market. Bloomberg uses linear regression analysis to estimate Northrop Grumman’s equity beta. With a bit of trial and error,  you should be able to match the above results identically. Importantly,  and not noted in the chart above,  your return calculation for Northrop Grumman (ticker symbol: NOC) should include dividends to capture the total weekly return for Northrop Grumman as opposed to just using returns based on Northrop

Grumman’s price alone. Also,  rather than computing the beta estimate for Northrop Grumman on Bloomberg,  you can easily download the price data (adjusted for dividends) for Northrop Grumman and the index data for the SPXT and calculate the beta via regression using Excel or other computer software,  and obtain the same point estimate.

The objective is to generate an estimate of Northrop Grumman’s forward-looking equity beta to capture its systematic equity risk. But since we do not know Northrop Grumman’s forward-looking equity beta,  we use historical estimates and economic logic. In terms of historical estimates of beta,  the backward-looking period should have systematic risk that is similar to the future; else the historical beta estimate will either be too high or too low and thus not reflective of the risk in valuing a new venture. Many factors can alter equity beta estimates through time,  such as changes in the capital structure due to a share repurchase for example or changes in the asset side of the business such as mergers and divest it ure s.

While this note uses weekly data over a five-year period for Northrop Grumman,  it could have also used daily or monthly data and also used periods of different lengths. Since Northrop Grumman’s overall business hasn’t changed substantially in the last few years and also since it is a liquid stock,  the choice of window length and return interval is not as important as it would be for small stocks or firms undergoing a lot of recent changes. For example,  with smaller stocks,  it is preferable to use weekly or monthly returns rather than daily returns due to the somewhat stale pricing of small stocks. Alternatively,  one can use daily returns and add lagged returns as well,  but then based on the number of lags added,  it may be more feasible to just weekly returns instead.

As indicated above,  linear regression analysis was used to compute the beta estimate for Northrop Grumman. But even absent the formal regression analysis,  a visual inspection of the data confirms a beta estimate of a little less than one. The top chart in black displays the weekly returns to Northrop Grumman on the horizontal axis and the weekly returns to the S&P 500 on the vertical axis. Absent the red regression line going through the data,  the returns seem to line up somewhat in a reasonably straight line with a slope of less than one,  and only a few abnormally large deviations. And in the white chart below,  the cumulative returns for Northrop Grumman tracks the cumulative returns of the S&P 500. A measure of the reliability of the 0.799 beta estimate for Northrop Grumman is the standard error of 0.079 which is small relative to the beta estimate. That is,  we can be confident that the true beta for Northrop Grumman,  at least during the historical five-year period,  is in the ballpark of 0.799. Of course,  however,  even absent a change in Northrop Grumman’s financial structure or overall business strategy,  its beta during the future could indeed differ from its historical beta,  aside from the reliability of the beta estimate over the historical five-year estimation window.

To the extent that Northrop Grumman has debt in its capital structure,  the financial leverage will increase the equity beta,  all else equal,  as discussed in the prior section. To estimate the asset beta,  one must unlever the equity beta and in effect,  free the company of financial leverage. Using financial data from

Bloomberg,  Northrop Grumman’s debt and equity values are displayed below over the five-year estimation period.

Table 2 Capital Structure at Northrop Grumman

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/81357ea675367e6635785f33eae2a642ff15d057575500b5b084cc03626ac957.jpg)

The average Debt/Equity ratio for Northrop Grumman over the most recent five years is $11\%$ . Assuming the debt of Northrop Grumman does not have systematic market risk,  we can use Equation 6 to unlever its equity beta. 11 Given Northrop Grumman’s [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratio]] is modest and also since it’s debt has an Investment Grade rating,  we assume zero systematic market risk for the debt.

$$
0.720\;=\;{\frac{0.799}{1.11}}
$$  

As a robustness check,  one can look at industry peers. In the case of Northrop Grumman,  Rockwell Collins and Harris Corporation are two close competitors. Table 3 displays the equity and asset betas for all three defense contractors. Notably,  Harris Corporation and Rockwell Collins have asset betas similar to the asset beta for Northrop Grumman,  at 0.70 and 0.74 relative to 0.72.

The final step is to estimate the cost of capital via Equation 7 for Northrop Grumman using all of the available inputs.

$$
6.93\%=2.90\%+0.72\times 5.6\%
$$  

Thus,  $6.93\%$ is the discount rate which Northrop Grumman would use for long-term projects with similar systematic risk to the overall risk of Northrop Grumman. It reflects the opportunity cost,  that is,  the expected return that an investor would expect to receive if investing in other companies or projects of similar risk. To restate,  the discount rate estimate for Northrop Grumman reflects the time value of money,  an overall market risk premium,  and the sensitivity (beta) of the systematic project risk relative to the overall stock market.

# Appendix: Theoretical Foundations of the Cost of Capital

# PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION

Investors are concerned with the tradeoff between the risk or variability of the returns on their portfolio and the average or expected return. The expected return on a portfolio of securities,  stocks,  for instance,  is the weighted average of the individual expected returns on the individual securities,  where the weights are the proportion of the portfolio value accounted for by each security.

$$
\mathsf{E x p e c t e d\,   R e t u r n}=\mathsf E\bigl (\mathsf{R_{P}}\bigr)=\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathsf{n}}\mathsf{w_{i}}\times\mathsf E\bigl (\mathsf{R_{i}}\bigr)
$$  

Holding everything constant,  investors prefer to maximize the expected return. Investors also wish to maximize the reliability of the expected return or put differently,  to minimize the riskiness associated with the distribution,  holding everything constant. In finance,  we commonly use the variance or the standard deviation of the returns distribution as a measure of risk.

$$
\mathsf{r i a r i a n c e\ R e p}=\sigma^{2}{=}\ E[\mathsf{R p}-E (\mathsf{R p})]^{2}
$$  

And considering a portfolio consists of a group of individual securities,  the portfolio variance reflects the variance of each of the individual security returns,  as well as the pairwise co variances of each of the individual security returns:

$$
\mathsf{V a r i a n c e\,   R_{p}=\ o_{p}^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_{i}^{2}O_{i}^{2}+\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{i=j+1}^{n-1}W_{i}\times\; W_{j}\times\; O_{i j}}
$$  

Note that as the number of securities in the portfolio increases,  the first term in the variance equation above goes to zero as n gets very large and the portfolio variance approaches the average covariance. That is,  there are two types of risk from holding risky securities as discussed earlier,  systematic or nondivers if i able risk and idiosyncratic or divers if i able risk. Systematic risk cannot be diversified away and arises from the fact that aggregate economic phenomenon similarly hit all stocks. On the other hand,  a well-diversifed portfolio largely purges the idiosyncratic risk. A diversified portfolio is simply a selection of securities that are not perfectly correlated,  or that do not move in perfect unison with one another.

# PORTFOLIO THEORY

Using the assumption that investors are only concerned about the tradeoff between risk and expected return,  portfolio theory can be used to define optimal portfolios. The first step is to identify the investment opportunity set of risky assets. The opportunity set is the set of all available investment portfolios consisting entirely of risky assets. Markowitz developed the mathematics for optimally combining the securities in the investment opportunity set into efficient mean-variance portfolios,  and

Thus identifies the efficient frontier. The term efficient refers to the concept of maximizing the expected return for a given level of standard deviation,  or minimizing the standard deviation for a given level of expected return. For any group of stocks or securities,  one can create efficient portfolios via quadradic programming to solve for the minimum variance given any expected return. Figure A 1 displays the meanstandard deviation frontier for a set of securities.

Portfolio Standard Deviation

The efficient frontier is represented by the upper line sloping region of the line as it provides the maximum expected return for a given standard deviation. The points on the line dominate all of the points below the line,  as well as the portion of the line in the lower region. Given that investors can choose from thousands of securities,  this optimization will yield a superior,  efficient frontier versus one obtained by merely considering a small sample of securities. In effect,  theoretically,  all investors will thus hold the same market portfolio. However,  these investors will have different tolerances for risk. Some will want to own a portfolio which is less risky than the market portfolio whereas others will want to own a portfolio which has a higher risk than the market portfolio. The way to achieve this is to introduce the riskfree rate to the efficient frontier as shown in Figure A 2.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e685c88bf32adb23878e440404a72fab4a63370b835b59be2cc6ea52133c19c5.jpg)

Portfolio Standard Deviation

By adding the risk-free rate,  this addition improves the efficient frontier which is now the line connecting the risk-free security and the tangency portfolio of risky assets. This line,  referred to as the Capital Market Line,  represents all combinations of the risk-free asset and the tangency portfolio. The tangency portfolio is of particular interest because along with the risk-free security,  it defines the most attractive investment opportunity set. Highly risk-averse investors can invest in both the risk-free security and the tangency portfolio by investing on the line to the left of the tangency portfolio. Less risk-averse investors can borrow at the risk-free rate and lever up the tangency portfolio,  thus holding a position on the Capital Market Line to the upper right of the tangency portfolio.

The slope of the Capital Market Line from the risk-free security to the tangency point of the efficient frontier is known as the Sharpe Ratio:

$$
\mathsf{S h a r p e\,   R a t i o=\frac{E\!\left[R_{p}\right]\!-\! R_{f}}{\sigma_{p}}}
$$  

The Sharpe Ratio offers the highest risk premium per unit of risk,  and the tangent portfolio maximizes the Sharpe Ratio. As noted earlier,  the tangent portfolio is efficient as it lies on the efficient frontier,  and when matched up with the risk-free security,  it provides all combinations of the risk-free security and the tangency portfolio which are also efficient. Thus,  as stated above,  all investors will hold the market portfolio as it maximizes the Sharpe ratio,  and based on their degree of risk aversion,  will move up and down the line. Conservative risk-averse investors will hold a combination of the risk-free security and the market portfolio whereas less conservative investors may not only avoid allocating any of their portfolio to the risk-free security,  instead may even borrow and lever up the market portfolio.

Whereas Markowitz laid the foundation for asset pricing in his classic 1952 article entitled “Portfolio Selection,  ” Bill Sharpe made an enormous contribution in 1964 with his extension of Markowitz’s work by incorporating economics and building a model of market equilibrium which prices securities. Sharpe made several simplifying assumptions in his model,  later coined the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): 15

(a) all investors are price takers,  that is,  there is perfect information in the market for securities (b) it is a one-period model (c) all investors are rational mean-variance optimizers in the spirit of Markowitz (d) all investors have common information and beliefs (they all use the same expected returns and co variances when estimating the mean-variance frontier) (e) all securities are public,  and investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate (f) there are no transactions costs or taxes.

Sharpe’s model of market equilibrium shows that all investors end up holding the identical portfolio which happens to be the market portfolio. That is,  given investors have the same information set and access to the same universe of securities,  they will end up with the same efficient frontiers and likewise the same risky portfolio as shown in Figure A 3.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c0933d08557578c793b2e1ac702ca2ac107c891369412ba6c41a722c64c0af9e.jpg)

Portfolio Standard Deviation

The CAPM essentially imposes market equilibrium under some specific assumptions and identifies the tangency portfolio from the portfolio problem as the market portfolio. Each security has a weight in the market portfolio which is proportional to its market value relative to the market value of the aggregate universe of securities. In equilibrium,  individual securities are priced based on individual risk premia which are determined by their contribution to total portfolio risk. The contribution of an individual security,  $\boldsymbol{\dot{I}}_{\!\prime}$ to the total variance of the market portfolio is proportional to the covariance of the individual’s stock return with the return on the market portfolio:

$$
\mathsf{w}_{\mathrm{i}}\times\mathsf{C o v}\big[\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{i}}\mathsf{,   R}_{\mathsf{m}}\big]
$$  

The market price of risk is the expected risk premium of the market divided by the variance of the market:

$$
\frac{\mathsf{E}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]\!-\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{f}}}{\mathsf{V a r}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]}\!=\!\frac{\mathsf{E}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]\!-\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{f}}}{\mathsf{C o v}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}},  \mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]}
$$  

In equilibrium,  if security i has the same risk as the market,  that is,  covaries perfectly with the market portfolio,  then it must have the same price of risk:

$$
\frac{\mathsf{E}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{i}}\right]\!-\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}}}{\mathsf{C o v}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{i}},  \mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]}\!=\!\frac{\mathsf{E}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]\!-\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}}}{\mathsf{C o v}\left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}},  \mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{m}}\right]}
$$  

Denoting the ratio of $\mathsf{C o v}(\mathsf{r}_{\mathrm{i},  \,  }\mathsf{r}_{\mathsf{m}})/\,  \mathsf{V a r}(\mathsf{r}_{\mathsf{m}})$ as $\mathsf{\beta}_{\mathsf{i},  \mathsf{\prime}}$ Eq. A 7 can be rearranged as:

$$
\mathsf{E}\bigl[\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{i}}\bigr]\!=\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}}+\mathsf{\beta}_{\mathrm{i}}\times\!\left[\mathsf{E}\bigl (\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{m}}\bigr)\!-\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{f}}\right]
$$  

Eq. A 8 is the infamous CAPM equation. It states that the beta of a security is the right measure of risk since it is proportional to the risk that the security contributes to the market portfolio. And the risk premium of a security is the product of the security’s beta and the market risk premium,  that is,  $\upbeta_{\mathrm{i}}\bullet[\mathsf{\Delta}E (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}})-$ R f ]. Thus,  the expected return to a security varies in direct proportion to its beta. The security market line (SML) portrays this relation graphically below.

# Additional Considerations in Estimating the Cost of Capital

# Recapping the Cost of Capital

How should corporate management think about the cost of capital for a project or venture under consideration? How important is it to managerial decision making? How reliable is the cost of capital estimate? What impact has academia had on corporate management in calculating the cost of capital?

The key consideration is the opportunity set of the corporation’s investors. If the investors can invest in projects or companies with comparable risk to that of the project under consideration,  their expected return on these equivalent-risk projects is the correct discount rate that managers should employ. In a micro-economics framework,  opportunity cost matters. But then how do managers determine what an equivalent-risk twin project is? And once management identifies the equivalent-risk twin project,  how do they go about figuring out what the expected return is for the twin project?

Before the 1970 s,  corporations tended to employ an accounting rate of return measure or a simple payback period technique to guide them in project valuation. But as modern finance theory evolved,  beginning in academia,  particularly with the development of the CAPM and the subsequent influential work by Hamada on unlevering equity betas which bridged the gap between investments and corporate finance,  large corporations began to embrace the use of NPV (and also IRR) in evaluating projects.

Based on the CAPM and the application of unlevering betas,  the cost of capital for a project (or firm) is given by:

$$
\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}\right)=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}+\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{A}}\!\left[\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}}\right)\cdot\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\right]
$$  

Note that I have used $"\mathsf{A}"$ in the subscript to signify asset. Alternatively,  I could have used $"{\sf P}"$ instead to signify project,  but $"{\sf P}"$ is typically used to signify portfolio. Also,  I prefer $"\mathsf{A}"$ as the refer ence to asset since our focus is on valuing projects on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. That is,  for project valuation,  we are not interested in the equity risk,  per se; instead,  we estimate the equity risk due to it being available and unlever the equity beta to obtain the asset risk,  that is,  the asset beta.

In some cases,  the project is simply an extension of the firm itself. Suppose Planet Fitness,  a large operator of physical fitness centers decides to increase its number of locations from 2,  045 to 2,  500. In this instance,  management of Planet Fitness can use its own asset beta,  as well as asset betas of other pure-play fitness companies,  in the discount rate computation.

In many cases,  the project under consideration does not have systematic risk equal that of the overall corporation. For example,  if Walmart decides to acquire Humana,  the correct discount rate is the cost of capital of managed health-care companies rather than of discount retailers. Likewise,  consider a private equity firm such as Bain Capital which invests in a broad spectrum of firms across many industries. Even though Bain Capital is private and most of its portfolio companies are private,  management can still rely on stock returns data from equivalent-risk publicly traded firms to provide estimates for cost of capital calculations for the companies in Bain’s portfolio .

In practice,  we use stock returns to calculate equity betas and then unlever the equity betas to obtain asset betas. If it were the case that debt securities were liquid and frequently traded,  we would not solely calculate equity betas,  instead would estimate both debt and equity betas,  and then take a weighted average of the debt and equity betas. Instead,  we make a simplifying assumption about debt betas,  often assuming they are zero or a low estimate such as 0.10 or 0.20. An exception would be a corporation in or near financial distress as their debt betas will be far higher,  even approaches 1.0 or greater.

There are three primary components of the cost of capital estimate via the CAPM,  only one of which we have a high degree of certainty about on an $e x.$ ante basis,  namely the risk-free rate. But considerable uncertainty exists about the market risk premium. For example,  the standard deviation associated with the historical excess return to the stock market is roughly $20\%$ . And equity beta estimates are subject to estimation error as the distribution of stock returns can be highly skewed by various events over the estimation period and thus can generate a misleading estimate of the true beta. Plus,  there is the matter of input estimation error from our picking the comparable firms and periods for which to compute the beta estimates. Thus,  estimates of cost of capital are extremely noisy,  but that is also true for estimating expected future cash flows. Nonetheless,  deriving such estimates are critical to improving managerial decisions,  and even if the estimates are quite volatile,  then even that information can be useful into whether we choose to move forward with a project. For example,  we will be more likely to move forward on a project with $+\mathsf{N P V}$ if we have more reliability in the cost of capital estimate.

A few additional considerations are in order with computing the cost of capital. First,  how should we think about the risk-free rate for long-term projects versus short-term projects? Second,  what about the weighted-average-cost of capital (WACC) and its use in practice? Third,  is the CAPM the right model by which to calculate the cost of capital? Should we consider a multi-factor asset pricing model instead? We discuss these considerations below.

# Risk-Free Rate for Long-Term Projects

As discussed in the Cost of Capital lecture note,  the CAPM is a one-period model,  and the risk-free rate is assumed to be a short-term Treasury security in a well-developed economy. But most corporate projects are long-term in nature. As a matter of practice,  investment bankers,  private equity analysts,  CFOs,  etc.,  use the long-term Treasury rate as the measure of the risk-free rate. And rather than calculating a market risk premium of stocks relative to Treasury bills,  they calculate a market risk premium of stocks relative to Treasury bonds,  as we did in the Northrop Grumman example in the Cost of Capital lecture note.

In the cost of capital formula,  we can use the short-term Treasury bill as the risk-free security,  even for long-term projects,  which allows us to use the market risk premium of stocks relative to Treasury bills. But this approach requires us to also forecast the expected treasury-bill return over the life of the long-term project. There are economic arguments that investors should be compensated for holding long-term Treasury bonds versus Treasury bills,  for example,  due to the higher volatility and the inflation risk associated with Treasury bonds. Treasury bonds have outperformed Treasury bills by $1.6\%$ annually and are three times more volatile,  thus consistent with the economic argument that investors require a risk premium for holding Treasury bonds rather than Treasury bills.

Thus,  if one uses the Treasury bill as the risk-free measure in a long-term project,  you need to estimate the expected Treasury bill return over the life of the project:

Expected Treasury Bill Return $=$ Treasury Bond Return – Treasury Bond Risk Premium

For example,  the current U.S. Treasury Bond yield is $3.7\%$ . Assuming the historical $1.6\%$ difference in returns between Treasury bonds and Treasury bills is our best estimate of the Treasury bond risk premium going forward,  Equation 2 yields an expected Treasury bill return of $2.1\%$ over the next 30 years. Given the future-risk free rate is now estimated,  Equation 1 should be modified by adding the expected operator in front of the risk-free rate as shown below in Equation 3:

$$
\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{A}}\right)=\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{F}}\right)+\mathsf{b}_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{A}}\!\left[\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{m}}\right)\cdot\mathsf{E}\!\left (\mathsf{R}_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{F}}\right)\right]
$$  

While Equation 3 is more theoretically correct per the CAPM,  it also adds measurement error to the cost of capital estimate. That is,  we now also have to estimate a bond risk premium which may or may not be equal to the historical return difference between bonds and bills. Just as we indicated that survivor ship bias can partly explain the large excess historical returns of stocks over bills,  the same is true of bonds over bills. In addition to adding measurement error,  I have rarely seen this version of the cost of capital used in practice,  and I would consider it to be more of an academic exercise,  but still useful to at least understand. In the end,  the cost of capital calculation yields roughly the same answer if using the short rate versus the long rate. The most important part is that the duration of the risk-free security should be the same for both places in Equations 1 and 3.

# Weighted-Average Cost of Capital

The weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) computes the cost of capital for the overall corporation as a weighted average of the debt cost of capital and the equity cost of capital:

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{A}}=\mathsf{W A C C}=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\left (1\cdot\mathsf{T}_{\mathrm{C}}\right)\left[\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{\left (D+E\right)}}\right]+\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\left[\frac{\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{\left (D+E\right)}}\right]
$$  

Notably,  the WACC formula accounts for the after-tax cost of debt,  namely because interest is a taxdeductible expense. It represents the concept that when one considers the cost of capital for a corporation,  the focus is on the overall business risk,  not just the risk of debt or of equity.

Many practitioners use the WACC as the cost of capital for projects of all types. However,  the WACC works correctly only under certain circumstances. For example,  the WACC assumes the project will have the same risk as that of the overall corporation which is often not the case. Also,  the WACC assumes the project will not alter the capital structure of the corporation,  and moreover,  the capital structure will not change for other reasons,  instead it assumes the same capital structure going forward. These assumptions are restrictive and not necessary.

In the U.S.,  debt financing creates shareholder value since interest,  while a return of capital to debt holders,  is treated as an expense by the tax authorities. WACC reflects the after-tax cost of debt to account for the value creation resulting from the interest tax shields. And when using the WACC as the discount rate for a project under consideration by the firm,  the resulting NPV reflects the tax benefits of debt financing. Importantly,  the NPV can be positive solely due to the use of the lower discount rate,  via the WACC,  as opposed to a discount rate which doesn’t incorporate the interest tax shields. In The Tradeoff Theory of Capital Structure lecture note,  we introduce the concept of APV,  short for Adjusted Net Present Value,  where we separately calculate the NPV of any financing benefits (or costs) such as interest tax shields from that of the NPV associated with the project as if equity financed and without any market imperfections.

# Failure of the CAPM

The CAPM is a significant contribution to modern finance theory and has not merely had an enormous impact in academia but also a huge influence in practice. The power of the CAPM in practice is not just for security or portfolio performance but also for applications in corporate finance,  such as estimating the cost of capital for a project or a corporation.

CAPM investors each demand the same efficient portfolio of risky assets,  given the assumptions. And if investors all choose to hold the same efficient portfolio optimally,  then due to the adding-up principle,  the market portfolio of all assets is the efficient portfolio according to the CAPM. Thus,  based on their risk preferences,  investors will hold some combination of the market portfolio and the risk-free security on the capital market line. That is,  some investors will keep a high proportion of their wealth in the risk-free security and a low proportion in the market portfolio of risky assets. Other investors may choose to have no exposure to the risk-free security and simply hold the market portfolio. And some investors may even decide to lever up the market portfolio by borrowing at the risk-free rate. But all investors,  irrespective of their risk preferences,  will hold some combination of the market portfolio and the risk-free security.

We can then use the CAPM to determine the expected return of any security or any portfolio of securities. The expected return on any given security,  given the CAPM,  is:

$$
\mathsf{E}\bigl (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{s}}\bigr)=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}+\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{s}}\bigl[\mathsf{E}\bigl (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}}\bigr)\cdot\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\bigr]
$$  

The notation above is for any security as the CAPM was not only developed for equities,  but rather for all securities. Since investors can diversify away all idiosyncratic risk,  they are left with systematic market risk,  or beta,  and given the formula,  there is a linear relation between the beta of a security and the expected return on the security. In the context of the cost of capital for a particular project where our interest lies,  the higher the beta,  then the higher the expected return,  thus the higher the cost of capital for the project. For example,  suppose Alphabet’s expected annual return over the next several years is $10.7\%$ based on the CAPM. Likewise,  the expected return on other firms with the same beta as Alphabet also have an expected return of $10.7\%$ . Thus,  if management of Alphabet is considering a project with the same risk as the overall firm,  say,  a CAPX expansion across the board to grow the company,  the hurdle rate for the project is the expected return of $10.7\%$ . Projects which have an $\mathsf{I R R}>(<)$ than $10.7\%$ create (destroy) shareholder wealth.

Is the CAPM a suitable model by which we can reliably estimate the cost of capital for projects in our corporate finance setting? For example,  we know that the assumptions don’t fully explain investors’ behavior. While in aggregate,  investors hold the market portfolio,  there are widespread deviations across investors. Look at Elon Musk for example who has a net worth of roughly $\S\,   140$ billion as of early 2023,  most of which is in Tesla stock. And at the other end of the extreme,  many small retail investors tend to hold their favorite stock picks rather than the diversified market portfolio. Likewise,  there is widespread empirical evidence that many investors,  particularly retail investors,  don’t always behave rationally. Nonetheless,  it is difficult to profit on the other side of these trades,  especially after accounting for trading costs and management fees.

Empirical tests of the CAPM have generally formed portfolios of stocks based on betas calculated from a prior period. According to the CAPM,  these portfolios,  ranked on beta,  should line up on the security market line. In a 2004 review paper,  Fama and French update this basic relation and is reproduced here as Figure 1. Consistent with prior empirical evidence,  the relationship between beta and average returns for ten portfolios sorted on beta have a lower slope than implied by the CAPM. That is,  as illustrated in Figure 1,  the returns are higher than predicted for the low-beta portfolios and are smaller than predicted for the high-beta portfolio. Note that the relation is still linear and positive,  just with a lower slope than predicted by the CAPM.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b79a0cb097aee32e516df397c649d67cbf424bed7d19c918389a2790591b7ffa.jpg)

G iven the CAPM doesn’t appear to explain stock returns fully,  the implication is that other factors,  in addition to the market return,  may also have reliable explanatory power. Since the development of the CAPM,  empirical researchers have shown that specific portfolios of stocks have higher beta-adjusted returns than the market portfolio. For example,  while small stocks have higher betas than large stocks,  their realized returns are statistically higher,  even after adjusting for their higher betas. This phenomenon is the well-known size effect. Another example is value stocks represented by firms with high book-tomarket ratios. Value stocks tend to have positive excess returns after accounting for their beta loading on the overall portfolio. Likewise,  stocks which have performed well tend to continue to perform well,  a

Phenomenon referred to as momentum. Overall,  these results,  and similar results,  are not consistent with the CAPM,  namely that the market portfolio is the efficient portfolio.

The evidence that certain “style” portfolios of stocks do better or worse than the CAPM implies is consistent with the concept of a multi-factor asset pricing model rather than the CAPM,  which has only the market as a factor. The original theory behind the idea of a multi-factor asset pricing is the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) developed by Stephen Ross. According to the APT,  the return of a security is a function of numerous factors as opposed to the single factor,  namely the market portfolio,  in the CAPM. Think of the CAPM as a restrictive case of the APT.

The most influential empirical multi-factor asset pricing model is the Fama and French three-factor asset pricing model developed in 1993. Based on prior empirical research during the 1980 s which documented that small stocks and high book-to-market stocks realized positive beta-adjusted returns. Fama and French created a three-factor model which include a size factor and a book-to-market factor in addition to the overall market factor. The Fama-French model is:

$$
\mathsf{E}\bigl (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\bigr)=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}+\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{E}}\Bigl[\mathsf{E}\bigl (\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}}\bigr)-\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}\Bigr]+\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{S M B}}\mathsf{S M B}+\mathsf{b}_{\mathsf{H M L}}\mathsf{H M L}
$$  

As noted above,  Fama and French retain the market as one of the model’s three factors. It is shown here as the expected market return minus the risk-free rate. The second factor in the equation is the size factor and is the return on small stocks minus the return on large stocks. The third factor is the value factor and is the return on high book-to-market stocks minus the return on low book-to-market stocks. Fama and French find that the three-factor model as described above does a better job at explaining the performance of stock returns than the single-factor CAPM where only the market beta matters.

Just as the market factor has a risk premium as discussed in the Cost of Capital lecture note,  the other two Fama and French factors have risk premiums as well,  at least as proposed by Fama and French. For example,  the higher return to small stocks reflects the fact that small stocks have higher risks than large stocks. Arguably,  small stocks are more sensitive to changes in business conditions,  and while they may have higher market betas to reflect this,  they still bear an additional risk premium. And Fama and French note that high book-to-market stocks may be more susceptible to financial default risk which is not fully captured by the beta on the market risk premium. If one merely observes that small stocks or value stocks perform well in a CAPM world,  that is,  generating positive alphas,  this finding suggests market inefficiencies given the model. The Fama and French response is that the single market factor in the CAPM is not sufficient to fully explain returns,  and thus other risk factors must be included as well such as the size and value factors.

Below,  we apply the Fama and French three-factor model to illustrate how a multi-factor model can be implemented to compute the cost of capital for a project. But note that numerous multi-factor models have emerged in the past few years,  though the Fama-French model remains at the forefront. For our

Purposes,  we can apply the following exercise with any respected multi-factor model due to not taking a stand per se on one model versus another.

Consider McDonald’s Corporation,  the global leader in fast food franchises. We will compute the shortterm cost of equity capital for McDonald’s using both CAPM and Fama -French. Monthly returns for a recent five-year period (October 2013-September 2018) will be employed to compute regression estimates. The returns for McDonald ’s are from Bloomberg,  and the returns for the market and the two additional Fama-French factors are available from Ken French’s website at Dartmouth University. The market return is a value-weighted return of all NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ firms,  and is net of the U.S. Treasury bill return. Likewise,  the return for McDonald’s stock is also computed net of the U.S. Treasury bill return for the regression. SMB (Small minus Big) is the return of small-stock portfolios minus the return of largestock portfolios to capture the size effect. HML (High minus Low) is the return of value-stock portfolios minus the return of growth-stock portfolios to capture the book-to-market effect.

Table 1 displays the CAPM regression. The beta estimate is 0.594 and is well below 1.0,  likely due to being somewhat recession resilient as opposed to more expensive dining establishments such as Le Bernadin or Noma. Note that despite McDonald ’s is a large multinational corporation,  the explanatory power of the overall stock market can only account for 17 percent of the variation in McDonald’s stock price returns. That is,  most of the variation in the returns to McDonald’s stock is driven by idiosyn cratic risk as opposed to systematic risk.

While this course is not about statistics,  it is helpful to understand the basic statistics from the regression output as they can influence our managerial decision making. The only number included from the above regression statistics which ends up in in the cost of capital calculation is the beta coefficient of 0.594. The other numbers are often disregarded but can be relevant. The standard error,  0.164,  is the estimate of the variability associated with the 0.594 beta coefficient. The t-statistic measures how significant the beta coefficient of 0.594 is from zero. Given the t-statisitic is 3.63,  the coefficient is stat is ic ally different from zero. And the p-value provides the probability levels associated with this beta coefficient and its difference from zero. But we care more about the confidence intervals associated with the beta coefficient. The confidence intervals of 0.266 and 0.922 indicate that we can be 95 percent certain that the intervals of 0.266 and 0.922 contain the true mean. Thus,  the range of be live ability is quite large. The Cost of Capital lecture note cautions us as to the reliability of the market risk premium as it is just an estimate. The same is true of these beta coefficients as they are only estimates with significant measurement error.

The next step is to evaluate McDonald’s returns with the three-factor Fama-French model via regression analysis for the same five-year time period (October 2013 – September 2018). Table 2 displays the regression output.

As displayed by the R-Square of 0.233,  the Fama French regression has higher explanatory power than the CAPM regression with an R-Square of 0.171. Even so,  the three-factor model can explain less than onefourth of the variation in the returns to McDonald ’s . The market beta increased from 0.594 to 0.658,  suggesting that McDonald’s stock has a higher relation to the overall stock market with the inclusion of other factors. The coefficient on SMB is -0.469 and thus a negative loading on the small-minus-big factor. This factor loading is not too surprising given that McDonald’s has a market capitalization of nearly $\S\,   140$ billion,  and therefore not only is a large capitalization stock but also behaves as such. The coefficient on HML is 0.067 and indicates that McDonald’s stock returns load positively on the value premium. But note that the standard error of 0.190 is large relative to the 0.067 estimate and thus the confidence interval is also large on a comparable base. Given McDonald’s P/E ratio of roughly 2 3,  it is indeed not a deep value stock with a low multiple and likewise not a super-high-growth stock. Consequently,  the 0.067 seems within the expected ballpark as the factor loading is not high in absolute value.

Recall that when we computed the risk premium for a project with the CAPM framework,  we multiplied the market beta associated with the project by the market risk premium which we assume for our purposes is $6.5\%$ for short-term projects. To simplify,  we will focus only on the equity cost of capital here and thus not delever the firm’s equity beta to obtain the asset beta. Using the CAPM framework,  the equity cost of capital for McDonald’s is:

That is,  given the CAPM beta coefficient of 0.594 and the market risk premium of $6.5\%,  $ ,  the expected cost of equity capital for McDonald’s is $6.26\%$ . Thus,  investors expect to receive a return of $6.26\%$ based on holding McDonald’s stock if they subscribe to the CAPM. The same methodology applies to estimates of McDonald’s equity cost of capital in the Fama-French model. The regression output supplies the beta coefficients or factor loadings,  and we already have the market risk premium of $6.5\%$ . Thus,  the two missing inputs are the risk premiums on SMB and HML,  respectively.

As discussed in the Cost of Capital lecture note ,  we don’t know the true market risk premium. Instead,  we look to historical evidence of realized excess returns and calibrate relative to theoretical models with economic arguments. We also can consider current valuations and attempt to back out the market risk premium,  but this also requires having the right estimate of the expected future growth rate which is an arduous task at best. In the end,  our estimate is subject to substantial measurement error. Notwithstanding the issues with estimating the market risk premium,  one can use economic arguments beginning with the case that stocks should outperform risk-free securities. And various theoretical models suggest how large this risk premium should be. But with risk factors such as SMB and HML,  there are no widely accepted economic arguments and theoretical models which indicate,  for example,  by what magnitude that small stocks should outperform large stocks. Thus,  to implement the model to estimate the equity cost of capital,  we rely on the historical record.

The Fama-French factors are available on Ken French’s website at Dartmouth. Below,  I use the recent fifty years of data as the data in the first half of the $20^{\mathrm{th}}$ century is spotty and has numerous missing records. Table 3 displays the annual returns for each of the three Fama-French risk factors,  including the market premium,  over the 1968-2017 period.

Table 3 Summary Statistics for Fama-French Risk Factors

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/9a746c9cc38a795f6655c0a2d9d12a3c9b460107fb139fecf9d7b70cec260362.jpg)

The market is the return on the value-weighted index of all NYSE-AMEX-NASDAQ stocks,  and the risk-free return is the return on short-term U.S. Treasury bills. The annual market return,  net of the risk-free rate,  over the past 50 years is $6.77\%$ . Also,  as discussed prior,  the volatility of stocks is large relative to bonds,  and is calculated at $17.84\%$ for the past 50 years. Thus,  there is a considerable amount of variability around the $6.77\%$ excess return. Despite the high volatility,  the mean estimate of $6.77\%$ is 2.68 standard errors from zero and thus reliably different from zero.

The difference in annual returns between small stocks and large stocks over the past 50 years is $2.00\%$ and referred to as the small stock premium. This premium estimate,  at least based on the past 50 years,  is

Considerably smaller than the premium estimate for the overall stock market relative to Treasury bills. Indeed,  at least for the past 50 years,  the $2.00\%$ excess return is not statistically different from zero as it is only 1.17 standard errors different from zero. Value stocks,  as proxied by high book-to-market ratios,  generate annual returns which are $4.90\%$ greater than growth stocks as proxied by low book-to-market ratios. The value premium,  at least for the prior 50 years,  appears to be reliably different from zero (2.43 standard errors from zero).

Now that we know all of McDonald’s factor loadings for the three -factor Fama-French model,  we can just multiply the factor loadings,  that is,  the regression beta coefficients,  by the estimates for the three risk premiums to compute McDonald’s equity cost of capital. It is:

$$
6.07\%~=~2.40\%~+~0.658~\left (6.50\%\right)~-~0.469~\left (2.00\%\right)~+~0.067~\left (4.90\%\right)
$$  

Thus,  according to the Fama-French three-factor model,  the expected equity return,  or equity cost of capital,  for McDonald’s stock is $6.07\%,  $ and thus roughly the same as the $6.26\%$ equity cost of capital per the CAPM. For many other firms,  the Fama-French model will provide widely different estimates than the CAPM as the factor loadings can be all over the place,  especially for SMB and HML at least at the individual firm level. At the industry level,  the factor loadings are more stable due to the averaging effects across numerous firms.

The Fama-French model,  as well as other multi-factor asset-pricing models,  is not as widely used as the CAPM in estimating the cost of capital for corporate projects. While the multi-factor models require more beta estimates and more risk premium estimates,  these can be computed,  but they are more difficult to interpret and understand versus the beta in the CAPM framework. Moreover,  as we noted for SMB for the recent 50-year record,  its return is not even statistically different from zero. Also,  there is the matter of taking it on faith that factors such as SMB and HML are indeed true risk factors which are priced by investors. That is,  one needs to be able to tell a story for example that value firms are riskier during market downturns,  perhaps due to having high fixed costs and not being able to react quickly to negative shocks. In contrast,  a growth company can defer its investment spending during a downturn. And importantly,  it must be the case that the beta on the market doesn’ t capture this corporate response,  that is,  one would expect value stocks would have higher stock market betas under this logic,  but that is not the case given the empirical rejections of the CAPM. Alternatively,  behavioral finance would suggest that SMB and HML are not risk factors; rather,  they reflect a mispricing of securities attributed to investor irrationality.

To summarize,  the Fama-French three-factor model has had an enormous impact in finance,  not only in academia,  but in practice as well. It has done a great job in pointing out that the CAPM is not as reliable an asset pricing model as once thought. Today,  investment fund performance is generally measured relative to the multi-factor asset pricing model,  if anything,  to see what factors a fund’s portfolio loads on. The concept of alpha,  in a CAPM world,  is no longer necessarily alpha in a multi-factor world. For corporate finance and calculating the cost of capital,  the Fama-French model is a nice complement to the CAPM,  but not an obvious or even suitable replacement. Indeed,  at the project level,  it is often confusing to think about how projects should load on SMB or HML. We can think of firms loading on these factors,  but not projects so much. As a practitioner,  I have rarely seen anyone use a multi-factor model to calculate the cost of capital,  but I think it is helpful to do so as it helps to confirm or modify our CAPM estimates and reinforces our thought structure that it is systematic risk which matters to investors more so than idiosyncratic risk.

# The Multiples Approach to Valuation

Investment bankers have a strong preference in using multiples from comparable corporations,  EBITDA multiples for example,  to value corporations and other assets. Private equity firms often tout multiples expansion in terms of creating value with their portfolio companies. Indeed,  multiple expansion is often viewed as arbitrage,  that is,  taking a corporation private at a low multiple and subsequently taking the corporation back public again a few years later at a higher multiple. This note provides a brief introduction to using multiples as a valuation tool. While corporate finance textbooks devote minimal discussion to multiples analysis,  it is important to understand why practitioners have adopted multiples valuation as a primary valuation tool and how it relates to the basic DCF framework. First,  this note revisits the perpetuity formula in terms of calculating terminal values for a project or corporation and then transitions to the concept of multiples valuation.

# Terminal Value in the Context of a Corporation

The lecture note,  Using NPV to Make Investment Decisions,  contains a valuation example of a travel machine as discussed in Amazon ’s 2004 shareholder letter. For that example,  we forecast cash flows over a seven-year period and assume the project terminates at the end of the seventh year. Alternatively,  we could assume Amazon continues to invest in travel machines and generate cash flows beyond the seventh year,  and thus calculate the value of the project beyond the seven-year forecast period. We often think of corporations as having perpetual lives as they don’t have maturity dates like many projects for example. Here,  the analyst can calculate year-to-year discounted cash flows when the firm is experiencing high or volatile growth,  until the growth rate hits steady state. Afterwards,  the analyst calculates the terminal value as of the end of the forecast period and then discounts back to the present date. This terminal value can take the form of a perpetuity valuation or of a multiples valuation,  and this note describes both in turn.

We first analyze the case where the terminal value is calculated using the perpetuity formula. Consider a private equity firm looking to value a publicly-traded corporation which it intends to take private at roughly $\$ 5$ billion. The private equity firm plans to make numerous operating changes over the next few years which will substantially reduce operating expenses,  as well as increase the revenue growth trajectory of the target firm. These major operational changes are expected to generate cash flows which will be fairly volatile over the next several years. The private equity firm anticipates that after eight years,  the operational changes will have all been implemented at which time earnings growth will be relatively stable going forward. For purposes of valuing the target firm,  the private equity firm computes valuations over two different periods,  the forecast period and the terminal value period. Given the expected high volatility of the cash flows over the eight-year forecast period,  they employ the DCF analysis to conduct the forecast-period valuation. A DCF analysis of the expected cash flows over the forecast period yields a value of $\$ 400$ million,  a relatively small value to the intended take-out price of $\$ 5$ billion. Consequently,  the bulk of the value in the target firm will be largely realized in the terminal value calculation.

Assume the expected cash flows in Year 8,  the final year of the forecast period,  are $\$ 480$ million. Thereafter,  the private equity firm expects the cash flows to stabilize and grow at an annual rate of $3.0\%$ in perpetuity. The private equity firm believes the cost of capital at the target firm is $11.0\%$ . Given these assumptions,  we can value the terminal value via the perpetuity formula:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{V}=\,  \frac{{\sf E}[\mathsf{C F}]}{[\mathsf{r}\!-\!\mathsf{g}]}\qquad\qquad\qquad\,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  \,  
$$  

The terminal value for the target firm is $\$ 6.0$ billion,  given the model assumptions. But note that we can’t add the $\$ 6.0$ billion terminal value to the present value of $\$ 400$ million based on the cash flows over the forecast period. Rather,  we need to first discount the terminal value of $\$ 6$ billion to the current date:

$$
£_{2.799\ b i l l i o n}\!=\!\frac{£_{6.0\ m i l l i o n}}{£_{1.11}{}^{8}}
$$  

Year 9 is the first year of cash flows for the terminal value calculation. Therefore,  it follows that the terminal value is as of Year 8. Thus,  the discounting of the terminal value of $\$ 6$ billion is eight years since the value of a perpetuity is as of the date one year prior to the first year of cash flows in the perpetuity formula. As a result,  the overall enterprise value of the target firm is $\$ 3.199$ billion,  the sum of the $\$ 400$ million present value over the forecast period and the $\$ 2.799$ billion present value of the terminal value.

A caveat to keep in mind regarding the seemingly precise valuation of $\$ 3.199$ billion. This estimate is based on all the various assumptions as given,  including that the cash flows are expected to continue forever. In a statistical sense,  that is,  if we account for the variability associated with the assumptions,  the $\$ 3.199$ billion is likely not significantly different from $\$ 3.0$ billion,  or perhaps even $\$ 2.5$ billion. In fact,  suppose for instance that we believe the perpetual growth rate is $6\%$ instead of $3\%$ . The resulting valuation as of today would be $\$ 4.566$ billion,  over $40\%$ greater than the $\$ 3.199$ billion valuation. While any DCF analysis is highly dependent on the assumptions,  the perpetuity formula is particularly sensitive to differences in discount rates and growth rates,  given the formula assumes cash flows grow forever. An attribute of using multiples to value a corporation is that we don’t have to rely on estimating the various

Inputs such as discount rates and growth rates,  rather they are already incorporated in the valuation of the comparable firm by the market as we discuss below.

# Using Multiples from Comparable Firms to Value Projects and Firms

The use of multiples in comparable transactions is how many,  likely most,  of us conduct valuations with respect to our personal and business transactions. For example,  when we purchase a house,  we search for prices of comparable houses to assess the value. Obviously,  for valuation purposes the critical issue is finding a comparable house since it is generally unlikely there is an identical house with a recent transacted price. Realtors tend to quote in terms of square foot per house,  and then adjust for differences in location,  age of house,  upgrades,  etc. To derive a suitable comparable transaction price. Alternatively,  we can compute a DCF analysis of purchasing a house,  but this analysis entails making numerous assumptions about all the various costs and benefits associated with owning a house and the expected price at which we could sell the house at some future date. But then how do we come up with a reasonable estimate of selling the house in several years down the road? Moreover,  given the expected long life of houses and the perpetual life of the underlying land,  small mistakes in the discount rate and growth rate can lead to erroneous valuations.

To rely on prices of comparable houses,  as well as any goods and services,  as adequate measures of value,  [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] price markets must be in force. The same principle applies to corporations and related assets. The value of a corporation is driven by market forces,  at least in a [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] economy which is now largely the case in most countries,  rather than a price or valuation controlled by the state. Indeed,  this concept is the basis for NPV as covered in the Introduction to Corporate Finance lecture note. That is,  corporate managers purchase those assets and corporations which they believe are worth more than the purchase price,  and thus the difference is the NPV.

Arbitrage is the underlying mechanism by which prices are set in asset markets. If two equivalent assets trade at the same time,  albeit in different markets,  they should trade at the same price assuming [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] and efficient markets. Otherwise,  arb it rage urs manufacture risk-free profits by purchasing the cheaper asset and simultaneously shorting the expensive asset. Indeed,  this is how we think of efficient markets,  that is,  arbitrage opportunities do not exist in efficient markets. Even in financial markets which exhibit various levels of inefficiency,  we can think of arb it rage urs working hard to push prices of related assets in line. In the market for real products and services,  we can even think of corporations as acting as arb it rage urs as the [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] pressure to maximize profits results in similar prices across products and services,  holding quality and other attributes constant.

Importantly,  there is a direct link in using multiples from comparable firms versus traditional DCF analysis to value a corporation or asset. A simple rearrangement of Equation 1 showcases the link between these two valuation measures.

$$
\begin{array}{r} {{\frac{\mathsf{V}} {\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{C F}]}}=\,  {\frac{1}{\,  [\mathsf{r}\!-\!\mathsf{g}]\,  }}}\end{array}
$$  

This rearrangement of Equation 1 indicates that the value of each dollar of expected cash flow can be expressed by the inverse of the discount rate minus the growth rate. Hence,  $1\,  /\,  \mathfrak{r}\,  –9$ gives us the cash flow multiple with respect to the total value of a corporation or of any asset. Intuitively,  a higher discount rate has the affect of reducing the cash flow multiple,  whereas a higher growth has the opposite effect.

Consider the cash flow multiple for Coca-Cola. At the end of 2020,  the enterprise value of Coca-Cola is $\$ 271.4$ billion and the pro forma cash flow for 2021 is $\$ 9.3$ billion. Consequently,  CocaCola’s cash flow multiple is 29.2 as of December 2020. The cost of capital for Coca-Cola is $6.2\%$ as of December 2020 using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Given the $6.2\%$ cost of capital,  the implied growth rate for future cash flows into perpetuity at Coca-Cola is $2.8\%$ . If we assume a higher (lower) cost of capital for CocaCola,  the implied growth rate is higher (lower) than $2.8\%$ annually. Assuming the cost of capital exceeds $3.4\%$ which is a low estimate since Treasury bonds were yielding about $2.0\%$ in December 2020,  then Coca-Cola cash flows are expected to grow annually into perpetuity.

Overall,  we can think of a high multiple as reflective of a high expected growth rate in cash flows,  a low cost of capital,  or both. And in cases where the multiple is on the low side,  it is possible,  the implied expected growth rate of the cash flows can even be negative. Consider textbook publishers for instance. The textbook industry has been hit hard over the past several years. First,  companies like Amazon and EBay have matched up buyers and sellers of used textbooks,  thus reducing the overall demand for new textbooks. Second,  the rental textbook market is a rapidly growing phenomenon which is reducing demand for new textbooks. Third,  the continuing transformation to digital is lowering textbook prices substantially,  especially given the mindsight of many young users that digital content should have close to a zero price. All three factors put considerable pressure on textbook corporations.

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt is a publicly-traded textbook publisher with an enterprise value of $\$ 923$ million as of December 2020. The 2021 pro forma cash flow is $\$ 102$ million as of December 2020,  and thus a cash flow multiple of 9.0,  much lower than Coca Cola ’s multiple of 29.2 . Assuming a cost of capital of $8.1\%$ for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,  the implied growth rate in the future cash flows into perpetuity is not positive,  rather negative at $-7.3\%$ . Thus,  the stock market agrees with the standard logic and perception that textbook publishers are likely on the decline as opposed to being a growth story.

How can we employ these cash flow multiples to value other corporations and assets? For example,  Platinum Equity,  a private equity firm,  purchased McGraw Hill in 2021 from Apollo Capital,  another private equity firm. Based on the expected annual cash flows of $\$ 490$ million at the beginning of 2021,  the 9.0 cash flow multiple from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt indicates a valuation of $\$ 4.4$ billion. Interestingly,  Platinum Equity paid $\$ 4.5$ billion for McGraw Hill,  thus roughly the amount as indicated by the cash flow multiples valuation. Of course,  it only makes sense to use Houghton Mifflin Harcourt as the comparable firm if it is expected to exhibit similar future growth rates in cash flows and a similar cost of capital. Given these two firms directly compete in the textbook market,  this assumption seems reasonable.

As described,  there is a direct connection in valuing a corporation using DCF analysis versus applying a cash flow multiple from a comparable firm. In both types of analyses,  the focus is on cash flows and over the entire future life of the corporation. The difference is that with the multiples approach,  we do not explicitly calculate an expected growth rate or the firm ’s cost of capital. Rather,  these factors are embedded in the multiple of the comparable firm. That is,  the multiples approach is one of relative valuation. Indeed,  the multiples approach to valuation assumes that the market does a good job of valuing firms in general. Thus,  if we use Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s cash flow multiple to value McGraw Hill,  we are making a strong assumption that the stock market is efficient and providing the correct valuation for Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Practitioners often conduct both types of valuation analyses,  using the multiples valuation approach as a check on the DCF valuation model. A cynical view is that practitioners use the multiples approach to obtain the value of the target firm and then engineer the NPV valuation to deliver a similar answer.

While conceptually the cash-flow multiple from a comparable firm should mimic traditional DCF valuation. A shortcoming in actual practice is that cash flows can be very lumpy and vary considerably year-to-year across firms. Recall the previously mentioned analysis of the travel machine project as described in Amazon ’s 2004 letter to shareholders. The analysis computes the [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] for the Amazon travel machine project and then converts the [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] to cash flows as follows:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c6430cc1a587e66bf89427eb425793c5890fea02300b134ffbd0b2a2be42d121.jpg)

The cash-flow pattern for the travel machines was highly variable on a year-to-year basis due to the large CAPX of the additional machines. The expected cash flow was even negative in the first three years of operations,  swinging from - $\cdot\$ 470$ million in Year 3 to $\$ 385$ million in Year 4. Consequently,  if the Amazon travel-machine project was a publicly-traded security,  it would not be possible to use its cash-flow multiple in the early years to value a related project or firm. Even for large and relatively stable firms such as Coca-Cola,  the cash flow can be way off the normal trend line in the year used to calculate the multiple as a result of an extraordinary amount of depreciation,  CAPX,  or change in NWC in a given year.

There are two basic ways to handling the lumpiness often exhibited with cash flow estimates. The first method is to normalize the respective depreciation,  CAPX,  or change in NWC estimates which generate the high volatility associated with the cash flow estimates,  whether for the comparable firm or the firm being valued. The second method,  and that which is typically employed,  is to go above the cash-flow line and use a profit measure which is usually less volatile than cash flows. A popular measure of choice is

Earnings Before Interest,  Taxes,  and Depreciation (EBITDA) as it tends to be closely related to cash flows,  and yet benefits from being less volatile.

An important consideration with using an EBITDA multiple as a substitute for a cash-flow multiple is that the comparable firm (s) has the same relation between EBITDA and cash flow as for the firm being valued. If in Eq. 1,  we replace E (CF) with E (EBITDA),  we add a new term,  Cash-Flow Conversion,  which is the ratio between EBITDA and cash flow:

$$
\frac{\mathsf{V}}{\mathsf{E[E B D I T A]}}=\mathsf{C a s h\!-\! F l o w\,   C o n v e r s i o n\,  }\frac{1}{\mathsf{[r\!-\! G]}}
$$  

Our working assumption is that the Cash Flow Conversion,  which represents an adjustment for depreciation,  taxes,  CAPX,  and changes in NWC,  is largely the same for the target firm as it is for the comparable firm (s). And to the extent that the ratio is not roughly the same,  one can adjust EBITDA to reflect these differences. Private equity firms tend to employ EBITDA multiples in part because they focus on mature firms which don’t tend to exhibit unusually high growth. But if looking at a target with super - high growth,  the EBITDA might be negative just like the cash flow. In this instance,  one might even employ a revenue multiple or instead forecast cash flows for a very long period until the cash flows are expected to stabilize.

# Multiple Expansion (Arbitrage or Not?)

The beginning of this lecture note made a reference to multiples expansion. Suppose a private equity firm takes a target firm private at an EBITDA multiple of 8.4 and a few years later returns to the public market via an IPO at an EBITDA multiple of 10.7. I expect the private equity firm will make numerous references to the 2.3 increase in the EBITDA multiple as multiples expansion,  and perhaps even refer to it as multiples arbitrage.

There are various ways in which multiples expansion can occur. We know that based on the perpetuity formula,  multiples are based on growth rates and discount rates. Thus,  firms with high expected growth rates and/or low discount rates will tend to have higher multiples. We saw this earlier with respect to Coca-Cola versus Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Consequently,  if management succeeds in making decisions which increase the expected growth rate of the cash flows,  or EBITDA,  over several years,  the multiple will expand,  reflecting the increased value of the corporation. Of course,  it is also possible that the multiple expansion to the corporation is driven by market sentiment for the relevant sector and largely unrelated to the respective managerial decisions. Multiples expansions,  via discount rates,  are generally due to overall market forces rather than to managerial action.

I have found over the years that board directors and CEOs like high multiple businesses. At least they often speak affective ly of morphing into a business model with a higher multiple than with their current company. For example,  consider a software consulting firm which provides customized solutions. This firm will have a lower multiple than a SaaS subscription model which is highly scalable and has recurring revenue. Certainly,  SaaS subscription firms are the rage these days with relatively high valuations. But the transition is costly and not necessarily shareholder wealth maximizing for all firms. Once a firm makes the transition to a SaaS subscription model,  it will tend to enjoy a higher multiple after the fact. However,  the cost of the transition and a reduction in near-term earnings during the transition period may possibly reduce shareholder wealth. Stated differently,  it is optimal for some firms to operate low-multiple businesses and other firms to operate high-multiple businesses.

# Real Options Analysis

# PREVIEW

The DCF concept of converting cash flows over several periods into a value as of a specific date is a powerful concept in finance. The resulting NPV generates a value that management can use to decide whether to invest or reject the investment project under consideration and maximize shareholder wealth.

Despite the benefits of using DCF to evaluate investment decisions,  it was not until the 1970 s before large corporations began to embrace the use of DCF as they had historically favored some measure of an accounting rate of return or a simple payback technique. Today,  over $75\%$ of large corporations use IRR and NPV in their investment decisions. Interestingly though,  over half of large corporations still employ the payback method as an evaluator tool for project selection.

While DCF and NPV are powerful finance concepts and widely used in practice,  a drawback is that a standard DCF analysis assumes the project will progress as intended,  given the assumptions at the beginning of the project. Stated differently,  as typically implemented,  DCF is a static model. In reality,  outcomes don’t always occur as expected ,  and thus the optimal path will often change before the project ends. And just because a result doesn’t happen as expected doesn’t mean that the priors were incorrect ex-ante,  rather,  expected values are based on various states of the world with associated probabilities.

Importantly,  management has the option to alter a project after it has commenced. That is,  management can choose to expand the project,  abandon the project,  or modify the project in numerous ways. These opportunities to alter projects down the road are referred to as real options and can be valued,  often with considerable difficulty,  at the beginning of the project and may end up altering the timing and the size of the project relative to undertaking a basis NPV analysis.

The purpose of this lecture note is to introduce the concept of a real option. We start with a refresher of option terminology and basic option pricing models. Next,  we describe how real investment decisions can have embedded options,  which we label as real options,  and follow with some relatively straightforward examples. We close with an overview of how real options impact overall firm valuations,  especially high-growth firms. But first,  we start with a case involving the Decision Tree Corporation.

Management of Decision Tree is analyzing Bang-Bang,  a project which requires an upfront investment of $\S\,   100$ million with perpetual cash flows commencing at the end of the year. Assume the future cash flows are $\$ 12$ million per year with $40\%$ probability or $\$ 6$ million per year with $60\%$ probability. Think of the $\$ 12$ million outcome as the good state of the world and the $\$ 6$ million outcome as the bad state of the world. The cost of capital for Bang-Bang is $8.0\%,  $ ,  and the risk-free rate is $3.5\%$ . The NPV for Bang-Bang is:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}~=~\$ 5\ \mathsf{m i l i o n}~=~\AA-\$ 100\ \mathsf{m i l i o n}~+~\frac{\left[\$ 12\ \mathsf{m i l i o n}\ \bigl (0.40\bigr)~+~\$ 6\ \mathsf{m i l i o n}\ \bigl (0.60\bigr)\right]}{0.08}
$$  

Employing basic NPV analysis,  management of Decision Tree accepts the proposed Bang-Bang project and invest immediately.

Suppose Decision Tree can delay the investment by one year at which time management will know whether the outcome is the good state of the world or the bad state of the world. Importantly,  once management knoww which state of the world the project is in,  it will remain in that same state into perpetuity. Thus,  if the Bang-Bang project hits the bad state of the world where the expected cash flows are $\$ 6$ million,  then all subsequent periods will also be in the bad state of the world. In this case,  management will estimate the NPV at the end of the year as:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}~=~\mathrm{~-~}\$ 28.5~\mathsf{m i l i o n}~=~\mathrm{~-~}\$ 103.5~\mathsf{m i l i o n}~+~\frac{\$ 6~\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{0.08}
$$  

Since the NPV is negative in the bad state of the world,  management would reject Bang-Bang had the investment decision delayed for a year. Before we estimate the NPV at the end of the year for the good state of the world,  note the underlying assumption behind the cost of the investment if delayed to the end of the year. Rather than assuming the investment cost remains fixed at $\S\,   100$ million,  the calculation above assumes instead that it will increase at the risk-free rate as commodity costs,  labor costs,  overhead,  etc.,  are expected to rise as prices increase.

In the good state of the world,  the NPV at the end of the year is:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}~=~\$ 46.5~\mathsf{m i l i o n}~=~\mathrm{~-~}\$ 403.5~\mathsf{m i l i o n}~+~\frac{\$ 12~\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{0.08}
$$  

Here,  the NPV is large relative to the size of the investment,  which shouldn’t be surprising given that Bang-Bang ended up in the good state of the world. Management of Decision Tree Corporation will recommend moving forward on the project due to the significant NPV. As outlined above,  we show

Investment decisions at two different points in time,  today and one year from today. Given a choice to invest in Bang-Bang at the current time,  management will recommend moving forward on the project given the NPV of $\$ 5$ million. But this decision assumes the investment is either made at the current time or not at all. We also show that if Decision Tree can wait and make the investment at the end of the year,  management will recommend acceptance in the good state of the world and rejection in the bad state of the world based on the respective NPVs.

The next step is to compare the two investments each which generates a positive NPV,  that is,  the NPV of $\$ 5$ million at the current time or the NPV of $\$ 46.5$ million at the end of the year if investing in the good state of the world. Both are attractive is isolation,  but what if viewed as mutually exclusive projects? To make this comparison,  we need to consider them at the same point in time. We know the NPV of investing immediately is $\$ 5$ million,  but what is the NPV today of waiting one year and then choosing to invest in the good state of the world? It is:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}~=~\$ 15.6~\mathsf{m i l i o n}~=~\left[\frac{-\,   103.5~\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{1.035}~+~\frac{\$ 12~\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{0.08 (1.08)}\right]\! 0.40
$$  

There are several points to note about the various components of the above NPV calculation. First,  the investment cost increases by $3.5\%$ if delayed by one year. Thus,  we have assumed an investment cost of $\S\,   103.5$ million in one year,  and note the discounting back to today at the discount rate of $3.5\%$ . In present value terms,  the cost of investment today is identical to the cost of investing in one year Second,  since the potential future cash flows of $\$ 12$ million commence in two years,  given the one-year delay of the investment decision,  the value of the perpetuity is as of the end of the first year and thus must be discounted another year back to the current. Third,  the formula reflects the fact that the probability at the current period of realizing the good state of the world one year later is equal to $40\%$ .

While the NPV of immediately investing in Bang-Bang is positive at $\$ 5$ million,  the NPV of the alternative project of delaying the investment for one year and then investing in the good state,  if it occurs,  is over three times greater at $\$ 15.6$ million. We have deliberated framed these as mutually exclusive projects,  in keeping with the way that we have applied NPV and DCF analysis so far which has been in a static framework. But given there are future decisions that can alter the profitability of the project we can model this project a bit differently using probability tree analysis and decision tree analysis as outlined as follows. We will end up at the same place as before,  but the approach will be different and will yield valuable insights into understanding more complicated decisions faced by management.

The starting point is a probability tree as displayed below.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/6ce722bf3c8f217a72184386d9499acd7a47b571766e813e3a580894b562bd19.jpg)

There is no new information in these diagrams,  rather,  a different way of illustrating the analysis. I label it a probability tree since there are no decisions made along the way. That is,  the decision will be made to invest now or not at all based on the cash flows provided. As shown above,  the associated NPV is $\$ 5$ million. The purpose of starting with the probability tree is to lay the groundwork for the decision tree in the illustration below.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/a31e85014efcb1cfabe80befaf22a785007ae7b74476e96bab477dde2e7118e4.jpg)

The decision tree illustrates the optional it y associated with the Bang-Bang project. Management can either decide to invest today or instead to wait and reevaluate in one year. By waiting one year,  management learns which state of the world exists,  the good state or the bad state. In both cases,  management has the option at the end of the first year to invest $\S\,   103.5$ million in Bang-Bang but will optimally choose to invest only in the good state. We saw that the NPV of investing today is $\$ 5$ million and the NPV of delaying the project and investing a year later,  if in the good state of the world,  is $\$ 15.6$ million. Thus,  the ability to delay the project by one year increases its value by $\$ 10.6$ million,  and hence the option to delay is $\$ 10.6$ million. Indeed,  the delay option is more than twice the value of the original NPV. Without this option to delay the project,  management bears the risk of ending up in the bad state of the world and with an ex-post negative NPV.

Decision tree analysis is merely an extension of NPV rather than an alternative to NPV . Basic NPV doesn’t allow for contingent decisions throughout a project by management,  and thus decision tree analysis delivers considerable value to the NPV framework by incorporating the concept of subsequent decisions and the resulting optional it y. However,  decision tree analysis has its share of drawbacks. First,  it is not easy to estimate the probabilities associated with the various states of the world. Second,  the risk is changing as the project moves through the tree. In our illustration,  we assume risk and expected cash flows in the respective states of the world do not change,  but these are overly simplistic and lousy assumptions,  at least when it comes to real options in the real world. Now,  we turn to the basics of option pricing to gain insight into how we can value real options,  just like the option to delay the BangBang projects,  similar to the valuation of financial options which many of us are familiar.

# BASIC OPTION TERMINOLOGY

Before delving into real options,  it is crucial to understand basic option terminology,  payoff diagrams,  standard option valuation models,  etc. The subsequent sections provide the basic framework necessary to understand financial options,  mainly what is most relevant for corporate finance,  and is a cursory review of what you learned in Investments.

There are two basic types of options,  calls and puts. A call option gives the owner the right to purchase an asset by a specified date (exercise or maturity date) at a set price typically referred to as the exercise or strike price,  whereas a put option gives the owner the right to sell an asset by a specified date at a set exercise or strike price. Figure 1 shows the payoff (in blue line) and profit (in dotted blue line) diagrams for the owner of a call option on the option exercise date at an exercise price of $\$ 40$ . Assume the option was purchased several weeks prior at $\$ 5$ . Further assume these options are European options and thus can only be exercised on the exercise date,  whereas American options can be exercised any date prior to the exercise date.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/2d53ba534695f5ea1b67bde75d2a694442b846f13a15b840e04bb60c84a44bb1.jpg)

If the asset price exceeds $\$ 40$ on the exercise date,  the holder of the option will exercise the option as it will be “in -themoney.” And if the asset price is equal or less than $\$ 40,  $ ,  the holder allow s the call option to expire worthless. The call option value at expiration is:

$$
\mathsf{C}=\mathsf{m a x}\;[\mathsf{S}-\mathsf{K},  \,   0)
$$  

Where ${\mathsf{C}}=$ call value,  $\mathsf{S}=$ asset price,  and $\mathsf{K}=$ exercise price. Suppose the asset price is $\$ 60$ on the exercise date. The holder will exercise and realize a profit of $\$ 15$ $(\$ 60\textrm{-}\$ 40\textrm{-}\$ 5)$ . It is important to note that the mere exercise of the option when the asset price exceeds the exercise does not imply the call option holder realizes a profit on the investment. For example,  if the asset price is $\$ 41$ on the exercise date,  the holder will exercise and incur a roundtrip loss of $\$ 4$ $4\: (\$ 41\textrm{-}\$ 40\textrm{-}\$ 5)$ . That is,  it is beneficial to realize a loss of $\$ 4$ via exercise versus a loss of $\$ 5$ if the holder chooses not to exercise the call option. As shown in the payoff and profit diagram,  the call option will have positive value on the exercise date if the asset price exceeds $\$ 40$ per the payoff line,  and the holder will profit from the investment if the asset price exceeds $\$ 45$ per the profit line.

As indicated above,  a put option gives the owner the right to sell the asset at a specified price. The put option value at expiration is:

$$
\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{m a x}\;[\mathsf{K}-\mathsf{S},  \,   0]
$$  

Thus,  the holder benefits if the asset price is less than the exercise price on the date of exercise. Figure 2 shows the payoff (in blue line) and profit (in dotted blue line) diagrams for the owner of a put option as the option exercise date and an exercise price of $\$ 60$ .

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/40fcb7b4e7fcf65f78e35f44ae951c1a7cc066f2486059731a895b2368dbc613.jpg)

Assume the option was purchased several weeks prior for $\$ 7$ . As illustrated,  the option is “in the money” and thus has a positive payoff if the asset price on the exercise date is less than $\$ 60$ . For example,  if the asset price is $\$ 50$ on the exercise date,  the holder will exercise and realize a profit of $\$ 3$ $\S\ (\$ 60\textrm{-}\$ 50\textrm{-}\$ 7)$ . And as indicated with the call option,  the holder of the put option will exercise at certain prices even it means losing money on the roundtrip trade. For example,  if the asset price is $\$ 55$ on the exercise date,  the holder will exercise and realize an overall loss of $\$ 2$ $(\$ 60\textrm{-}\$ 55\textrm{-}\$ 7)$ . But exercising and realizing a loss of $\$ 2$ is preferable to not exercising and realizing a loss of $\$ 7$ .

As there are two sides to every option contract,  the writer or the seller of the option is on the other side of the long position by the party who bought the option. By selling the option,  the writer receives a premium upfront but is subject to subsequent liabilities. That is,  the option writer never receives funds in addition to the upfront premium as the holder of the option will not exercise if the option is out of the money. The option writer’s profit or loss is the exact opposite of the option buyer’s profit or loss as it is a zero net -sum transaction. Thus,  the payoff to the seller of a call option is:

$$
\mathsf{C a l l~S e l l e r~P a y o f f=-m a x~[S-K,  ~0)=m i n~[K-S,  ~0]}
$$  

The payoff,  and profit,  at expiration to the seller of the call option is shown below in Figure 3 and is the exact opposite of the payoff and profit diagram for the call buyer as shown in Figure 1.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b9b72a7fee8ecaed64583189d578c4fe866b4e8a32c6dfaf6f5107447f4e318a.jpg)

Finally,  the payoff to the seller of a put option is:

$$
\mathsf{P u t\; S e l l e r\; P a y o f f=-m a x\;[K-S,  \,   0]=m i n\;[S-K,  \,   0]}
$$  

The payoff,  and profit,  at expiration to the seller of the put option is shown below in Figure 4 and is the exact opposite of the payoff and profit diagram for the put buyer as shown in Figure 2.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/23bce3a229212a4b19ba756c90f54de92c7a331272bfead2b3c60afebaa05d68.jpg)

The payoff to the put writer is similar to that of certain investment strategies including that of merger arbitrage. In 2001,  Todd Pulvino and I were the first researchers to document that hedge fund strategies such as merger arbitrage have a payoff structure comparable to that of sellers of out-of-the-money S&P 500 index put options. See Figure 5 below which is from our 2001 paper and covers the period 1975-1998.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c4fc3e68830d0472c01f4d3f0bf71bfa9ea792e7c3b726550f33c3f82384dcec.jpg)

Below,  see Figure 6 which covers the 2001-2017 period in support of the original analysis. The beta tends to be somewhat flat when the market is increasing,  flat or slightly declining,  but increases substantially when the market is tanking. Overall,  our research shows that similar to out-of-the-money index put options,  a small premium is collected in most states of the world by merger arb it rage urs,  but occasionally a hefty payout is made just like with insurance policies. Moreover,  while investment managers are typically judged against a CAPM or a multi-factor asset pricing model such as Fama-French,  risk arbitrage may be better evaluated relative to a replicating portfolio with a non-linear option-like payoff.

The purpose of illustrating the above is to point out that if an investment strategy looks like an option,  then it should be modeled and valued as an option. The same is true for real options as discussed at the end of this lecture note.

# FACTORS DRIVING OPTION VALUES

The value of an option is driven by six primary factors:

(1) asset price Increases in the asset price result in higher (lower) call (put) option values.

(2) strike price

Increases in the strike price result in lower (higher) call (put) option values. Some companies which have realized steep stock price declines will reset the strike prices of way out-of-themoney [[Week 4 ESOs and Valuation|employee stock options]] to “better align incentives ,  ” often to the chagrin of shareholders.

(3) time to expiration

Longer-dated options,  both calls and puts,  have higher values than short-dated options,  everything else constant. EBay’s stock price is currently $\$ 45.98$ . A put option with a strike price of $\$ 42.50$ and expiring in one day is worth about 1 cent. But if the put option has two years of remaining life,  the value is about $\$ 6.20$ ,  thus 620 times higher.

(4) volatility of underlying asset

If volatility increases unexpectedly,  the probability of the asset performing either extremely well or extremely poorly increases and thus leads to higher values for both calls and puts. For example,  if Kinder Morgan,  a pipeline transportation and energy storage firm with long-term fixed contracts,  were to expand into exploration and production,  its volatility would likely increase,  resulting in higher value for both call and put options.

# (5) risk-free interest rate

Since the exercise price is not paid until a future date,  increases in the interest rate will increase the value of call options and decrease the value of put options,  everything else held constant.

# (6) expected dividends

As discussed in the Dividend Policy lecture note,  dividends reduce the stock price on the ex-dividend date. Thus,  dividends paid prior to the exercise date have the effect of reducing the price of call options and increasing the price of put options. Note that dividends can lead to early exercise of call options depending on the size of the dividend.

# THE Binomial OPTION PRICING MODEL

When one thinks of option pricing models,  what first comes to mind is the famous Black-Scholes model published in 1973. Fischer Black began attempting to price options in 1968,  started collaborating with Myron Scholes in 1969,  and circulated the first version of their paper in 1970. As with many innovative articles,  Black and Scholes had great difficulty in publishing their option pricing model. Three academic journals rejected their article before it was finally accepted by the Journal of Political Economy based on the strong recommendations of Eugene Fama and Merton Miller. In the same year,  Robert Merton published his option pricing model independent of Black-Scholes,  and often their joint model is referred to as Black-Scholes-Merton. We discuss their model in the next section. While the Black-Scholes-Merton model is mathematically complicated,  a far easier way to price options was developed a few years after,  namely the binomial option pricing model which converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton model with enough time steps.

As described below,  the binomial option pricing model is a simple,  yet extremely powerful model that can be employed to solve very complex option pricing problems. Whereas the Black-Scholes-Merton

Model requires advanced mathematics such as solving partial differential equations,  the binomial model only requires basic algebra and is exceptionally intuitive. As implied by the name,  the binomial option pricing model makes the simple assumption that the asset price has only two possible values at the end of the next period. Importantly,  and similar to the Black-Scholes-Merton model,  the binomial model constructs replicating portfolios of a risk-free bond and the underlying asset which generates the same payoff as that of the option. And given the law of one price,  namely that two assets which have the same payoff should have the same price,  it can be shown from the model that the value of the option is equivalent to the cost of setting up the replicating portfolio. A simple example follows below.

Consider a call option that expires in one period and has an exercise price of $\S\,   100$ . The current price of the underlying asset is $\$ 80$ and the interest rate during the period is $5\%$ . At the end of the period,  the asset price will either be $\S\,   120$ or $\$ 50$ . All of this information can be summarized on the binomial tree below which provides the timeline and all of the possible outcomes.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1119cbd219bbd5109687ae64961f80d49ddd85f656fd6b44696a917ee8e3ac8d.jpg)

The timeline above shows that the current asset price is $\$ 80$ and there are two possible outcomes at the end of the period. First,  the asset price can increase to $\mathbb{S}120,  $ ,  and we refer to this state as the up state. Second,  the asset price can decrease to $\$ 50,  $ ,  and we refer to this state as the down state. We know that at the up state asset price of $\mathbb{S}120,  $ ,  the holder of the call option will choose to exercise the option at the strike price of $\mathbb{S}100,  $ ,  thereby yielding a payoff of $\$ 20$ . At the down state asset price of $\$ 50,  $ ,  the option holder will opt not to exercise the option and thus the payoff will be $\$ 0$ .

Now that we know the two payoffs to the call option in both states of the world,  that is,  $\$ 20$ and $\$ 0,  $ the next step is to create a portfolio of the underlying asset and a risk-free bond which will exactly match the payoffs to the option in the two states of the world. Looking ahead,  we can compute the cost of the replicating portfolio which gives us the value of the option due to the law of one price. Think of the riskfree bond as cash and either investing to earn the risk-free rate or borrowing at the risk-free rate. In the up state of the world,  the replicating portfolio is:

$$
\$ 120\Delta\,  +\,   1.058=\$ 20
$$  

The replicating portfolio in Eq. 9 of the asset and a risk-free bond gives the same payoff of $\$ 20$ as the call option in the up state. There are two unknowns,  $\Delta$ and B. $\Delta$ refers to the number of shares of the asset in the replicating portfolio and B refers to the number of risk-free bonds in the replicating portfolio. Assume

The price of each risk-free bond is $\S\,   1$ . There is some combination of asset shares and risk-free bonds which delivers the same payoff as the call option. But from basic algebra,  we cannot solve for the amounts of assets and bonds since we have two unknowns and only one equation.

In the down state,  the replicating portfolio is given as:

$$
\$ 50\Delta\,  +\,   1.058=\$ 0
$$  

Now,  there are two simultaneous equations,  Eq. 9 and Eq. 10 ,  with two unknowns,  $\Delta$ and $\mathsf{B},  $ and thus we can solve for the answer,  that is,  the number of asset shares and risk-free bonds. By subtracting Eq. 10 from Eq. 9 ,  we obtain:

$$
\$ 70\Delta=\$ 20
$$  

Solving for $\Delta$ yields:

$$
\Delta\ =\ {\frac{\$ 20}{\$ 70}}=\ 0.2857
$$  

The replicating portfolio will own 0.2857 shares of the asset. Now that we know the solution for $\Delta,  $ we can plug the solution,  0.2857,  into either one of the two equations to solve for B as shown below by plugging into the up state equation:

$$
\$ 120\ (0.2857)\,  +\,   1.058=\$ 20
$$  

And yielding:

$$
\mathsf{B}=-\P 13.605^{11}
$$  

By borrowing $\$ 13.605$ and simultaneously purchasing 0.2857 shares of the asset,  this portfolio yields the same payoff of $\$ 20$ in the up state as shown above in Eq. 13 and the exact same payoff of $\$ 0$ in the down state as shown below in Eq. 15 :

$$
\$ 50\: (0.2857)\,  +\,   1.058=\$ 0
$$  

Since the portfolio of 0.2857 shares of the asset purchased via borrowing $\$ 13.605$ yields the same payoff in both states of the world as the payoff to the call option in both states of the world,  then the price of the call option must equal the cost of constructing this replicating portfolio. And the value of the replicating portfolio as of time 0 is simply equal to the value of the asset minus the funds borrowed:

$$
\$ 80\ (0.2857)\textrm{-}\$ 13.605=\$ 9.25
$$  

Since the value of the replicating portfolio is $\$ 9.25\$ as in Eq. 16 above,  then due to arbitrage,  that is,

Equivalent securities must sell for the same price,  the price of the call option must also be equal to $\$ 9.25\$ . This result is amazing. That is,  if one merely knows the current asset price,  the two possible asset prices at a future date,  the exercise price,  and the risk-free rate,  she can compute the value of a call option without knowing the probabilities associated with the two future states of the world and without knowing the expected return on the underlying asset. And if the price of the call option is less (greater) than $\$ 9.25,  $ ,  arb it rage urs will buy (write) the call option and simultaneously short (purchase) 0.2857 shares of the asset and invest (borrow) $\$ 13.605$ of cash,  guaranteeing a riskless profit until the prices converge.

The above stylized example can easily be generalized to apply to any option. As before,  assume there is only one period which has a beginning and end of the period and can be represented below.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/57d2d7bb2dc61d495ab96e626431a2c8defe0241b9884a58bbd40574bb594a62.jpg)

As shown,  the current asset price is $\mathsf{A},  $ and it can increase to A U or decrease to A D . And the corresponding option prices are ${\mathsf{C}}{\mathsf{U}}$ and $\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}$ . As before,  the bond is given as B,  and it earns (or pays) the risk-free (R F ) rate of interest. To compute the value of the option today,  we calculate the number of units,  $\Delta,  $ in the asset and the number of bond units to create a replicating portfolio which has the same payoff as the option when the asset goes up or down. As shown earlier with the stylized example,  here we solve generally for the two unknowns in the two simultaneous equations with the replicating portfolio.

$$
\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{D}}\,  \Delta\,  +\,  \mathsf{B}(1\,  +\,  \mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}})=\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}
$$  

Subtracting the $\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}$ equation from the ${\mathsf{C}}_{\mathsf{U}}$ equation and then solving for $\Delta$ yields:

$$
\mathsf{D}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{U}}\cdot\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}}{\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{U}}\cdot\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{D}}}
$$  

T he $\Delta$ captures the sensitivity of the value in the option to changes in the underlying asset price. And then solving for B yields:

$$
\textsf{B}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\mathsf{D}}\cdot\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{D}}\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}}
$$  
$$
\textsf{B}=\frac{\mathsf{C}_{\cup}\cdot\mathsf{A}_{\cup}\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{1}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathtt{F}}}
$$  

It follows,  as we showed earlier,  that the value of the option is simply equal to the cost of the replicating portfolio:

$$
{\mathsf{C}}={\mathsf{A}}\,  \Delta\,  +\,  {\mathsf{B}}
$$  

With these three simple equations,  Eq. 18 ,  Eq. 19 ,  and Eq. 20 ,  one can calculate the value of an option with the binomial option pricing model. Note that if we plug in the assumptions from the stylized example discussed earlier,  we obtain the same value for the option as shown below:

$$
0.2857\ =\ {\frac{\$ 20\,  \,  -\,  \$ 0}{\$ 120\,  \,  -\,  \$ 50}}
$$  

$$
\cdot\$ 13.605\ =\ {\frac{\$ 0\ -\ \$ 50\ \left (0.2857\right)}{1\ +\ 0.05}}
$$  

$$
\$ 9.25=\$ 80\ (0.2857)-\$ 13.60
$$  

Thus,  with this general formula,  we obtain the exact same answer as earlier when we solved the specific simultaneous equations for the two unknowns.

Notwithstanding the powerful finding that pricing an option is straightforward as demonstrated above,  we have done so in a vacuum as the real world contains many more possible states (outcomes) and many more periods than our simplistic assumptions. It is conceptually easy to add more periods and we can demonstrate by adding another period to the example used earlier. Thus,  we add another period to the previous example as shown below.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/409cd8c6e291c3423a7fc52ac9edfff292e1faa55e322b40d74cde4f544ca6b6.jpg)

As shown above,  the asset can either go up or down in each period. With two periods,  there are four possible stock price outcomes at the end rather than two stock price outcomes in the one-period model. Assume the current asset price is $\$ 60,  $ ,  rather than the previously assumed $\$ 80$ ,  the exercise price remains at $\mathbb{S}100,  $ and the risk-free rate remains at $5\%$ . Importantly,  to calculate the value of an option in a multiperiod model,  we start at the far right of the binomial tree and work backward. Note that the option expires at the end of the second period,  and in only one state in this example,  that is when the asset price is $\mathbb{S}120,  $ ,  will it be optimal to exercise the option. That is,  at the end of the second period,  the call option is worth $\$ 20$ when the asset price is $\S\,   120$ and is worthless for the other states where the asset price is $\$ 50$ and $\$ 30$ .

Now that we know the values of the option for each of the states at the end of the second period,  we work back and compute the value of the option at the end of the first period. The case where the asset price at the end of the first period is $\$ 80,  $ ,  with the two possible payoffs of $\$ 120$ and $\$ 50,  $ ,  should be familiar since it is the exact binomial tree we solved earlier. Thus,  the value of the option is $\$ 9.25\$ at the end of the first period where the asset price is $\$ 80$ .

In the case where the asset price drops to $\$ 40$ at the end of the first period,  this is easy to solve since neither asset price in the second period exceeds $\$ 100$ as they are $\$ 30$ and $\$ 50$ ,  respectively. Thus,  with the asset price of $\$ 40,  $ ,  a call option with a strike price of $\S\,   100$ would have zero value since there is zero probability that the ending asset price would exceed $\S\,   100$ .

Now that we know the value of the call option in either state of the world at the end of the first period,  we can work backward and determine the current value of the call option.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/bf9577923964c6e1d51f625dec2483368f8be0695978f7eb3dfda5d1eef2fc0c.jpg)

Thus,  the initial value of the call option is $\$ 5.07$ given the exercise price of $\S\,   100$ and the current asset price of $\$ 60$ . Note how the $\Delta$ changes from the first period to the second period if the asset price increases to $\$ 80,  $ ,  that is,  the $\Delta$ increases from 0.23 to 0.29. Thus,  we will rehedge our position at each period as the risk changes,  and at the limit,  this is referred to as dynamic hedging.

The purpose of showing the two-period example is to illustrate that the math employed is identical to that of the one-period example,  just employed more times. And to make the binomial model realistic,  we increase the number of periods and thus let the time between each period be very close,  for example,  each period could be one nanosecond. As the number of periods near infinity,  the binomial option model approaches the Black-Scholes-Merton model which we consider next.

# THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON OPTION PRICING MODEL

A bit of history is important to understand the timing of the incredible breakthrough by Black-Scholes Merton in developing the option pricing model. Fischer Black began work as a consultant at Arthur D. Little,  Inc. In Boston and was influenced by another consultant,  Jack Treynor,  who is known as one of the developers of the CAPM. They both worked in the Operations Research group. Though trained as a

mathematician,  Black had a strong interest in finance and economics and began to study the CAPM and other financial models. He attempted to use the CAPM to price securities other than stocks and began to focus on the valuation of warrants in 1968. Black recognized fairly quickly that one could n’t use the CAPM to price warrants as the discount rate changes dynamically due to the non-stop change in the riskiness of warrants as stock prices changes and as time passes by. Thus,  Black took the novel step of attempting to price a warrant where its price depended on the underlying stock price and a host of other factors. He used the CAPM to account for every moment in the warrant’s life,  reflecting every possible stock price,  etc. The result was a differential equation with just one solution. However,  Black was unable to solve the equation to obtain the solution and quit working on it,  but he did recognize,  and importantly,  that the warrant value did not depend on the expected return of the stock,  instead it depended on the total risk,  i.e.,  volatility of the underlying stock.

After receiving his Ph. D. From Chicago Booth,  Scholes took a job as Assistant Professor at MIT and reached out to Black who was nearby at Arthur D. Little. It was pointed out to them that their differential equation can be written in the form of the famous heat equation which high-level math students are familiar. As Black hadn’t focused on differential equations while pursuing his Ph. D. In Math at Harvard,  he wasn’t aware of the heat equation at the time. But once they became aware of this,  Black and Scholes were able to model the Black-Scholes equation in the form of a heat equation,  and they had their answer which Black had given up on earlier in his attempt to value a warrant. Meanwhile,  Robert Merton was working independently on the same problem and derived roughly the same answer but doing so outside of a CAPM model. Black and Scholes had a difficult time in publishing their paper as it was rejected by a few academic journals and it wasn’t until Gene Fama and Merton Miller intervened and told the Journal of Political Economy that it should give another look at the paper and then it was finally accepted for publication.

Going back to the binomial model,  if you let the time period collapse to zero and thus have an infinite number of periods,  the binomial option pricing model in effect becomes the Black Scholes model,  though they didn’t derive it that way as the binomial model didn’t come along until 1979.

Rather than perform any derivations,  and since we went step by step in the binomial option pricing model to obtain the insight,  below we show the solution to the differential equation which Fisher had difficulties in solving years ago:

$$
\mathsf{C}=\mathsf{S N}(\mathsf{d}1)-\mathsf{p v}(\mathsf{K})\mathsf{N}(\mathsf{d}\mathcal{2})
$$  

In plain English,  this solution states that the value of a call option,  C,  is equal to the value of the underlying stock price,  S,  multiplied by a delta,  N (d 1),  minus the present value of a risk-free bond that pays the exercise price,  $\mathsf{K},  $ on the call option ’s maturity date ,  multiplied by a delta,  N (d 2). Conceptually,  this is what we saw with valuing call options with replicating portfolios in the binomial option pricing model. We found the value of a call option was equivalent to the cost of a replicating portfolio which purchased some amount of shares based on the $\Delta,  $ delta,  using borrowed funds,  that is,  -B. All this formula is saying is that you can replicate an investment in a call option via a levered investment in the underlying stock.

The terms ${\mathsf{N}}({\mathsf{d}}\,  \rlap{/}\gamma)$ and N (d 2) require further explanation. First,  the function $\mathsf{N}(d\!\!\!\!/)$ is the cumulative [[Lecture 1- Probability Distributions of Returns|probability distribution]] function for a variable with a normal distribution which many of you have

learned at various times in math and statistics classes. It is the probability that a normally distributed variable will be less than d.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/fe3be2c975992df909c1ff4bd0d15e53cc50c6b9bf3b069cab5b8ae13c85bd4b.jpg)

$$
\mathsf{d}_{1}=\frac{\mathsf{I n}\left[\frac{\mathsf{S}}{\mathsf{p v}\big (\mathsf{K}\big)}\right]}{\mathsf{S}\,  \sqrt{\mathsf{T}}}+\frac{\mathsf{S}\,  \sqrt{\mathsf{T}}}{2}
$$  

$$
{\mathsf{d}}2={\mathsf{d}}1\ \overline {{\cdot\,  \circ\ {\mathsf{v}} \,  {\mathsf{T}}}}
$$  

The important takeaways from the Black-Scholes equations are that the value of a call option increases with the stock price and decreases with the exercise price as expected. And it increases with the time to maturity and the assumed volatility. As indicated earlier,  the binomial model has discrete time steps but as each period becomes shorter and shorter,  the time steps approach continuous time and the distribution approximates the well-known normal distribution. The value drivers are the same for BlackScholes as for the binomial model and the vastly important principle of replicating portfolios applies to both in the same way,  that is,  the replicating portfolio is created by buying a certain number of shares using borrowed funds,  that is,  it is self-financing.

# REAL OPTIONS

Many projects and real investments have options embedded in them and thus traditional discounted cash flow analysis will underestimate the value of the project. Examples of these real options include the following:

(1) Expand into new products or markets at later stages of the project based on initial success. (2) Terminate projects or reduce exposure if initial results are unfavorable. (3) Delay implementation of the investment. (4) Adjust the type of production as input prices change during the life of the project.

The value of a real option is that as managers we can learn from what is going on as we begin to undertake the project or are actually in the midst of the project,  and based on this learning,  we can adjust the investment to increase the expected profitability or to decrease the expected losses. Put differently,  the traditional discounted cash flow methodology is static,  yet we operate in a dynamic world and thus need to be equipped as situations evolve and impact the overall project value.

It is relatively straightforward to identify when a project has an embedded real option and there are three basic conditions which must be met:

(1) There has to be an underlying project whose value is subject to change through time due to the realization of various outcomes over the life of the project. (2) The real option has to have a contingent-like payoff dependent on a certain event occurring. That is,  the real option has to look like a regular financial option which we are familiar.

(3) There has to be some exclusivity on the option; otherwise,  it is simply an opportunity and doesn’t have real economic value.

# ILLUSTRATIONS OF REAL OPTIONS

Below,  we provide two illustrations of real options. The first illustration involves Scroll Motion,  a digital marketing services firm which assists corporations in developing interactive sales presentations. Scroll Motion is contemplating a major shift in strategy where it will transition from a services-based operating model to a subscriber-based platform which allows the end-user to develop the interactive sales presentations internally. The issue is whether Scroll Motion should move forward on the major strategy shift even though the NPV appears to be negative. Does moving forward on the -NPV project allow Scroll Motion to subsequently expand and create shareholder wealth? The second illustration is about Fresh Direct,  an online food grocer which has recently built a new operating plant. In this illustration,  the focus is on the abandonment value of the new plant in the state of the world where it performs well below expectations.

# Strategy Shift at Scroll Motion

Background

Scroll Motion was launched in 2008 to assist major corporations,  especially in publishing,  to take their print content to the interactive touch format on tablets,  etc. Over the next few years,  Scroll Motion consulted for numerous large corporations in their transition to using mobile devices in their outreach to customers. While Scroll Motion was able to assist corporations in creating interactive presentations with the client needing an internal designer or developer,  the process was extremely time consuming and often required large teams of developers at Scroll Motion. In addition,  the marketing and sales outreach was also an arduous task as it was difficult to convince the client that it was worthwhile to make the switch given the lengthy process involved.

In 2016,  Scroll Motion was at a crossroads as the company had not grown nearly as quickly as its venture capital backers had expected. As a result,  Scroll Motion’s valuation plummeted and existing investors were hesitant to continue funding,  not because the firm had no promise,  rather because the existing business model did not turn out as planned.

A new investor group emerged,  and along with some of the existing investors,  the new mindset was to radically alter the firm such it would transition from a services firm to a SaaS subscription-model based platform. Doing so would require a complete regutting of the entire business model from technology to its sales effort. In effect,  Scroll Motion would walk away from its services business and thus virtually eliminate its revenues for the next few years.

To implement the new direction Scroll Motion was taking,  the new investor group recognized a different type of managerial expertise would be required and brought in seasoned executives from Apple whom had been advocates of Scroll Motion. Not only had Scroll Motion been producing content for large corporations,  but it had also been building content for one of Apple’s mobility programs for small businesses.

This new direction required a complete revamp of ScrollM otion’s software that would be used to allow businesses to assemble and share authentic,  customized content for sales presentations,  portfolios,  digital collateral,  and advertising. This platform,  labeled Ingage,  would allow users to assemble content,  with the aid of their companyapproved libraries,  and then generate their sales presentations. Importantly,  whereas Scroll Motion initially focused on the tablet,  Ingage would also transition beyond the iPad or iPhone with touch-screen interface to desktop and laptop computers with keyboards.

Scroll Motion estimates the transition and redevelopment to Ingage will cost $\$ 60$ million to develop and it has a present value of $\$ 40$ million. Thus,  Ingage has a NPV of - $\cdot\$ 20$ million and viewed in isolation,  it should not be developed. But by developing Ingage,  Scroll motion will have the option to create IngagePlus for the masses which will require extremely limited knowledge of technology by the end user in their own creation of marketing content on social media. Ingage Plus will require a substantially larger investment than Ingage due to creating an infrastructure that virtually builds the content for even the most inexperienced user. For example,  one of the intended features of Ingage Plus is that it will convert a basic PowerPoint presentation to an interactive format,  with rudimentary assistance from the client. Based on Scroll motion’s current assessment,  Ingage Plus will cost $\$ 200$ million to develop and it has a NPV of roughly - $\cdot\$ 50$ million.

The valuation metrics for Ingage and Ingage Plus are displayed below.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/93438237f33384077b4fd84120e95f9f1ce2ba951ec794efc0aa9c37af349657.jpg)

Based on the above NPV estimates,  Scroll Motion will reject both projects. But,  in the course of developing Ingage and assessing the customer response thereof,  management will amass valuable information which will likely influence its decision to go forward or not with Ingage Plus. By considering only the expected cash flows and then discounting back to the current,  management should pass on Ingage and by definition,  on Ingage Plus as well,  since to invest in Ingage Plus,  Scroll motion must first develop Ingage. While Ingage Plus looks like a bad investment today,  this does not have to be the case if we are able to value the real option of Ingage Plus by investing in Ingage today.

Real Option Analysis of Ingage Plus

To examine the real option value of Ingage Plus to Scroll Motion,  we can create a framework just like that of analyzing financial options as described earlier. First,  it is important that the project looks like a financial

Option,  that is,  there must be a non-linear contingent payoff. In the case of Ingage Plus,  the cash flow estimates as provided above assume that Ingage has been completely developed. Put differently,  one could immediately develop Ingage Plus without developing Ingage first,  but the cost would be substantially higher and thus the NPV even more negative. Thus,  as set up,  the Ingage Plus cash flows are contingent on the prior development of Ingage.

Recall that the following inputs are necessary to value an option: (1) asset price,  (2) strike price,  (3) volatility,  (4) time to maturity,  and (5) interest rate. The asset price is given as the sum of the expected discounted cash flows of the Ingage Plus project which is $\$ 150$ million. The strike price is the $\$ 200$ million upfront cost of undertaking the Ingage Plus project. We can think of this as an out-of-the-money call option where the strike price is higher than the underlying security price. From a corporate finance perspective,  we can think of a -NPV project as being out of the money. Likewise,  a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ project can be viewed as in-the-money option. Importantly,  as we show below,  out-of-the-money options have value,  just not as much as in-the-money options,  holding everything else constant.

We view risk as a negative feature in valuing a project,  specifically its systematic risk. But with real options,  there is an upside feature to risk in that uncertainty can be a driver of value,  assuming of course that management is prepared to act opportunistic ally and take advantage of the uncertainty associated with a project. Ideally,  we know the volatiliy associated with the project. And as with financial options,  we have to estimate the forward-looking volatility as we never know the actual volatility in advance.

For the purposes of this illustration,  we will not go into great detail with respect to estimating volatility estimates for Ingage Plus. But conceptually we can employ estimates from publicly-traded firms which are equivalent twins to Ingage Plus. Since there is no pure twin to Ingage Plus,  a reasonable choice would be to estimate standard deviations of stock returns from small single-product software development corporations. Assume this estimate is $75\%$ which we will employ here. Alternatively,  we could estimate the standard deviation from running Monte Carlo simulations of the various outcomes for Ingage Plus,  but this is beyond the scope of this course.

The time to maturity assumes that Scroll Motion has only two years to commence the development of Ingage Plus in case either Ingage is a success or if positive information arrives indicating that Ingage Plus becomes a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ investment. Lastly,  assume the risk-free rate is $3\%$ .

The five inputs are summarized below:

1. Asset Price: present value of Ingage ${\sf P I u s}=\oint_{}^{}150$ million 2. Strike Price: cost of Ingage $\mathsf{P l u s}=\mathopen{}\mathclose\bgroup\left.\mathclose\bgroup\left.\!\!\mathfrak{L}200\aftergroup\egroup\right.$ million 3. σ : standard deviation of Ingage Plus: $75\%$ annual 4. T: time to maturity $=2$ years 5. RF: interest rate $=3\%$

Using the above assumptions in a calculator of the Black-Scholes option pricing model,  the value of the

Real option to invest in Ingage Plus is worth $\$ 50.6$ million. Without considering this option value,  Scroll motion management would be advised to reject the investment in Ingage as it yields negative NPV of - $\cdot\$ 20$ million. And despite the case that Ingage Plus also have a negative NPV,  - $\cdot\$ 50$ million,  at the current time,  it has substantial option value such that the overall investment today of $\$ 60$ million in Ingage has an adjusted NPV of $\$ 30.6$ million. That is,

Ingage Adjusted NPV $=$ Ingage NPV $^+$ Ingage Plus Real Option \$30.6 million $=$ -\$20.0 million $+~\$ 50.6$ million

As shown above,  the extremely high level of uncertainty about Ingage Plus generates substantial option value with respect to investing in Ingage,  despite the case that Ingage appears to be a value-destroying investment,  and even Ingage Plus in isolation also appears to destroy value.

I wrote the above synopsis for the Spring Quarter 2019 class in Corporate Finance. As expected Ingage was horribly -NPV,  far worse than expected. On the positive side,  it did generate massive tax-loss carry forwards due to a recapitalization which wiped out all the junior security holders!! The investors moved forward on Ingage Plus. By March 2020,  Ingage Plus was also heading into the bad state of the world despite having built incredible software which sales managers loved. The sales team was experiencing traction at various conferences,  but the growth was slower than expected. And with COVID-19,  the concern was that in light of the shutdown of the physical conferences,  Ingage Plus had no chance to grow and reduce its massive cash burn. But given that the sales personnel of its potential customers were also unable to travel,  this actually created an extraordinary demand for the product and as of early 2023,  Scroll Motion is on its way to profitability despite numerous setbacks. Had COVID-19 not occurred,  it is likely that investor fatigue would have forced a sale at a price way below the expected valuation.

# Plant Expansion at Fresh Direct

# Background

Fresh Direct,  an online grocer founded in 1999 in New York City,  was profitable during 2011 to 2017. It is the largest online grocer in New York City with more than $50\%$ of the market share. With expected revenue of about $\$ 800$ million in 2018,  Fresh Direct had grown beyond its capacity in the Long Island City plant just across the East River from Manhattan. In July 2018,  Fresh Direct opened a 650,  000 square foot facility in the South Bronx which allows it to double the overall size of the business. The new state-of-the art facility has it all with robotic pick towers,  smart routing technologies and nine miles of conveyor belts.

Assume that when the new Bronx plant goes into production,  the incremental value to Fresh Direct is $\S\,   100$ million. Beyond the typical systematic risk of operating an online grocery,  there is the idiosyncratic risk that the plant may not live up to expectations. To simplify,  assume that the plant will either work as intended or it will be an absolute failure. If the new plant works as intended,  the value at the end of the year will be $\$ 125$ million,  that is,  the incremental value of the Bronx plant versus the old facility in Long Island City. But there is a low likelihood that the design and configuration of the new plant will render it to have only $\$ 20$ million incremental value relative to the old facility,  even after reconfiguration s to improve the overall facility. In case the new Bronx plant is a complete failure,  Fresh Direct will have the option to sell it at the end of the year for $\$ 50$ million (the $\$ 50$ million is net of the cost of reopening the old facility in Long Island City) to a beer distributor.

Analysis

The ability of Fresh Direct to sell the new plant at the end of the year for $\$ 50$ million in case it doesn’t work as intended can be modelled as a real option. That is,  the right for Fresh Direct to sell the plant has real value which we can refer to as abandonment value or disposal value. In financial derivative terms,  it can be likened to a put option.

To facilitate our understanding of the treatment of the plant abandonment as a put option,  all of the various assumptions are simplified. For example,  only one period is specified. Likewise only two outcomes are specified,  the most likely outcome and the disaster state in which Fresh Direct would sell the facility. We can use the binomial option pricing model described earlier to value the abandonment option of Fresh Direct’s Bronx facility. The information as provided can be summarized on the binomial tree below which provides the timeline and possible outcomes.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/a8f069badf5c096cd5b57d4c6aec8d3c1762f9f8fda344426ab8951254906f2a.jpg)

As shown in the above timeline,  the incremental value of the Bronx plant just before it opens for business is $\S\,   100$ million. Assuming that all goes well,  the facility’s incremental value will increase to $\S\,   125$ million at the end of the period and will be $\$ 20$ million otherwise. Obviously,  if the plant operates as expected,  Fresh Direct will not consider disposing of the plant at year end. But in the low likelihood that disaster strikes,  and it is not efficient to reconfigure the plant,  Fresh Direct will exercise its option to dispose of the plant,  that is,  sell the plant to the beer distributor.

Now that we know the payoff to the abandonment option in both states of the world,  that is,  $\$ 0$ and $\$ 30$ million,  the next step is to create a portfolio of the underlying plant and a risk-free bond which will exactly match the payoffs to the abandonment option in both states of the world. Assume a risk-free rate of $5\%,  $ ,  and we will follow the same steps as we did for the pricing of the call option in the one-period binomial model illustrated earlier in this lecture note.

In the likely state of the world where the Bronx plant performs as intended,  the replicating portfolio is:

$$
\$ 125\:\mathsf{D}+1.05\:\mathsf{B}=\$ 0
$$  

The replicating portfolio in Eq. 25 of the underlying Bronx plant and a risk-free bond gives the same payoff of $\$ 0$ for the abandonment option in the outcome where the plant performs as intended. In the Bronx plant failure state of the world,  the replicating portfolio is:

$$
\$ 20\;\mathsf{D}+1.05\;\mathsf{B}=\$ 30
$$  

By subtracting Eq. 26 from Eq. 25 ,  we can solve for the two unknowns,  $\Delta$ and $B.$ The solution for $\Delta$ is - 0.2857 and the solution for $\boldsymbol{B}$ is $\$ 34.01$ . This solution shows that to replicate the payoff of the put,  the replicating portfolio is short -0.2857 of the asset (underlying plant) and has $\$ 34.01$ million invested in the risk-free security. The value of the abandonment put must equal the value of this replicating portfolio. At the current period,  the value of the replicating portfolio is:

$$
\mathfrak{F}5.44=100 (-0.2857)+34.01
$$  

Since the replicating portfolio,  in theory,  exactly replicates the payoff outcomes to the abandonment option,  then due to the law of one price,  the value of the abandonment option is also $\$ 5.44$ million. Whereas we solved above using the two simultaneous equations,  alternatively,  we could have used the general equations ( Equations 18-20 ) to solv e for $\Delta$ and $B.$

$$
\mathsf{D}=\frac{\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{U}}\cdot\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{D}}}{\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{U}}\cdot\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{D}}}=\frac{0\;\cdot\; 30}{125\;\cdot\; 20}=\;-0.2857
$$  

$$
\mathsf{B}\,  =\,  \frac{\mathsf{P}_{\mathsf{D}}\cdot\mathsf{A}_{\mathsf{D}}\mathsf{D}}{1+\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{F}}}\,  =\,  \frac{30\,  \mathrm{~\textbar{~}}20\;(\cdot 0.2857)}{1.05}\,  =\,   34.01
$$  

There are several important points to note about the above example. The conceptual point is that the option to abandon a project will increase the overall value of the project. Static DCF analysis doesn’t allow for this optional it y. We were able to calculate the value of the abandonment option without knowing the discount rate for the calculation of the Bronx plant or the associated probabilities with the two possible outcomes. Rather,  those estimates are reflected in the underlying $\$ 100$ million value of the plant.

The Fresh Direct example assumed only a single period rather than multi-periods as the case in the real world. But the objective is simply to convey how to think of a real option and the underlying calculations thereof. Add real-world time steps certainly would yield a more accurate measure of the value,  but not deliver additional basic concepts. Lastly,  our analysis assumes that we could have created a replicating portfolio,  that is,  via shorting the Bronx plant. But this is not a realistic assumption at all,  moreover,  it is not realistic to assume that one could locate a twin plant to short. Rather,  our objective is simply to

Conceptually illustrate real options and the framework by which to analyze.

I wrote the Fresh Direct synopsis during the Spring Quarter 2018 for 35200. When I wrote the synopsis,  I did so merely as an exercise as opposed to thinking that the Bronx plant might not work out as intended. The actual outcome was a complete disaster. When the plant opened in the summer of 2018,  Fresh Direct simultaneously shut down its existing plant in Long Island City. The expectation of the new plan was $50\%$ increased capacity and a substantial reduction in expenses per ticket item,  thus would be strongly accretive to existing positive cash flows.

The plant failed to work as intended. The technology platform for Fresh Direct’s pick -and-packing functions was unable to correctly connect with the customer-facing software. The customer would order bacon and would receive broccoli. Literally none of the orders worked as intended,  and due to the massive returns,  Fresh Direct was losing large sums of money on each order and the cumulative losses put the firm in a massive liquidity crunch. The existing investors,  led by the Ackerman family and JP Morgan,  were forced to make two sizeable equity contributions to weather the technology disruption,  but it wasn’t enough. Attempts to sell to Amazon and Walmart were fruitless,  despite both firms making substantial offers to buy Fresh Direct well before the new plant becoming operational.

Even a year after opening,  the plant still wasn’t functional,  and the existing investors capitulated and walked away. New investors provided senior funding,  in effect,  a prepackaged bankruptcy. Shortly after the original investors stepped aside,  COVID-19 hit around the time that the company was able to solve the technology issues and recovery was fairly immediate due to the extraordinary demand coupled with the new plant finally working as intended. Soon after,  in November 2020,  Ahold Delhaize and Center bridge Partners announced the purchase of Fresh Direct at several times what the recent investors had put in the company.

In the two above illustrations,  we focused on the option to expand and on the option to abandon. We evaluated the expansion option via Black-Scholes and the abandonment option via the Binomial Option Pricing Model. Recall that in the introduction to this lecture note,  we considered the option to delay an investment,  that is the Bang Bang investment,  but we modeled via only a decision tree and didn’t calculate option values per a formal option framework.

Investors must be compensated to bear risk,  specifically systematic risk as one can easily diversify away idiosyncratic risk. But when one accounts for real options,  that is the ability to adjust a project as learning occurs,  then risk is actually a benefit,  specifically the idiosyncratic risk is a benefit and the higher th e risk the more valuable the option. Just like with a financial option,  a real option gives management the right to change or alter an investment,  but not the obligation. For example,  if the cash flow forecast for an investment is all over the board,  this level of uncertainty can actually give value due to the option to delay the investment for instance.

Based on recent surveys,  roughly $30\%$ of large corporations state they employ real options in their valuation of projects. These users tend to be industry specific,  for example,  drug companies looking to invest in R&D and oil companies deciding when to drill. Moreover,  they may largely use the framework to help them in recognizing the option,  etc.,  without drilling too deep into the black box as the assumptions can become overwhelming. Rather,  when it comes to real options,  the first order effect is to recognize the real option and be able to understand the factors which influence the option value. But knowing the

# REAL OPTIONS AND FIRM VALUATIONS

This lecture note has focused on how optional it y increases the value of a project. The optional it y is multifaceted,  as it can be to expand,  delay,  terminate or otherwise alter the project. This section provides a brief overview of how to think about real options in the context of the overall valuation of corporations.

# VALUE and GROWTH

This overview examines two fictional firms,  VALUE and GROWTH,  to illustrate the concept of real options in the context of a f irm’s value. From an asset pricing or investments perspective,  value stocks are viewed as stocks which tend to trade at low prices relative to fundamentals such as dividends,  cash flow,  or earnings. Growth stocks are stocks which have high earnings potential. Some commentators claim that value stocks tend to be cheap and growth stocks the opposite. Below,  we frame VALUE and GROWTH firms from a corporate finance perspective and afterwards connect to their meaning with respect to asset pricing or investments.

Consider a firm,  VALUE,  with assets-in-place,  that is,  an operating plant,  sales force,  etc. To simplify,  assume VALUE has constant and perpetual expected cash flows of $\$ 100$ million annually,  and distributes all cash flows to the shareholders via dividen ds and share repurchase s. Assume VALUE has just distributed last year’s cash flow to its shareholders. The cost of capital for VALUE is $8\%$ .

Given the above assumptions,  the value of VALUE’s assets -in-place is:

$$
\L_{\L}\$ 1.25\mathrm{\bilde{u}l i o n=\frac{\$ 100\mathrm{\milde{u}l i o n}}{0.08}}
$$  

As shown below,  VALUE’s assets -in-place a re displayed on VALUE’s balance sheet. Assume that VALUE has no other assets.

VALUE: Market-Value Balance Sheet

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e0a06cb75aa9fb7668e0f9e6d899f90d9930d58aafce30308052d7f253a7ccac.jpg)

Insufficient information has been provided to indicate whether or not management of VALUE has created shareholder wealth. That is,  VALUE may have undertaken strictly $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects,  strictly – NPV projects,  or a combination of positive and negative NPV projects which resulted in the $\$ 1.25$ billion value of the assets-inplace.

GROWTH also has assets-in-place valued at $\$ 1.25$ billion,  the same as VALUE. But GROWTH has market equity of $\$ 1.8$ billion rather than $\$ 1.05$ billion. We can label the difference of $\$ 750$ million as PVGO (present value of growth options). The balance sheet of GROWTH is shown below.

GROWTH: Market-Value Balance Sheet

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f3b448505c87389119b3c31f35a15273f3bca6ab11186da0110138d78241747c.jpg)

As mentioned above with respect to VALUE,  we have not provided sufficient information to assess whether management created shareholder value regarding the assets-in-place. The focus is to understand the logic behind the $\$ 750$ million estimate of growth options,  commonly referred to as PVGO. The $\$ 750$ million of PVGO reflects investors’ expectations today of NPVs associated with GROWTH future projects. Put differently,  investors expect that GROWTH management will undertake new projects which generate a return in excess of the respective cost of capital of such projects. Importantly,  the estimate simply captures the NPV part of the expected future projects,  not the total expected value. For example,  suppose investors expect GROWTH to invest in numerous future projects,  but these projects will generate zero NPV in aggregate,  that is,  the return will simply equal the cost of capital. In this case,  the value of PVGO is zero and GROWTH has the same value as VALUE.

# Adobe Inc. Versus Kroger

Adobe Inc. (previously known as Adobe Systems) is a large computer software firm which has been widely known for Photoshop (introduced in 1989) and PDF (introduced in 1993). We can think of Photoshop,  PDF,  and other well-known products such as Adobe Reader and Adobe Creative Suite,  as representation of Adobe’s assets -in-place. In 2018,  Adobe generated roughly $\$ 3$ billion in cash flow. Think of these cash flows as generated by Adobe’s current assets -in-place. Using a cost of capital of $10.8\%$ and assuming perpetual cash flows with zero growth,  the value of Adobe’s assets -in-place is:

$$
\S\,   27.8\,  \mathsf{b i l i o n}=\frac{\$ 3\,  \mathsf{b i l i o n}}{0.108}
$$  

And if we assume that Adobe’s existing assets -in-place are sufficient to generate cash flows which grow at a rate of $3.0\%$ annual into perpetuity,  the value of the assets-in-place increase to:

$$
\S\,   38.5\,  \mathsf{b i l i o n}=\frac{\$ 3\,  \mathsf{b i l i o n}}{0.108\cdot 0.03}
$$  

In both cases,  the zero growth case and the $3\%$ annual growth case,  the value of the assets-in-place is less than half of the total enterprise value of Adobe Inc. As shown in the table below,  the implied value of Adobe’s PVGO is $\$ 92.2$ billion under the zero growth case . As noted earlier,  these estimates don’t reflect the future value of new assets and businesses created by Adobe,  rather these estimates reflect the NPV,  that is,  the expected value created,  via future investments.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/19c12509ed4c9563c34ff213e184da03400ba2ef3de0eabc7deb0da264214d54.jpg)

One can make the argument that the existing assets-in-place are worth more,  and thus the expected growth rate is far higher than assumed here. But it is practically impossible for static assets to perpetually grow at a rate which exceeds the overall economy growth. To grow at a higher rate requires subsequent CAPX,  which in turn reduces the corresponding near-term cash flows. In any event,  the subsequent CAPX in enhancing the assets-in-place would be reflective of the exercise of the growth options.

Kroger is the largest supermarket chain by revenue in the United States. Kroger operates 2,  765 supermarkets and multi-department stores. Kroger supplies its supermarkets via 38 food processing and manufacturing facilities. Kroger is subject to intense competition from other large supermarket chains,  independent grocery stores,  Walmart which carries grocery products within its hypermarket s,  online grocers,  restaurants and restaurant delivery,  etc.

In 2018,  Kroger generated roughly $\$ 4.0$ billion in cash from its assets-in-place. Using a cost of capital of

  $8.5\%$ and perpetual zerogrowth cash flows,  the estimated value of Kroger’s assets -in-place is $\$ 47.1$ billion:

$$
\S\,   47.1\;\tt b i l l i o n=\frac{\$ 4.0\;\tt b i l l i o n}{0.085}
$$  

And if we assumed a positive growth rate,  the estimated value of Kroger’s assets -in-place would be even higher. However,  the overall enterprise market value of Kroger is $\S 37.0$ billion,  roughly $\S 10.1$ billion less than the estimated value of the assets-in-place. At first glance,  one might conclude that the market is undervaluing Kroger given its market enterprise value is less than that of its assets-in-place. But that is not the point of this exercise. Indeed,  the most likely explanation is that the cash flows generated by the assets in place are expected to decline over time,  rather than stay constant as assumed above. Another possibility is that the cost of capital is much higher than $8.5\%$ which also results in a lower valuation of the assets of place.

Notwithstanding any adjustments,  large or small,  to the various assumptions,  it is clear that Adobe derives the majority of its market value from the expected NPV of future real options,  whereas Kroger derives its value from existing assets-in-place. From an investments framework,  an analyst may view Adobe as a rich security since it has an Enterprise Value / Cash Flow multiple of 40.0 versus a multiple of less than 10.0 with respect to Kroger. Indeed,  cash flow multiples are one of the benchmarks used to distinguish value stocks from growth stocks. But from our corporate finance perspective,  we are not making a judgement call on cheapness or richness,  rather that Kroger’s value simply derives from its assets -inplace and Adobe’s value derives from expected profits of new ventures.

# Introduction to Capital Structure: M&M Propositions

“My equity investors expect me to generate returns in the high teens and are very demanding especially during quarterly calls. But I can go out and raise debt and pay only a $\pmb{5.5\%}$ coupon. Thus,  debt financing is far cheaper than equity.”

# INTRODUCTION

Analysts value firms by largely focusing on the assets and projects on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. The value of a project is the sum of the project’s expected future cash flows discounted at the project’s cost of capital. For a firm with multiple projects,  the overall firm value is equal to the sum of the value of all projects,  other assets including excess cash,  plus growth options not associated with the projects.

A common assumption,  at least for many corporate finance textbooks is that management can quickly raise funds for projects expected to yield $+\mathsf{N P V},  $ that is,  create shareholder wealth. As long as the project is expected to generate positive $+\mathsf{N P V}$ ,  financing is readily available even if positive cash flows are not likely to accrue for several years. Notwithstanding this assumption,  it is useful to build a framework by which to understand the financing of corporations. In simplest terms,  the corporation issues debt (bank loans or bonds) and equity (various types of stock) to investors. In return,  these investors have a claim on the assets of the firm,  namely a claim to the expected future cash flows. In the case of an all-equity firm,  all expected future cash flows belong to the shareholders. For firms with debt in addition to equity,  the debt holders are entitled to receive a fixed payout,  and the shareholders receive the residual cash flows.

The bifurcation of cash flows into straight debt and equity is obviously simplistic as corporations issue all types of securities. However,  this straightforward bifurcation allows for a solid understanding of real-world capital structure and paves the way for the subsequent discussion of complex securities.

Can management take advantage of financing opportunities and realize $+\mathsf{N P V}$ on the right-hand side of the balance sheet just like with real assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet? Suppose the cost of long-term debt financing at Procter & Gamble is $4.2\%$ and the cost of equity financing is $8.4\%$ . Is it possible for Procter & Gamble to lower its overall cost of capital,  thereby increase firm value,  by increasing its level of debt financing and simultaneously decreasing its equity financing? Or instead can Procter & Gamble create value by reducing the relative amount of debt financing since debt requires fixed and periodic payments to the debt holders whereas dividend payments to shareholders are not mandatory? Framed more generally,  what is the mix of debt and equity that produces the highest firm value? There are two primary questions. First,  as framed by the question above,  can management alter the firm’s cost of capital by merely rearranging the mix of debt and equity? Second,  what mix of debt and equity generates high operating efficiencies,  low bankruptcy costs,  minimal managerial malfeasance,  etc.? That is,  is there a debt/equity ratio that is optimal for creating value on the left-hand side of the balance?

# MODIGLIANI & MILLER

Consider the above mentioned Procter & Gamble,  a multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer products. Procter & Gamble has an equity market capitalization of $\S 360$ billion as of January 2023 and a book value of debt of $\S 33$ billion. The annual EBITDA for Procter & Gamble is roughly $\S 21.1$ billion,  and it incurs interest expense of around 450 million. Due to the low leverage and high-interest coverage,  Procter & Gamble has an investment grade credit rating of AAand minimal chance of bankruptcy. Prior to the era of modern corporate finance theory,  the prevailing wisdom was that since the likelihood of default was so low Procter & Gamble could simply tweak its capital structure just a bit by raising “ cheap debt ” $(4.2\%)$ and re purchasing “ expensive equity ” ( $8.4\%$ required return),  and create instant value as this slight adjustment would not impact the probability of financial distress. While this is not the prevailing wisdom today,  at least in academic circles,  it is still widely held by many practitioners and especially by corporate management.

In 1958,  the American Economic Review published the path-breaking paper by Modigliani and Miller entitled “The Cost of Capital,  Corporate Finance,  and the Theory of Investment.” 2 Modigliani and Miller proved that capital structure does not influence firm value. Essentially,  management’s decision on how to finance the firm is irrelevant. In other words,  a levered firm has the same value as an all-equity firm,  everything else the same. This paper ushered in the birth of modern corporate finance theory as we know it today.

Modigliani and Miller assume perfect capital markets,  that is,  a world absent of taxes,  information a symmetries,  transactions costs,  and other real-world market imperfections. Rather than assuming the future cash flows are known with certainty,  Modigliani and Miller assume expected future cash flows are risky and thus not known with certainty. This assumption of risky cash flows is a significant distinction as we will discuss further in this lecture note.

Rather than operate in an academic vacuum,  Modigliani and Miller recognize the importance of carefully identifying the assumptions,  as they allow us to consider the optimal debt/equity ratio in an environment free of market imperfections. Once we understand the capital structure implications in the world without frictions,  we can relax the restrictive assumptions and assess their impact on real-world capital structure and resulting firm value.

# PROPOSITION I

Consider two firms which are identical with one exception,  namely,  their capital structures are different. One firm,  ALLEQUITY,  has zero debt. The other firm,  LEVER,  has a capital structure composed of debt and equity. Imagine these two firms produce the same product,  employ the same quality of workers,  utilize the same technology,  and so forth. ALLEQUITY generates expected annual profits of $\S 50$ million with a $10\%$ cost of capital. It has just paid a dividend of $\S 50$ million reflecting the previous year’s profits. All of ALLEQUITY’ s assets in place are required to generate the expected annual profits of $\S 50$ million which are expected to remain constant forever. The value of ALLEQUITY can be represented as follows:

$$
\mathsf{V_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}=\mathsf{D_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}+\mathsf{E_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}=\mathsf{E_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{o r\S 500\m i l i o n}=\S 0+\S 500\m i l i o n^{3}
$$  

LEVER has $\S 250$ million in perpetual debentures which pays an annual coupon of $5.0\%$ . Given the condition stated above that LEVER is identical to ALLEQUITY other than the difference in capital structure,  LEVER also generates expected profits,  before interest,  of $\S 50$ million annually,  forever. And like ALLEQUITY,  LEVER will pay out all its profits after interest as dividends. The total firm value and equity value of LEVER is unknown:

$\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\mathsf{D}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}+\mathsf{E}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}$ $\mathsf{o r\,   V_{L E V E R}}=£ 250\;\mathsf{m i l l i o n+\,   E_{L E V E R}}$

Supppose an investor purchases $20\%$ of the shares in ALLEQUITY. What is their payoff?

Investment Strategy: Buy $\S\,   100$ million of stock in ALLEQUITY

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b22c66c09326912c411763e8c4bfc6fe3f3e5eb0203b113de27ad278edcb2227.jpg)

The $20\%$ ownership in ALLEQUITY entitles the investor to $20\%$ of the profits (note in this setting,  profits are equal to cash flows as there are no taxes,  no changes in net working capital,  no $\mathsf{C A P X},  $ etc.). At the end of each year,  the investor expects to receive $\S 10$ million in dividends. Suppose the investor chooses to replicate this payoff via purchasing securities in LEVER. Modigliani and Miller show that this can be accomplished by buying both debentures and stock in LEVER. In this particular example,  the investor will invest $\S 50$ million in LEVER debentures and also acquire $20\%$ of LEVER stock.

Replicating Strategy: Invest $\S 50$ million in LEVER debentures and $20\%$ of LEVER stock

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/a544690afd219213648811619c7803f0e8f09ab3062fc66b8e73b2277220948f.jpg)

The replicating strategy yields an identical payoff to the initial investment strategy. Both investment strategies return $20\%$ of total operating profits. The only difference is that in the replicating strategy,  the investor receives $\S 2.5$ million of interest and $\S 7.5$ million of expected dividends. Given this payoff is identical to the payoff of stock in ALLEQUITY,  it implies the cost of the replicating portfolio must be identical to the cost of the initial portfolio. Thus,  the investor pays $\S 50$ million for the $20\%$ of LEVER stock,  and hence the value of LEVER is:

V LEVER = \$500 million $=\S 250$ million $\mathsf{D}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}+\S 250$ million E LEVER

This proof is the foundation for Proposition I. Note that their proof was a formal mathematical proof as opposed to the numerical example as provided here.

Proposition I:

“…the market value of any firm is independent of its capital structure and is given by capitalizing its expected return at the rate appropriate to its class….. The average cost of capital to any firm is completely independent of its capital structure and is equal to the capitalization rate of a pure equity stream of its class.”

But what if Proposition I does not hold? Suppose for example the value of LEVER is equal to $\S 450$ million rather than to $\S 500$ million. This would imply:

V LEVER = \$450 million $=\P 250$ million D LEVER $\mathbf{\varepsilon}+£ 200$ million E LEVER

That is,  the value of the debt remains at $\S 250$ million,  but the equity value is $\S 200$ million rather than $\S 250$ million. An arb it rage ur will immediately purchase $20\%$ of D LEVER for $\S 50$ million as above and purchase $20\%$ of E LEVER for $\S 40$ million. As indicated above,  these purchases entitle the arb it rage ur to receive the same payoff as above,  namely $\S 2.5$ million of interest and $\S 7.5$ million of dividends. Moreover,  the arb it rage ur will also have the excess $\S 10$ million to invest elsewhere. Arb it rage urs will buy LEVER,  and short sell ALLEQUITY,  until LEVER had a value equivalent to ALLEQUITY,  consistent with the law of one price,  namely,  two assets must have the same price if they yield identical risks and payoffs. If their prices are different,  then the arb it rage ur can make a risk-free profit,  and importantly in companies which generate risky cash flows. This arbitrage proof paved the way for researchers to set up arbitrage conditions in many other areas of finance,  notably option pricing for instance in which the same principles are applied.

As described above,  the investor purchases stock in ALLEQUITY and then creates a replicating portfolio with a purchase of both debentures and stock in LEVER. Alternatively,  the investor can purchase shares in LEVER and then create a replicating portfolio via purchasing shares in ALLEQUITY. Assume the investor purchases $20\%$ of the stock in LEVER. Further,  assume that the value of LEVER is given as:

V LEVER = \$500 million $=\P 250$ million D LEVER $\mathbf{\varepsilon}+\Updownarrow 250$ million E LEVER And further assume that the value of ALLEQUITY is unknown.

Investment Strategy: Invest $\S 50$ million of stock in LEVER

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/466a1bb824cbb0da11d455a95a641496be33fb5b47d1cccc0b372870799ffed0.jpg)

The expected operating profits of LEVER are $\S 50$ million,  the total interest payments are $\S 12.5$ million,  and the expected dividends are $\S 37.5$ million. Thus,  the $20\%$ investment in LEVER stock yield an expected $\S 7.5$ million annually in dividends to the investor. This investment can be replicated via a purchase of stock in ALLEQUITY. The investor can simply borrow an amount equal to $20\%$ of the debt in LEVER and use those proceeds to supplement a $20\%$ purchase of stock in ALLEQUITY.

Replicating Strategy: Borrow an amount equal to $20\%$ of the debt of LEVER and use to partially finance a $20\%$ purchase of ALLEQUITY

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8272526ceafd278e412eaeb4a8d8b2bf1915ccddc54d6d3bf15d9da1ccd818d1.jpg)

Thus,  the investor borrows $\S 50$ million and will use this $\S 50$ million,  along with non-borrowed funds,  to buy $20\%$ of ALLEQUITY. Given perfect capital markets,  the investor pays the same rate of interest,  $5\%,  $ ,  as would LEVER. At year-end,  the investor receives $\S 10$ million in dividends from her shares in ALLEQUITY and simultaneously pays $\S 2.5$ million in interest,  for a net payoff of $\S 7.5$ million. That is,  the replicating portfolio using borrowed funds to buy stock in ALLEQUITY yields an identical payoff to the purchase of stock in LEVER. It follows,  therefore,  that if the payoff is the same,  and the underlying riskiness of the asset cash flows are the same,  then the cost of the investments should be identical,  that is,  the investors pay $\S 100$ million for the $20\%$ share in ALLEQUITY stock. Thus,

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{A L L E Q U I T Y}}
$$  

Again,  the conclusion is the same. The value of a firm with debt is identical to an all-equity firm with the same structure of cash flows,  assuming perfect capital markets. Given investors can create replicating portfolios with identical payoffs,  the law of one price holds. If the firm values are different,  arb it rage urs instantaneously buy stock in one firm and short stock in the other firm to realize risk-free profits.

In proving that capital structure does not matter in perfect capital markets,  Modigliani and Miller built the foundation for modern corporate finance theory. As a result,  we now know that if capital structure impacts firm value,  it is due to the case that some of the assumptions in their model do not hold. Modigliani and Miller were also the first researchers to construct replicating portfolios with risky assets. You can think of their replication as that of static replicating portfolios as the replicating portfolio has the same cash flows as the underlying portfolio. Indeed,  the famous put-call parity relationship is just Proposition I of Modigliani and Miller. What followed was dynamic replication,  e.g.,  Black-Scholes option pricing where the replicating portfolio doesn’t have the same cash flows,  instead for very small changes in the parameters,  the price of the underlying asset and the replicating portfolio will change by the same amount (thus,  it has the same “greeks” at a specific point) .

Proposition II directly follows from Proposition I. As stated by Modigliani and Miller,  Proposition II:

“From Proposition I ,  we can derive the following proposition concerning the rate of return on common stock in companies whose capital structure includes some debt: the expected rate of return or yield $i,  $ on the stock of any company j belonging to the kth class is a linear function of leverage as follows:

$$
\mathsf{i}_{\mathrm{j}}\,  {=}\,  \mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{k}}\,  {+}\,  \left[\mathsf{p}_{\mathrm{k}}\,  {\-}\,  \mathsf{r}\right]\frac{\mathsf{D}_{\mathrm{j}}}{\mathsf{S}\mathrm{j}}
$$  

That is,  the expected yield of a share of stock is equal to the appropriate capitalization rate $\pmb{p_{k}}$ for a pure equity stream in the class,  plus a premium related to financial risk equal to debt-to-equity ratio times the spread between p k and r.”

To illustrate,  reconsider ALLEQUITY. The value of ALLEQUITY is $\S 500$ million. Assume management of ALLEQUITY chooses to substitute $\S 100$ million of debt,  at an interest rate of $5\%,  $ ,  for equity in its capital structure. As proved by Proposition I,  the enterprise value of ALLEQUITY,  newly named LEVER,  stays constant at $\S 500$ million. Proposition $\mathrm{II},  $ as shown above,  shows what happens to the expected return to equity as a result of the recapitalization. Table 1 illustrates the recapitalization.

Table 1

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b276beaa9095bd73921580ade4b6a23638fa942a25c3ab2517d12f780270468b.jpg)

Simultaneous with the new debt issuance of $\S\,   100$ million at a $5\%$ coupon rate,  ALLEQUITY repurchase s 5 million shares at the market share price of $\S 20$ . Per Proposition I,  firm value is invariant to changes in the capital structure and thus there is no change in the share price. Since the adjustment in the capital structure doesn’t influence the left -hand side of the balance sheet,  namely the assets of the firm,  the expected operating income remains constant at $\S 50$ million. Due to the interest payment of $\S 5$ million,  the equity earnings of LEVER are $\S 45$ million versus $\S 50$ million for ALLEQUITY and expected EPS increases from $\S 2.00$ to $\S 2.25$ . Whereas,  for ALLEQUITY,  the expected return on shares is:

\$50million ALLEQUITY Expected Return on Shares = 10.00% = \$500 million  

The expected return on shares for LEVER is:

\$45million LEVER Expected Return on Shares = 11.25% = \$400 million  

Thus,  the expected return on equity increases with an increase in the leverage ratio as indicated above by Proposition II. And we know from Proposition I that the average cost of capital of a firm is invariant to changes in the capital structure,  and thus can be given as:

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\!\left[\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\left[\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}\right]}\right]\,  +\,  \mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\!\left[\frac{\mathsf{E}}{\left[\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}\right]}\right]
$$  

As covered in Investments,  the expected return on a portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the expected returns on the various positions in the portfolio. And in the context of a firm,  the expected return to the firm is the weighted average of the expected return to the various securities of the firm,  and in the case of Eq. 4 ,  debt and equity. Solving Eq. 4 for the expected return to equity yields:

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}+\,  \left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}\cdot\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\right]\,  \frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{E}}
$$  

And with respect to the recapitalization illustration above:

$$
11.25\%=10.00\%+[10.00\%\cdot 5.00\%]\ \frac{100}{400}
$$  

Eq. 5 a yields the same answer for the expected return to equity as in Table 1 above. Thus,  as per the original quote from Modigliani and Miller,  Proposition II shows that the expected return to equity increases linearly with leverage. And as indicated earlier,  Modigliani and Miller assumed in their proofs of Proposition I and Proposition II that debt is risk-free,  hence the linear relation between the expected return to equity and increases in the debt-to-equity ratio. Given the firm value and the share price do not change and the expected return on equity increases,  then it follows of course that the equity risk increases commensurate with the increase in the expected return. Put differently which a firm increases its leverage,  this amplifies the volatility of the return stream to the equity holders,  who in turn,  demand a higher return to hold the shares.

As discussed in footnote 6,  Modigliani and Miller assumed that debt was risk-free. They did so primarily to sharpen the distinction between risky equity and risk-free debt,  but it did not drive the proofs. They were challenged in a big way in that an asset pricing model such as CAPM did not exist when they formalized their proofs which is all the more impressive. As there was no robust concept of a market risk premium,  Modigliani and Miller took the clever tack of assuming the two firms had the same business risk and thus in the same risk class.

Several years after the development of the CAPM,  Rubinstein (1973) merged the CAPM with the Modigliani and Miller capital structure propositions and importantly was able to allow for risky debt via the CAPM. Moreover,  where Modigliani and Miller generally assumed that the firms were in the same risk class,  Rubinstein replaced this notion with that of the firms having the same underlying asset beta. In effect,  Rubenstein was then able to prove the Modigliani and Miller theorems via a mean-variance framework,  namely that of the CAPM.

Conceptually,  when debt becomes risky,  it starts to bear systematic business risk,  that is,  the beta on corporate debt goes from zero to positive. Obviously,  firms with highly risky operations,  for example,  firms with large fixed costs in cyclical industries,  will have risky debt if their leverage ratios are sufficiently high. Thus,  as leverage causes the debt to become risky,  then debt holders will demand a higher return to compensate them for the added risk; namely they will demand a credit risk premium. Figure 2 below extends Figure 1 to include risky debt.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5e2aee5e1bde07eaebeab485eb575495e4314fe197d1a0d45da5644c9d69b3af.jpg)

For purposes of illustration only,  assume here that debt becomes risky once the proportion of debt in the capital structure exceeds $60\%$ . Thus,  as shown in Figure 2,  the expected return on debt is constant and riskfree when the proportion of debt in the firm is $60\%$ or less,  and the expected return on equity increases linearly with increasing leverage. But when the proportion of debt exceeds $60\%,  $ the required return on debt increases because the debt holders are not expected to be paid in full if a corporate default occurs. The expected return on equity continues to increase as its risk continues to increase with leverage rising because if default occurs,  the creditors receive payment before the shareholders receive their claims. But note that as the expected return on debt increases due to being subject to the overall business risk of the firm,  the equity risk begins to increase at a decreasing rate. Importantly,  while both the expected return on debt and equity are increasing,  the overall cost of capital remains fixed due to the relative proportion of the debt increasing and the relative proportion of the equity decreasing. At the limit,  that is where the firm is $100\%$ debt,  as in the case of a failure and the debt holders receive all of the future cash flows,  the expected return on debt becomes the overall cost of capital. Indeed the firm reverts to an all-equity capital structure. That is,  bankruptcy occurs,  but the formality of bankruptcy itself is not costly as all that happens is that the equity holders turn over the keys to the debt holders.

# Recap of Propositions I and II

Like many excellent academic papers,  the work of Modigliani and Miller was not instantly embraced,  instead met with a lot of criticism,  and if not criticism,  then considerable skepticism. The critics challenged the assumptions for being unrealistic and for the concept that arbitrage could work with risky assets. At the time,  interest rates were low and expected returns on equity were thought to be high such that there was a double-digit spread between expected equity returns and debt returns. The prevailing wisdom was that a firm with no or minimal debt could increase leverage a bit could automatically create value due to the expected return on equity not increasing as much as predicted by Modigliani and Miller. Moreover,  this belief was not simply based on the ability to deduct interest expenses with respect to taxes. Instead,  it was a view that management could somewhat create value on the right-hand side of the balance sheet via financial engineering. That is,  it was based on the understanding that a firm like Procter & Gamble with a strong Investment Grade bond rating and a low level of leverage can create shareholder value via a slight amount of additional leverage. But this understanding missed the point of Proposition II,  that is,  increases in leverage,  however slight,  result in high costs of equity capital.

Ex post,  the paper ended up resulting in not one,  but two separate Nobel Prizes,  Modigliani in 1985 and Miller in 1990,  as the paper created what today is known as modern corporate finance theory. The subsequent academic work has used Modigliani and Miller as the foundation of corporate finance and has focused empirically and theoretically on how capital structure impacted cash flows and investors’ expectations of cash flows based on the relaxation of the various assumptions underlying the theory.

# The Trade-Off Theory of Capital Structure

# RECAP OF MODIGLIANI & MILLER

Modigliani and Miller laid the groundwork for modern corporate finance theory in their capital structure propositions. They issued a steep challenge to the way that academics and practitioners thought about corporate finance and faced enormous skepticism and rebuttal initially,  but soon their invariance proposition became the cornerstone of corporate finance and set the stage for all future work. Modigliani and Miller debunked the prevailing notion that firms could arbitrage the spread between the cost of equity and the cost of debt by showing investors can accomplish the same outcome,  thereby eliminating such arbitrage by corporations. Importantly,  Modigliani and Miller did not operate in a vacuum; rather they were quite mindful of the restrictive assumptions they incorporated in deriving their propositions. The objective of the next few lecture notes is to isolate each of these assumptions and demonstrate how these assumptions substantive ly impact capital structure through time and across corporations.

# DEBT AND TAXES

The tax code of the United States imposes double taxation on corporations with one tax at the corporate level via the corporate income tax and a separate tax at the shareholder level via taxes on capital gains and dividends. Until the recent tax law of 2017 which decreased the federal corporate tax rate from $35\%$ to $21\%,  $ ,  the combined tax rate (federal and average state tax rate on corporations,  and federal and average state tax rate on individuals) was $56.6\%$ in the United States,  second highest in developed economies. With the recent tax law change,  the combined tax rate has declined to $42.6\%$ .

Modigliani and Miller assume no corporate income taxes in their proof that the cost of capital is invariant to the mix of debt and equity on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. However,  the U.S. tax system favors debt financing as the IRS handles interest to debt holders differently than it does dividends to shareholders. Specifically,  interest is a taxable expense for accounting purposes and thus entirely escapes corporate taxation as the debtholder is taxed only once. And as indicated above,  dividends are not a tax deductible expense. Many countries have integrated their corporate and individual tax codes to reduce the double tax on corporations via tax credits or exemptions on dividend income.

Consider the firm ALLEQUITY. For the current setting,  ALLEQUITY has zero debt,  expected annual pre-tax profits of $\S\,   100$ million in the current year,  perpetual growth rate of $4.5\%,  $ ,  and a cost of capital of $12\%$ . Assume a corporate tax rate of $25\%,  $ ,  reflecting the current-day combined federal and average state taxes. ALLEQUITY has just paid a dividend of $\S 75$ million reflec ting the previous year’s after -tax profits. To simplify,  assume the expected net income of $\S 75$ million is also equal to the expected cash flows for this year. The value of ALLEQUITY is:

$$
\mathsf{V_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}=\mathsf{D_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}+\mathsf{E_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}=\mathsf{E_{A L L E Q U I T Y}}
$$  

Or $\S 1$ billion $=\S 0\,  +\,  \S 1$ billion.

Assume ALLEQUITY intends to issue $\S 300$ million of perpetual new debt which pays an annual coupon of $6.0\%$ . ALLEQUITY intends to repurchase shares with the proceeds from the new debt,  and will change its name to LEVER. Since management is embarking solely on a financial restructuring,  there should be no impact on the left-hand side of the balance sheet,  that is,  the recapitalization should not impact the operating cash flows. The total firm value and equity value of LEVER is unknown:

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\mathsf{D}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}+\mathsf{E}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{o r\,   V_{L E V E R}}=£ 300\,  \mathsf{m i l l i o n+\,   E_{L E V E R}}
$$  

In the lecture note,  Introduction to Capital Structure,  ALLEQUITY and LEVER have identical firm values in perfect capital markets. That is,  the equity value and firm value of LEVER are $\S 700$ million and $\S 1$ billion,  respectively,  in perfect capital markets. However,  the presence of corporate taxes will result in higher cash flows to the combined debt holders and equity holders for a firm with debt relative to a comparable allequity firm as shown in Table 1.

Table 1

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c69a3c2ec2cd66e2cd92a634f1e484f70590dc350b35ec50c8ec6a6d44644c8f.jpg)

Due to the deduct i bil it y of interest from taxes at the corporate level,  LEVER pays $\S 20.5$ million in corporate taxes versus $\S 25.0$ million in corporate taxes for ALLEQUITY. While LEVER has a lower net income,  due to the interest expense,  of $\S 61.5$ million versus $\S 75.0$ million of net income for ALLEQUITY,  the total income available to equity holders and debt holders combined is $\S 79.5$ million at LEVER versus $\S 75.0$ million to the equity holders at ALLEQUITY.

The additional $\S 4.5$ million of income to the overall investors is due to the tax treatment of interest as an expense and is referred to as the interest tax shield. It is given by:

$\mathsf{I n t e r e s t\,   T a x\,   S h i e l d}=\mathsf{T_{C}}\times\mathsf{R_{D}}\times\mathsf{D}$

Where $\mathsf{T}_{\mathsf{C}}$ is the corporate tax rate,  R D is the rate of interest and D is the level of debt. Thus,  in the case above of LEVER,

$\S 4.5\;\mathsf{m i l i o n}=0.25\times 0.06\times\S 300$ \$4.5 million = 0.25 × 0.06 × \$300 million

Without any alterations to the business operations,  management can increase the overall distribution of cash flows to the security holders,  namely,  the equity holders and debt holders,  by $6.0\%$ on an annual basis via a reduction in corporate taxes paid.

As indicated above,  the new debt is permanent. Assuming a constant interest and tax rate,  the interest tax shield (PVTS) can be viewed in the context of a perpetuity formula to assess the impact on firm value.

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{\mathsf{P V}(\mathsf{I n t e r e s t\; T a x\; S h i e l d})=\frac{\mathsf{T_{C}}^{'}\;\mathsf{R_{D}}^{'}\;\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{R_{D}}}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad=\mathsf{T_{C}}^{'}\;\mathsf{D}}\end{array}
$$  

In the case of LEVER,  the present value of the interest tax shields with fixed and permanent debt is equal to $\S 75$ million:

$$
\S 75\;\mathsf{m i l i o n}=0.25\,  \times\,  \S 300\;\mathsf{n}
$$  

Note the use of the interest rate as the discount rate to calculate the present value of the expected interest tax shields in the formula above,  assuming constant and perpetual debt. The tax shields are not risk-free as LEVER could end up with insufficient operating income to make the interest payments or even file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the same time,  the risk of receiving the tax shields is lower than that of the overall cost of capital. Specifically,  the firm receives the tax shields as long as it is able to continue in business. Thus,  the interest rate is often used as the discount rate in the case of perpetual debt.

Reverting back to Eq. 2 ,  the value of LEVER is equal to $\S 1.075$ billion:

$$
\mathsf{V_{L E V E R}}=\S 1.075\mathrm{\besselI I i o n}=\S 300\mathrm{\mhyphen}+\S 775\mathrm{\mhyphen}^{7}
$$  

That is,  by re capitalizing the firm via a $\S 300$ million issue of permanent debt,  management has created additional shareholder wealth of $\S 75$ million,  and on the right-hand side of the balance sheet. While it might first seem that this wealth creation violates Proposition I,  that is not the case. Rather,  Modigliani and Miller assumed a world without taxes,  and thus by assuming corporate taxes,  one can show how capital structure does matter and moreover that the higher value of LEVER versus ALLEQUITY is because the U.S. taxing authorities allow corporations to treat interest as an expense. In effect,  the U.S. government subsidizes the use of debt financing by corporations.

In this simplified Modigliani and Miller world where we have only relaxed the assumption of no corporate taxes,  the recapitalization of ALLEQUITY into LEVER is relatively straightforward. To illustrate,  assume that ALLEQUITY has 65 million shares outstanding,  and thus the share price is $\S 15.38$ . Table 2 shows the mechanics of the recapitalization step by step.

Table 2

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/0dac9bf86de657f5eebcb305407a587b4240f728470ce8a29b4c14702b533e9e.jpg)

As shown in Table 2,  when ALLEQUITY announces the decision to borrow $\S 300$ million and repurchase an equivalent amount of shares,  the market value of ALLEQUITY immediately increases by the present value of the interest tax shields,  thus from $\S\,   1$ billion to $\S 1.075$ billion. The increase in equity value by the full amount of the value of the tax shields is predicated on three assumptions. First,  the stock market does not anticipate ALLEQUITY is contemplating a recapitalization and thus it is a complete surprise,  else,  the value of ALLEQUITY would have previously incorporated some expectation of a recapitalization in which case the value of ALLEQUITY would have been initially higher than $\S 1$ billion. Second,  when ALLEQUITY announces the recapitalization,  the analysis assumes there is $100\%$ certainty that management will implement the recapitalization; otherwise the value increase would be less to reflect the possibility that ALLEQUITY could fail to complete the recapitalization. Third,  it assumes that the stock market does not expect the size of the debt issue,  interest rate,  or corporate tax rate to change over time.

In the third stage of the recapitalization,  ALLEQUITY issues the new debt of $\S 300$ million. Given we have only relaxed the assumption of no corporate taxes in a Modigliani and Miller world,  there are no issuance or transactions costs associated with the $\S 300$ million debt raise. Commensurate with the debt raise,  ALLEQUITY changes its name to LEVER,  and the new firm value is now $\S 1.375$ billion.

LEVER repurchase s $\S 300$ million of stock in the fourth and final stage of the recapitalization. Specifically,  LEVER repurchase s 18.1 million shares at $\S 16.54$ which reflects the entire present value of the interest tax shields.

# THE IMPACT OF PERSONAL TAXES ON THE INTEREST TAX SHIELD

At first glance,  the tax status of a firm’s investor base does not appear to be of first-order importance to corporate management of publicly-traded corporations. Conceptually,  however,  management should attempt to minimize the value of all taxes,  corporate and personal,  paid by its investors. The issue is that interest income is taxed at a higher personal tax rate than dividends or capital gains,  that is,  for taxable investors. Moreover,  capital gains are taxed only when realized,  that is,  capital gains are not taxed marked-to-market on an annual basis. Since the personal income tax on interest is considerably higher,  at $40.8\%,  $ than the $23.8\%$ tax rate on dividends and capital gains 10 ,  this suggests that the tax benefit of debt financing is less than otherwise believed.

Merton Miller (1977) provides a formula to reflect the tax advantage of debt financing. It is:

In Eq. 5,  T i represents the tax rate on interest income,  ${\sf T}_{\sf e}$ represents the tax rate on equity income (capital gains and dividends) and ${\sf T}_{\sf c}$ represents the corporate tax rate. Given the tax rates provided above,  it seems there still is an advantage to debt financing for taxable investors,  albeit it is lower perhaps than previously assumed. However,  it is extremely difficult to know the exact tax advantage of debt financing for taxable investors because it requires knowledge of the marginal investor’s tax rate,  whether debt investors with personal tax rates have other clientele reasons to prefer debt financing,  and several other considerations.

# THE WEIGHTED AFTER COST OF CAPITAL (WITH TAXES)

In a Modigliani and Miller world,  a firm’s overall value is invariant to changes in leverage,  assuming no taxes,  transactions costs,  agency costs,  etc. Leverage has no impact on the operating cash flows,  and the firm’s cost of capital,  or weighted average cost of capital (WACC),  is also invariant to changes to leverage.

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}=\mathsf{W A C C}=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\left[\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}}\right]+\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\left[\frac{\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}}\right]
$$  

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\,  {=}\,  \mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}\,  {+}\,  \left[\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}\,  {\cdot}\,  \mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\right]\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{E}}
$$  

The cost of capital for the firm,  as represented by $R_{A}$ stays constant because as a firm tilts its capital structure toward debt which has a lower expected return,  this tilt increases the expected cost of equity as shown in Eq. 7 which is Proposition II. Thus,  when the proportions of debt and equity change,  the riskiness of debt and equity change simultaneously leaving the overall cost of capital unchanged. In the example of ALLEQUITY and LEVER above,  the cost of capital for ALLEQUITY was $12\%$ . If ALLEVER borrowed $\S 300$ million at a rate of $6\%,  $ ,  repurchased stock with the proceeds,  and changed its name to LEVER,  the cost of capital would not change. Rather,  the cost of equity would increase due to the increased risk to equity holders given the financial leverage.

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}=~14.57\%~=~12.0\%~+~\frac{300}{700}~\left[12.0\%~\cdot~6.0\%\right]
$$  

$$
{\mathsf{W A C C}}\ =\ 12.0\%\ =\ 6\%\left[{\frac{300}{1,  000}}\right]\ +\ 14.57\%\left[{\frac{700}{1,  000}}\right]
$$  

With corporate taxes,  the WACC is modified to:

$$
\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}}=\mathsf{W A C C}=\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{D}}\mathsf{[1\!-T\!_{C}]}\left[\frac{\mathsf{D}}{\mathsf{D}+\mathsf{E}}\right]+\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}\left[\frac{\mathsf{E}}{\mathsf{[D+E]}}\right]
$$  

Eq. 8 is the WACC formula which is used primarily in practice,  for example,  by investment bankers,  equity analysts,  corporate finance departments in corporations,  private equity firms,  etc. Here,  the WACC formula uses the after-tax cost of debt to capture the tax shields.

The WACC For LEVER is $11.55\%$ given the current corporate tax rate of $25\%,  $ ,  versus a $12.0\%$ cost of capital for ALLEQUITY as shown here:

$$
\mathsf{W A C C}\;=\; 11.55\%\;=\; 6\%\;(1\,  -\,   25\%)\left[\frac{300}{1,  000}\right]\;+\; 14.57\%\left[\frac{700}{1,  000}\right]
$$  

As illustrated,  the WACC declines as leverage increases. This decline in the firm’s cost of capital is not due to debt being cheaper than equity; rather it is due to the case that interest is treated as an expense and thus provides a tax shield to debt financing.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/61f1ec4612cea26b98db2be45f9c83cb3116952fbf7bf69caa192c3077031002.jpg)

With the $11.55\%$ estimate for LEVER’s WACC,  we can compute the firm value as:

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\,  \S 1.064\;\mathsf{b i l i o n}\;=\frac{\S 75\;\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{0.1155\;\cdot 0.045}
$$  

It is important to recognize what is driving the difference in the value of LEVER via the WACC estimate of $\S 1.064$ billion versus the prior method of $\S\,   1.075$ billion. As described earlier when we illustrate the debt

Raise of $\S 300$ million,  the assumption is that the level of debt remains constant and perpetual at $\S 300$ million. Here,  we value the interest tax shields separate from the unlevered valuation of the fi rm’s operating assets. This approach is known as adjusted present value (APV). In essence,  APV estimates the value of an all-equity firm as the base case and then subsequently accounts for various financing side effects such as the interest tax shields.

With WACC,  there is an explicit interaction of the investment and the financing decision. Whereas the APV approach calculates the present value of the interest expense tax shield as a standalone project to account for the tax benefits of debt financing,  the WACC approach captures the value of the interest tax shields by using the after-tax cost of debt $[{\sf R}_{\sf D}\left (1-{\sf T}_{\sf C}\right)]$ . The APV approach is flexible to valuing the interest expense tax shields for any level of debt (it can change through time) and for any period (we assumed perpetual above,  but it could also be assumed for a finite life). In contrast,  the WACC approach assumes that the D/E ratio is constant on a forward-looking basis. That is,  the WACC approach assumes management dynamically rebalances the capital structure,  e.g.,  the mix of debt and equity,  every period to maintain a constant leverage ratio. Given the WACC is calculated for the firm as a whole and assumes constant leverage,  it should only be used as a discount rate for projects which have the same risk as to the firm and which don’t alter the leverage ratio of the firm. Gi ven projects within firms have varying discount rates and also that many projects alter the capital structure of the firm,  using WACC as the discount rate for projects is problematic despite being commonly done.

While the value of LEVER is roughly similar under the two approaches,  $\S\,   1.075$ billion (APV) and $\S 1.064$ billion (WACC),  offsetting factors which drive the similarity. Recall that for the APV approach utilized in the example above,  we assumed that for a relatively modest leverage ratio,  the appropriate discount rate to use in discounting the expected interest tax shields is the cost of debt since the realization of the tax shields occur if the interest payments can be made in full,  that is,  where the firm is profitable. In contrast,  the interest tax shields are discounted at the WACC in the WACC approach rather than at the cost of debt. As noted above,  the operating assets and leverage benefits are comingled in the WACC approach,  and the same cost of capital is used to discount all cash-flow streams. Here,  by assuming a constant D/E ratio,  the debt is expected to increase through time for a firm with expected future growth of cash flows and is thus the realization of the interest tax shields is dependent on the overall risk of the firm.

Since the presence of corporate taxes encourages debt financing,  the implication is that firms should maximize their use of leverage as the WACC continually decreases as leverage increases. However,  increased leverage results in higher financial risk,  per Proposition II of Modigliani and Miller,  and thus a higher likelihood of financial distress and eventually bankruptcy.

While the Modigliani and Miller’s propositions allow for greater financial risk and bankruptcy,  it is important to note that bankruptcy is not costly given their assumption of perfect capital markets. Specifically,  if a firm is unable to make its interest and principal repayments when due,  the equity holders will turn the keys over to the bond holders. Instantly,  the firm reverts from a highly levered firm unable to make interest payments to an all-equity firm where the bond holders are suddenly the new equity holders. Bankruptcy is not costly because there are no direct transactions costs (legal and advisory fees concerning a bankruptcy filing) in a Modigliani and Miller world. Likewise,  there are no agency costs or imperfect information in a Modigliani and Miller world,  and thus there are no indirect costs of bankruptcy such as customers or suppliers refusing to do business with a failing firm.

In the real world,  the direct cost of financial distress can be steep. A case in point is that of Lehman Brothers,  formerly the fourth largest investment bank in the world,  which filed for Chapter 11 protection on September 15,  2008 during the early days of the financial crisis. Lehman did not emerge from Chapter 11 until March of 2012 and has already paid roughly $\S 8$ billion as of December 2022 to its legal and financial advisors for their work during the financial restructuring process. While Lehman technically is out of bankruptcy,  the advisors are still today in 2023 working through various creditor claims and legal disputes which will go on for the next few years.

The direct costs of financial distress,  e.g.,  the fees to the financial,  restructuring and legal advisors,  are relatively easy to estimate. There are indirect bankruptcy or financial distress costs which are difficult to estimate either ex-ante or ex-post. These indirect costs can occur across a wide variety of stakeholders. For example,  some customers shift their loyalty elsewhere,  suppliers cut back on shipments,  employees begin to reduce work effort along many dimensions such as increased sick days,  theft,  search for alternative jobs,  creditors refuse to advance more funds,  and management may rationally engage in – NPV projects. These indirect costs of financial distress tend to far exceed the direct costs of financial distress.

Conceptually,  it is straightforward to calculate the cost of financial distress as it involves three basic factors:

(1) the probability of financial distress (2) the actual (direct and indirect) cost once the firm is in distress

# (3) and the discount rate associated with the distress costs

In practice,  these three factors are challenging to estimate and are subject to measurement error due to modeling issues,  limited data,  and subjective judgment for many of the inputs. Nonetheless,  it is important to have a framework by which to think about the expected costs of financial distress.

To illustrate,  consider a firm such as Xerox which has a BB debt rating. Assume that the expected annual probability of default for XEROX is $0.75\%,  $ the discount rate is $5\%$ ,  and the expected cost of financial distress,  if it occurs,  is $20\%$ . The firm value $\mathfrak{F A A}$ billion debt $+\ \S 5.4$ billion equity) of Xerox is $\S 9.8$ billion. Given these assumptions,  what is the present value today of the cost of financial distress for Xerox? We know debt financing creates valuable tax shields for Xerox,  but is there a point at which leverage is too high to maximize shareholder wealth?

The first step is to calculate the present value of financial distress if it occurs within the next year. Multiply the cost of financial distress by the probability of distress (p) and then discount at the one-year rate:

$$
\mathsf{P V F D}=\mathsf{p}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C F D}}{1+\mathsf{r}}\right]
$$  

Where PVFD is the present value of the cost of financial distress and CFD is the cost of financial distress when it occurs. The present value of the cost of financial distress occurring in one year is:

$$
\S 14.0\;\mathsf{m i l l i o n}=0.0075\Bigg[\frac{\S 9.8\;\mathsf{b i l l i o n}\;(0.20)}{\big (1+. 05\big)}\Bigg]
$$  

The calculation for the present value today of financial distress occurring in the second year will reflect the probability of financial distress occurring in the first year. Since $\mathsf{p}$ is the probability of financial distress in each year,  then ${\mathsf{1}}{\mathsf{-}}{\mathsf{p}}$ is the probability of success in each year. As of today,  the probability of Xerox experiencing financial distress by the end of the second year is equal to ${\mathsf{p}}\,  +\,   (1\!-\!{\mathsf{p}}){\mathsf{p}},  $ ,  that is,  $1.49\%$ . Thus,  the present value of the cost of financial discuss for Xerox in the next two years is $\S 27.2$ million and given by:

$$
\S 27.2\ \mathrm{million}=0.0075\left[{\frac{\S 9.8\ b i l i o n\ (0.20)}{(1+. 05)}}\right]+0.0075 (1-0.0075)\left[{\frac{\S 9.8\ b i l i o n (0.20)} {{(1+0.\1)}^{2}} }\right]
$$  

A useful way to illustrate the present value of financial distress is via a tree analysis as shown below in Figure 2.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/ffe57dc77a145db280d791fa2d642e533bb35e42936974876027ac93b6f93815.jpg)

As displayed in Figure 2,  financial distress will occur in Year 1 with probability $p$ and survival will occur with probability of $_{1-p.}$ And if distress occurs,  then the firm realizes the CFD,  and the valuation tree ends at this point. If instead,  the firm survives with probability ${\mathsf{1}}{\mathrm{-}}{\mathsf{p}},  $ then the conditional probability of it realizing financial distress in Year 2 is also p. Thus,  if the annual probability of Xerox failing is $0.75\%,  $ ,  then the probability of Xerox not surviving beyond Year 2 is equal to $\rho+(1\!\cdot\!\rho)\rho=1.49\%$ as indicated earlier,  and so forth.

In a multi-period model,  the present value of financial distress is given by:

$$
\mathsf{P V F D}=\mathsf{p}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C F D}}{\left (1+\mathsf{r}\right)}\right]+\left (1-\mathsf{p}\right)\mathsf{p}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C F D}}{\left (1+\mathsf{r}\right)^{2}}\right]+\left (1-\mathsf{p}\right)^{2}\mathsf{p}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C F D}}{\left (1+\mathsf{r}\right)^{3}}\right]+\ldots\ldots+\left (1-\mathsf{p}\right)^{\infty-1}\mathsf{p}\left[\frac{\mathsf{C F D}}{\left (1+\mathsf{r}\right)^{\infty}}\right]
$$  

That is,  the PVFD as of today is equal to the sum of the expected discounted cost of financial distress if it occurs in Year 1,  Year 2,  Year 3,  etc. Expanding via a geometric series (comparable to the perpetuity formula),  Eq. 10 can be solved to yield:

$$
\mathsf{P V F D}=\frac{\mathsf{p}}{\left[\mathsf{p}+\mathsf{r}\right]}\,  \left[\mathsf{C F D}\right]
$$  

Applying Eq. 11 to Xerox yields

$$
\S 255.7\ \mathsf{m i l l i o n}=\frac{0.0075}{\left[. 0075+. 05\right]}\Big[\S 9.8\ \mathsf{b i l l i o n}\ (0.20)\Big]
$$  

Thus,  by these rough calculations,  the PVFD at Xerox is $\S 256$ million and is $2.6\%$ of its total enterprise value of $\S 9.8$ billion. The message is that even for a well-known firm like Xerox,  the cost of the expected likelihood of future financial distress is factored in the valuation of the underlying firm and should be weighed against the tax benefits of debt financing.

# THE TRADE-OFF THEORY OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE

The trade-off theory of capital structure weighs the benefits of debt financing in shielding cash flows from taxes against the cost of direct and indirect financial distress. Using the Adjusted Present Value approach to estimating a firm’s value:

- PVTS - PVFD
$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{A L L E Q U I T Y}}+\mathsf{P V T S}\cdot\mathsf{P V F D}
$$  

The trade-off theory of capital structure indicates there is an optimal leverage ratio for corporations. In contrast,  recall that the Modigliani and Miller propositions prove capital structure does not matter in a perfect world and thus can vary randomly across firms and industries. However,  capital structure often varies predictably in the real world. For example,  utility firms such as Duke Energy with stable and strong cash flows tend to have high leverage ratios relative to a biotechnology firm such as Momenta Pharmaceuticals which has negative cash flows and no tangible assets.

The trade-off theory cleanly builds on the Modigliani and Miller theory of capital structure and advances our fundamental understanding. While the trade-off theory can explain many differences in capital structure across certain industries,  it is unable to explain why there are many large successful firms which have a small amount of debt relative to the market capitalization of the firm’s equity. Microsoft,  for example,  has an equity market capitalization of $\S 1.8$ trillion versus $\S 80$ billion of debt. Indeed,  Microsoft has negative net debt since it has cash and equivalents of $\S\,   1\,   10$ billion. With forecasted EBITDA in excess of $\S 100$ billion,  Microsoft could easily handle a considerable more substantial debt burden and still maintain investment grade debt (currently AAA debt). Nonetheless,  there are numerous large profitable and financial stable firms carrying large amounts of “excess cash.”

# Agency Costs and Capital Structure

# REVIEW OF TRADEOFF THEORY OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE

In perfect capital markets,  capital structure has no impact on the overall value of firms. If a firm chooses to alter its mix of debt and equity,  the only impact is to change the risk and return of the various securities,  not the risk of the overall firm. Stated differently,  decision making on the left-hand side of the balance sheet is what drives firm value and is invariant to changes on the right-hand side of the balance sheet.

The U.S. tax system favors debt financing. That is,  the treatment of interest as an expense generates tax shields to the extent that a corporation employs debt in its capital structure. Consider the fictional firm,  ALLEQUITY,  renamed LEVER. The market-value balance sheet,  preand post-debt raise/share repurchase,  is shown below:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/613487d86997fb9e067a2c736429fc6fcf97a989838c33491b65147349859fa7.jpg)

The market value of LEVER exceeds the market value of ALLEQUITY by $\S 75$ million,  the present value of the interest tax shields. We can think of the interest tax shields as a separate project and have labeled as such on the lefthand side of LEVER’s balance sheet. Here,  management increases overall firm value by a recapitalization which involved a repurchase of shares via debt financing. And as noted in the balance sheets above,  the value of the operating assets (underlying projects) remained fixed at $\S\,   1$ billion.

There are two ways in which corporate management can think of the interest tax shields. As shown above,  we treated the interest tax shields as a standalone project. This method is APV (adjusted present value).

The alternative method to calculate the interest tax shields is via the WACC (weighted average cost of capital). The WACC approach captures the value of the tax shields by using the after-tax cost of debt in the WACC equation. By accounting for the after-tax cost of debt,  the WACC is less than the unlevered cost of capital. The WACC also assumes that the leverage ratio for the firm stays constant as discussed in the Tradeoff Theory of Capital Structure lecture note. Using WACC,  the balance sheet of LEVER is:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/21da0d1da538e857bacdb4f8e0d9258aad529b269bb82fb0b997f2c0574e7729.jpg)

Thus,  there is an explicit interaction of the financing and investment decision. The $\S 1.064$ billion value of LEVER in the WACC method versus $\S 1.075$ billion in the APV method is due to differences in the expected amount of debt outstanding through time and due to differences in the discount rate used to value the tax shields. While it is fine to think of the WACC as the overall cost of capital for the firm,  it is not a useful metric to use for valuing a project which would either alter the capital structure of the firm or would have different risk than the overall risk of the firm.

According to Proposition II of Modigliani and Miller,  leverage increases the risk to equity as leverage exacerbates the volatility of the residual cash flows to equity holders due to the fixed payments to debt holders. Thus,  bankruptcy is more likely to occur as leverage increases. That is,  a highly levered firm has a higher chance of financial distress and eventually bankruptcy than a firm with minimal leverage. In a world with perfect capital markets,  financial distress is not costly as the equity holders can turn the keys over to the bond holders with no disruption in the overall operation of the firm. It is an entirely different story in the real world as financial distress can be quite costly resulting in steep losses to the business due to the loss of customers,  vendors,  employees,  etc. In the real world,  financial distress impairs the value of the operating assets of the corporation.

Conceptually,  we can think of the value of financial distress as an asset or project,  albeit with a negative sign. As with any project,  one computes the expected cash flows on a timeline and discounts the cash flows accordingly. Suppose that in the case of LEVER,  the present value of financial distress is equal to - $\S 25$ million. In this case,  the market-value balance sheet is:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8a5cd91c2ccfafa836f5243e43686ed22310fad7d4c655c5ac3fac8be8704473.jpg)

As shown above,  the PVFD is included in the value of the operating assets since the expected cash flows from the operating assets are lower once the possibility of financial distress exists. As described above,  the trade-off theory of capital structure weighs the benefit of debt financing in shielding cash flows from taxes against the cost of direct and indirect financial distress.

$$
\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{L E V E R}}=\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{A L L E Q U I T Y}}+\mathsf{P V T S}\cdot\mathsf{P V F D}
$$  

The trade-off theory suggests there is an optimal capital structure for each firm and thus management dynamically or at least periodically adjusts the capital structure toward the optimal level. Stated differently,  if the incremental cash flows from increasing leverage,  accounting for both tax shields and financial distress costs,  are positive,  the CFO should increase the leverage ratio. And if the incremental cash flows from additional leverage are negative,  the CFO should issue new equity and or retire debt.

Distinguishing financial distress from economic distress is important. For example,  an all-equity firm can realize economic distress due to poor operating margins and may be forced to exit the business and shut down. Consider BlackBerry LTD which invented the smartphone. In 2008,  Blackberry reached an equity market capitalization of nearly $\S 80$ billion,  had zero debt,  and strong cash flows. Blackberry’s market capitalization subsequently dropped to less than $\S 3$ billion,  and revenues plummeted from nearly $\S 20$ billion in 2011 to less than $\S 1$ billion in 2023. BlackBerry became economically distressed due to not making a profit in the past eight years ,  but not financially distressed since it didn’t have leverage until recently. Its demise was due in large part to the subsequent innovation by Apple with the iPhone.

In contrast,  financial distress occurs when a leveraged firm is forced to re capitalize due to its over levered capital structure,  otherwise,  its operating margins may be more than sufficient to continue as a viable firm. That is,  when financial distress occurs,  the firm’s operating performance will be lower than the operating performance of firms without leverage. Put differently,  the present value of financial distress can be viewed as the cost of leverage,  that is,  the incremental possibility of the firm experiencing financial distress imposes a reduction in the value of the firm’s operating assets. The recognition of financial distress costs resulted in the trade-off theory as the tax shields are quite valuable but have to be weighed against the expected value of financial distress and thus the destruction of value on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.

# AGENCY COSTS OF ISSUING EQUITY

Does management always acts on behalf of the shareholders of the firm? In the case of a sole proprietorship,  this assumption is a non-issue since a single person owns $100\%$ of the firm. Thus,  even if

The manager-owner intentionally engages in actions which do not maximize the value of the firm,  she is doing so on her own behalf to maximize utility. That is,  if the owner-manager chooses to put unqualified friends and family on the payroll,  she incurs the full costs of these actions.

The separation of ownership and managerial control in a firm often results in conflicts between owners and managers. Beginning with Jensen and Meckling (1976),  academics and practitioners have referred to these potential conflicts as agency problems or agency costs. Specifically,  shareholders,  e.g.,  principals,  hire managers,  e.g.,  agents,  to act on their behalf,  but since managers don’t bear the full costs of their actions,  they may be inclined to put their interest ahead of the interests of shareholders. These personal interests can range from perquisites on the job to reducing overall work effort.

As part of a broad theory of the firm,  Jensen and Meckling showed that as the owner-manager sells shares in the firm,  he or she will bear the expected agency costs. New shareholders who are rational will assume some amount of agency costs and likely will expend resources to monitor the manager,  but it is the owner-manager who will be the residual claimant and largely bear the brunt of the agency costs. Indeed,  the manager will take various actions to bond himself not to engage in agency costs,  but these bonding actions are not free. And as the firm continues to sell more and more shares to diffuse shareholders,  the agency costs will increase,  and thus the bonding and monitoring efforts will also increase to offset. These bonding and monitoring efforts include audits,  budgets,  control systems,  independent boards,  shareholder-based compensation systems,  etc. It is important to note that while these bonding and monitoring efforts are incredibly costly to implement,  they are not without their flaws and even associated auditing costs. For example,  the internal auditor and external auditor will want to overspend on auditing budgets and oversight,  and often cause considerable friction with various business units during the auditing process. Seemingly independent board members,  while may be free of specific conflicts,  often have their agendas rather than of merely maximizing shareholder wealth.

Before the seminal work by Jensen and Meckling,  the academic literature largely ignored agency costs,  and indeed the initial response to Jensen and Meckling’s work was not well received when they presented their paper as it upset the status quo in a significant way. Since the publication of the Jensen and Meckling paper,  the agency cost theory literature has exploded and continues to be a vibrant area in academic research and practitioner research as well,  and also has extended well beyond corporate finance where it originated. In effect,  its influence has been to force the textbook profit maximization world to be more adaptable to the real world where sometimes managers are inclined to lie,  steal,  and cheat.

Jensen and Meckling suggest that one route to avoid the agency costs associated with issuing equity is for the owner to raise all external funds via debt. Indeed,  they proposed the leveraged buyout (LBO) years in advance of the LBO structure becoming part of many U.S. corporations.

# CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND DEBT INDENTURES

There are two primary forms of debt financing: bank loans and debentures. A bank loan is a private agreement between the corporation and the lender,  traditionally a bank or syndicate of banks,  but lenders of loans have extended to many non-banks over recent years. A bank loan avoids various costs of registration but is generally illiquid due to not being publicly traded on a listed exchange. Bank loans are typically of two forms,  either a term loan with a stated maturity or a revolving line of credit which is similar to a credit card for an individual. Jumbo bank loans tend to be syndicated to multiple lenders via the lead arranger for the loan who serves as the underwriter. As bank loans are private contracts between the borrowers and lenders,  they can be made to fit every situation and usually have numerous restrictive covenants,  many of which are commonly broken and thus the borrower is required to cure via additional cash payments,  pledging of more assets,  etc. These loans tend to be shorter in term than traditional public bonds and are most often secured by specific assets. By having security on various assets,  the lender has substantive leverage over the borrower as it can take steps to seize the secured assets in case the two parties are unable to resolve a dispute.

Publicly-traded bonds or debentures are debt securities issued by large corporations. Similar to an equity issue,  a corporate bond will have a prospectus or offering memorandum which spells out many of the details of the security issue. But the governance of a debt security is far different from the governance of an equity security,  a point which tends not to be explicitly made in corporate finance textbooks,  instead tends to be made in corporate law textbooks. In the case of equity,  the shareholders elect a board of directors to monitor management on their behalf. The board of directors is charged with hiring and replacing management,  setting the compensation for management,  approve significant decisions,  etc.,  all on behalf of the shareholders. With public debentures,  there is no board which acts on behalf of the holders; rather there is an indenture which is a formal contract between the company and the bond trustee which serves to protect the interests of the bond holders.

While an indenture will name a trustee,  typically a bank,  for the indenture to represent the bond holders,  trustees rarely exert any power unilaterally. Instead,  if bond holders have an issue with various issues as they pertain to their bonds,  the bond holders will direct the trustee to take specific actions. Generally,  before the trustee agrees to take any steps on behalf of the bond holders,  the bond holders must first agree to indemnify the trustee against a negative response from the issuer or other party which happens to be threatening the value of the bond holders’ rights to receive their payments.

In 1939,  Congress passed the Trust Indenture Act (TIA) to protect bondholder rights,  specifically to ensure that minority bond holders are not coerced into giving up their rights to payment. An influential paragraph from the TIA,  Section 316 (b),  is often copied word for word into various bond indentures just to make it crystal clear as to the rights of the bond holders,  specifically,  the rights of minority bond holders from the actions of the majority bond holders often acting in conjunction with the company. Section 316 (b) states:

“ Notwithstanding any other provision of the indenture to be qualified,  the right of any holder of any indenture security to receive payment of the principal of and interest on any such indenture security,  on or after the respective due dates expressed in such indenture security,  or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates,  shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder….”

While bond indentures provide specific restrictions of various actions by managers via covenants which address asset sales,  dividends,  share repurchase s,  mergers,  and other events which could negatively hamper the bond holders’ ability to be repaid,  disputes arise quite frequently,  and in parti cular,  when the firm is in financial distress. Indeed,  whereas stockholders,  especially minority stockholders,  can rely on a board of directors to protect their economic interest,  bond holders are often forced to take legal action against management in disputes over major decisions which impair the value of the securities held by the debt holders. And in some cases,  the setting is not merely management against bond holders,  but could be management and majority bond holders who may agree to the stripping of covenants,  etc. From the indenture,  which could benefit them due to their holding other securities of the issuer,  but may impair the ability of the minority bond holders from receiving payment.

# OPTIONS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

An option is a contract which gives the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified strike price on a set date. The seller must sell or buy the underlying asset if the buyer chooses to exercise the option. Interestingly,  we can view the capital structure of a corporation as options on the assets of the corporation. Consider Hewlett Packard Enterprise whose capital structure consists of $\S 12.9$ billion of debt and $\S 28.7$ billion of equity as of January 2023. Shareholders of Hewlett Packard have limited liability,  that is,  if Hewlett Packard fails to repay its interest and principal on the debt,  the debt holders have no rights to go after other assets owned by the shareholders. Put differently,  shareholders of a publicly-traded

Corporation don’t sign personal guarantees to obtain debt financing for the corporation. By having the option to default,  and in effect give the keys to the debt holders,  the shareholders own a call option on the assets of the corporation.

Figure 1 illustrates the concept of equity as a call option on the assets of a corporation using Hewlett Packard as an example. For simplicity,  assume that all of Hewlett Packard’s debt will mature soon. The horizontal axis reflects the total enterprise value of Hewlett Packard and the vertical axis represents the equity value of Hewlett Packard at the time of the debt maturity. If the value of Hewlett Packard is $\S 12.9$ billion or less when the debt matures,  the management team will file Chapter 11 and turn the keys over to the debt holders,  leaving shareholders with zero value. And if the value of Hewlett Packard exceeds $\S 12.9$ billion,  the management team will refinance the debt,  and the shareholders will have a value equivalent to the difference between the firm value and the $\S 12.9$ billion of debt. That is,  the strike price on the assets of the corporation is equal to the $\S 12.9$ billion of the total debt. As shown,  this payoff diagram to equity looks just like the payoff diagram of a call option,  and hence the logic of shareholder equity as a call option on the assets of the firm.

Hewlett Packard Asset Value

From the perspective of the debt holders,  we can think of the debt holders as owning the corporation and selling a call option on the firm’s assets to the shareholders. If the value of Hewlett Packard exceeds the $\S 12.9$ billion of the total debt on the maturity date,  then the shareholders will exercise their call option on the assets of Hewlett Packard and thus require the debt holders to give up ownership of the firm. And if the value of Hewlett Packard is less than the $\S 12.9$ billion strike price,  the calls held by the shareholder expire worthless,  management declares bankruptcy,  and the debt holders take control of the assets. Figure 2 displays this payoff from the viewpoint of the Hewlett Packard debt holders.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/ede656fcdc13eb4c15ed66a97e3d637d1d25a6131cdfb895b66deea236351b9c.jpg)

Hewlett Packard Asset Value

There is an alternative way to think about the claims held by the debt holders. Recall the put-call parity relationship from 35000,  that is,

$$
\mathsf{C a l l\mathrm{~+~}P V\,   (S t r i k e\,   P r i c e\,   o f\,   O p t i o n)=P u t\mathrm{~+~}S t o c k}
$$  

Since a portfolio consisting of a stock and a put yields exactly the same payoff as a portfolio consisting of a call and the present value of the option’s strike price,  the two portfolios must have the same value. In the context of the corporation,  we can rewrite Eq. 2 as:

Thus,  all we are doing with the familiar put-call parity equation as in Eq. 2 is to replace the strike price of the option with the face value of the debt and replacing the stock value with the asset value of the corporation. And as we discussed above,  the debt holders own the assets and have sold a call option on the assets to the shareholders:

Given put-call parity,  it therefore holds that:

Debtholder Value $=$ PV (Face Value of Debt) – Put

That is,  due to put-call parity,  the debtholder value is equal to the present value of the face value of the debt minus a put option which gives the shareholders the right to put the assets back to the debt holders and default. Put differently,  debt holders own a risk-free bond and are short a put option with a strike price equal to the face value of the debt. Thus,  when a firm files bankruptcy,  the shareholders exercise

Their rights to put the assets of the firm back to the debt holders. In other words,  as mentioned earlier,  shareholders of corporations have limited liability and thus can turn the keys over to the debt holders without recourse. Figure 3 displays this payoff to the debt holders below:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e3e24d789d1d831e46729df1f92a4af82e006d7519d6f92888551713e38404df.jpg)

Hewlett Packard Asset Value

As shown,  Figure 3 displays the identical payoff to the debt holders as in Figure 2; rather the interpretation is different. Whereas in Figure 2,  the debt holders have sold the upside of the corporation to the equity holders,  Figure 3 characterizes it as the debt holders owning a risk-free bond and having sold a put option to the equity holders. Indeed,  a debtholder could purchase a put option and therefore insulate itself from credit risk. This type of put option is referred to as a credit default swap for which the holder pays a periodic premium and would receive a substantial payment from the seller if the firm were to default.

# THE AGENCY COST OF LEVERAGE: MAXIMIZE FIRM VALUE OR SHAREHOLDER WEALTH?

In the Tradeoff Theory of Capital Structure lecture note,  the entire value created by the increase in leverage due to the interest-tax shields accrued solely to the shareholders. That is,  the existing bond holders and new bond holders do not participate in the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ generated by the leveraged recapitalization. Thus,  the maximization of shareholder wealth is consistent with maximizing firm value,  and if the existing debt is risk-free,  then the change in shareholder wealth is equivalent to the change in firm value. Co nsider LEVER’s market-value balance sheet below.

LEVER MARKET-VALUE BALANCE SHEET

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/db648b97bf36065d53f004027933e3a39593ea6dc25d5416bae5f9a6a1bde659.jpg)

Suppose LEVER considers a new project called PROJECT which requires an investment of 10 and has a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ of 5. Given the NPV is positive,  management will proceed with PROJECT and use some of its existing cash for financing. As shown below,  the entire NPV of 5 accrues to the shareholders. Likewise,  LEVER can finance PROJECT via a new debt issue or a new equity issue of 10,  and in both cases,  the NPV of 5 will still accrue to the current shareholders.

LEVER MARKET-VALUE BALANCE SHEET (WITH PROJECT)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b9e5f44f0d678e6bd07c8d565c23b976e54d3881861565c7f00d2f0a14f4d6b9.jpg)

Even when debt is risky,  shareholder wealth maximization is often consistent with maximizing firm value,  just that the shareholders and debt holders share the benefits or costs associated with an investment or transaction. In the example above,  if the debt is risky,  then the benefits of PROJECT ’s $+\mathsf{N P V}$ c an accrue not only to the shareholders but also to the debt holders,  though the bulk of the value increase will accrue to the shareholders since the leverage ratio of LEVER is fairly modest. When debt is risky,  debt holders can benefit from $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects as the value creation for the firm can reduce the credit spread for the debt due to a reduction in the probability of subsequent bankruptcy.

When a firm is near financial distress or is in financial distress,  the incentives between debt holders and shareholders tend to quickly diverge. If this occurs,  management may take actions which benefit shareholders at the expense of the bond holders. Suppose that LEVER’s market -value balance sheet is:

LEVER MARKET-VALUE BALANCE SHEET (IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f4b3701b285d8322f4ce8704862b5f9eabe006f40667a1d8f962b77cc83e79f0.jpg)

While LEVER’s market value of debt is 60,  the face value (or book value) of LEVER’s debt is 120 and matures in one year. Thus,  LEVER is in financial distress since the market value of its debt is trading at half the face value. Suppose that instead of one year left until maturity,  LEVER’s debt matures tomorrow. Assuming no transactions costs associating with liquidating the firm,  the debt will be worth close to 80 and the equity at zero. In both cases,  the debt is underwater,  and the market value of LEVER is the same,  but the debt and equity values are quite different in the two scenarios,  that is,  with one day to maturity versus one year to maturity. This example illustrates the logic of equity as a call option on the assets of the firm and the influence of volatility on the value of the option. Given the strike price of the option is 120,  the asset value is only 80,  and with only one day before expiration,  the option has roughly zero value. But with one year to go,  there is a higher probability of LEVER realizing positive outcomes,  and thus the equity has option value of 20. And since the debt holders are counter parties to the equity option of 20,  the market value of the debt is 20 less than the debt’s face value.

To illustrate the conflict between the debt holders and the equity holders of LEVER,  assume management has two mutually exclusive investment projects,  LOW and HIGH,  shown below. Assume that the assets-inplace are low risk and will yield future payments in one year which are not very different from the current value of 50. To simplify,  assume that both the LOW and HIGH projects have two possible states of the world,  good and bad.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/39e83a9a9980ad22af6c82ab462f1b199fec2e6c733d394beb9f79a0f289fd87.jpg)

LOW requires an upfront investment of 40 and will either pay off 60 or 40 with $50\%$ probability each in one year,  coinciding with the maturity of LEVER’s debt. If we assume a cost of capital of $10\%$ for $\mathsf{L O W},  $ ,  the NPV is $+5.45$ :

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=+\,   5.45=-\,   40+\,  \frac{\bigl[60\,  \times\,   0.50+40\,  \times\,   0.50\bigr]}{1.10}
$$  

Given LOW has $+\mathsf{N P V},  $ the recommendation is for management to invest in LOW. However,  given LEVER is in financial distress,  it is unlikely that it will be able to raise debt to finance LOW and thus must issue new equity of 10 to supplement the cash position of 30 to invest 40. The problem is that equity investors will refuse to invest in LEVER to partially finance this $+\mathsf{N P V}$ project as the funds will be used to pay off the debt holders in one year when the debt matures unless the assets-in-place has a huge upside outcome. For example,  if the assets-in place ends up at 55 in one year,  the firm will be worth either 95 or 115 (that is,  $55\,  +\,   40$ or $55\,  +\,   60$ ) and in both cases,  the debt holders end up with the entire amount. Meanwhile,  the original equity of 20,  plus the new equity of 10,  drops to a zero value. This phenomenon is referred to as

The under investment problem for firms in financial distress and was originally formulated by Myers (1977).

Assume HIGH has a cost of capital of $15\%$ . HIGH has a NPV of -10,  that is:

$$
\mathsf{N P V}=-\,   10=-\,   30+\,  \frac{\left[140\,  \times\,   0.10+10\,  \times\,   0.90\right]}{1.15}
$$  

Thus,  the HIGH project has negative NPV and high volatility. If the good state of the world occurs with the investment in HIGH,  the payoff is 140,  and there are sufficient funds to pay off LEVER’s debt,  plus there is considerable value left over for the equity holders. In the bad state of the world,  equity receives zero and debt recovers far less than its face value. But the equity holders would have also received zero payoff if management had opted for the LOW project and likewise would have received a zero payoff had management passed on both projects and simply liquidated the cash and assets-in-place when the debt matured.

Table 1 displays the payoffs to debt and equity at maturity for the debt in the above analysis. The payoffs are displayed if Project LOW is accepted,  Project HIGH is accepted,  or if management passes on both projects. We assume the assets-in-place are worth 55 when the debt matures and if management passes on both projects,  the excess cash earns a return of zero. These payoffs illustrate how shareholders benefit from risk-increasing decisions when the firm is in financial distress. In this particular example,  the only chance for shareholders to receive any distribution is for management to roll the dice.

In treating debt and equity as options on a portfolio of assets,  it is logical that management,  acting on behalf of equity holders,  acts to move forward with a wealth-destroying project for the corporation,  but wealth increasing for the shareholders who wish to maximize the value of their call option,  and thus prefer the higher volatility project even it is expected to generate a loss. This issue is often referred to as the asset substitution model and was introduced in Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) seminal work discussed in the beginning of this lecture note.

# BEYOND FINANCE THEORY: AGENCY COSTS IN THE REAL WORLD

In the absence of agency costs,  there is no need for auditors,  independent board members,  incentive compensation plans,  lengthy loan contracts and indentures,  proxy battles,  activist investors,  etc. A huge amount of time and effort is spent in attempting to contain and curtail agency costs in corporations on all levels. In my experience,  it seems that most of the time and energy at high management levels of large corporations go into monitoring and bonding with respect to agency costs. And at the board level,  especially across board committees such as risk,  human resources,  audit,  independent,  corporate governance,  etc.,  the primary focus is often to curtail agency costs.

In reality,  agency costs increase non-linearly with financial distress. The overly simplified examples of asset substitution and debt overhang discussed above are rampant in actual practice and perhaps even more extreme. In practice,  we have experienced situations of large dividends and share repurchase s of companies while in financial distress to the detriment of the debt holders,  and in some cases,

Alignment of interest between equity holders and certain debt holders,  but excluding other debt holders. For example,  we have witnessed occurrences of a majority of debt holders agreeing to the removal of various covenants on a particular debt issue which benefitted them via a new secured debt issue which they financed,  but substantially harmful to the non-participating minority debt holders.

It is important to note that bond holders don’t behave passively and simply sit still,  rather their level of aggressiveness can be rather extreme relative to the shareholder activist saber rattling we often witness. A highly publicized example is Caesars Entertainment,  the largest casino operator in the United States. In December 2006,  Caesars agreed to a leveraged buyout by Apollo and TPG,  two large and well-known private-equity firms. Caesars was one of the largest buyouts in corporate history and by the time that the deal formally closed in January 2008,  the economy was in a downturn and headed for the financial crisis. Due to a heavy debt burden,  management of Caesars embarked on numerous financial and asset restructuring programs for survival. The asset restructuring programs included transferring some of the best casino properties to other entities that they owned. The debt holders,  led by Elliott Management,  Appaloosa Management,  and Oaktree Capital,  did not take the asset transfers lightly,  rather sued Caesars and the private equity sponsors for fraudulent convenance. It ended up becoming one of the nastiest corporate brawls in history involving some of the largest Wall Street players on both sides. Importantly,  the entire impetus for the war between the equity holders and the debt holders of Caesars was due to the divergence of incentives caused by the financial distress and eventual inability of Caesars to meet its debt obligations.

# Information Asymmetry and Capital Structure

# REVIEW OF AGENCY COSTS AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

As described in Agency Costs and Capital Structure,  agency costs can significantly reduce firm value. If investors expect that management will not maximize shareholder value,  stock prices will be lower as a result. Thus,  the burden is on management to convince shareholders that their objective is to maximize shareholder wealth. Agency cost concerns are exceptionally high at firms with multiple class voting structures for board members. For example,  Mark Zuckerberg controls $15\%$ of the economic interest of Meta Platforms (Facebook) and $58\%$ of the voting interest. Given the voting interest,  Zuckerberg in effect controls the board.

Agency costs are not limited to conflicts between management and shareholders,  but also occur between management,  acting on behalf of shareholders,  and debt holders. For financially stable firms,  when management makes decisions which impact firm value,  shareholders capture all or most of the resulting change in value. For firms with risk-free debt,  $100\%$ of the change in firm value,  positive or negative,  accrues to the equity holders. With risky debt,  and even for financially stable firms,  it is the case that the debt holders will also participate,  albeit to a small extent,  in the creation or destruction of firm value due to managerial decisions or otherwise exogenous forces. But when firms are in financial distress and or near bankruptcy,  managers,  when acting on behalf of the shareholders,  may optimally make investment decisions which reduce overall firm value even though it increases shareholder wealth. Specifically,  managers have incentives to increase the volatility of the outcomes associated with projects even if it means investing in projects which are not expected to generate economic value. Thus,  firms and investors attempt to create robust corporate governance and credit documents to ensure such value destruction doesn’t occur when firms end up ex -post in financial distress.

In the corporate form of organization,  shareholders face only limited liability. That is,  shareholders can lose no more than what they invested in the corporation,  and thus the debt holders don’t have recourse

To go after additional assets held by the shareholders. For example,  if debt holders have recourse to go after assets of shareholders such that shareholders can actually lose more money than they put into the corporation,  then managers are less likely to invest in – NPV projects on behalf of shareholders when the corporation is in financial distress,  that is,  projects which would otherwise transfer wealth from debt holders to shareholders.

Limited liability gives shareholders the option to default,  and thus we can think of shareholders as owning a call option on the assets of the corporation. From the debtholder viewpoint,  we can think of the debt holders as owning the corporation and selling a call option on the firm’s assets to the shareholders. Alternatively,  we can think of the debt holders as owning a risk-free bond and have sold a put option to the shareholders giving the shareholders the right to put the assets back to the debt holders.

Unlike shareholders,  debt holders don’t have a board of directors to act on their behalf ; rather debt holders are protected by a legal contract known as an indenture and the courts. Over the years,  the courts have recognized the existence of the agency costs of debt and have primarily ruled that when a corporation becomes insolvent,  and even in the “zone of insolvency ,  ” the manager s owe a duty to the creditors and not merely to the shareholders.

A key takeaway of our knowledge of agency costs and capital structure is that firms are reluctant to issue new equity when in financial distress as the proceeds likely go to the debt holders. This lecture note will consider equity issues for firms not in financial distress.

# PREVIEW OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND INFORMATION ASYMMETRY

In perfect capital markets,  outside investors have access to the same information set as management and other insiders. Of course,  this assumption doesn’t hold up well in the real world . Managers know what earnings the day before the earnings release will be,  they have superior information concerning product launches,  they know firsthand what is taking place in merger negotiations,  all well before outside investors learn of the resulting information,  and thus information asymmetry is simply a given in real-world corporate finance.

Consider bluebird bio,  a bio pharmaceutical firm based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts which focuses on gene therapy to cure rare diseases. Bluebird bio has had several products in the pipeline,  but none of these products provided material revenue before 2020. Since bluebird bio went public in 2013,  it has issued equity several times. Below,  we discuss one of bluebird bio ’s equity issue s which occurred in December 2017. After the 4 pm EST close of the stock market on December 11,  2017,  bluebird distributed a press release which conveyed the following:

“ bluebird bio,  Inc.,  a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to developing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer,  today announced that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of \$600 million of its common stock. Bluebird bio also intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{I}}={\mathcal{K}}$ of the shares of common stock offered in the public offering. All of the shares in the proposed offering are to be sold by bluebird bio. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,  BofA Merrill Lynch,  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Cowen are acting as joint book-running managers of the proposed offering. The offering is subject to market and other conditions,  and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the offering may be completed,  or as to the actual size or terms of the offering.”

The stock price of bluebird bio closed at $\S 201.80$ on December 11,  2017 and had risen over $126\%$ in just a little over four months since August 1,  when it closed at $\S 89.15$ . For comparison,  over the same period,  the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index increased only $1\%$ . The underwriters were successful in placing the new shares of bluebird bio to the public the next day,  selling the intended 3,  243,  244 shares for gross proceeds of $\S 600$ million. For their services in placing the shares,  the underwriters received commissions of $\S 30$ million,  or five percent of the total gross proceeds. In addition to the commissions paid to the underwriters,  bluebird bio incurred legal fees associated with the offering.

The underwriters set the offering price at $\Updownarrow 185.00,  $ ,  well below the closing price of $\S 201.80$ on December 11; thus,  the issue realized under pricing of $8.3\%$ relative to the December 11 closing price. The stock market responded negatively to the announcement of the offering,  declining to $\S 190.95$ on December 12,  thus a $5.38\%$ decline relative to the day prior. Moreover,  the under pricing was also a meaningful $3.12\%$ relative to the closing price on December 12,  that is,  the $\S 185.00$ relative to the $\S 190.95$ closing price after the stock market responded to the announcement.

In perfect capital markets,  stock prices should not change in response to the announcement of an equity issue. If the purpose of the equity issue to finance a specific investment or project,  the stock price response responds to the unexpected amount of the NPV resulting from the project,  but it should not move based on the fact that the firm decided to finance the project with equity. Also,  there are no transactions costs associated with equity issues in perfect capital markets.

# THEORY: INFORMATION ASYMMETRY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

While the 1958 seminal paper on capital structure by Modigliani and Miller ushered in the modern era of corporate finance,  it was another twenty years before researchers began to formally address the importance of information asymmetry for investment decisions and the choice of equity or debt to finance those real investments. The seminal work started on information asymmetry and capital structure

Started with discussions between Stewart Myers (MIT professor) and Nicholas Majluf (then a Ph. D. Student in corporate strategy at MIT) in 1978. It was another six years in 1984 before they were successful in publishing their paper in an academic journal. Since publication,  their joint work has generally been viewed as the most influential research about equity issues and information asymmetry.

Outside of the initial public offering and an occasional stock merger,  new primary equity issues are infrequent. The goal of Myers and Majluf was to understand the reluctance by public corporation ns to issue equity. According to Modigliani and Miller,  management should be in different to issuing equity versus debt. And according to the trade-off theory of capital structure,  there is an optimal level of debt which weighs the benefits of interest tax shields and the costs of financial distress. That is,  when the present value of the cost of financial distress exceeds the present value of the tax shields,  then firms should issue equity to finance projects,  assuming of course the firm isn’t in financial distress in which case management is less likely to issue equity due to the debt overhang problem as discussed earlier.

Myers and Majluf built a model of a firm with assets in place and a project under consideration. As with most theories,  the assumptions matter:

(1) No taxes or transactions costs (2) Investors are rational (3) No market imperfections

In contrast to Modigliani and Miller,  Myers and Majuf do not assume that investors have the same information as do managers,  rather managers often have private information unknown to outside investors. Moreover,  it is costly for managers to reveal the information asymmetry for a variety of reasons. Below,  the lecture note illustrates their model using the fictional firm,  ASYMMETRY. Rather than demonstrating via a formal mathematical model,  I do so via an example (they do both in their research) which will more than suffice for our purposes in this class and your career.

ASYMMETRY has a $^+$ NPV project,  PROJECT,  that it needs to undertake immediately,  else the opportunity will vanish. To finance PROJECT,  ASYMMETRY will need to raise shares; that is,  it does not have any excess cash or access to debt financing. So far in this course,  if a firm issues new equity,  it does so at zero NPV. That is,  managers can’t create value or destroy value by issuing new equity.

For simplicity,  assume the model has three dates,  $\mathsf{T}=\,  -\mathsf{1},  \,   0,  $ ,  and $+1$ . In the first date,  $\mathsf{T}={}-1$ ,  there is no information asymmetry; in $\mathsf{T}=0$ ,  managers possess proprietary information about its existing assets-inplace which is unknown to outside investors; and in date $\mathsf{T}=+\mathsf{\Omega},  $ ,  the proprietary information is made public to the outside investors.

The upfront investment required for PROJECT is 45.0,  and the NPV is $+5.0$ . Assume management can convey all proprietary information about PROJECT to the outside investors; that is,  there is no information asymmetry about PROJECT. Since PROJECT has a positive NPV of 5.0,  management will immediately undertake PROJECT and invest the 45.0.

For ASYMMETRY’s existing operations ,  labeled as Assets-In-Place,  there are two outcomes with $50\%$ likelihood each.

ASYMMETRY’s Assets -In-Place ( $\daleth=-1$ and $\mathsf{T}=0,  $

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/59cb29452b8ee64d31ac7537f5e1d7c5fd4f4f0fedf5d54563cb193bd3bdb795.jpg)

As shown above,  the value of Assets-in-Place is 100.0 in both periods,  $\mathsf{T}=\mathsf{-1}$ and $\mathsf{T}=0$ . But in $\mathsf{T}=0,  $ ,  management has proprietary information about which state of the world will occur,  and management will inform the outside investors in $\mathsf{T}={+1}$ as to the true state of the world.

Begin by assuming that management will issue stock to finance PROJECT irrespective of which state of the world occurs. That is,  management chooses to accept the project regardless of the value of the Assets-InPlace. Thus,  in $\mathsf{T}=0$ ,  management announces PROJECT,  and the value of ASYMMETRY increases from 100.0 to 105.0,  reflecting the NPV of $+5.0$ associated with PROJECT.

ASYMMETRY will immediately issue new shares worth 45.0 to the new shareholders,  resulting in a new firm value of 150.0. That is,

$$
\mathsf{V_{A S Y M M E T R Y}}=\mathsf{V_{O R I G I N A L\; S H A R E S}}\,  +\,  \mathsf{V_{N E W\; S H A R E S}}
$$  

$$
150.0=105.0+45.0
$$  

Or,

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{V_{A S Y M M E T R Y}}=\mathsf{V_{A S S E T S-I N-P L A C E}}+\mathsf{V_{P R O J E C T}}}\\ &{}\\ &{150.0=100.0+50.0}\end{array}
$$  

Where the value of PROJECT is the sum of the investment and the NPV in the project:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{P R O J E C T}}=\mathsf{I}_{\mathsf{P R O J E C T}}+\mathsf{N P V}_{\mathsf{P R O J E C T}}}\\ &{}\\ &{50.0=45.0+5.0}\end{array}
$$  

At $\mathsf{T}=0,  $ ,  with the announcement of PROJECT and the simultaneous issue of new shares,  the original shareholders will own $70\%$ (105.0/150.0) of ASYMMETRY,  and the new shareholders will own $30\%$ (45.0/150.0) of ASYMMETRY.

From the viewpoint of the new investors,  the shares are priced correctly. For example,  the value of ASYMMETRY was 100.0 initially. Then ASYMMETRY announced PROJECT with $+\mathsf{N P V}$ of 5.0,  all of which accrues to the original shareholders. Thus,  at the announcement of PROJECT,  the value of the firm immediately increases to 105.0. Simultaneously,  ASYMMETRY issues new equity of 45.0. Since

ASYMMETRY chooses to issue stock in both states of the world,  the issuance in and of itself doesn’t convey any information to the new shareholders. The resulting new value of ASYMMETRY is 150.0.

The payoffs,  as made public in $\mathsf{T}+\mathsf{\Omega},  $ ,  to the original shareholders and new shareholders are displayed below. These payoffs are a function of the value of ASYMMETRY and the percentage ownership stakes. For example,  if the firm ends up in the bad state (State 1),  the resulting firm value is 130.0,  and the original shareholders own 91.0 $(70\%)$ of ASYMMETRY,  and the new shareholders own 39.0 $(30\%)$ of ASYMMETRY.

Payoffs to Original and New Investors if Investing in PROJECT

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/025731d6d68b7c6f239df27d1539c1b26c3ac8357a8e2eef19b058e80c14580f.jpg)

As noted above,  new shareholders are willing to invest 45.0 million in ASYMMETRY and own $30\%$ of the firm as they assume management will issue shares irrespective of which state of the world. Recall that management,  however,  knows in $\mathsf{T}=0$ which state of the world the firm is in and will not reveal until $^{\textsf{T}+}$ 1. If management acts on behalf of the current shareholders,  they will compare the wealth of the original shareholders under the two states of the world based on issuing new stock versus not issuing new stock to finance PROJECT. The table below displays the payoffs to the original investors from investing versus not investing in PROJECT.

Payoffs to Original Investor from Investing or Not Investing in PROJECT

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e9214489c0da1d53d8b0e0a0d022396e94e7d14bf5ad2384bf0111c691d5092b.jpg)

The original shareholders,  specifically the only shareholders when management contemplates a decision to accept or reject PROJECT,  are better off if management bypasses the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ investment if management knows ASYMMETRY is in State 2. That is,  in period $\intercal+1$ ,  the ownership stake held by the original shareholders is worth 120.0 if management bypasses PROJECT versus 119.0 if management accepts PROJECT and raises 45.0 from the new shareholders. Thus,  management issue new shares only if they know ASYMMETRY is in State 1. New shareholders,  who are rational per the model,  recognize management will issue and invest only in State 1. Consequently,  new shareholders will assume the firm is in State 1 and thus assign a value of 80.0 to the Assets-In-Place.

In this model,  management will optimally bypass a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ if the firm is substantially undervalued in the market to avoid issuing stock at too low a price. Of course,  there are times where the project has such a large $+\mathsf{N P V}$ that it still makes sense for management to accept the project and invest as it more than compensates for selling the stock at too low a price.

We can think of financial slack in a corporation as cash on hand and an available line of credit or immediate debt capacity. Given information asymmetry,  financial slack has option value as it allows a firm to invest in a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ project where the firm might otherwise reject if forced to issue undervalued stock. In the real world,  many large prominent companies maintain financial slack to solve this problem of information asymmetry.

If management can convey its proprietary information to investors,  the problem of under investment in $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects will immediately disappear. But due to agency costs,  investors don’t necessarily believe managers as some managers are inclined to cheat. And importantly,  revealing the information is costly for several reasons ranging from disclosing proprietary information to competitors and the time and energy it takes to convey the information to the shareholders.

The pecking order theory is the result of information asymmetry. Namely,  firms finance projects primarily with retained earnings and access to lines of credit,  plus new issues of debt. When the firm runs out of debt capacity,  e.g.,  when bankruptcy and agency costs of debt become large,  it is usually at this juncture when firms are forced to resort to financing via new equity issues. But when firms end up in financial distress,  the cost of debt overhangs makes it problematic to issue new equity since the benefit is often only to the debt holders rather than to the shareholders. In aggregate,  firms rely on retained earnings for about $75\%$ of its financings to grow and the rest is with new debt issues,  thus largely no financing from new equity issues.

As illustrated by the bluebird bio example at the beginning of this lecture note,  bluebird bio issued new equity after its stock price had risen sharply,  and its stock sharply declined in response to the new equity issue announcement. This finding generalizes to larger samples across thousands of firms and through time. On average,  the issuer’s stock price increases during the several months prior to a new equity issue and then declines roughly $3\%$ at the announcement of the equity issue. In many respects,  the $3\%$ decline does not seem substantial relative to the volatility of stock prices,  etc.,  but it fails to capture the under pricing aspect of issuing new equity as illustrated in the bluebird bio example. More importantly,  there is extremely severe sample selection bias with respect to new equity issuers. That is,  for most firms which issue new equity,  they are somewhat able to mitigate the information asymmetry problem by being able to release the relevant information to new investors at a relatively low cost. Otherwise,  they simply bypass the project and the new equity issue,  and thus we do not have empirical evidence on what the stock price reaction would have been to non-equity issuers if they had chosen to announce and issue. However,  firms which are hit with sudden needs for cash to survive and can only do so via raising new equity are forced to realize enormous discounts of often $20\%$ and even higher.

The pecking order theory is straightforward. Due to information asymmetry,  corporations first use retained earnings to finance new projects,  then lines of credit,  followed by new debt issues,  and lastly,  equity. The pecking order theory comes from a strong area of economic research known as signaling or adverse selection theory. Most of us are familiar with the lemons principle as formulated by George Akerlof (1970),  winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics. Akerlof proved how markets can partially fail when potential buyers are unable to verify the quality of the product they are buying. Akerlof applied the adverse selection theory to the used car market. Car owners tend to sell cars which they do not like versus cars which they like. Buyers recognize this adverse selection on the part of sellers and thus will only pay low prices. The result is that lower-quality cars are sold in the used car market and at low discounted prices. The Myers and Majluf theory which extends the work of Akerlof is more interesting and complex as the information asymmetry does not necessarily involve the project for which the financing is required,  rather the asymmetry is about the already existing assets-in-place which are not being sold and need no financing.

Despite all of the focus on the stock market and the creation of shareholder wealth,  corporations are hesitant to issue new equity. This lecture note focuses on the information asymmetry problem which severely constrains new equity issues. That is,  managers are not inclined to issue equity if they believe the company’ stock is undervalued. And if stock is issued,  investors expect the worse. In the prior module,  we saw that shareholders are generally unwilling to provide additional equity financing when the firm is in financial distress as the funds are redistributed to the bond holders.

This is not to say that equity issues don’t occur. For instance,  a stock merger includes the issuance of new equity. And new equity is issued with respect to the exercise of employee stock-option plans. Notably,  for these types of equity issues,  the information asymmetry is mitigated by the fact that the recipients are more likely to possess the same information as management. That is,  as part of their initial due diligence in reaching a definitive agreement to merge,  acquirers will gain a far better understanding about the value of the target firm relative to other outside shareholders. And in the case of employee stock options,  at least the higher-ranking employees will also benefit from their information flow. And by far,  the most profile new equity issue is the initial public offering (IPO) for companies. The direct underwriting fees on large IPOs,  those greater than $\S\,   1$ billion in issue size,  are generally around $4\%$ in today’s market.

In some infrequent cases,  companies go public via a direct listing rather than the traditional IPO process where an underwriter is employed. A high-profile case involved that of Spotify which listed directly on the NYSE in 2018. With the Spotify direct listing,  there was no accompanying designated raise of capital by either the company itself or its investors. Rather,  Spotify simply became listed,  thereby allowing its existing shareholders to freely sell their shares on the stock exchange.

Notably,  this lecture note has not yet mentioned the ugly word which comes to mind with respect to issuing new equity,  that is,  “dilution.” Corporate managers,  business reporters,  pundits of all types,  and even many students who excel at Chicago Booth,  terribly misunderstand dilution. In essence,  the big concern is that if a company issues new shares of stock,  it can reduce the value of the existing shareholders’ wealth and simply due to a reduction in their proportional holdings in the company. But this concern is baseless,  assuming of course that investors prefer more wealth to less wealth.

Consider two paths which management could take. The first path is to issue new shares to finance a $^+$ NPV project. Granted,  this path reduces the proportional ownership of shareholders who choose not to participate in the equity offering,  but their wealth is higher assuming that the benefits from the project exceed any signally or issuing costs with the new equity. The alternative path is to reduce CAPX,  that just happens to generate $+\mathsf{N P V},  $ ,  and repurchase shares with the cash. This path is accretive in terms of the share ownership for investing not choosing to tender their shares. However,  it is wealth destructive.

ECONOMIC DILUTION IS DUE TO SELLING UNDERVALUED STOCK.

# CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES

Most external financing of large corporations is either of straight debt (or bank loans) and of common equity (for stock mergers,  IPOs,  etc.,  as noted above). Other corporate financings include convertible securities (debentures and preferred),  preferred equity,  and warrants. Historically,  convertible debentures have been an important source of financing for firms with negative or volatile cash flows and often with expected high future growth. Despite convertibles having been around for decades,  many market participants,  including some issuers and bankers,  do not appear to have a rudimentary understanding of how convertible debentures are valued.

An often-used explanation given for the issuance of a convertible security is that they provide the best of both worlds,  that is,  convertibles pay a lower interest rate than straight debt on one hand and they provide an opportunity to issue new equity at a premium to the current stock price on the other hand. A survey of corporate executives reveals that in nearly $60\%$ of the cases,  management viewed a convertible security as an inexpensive way to issue delayed stock and in over $40\%$ of the cases viewed convertibles as cheaper than straight debt. This explanation is intuitive and appealing at first glance. But the logic implies corporations can issue convertible debentures at prices rich relative to straight debt or common equity. Indeed,  this line of thinking violates Proposition I of Modigliani and Miller. The explanation accounts for only one side of the equation. While it is true that a convertible debenture pays a lower interest rate than straight debt,  it also pays a higher interest rate than that on straight equity (zero) and thus is worse than issuing equity in the downside scenario as it still contains an indenture which gives the convertible holder priority over the equity holders. And if the company does exceedingly well after the issuance of the convertible,  it is true that it is better to have issued the convertible at a higher price due to the conversion than if issuing straight equity,  but it would have been even better to have issued straight debt.

We will view a convertible debenture not only in the context of a Modigliani and Miller world,  but will also relax assumptions of taxes,  financial distress costs,  and information asymmetry,  to show why convertible debentures exist,  even if not mispriced as suggested by the popular explanation. In addition,  we consider there are instances where convertibles can become mispriced and largely due to issues involving liquidity,  a concept not frequently studied in corporate finance as corporate finance is often studied in a vacuum isolated from capital markets.

# CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES AND MODERN FINANCE THEORY

In the lecture note,  Introduction to Capital Structure,  the focus was on the choice of debt versus equity and did not consider hybrid securities such as convertible debentures. But by understanding the Modigliani and Miller propositions,  we know that in a perfect world without market frictions and imperfections,  the issuance of a convertible debenture to either replace a corresponding amount of debt or equity,  or even both,  will have no impact on the overall value of the corporation. An investor can easily create a mimicking portfolio of a straight corporate debenture and equity options (or delta hedged shares). And with respect to Proposition II,  if the convertible debenture is issued to replace straight corporate debt,  it will decrease the expected return on equity,  though not as much as an equity issue would. And if the convertible debenture is used to replace straight equity,  it will increase the riskiness of equity,  though not as much as if straight corporate debt was issued.

As shown in follow-up lectures to the Modigliani and Miller propositions,  the assumptions are key. For example,  the tax treatment of interest favors debt financing,  all else held constant. Likewise,  we can show that convertible debentures often play an important role in the capital structure of many corporations,  specifically to mitigate agency costs and information asymmetry. As discussed below,  there are cases in which a convertible debenture can be a more efficient form of financing than straight corporate debt and other cases where a convertible debenture is a preferable form of financing to straight equity. We will discuss the case of a convertible debenture as an alternative to straight debt.

Consider an industrial biotechnology firm such as Amyris which engineers organisms to manufacture renewable products. Due to a high degree of uncertainty about its ability to generate positive cash flows,  the stock price of Amyris is highly volatile with annualized volatility of about $80\%$ . If Amyris were to issue straight debt,  it may have to pay an abnormally high interest rate due to its high risk. Indeed,  even if Amyris ever becomes profitable,  it could still be close to financial distress given the volatility of its cash flows. As we saw in the Agency Costs and Capital Structure lecture note,  firms in financial distress find it difficult to raise debt financing due to the possibility of asset substitution and risk shifting on behalf of the shareholders. The same difficulty in raising debt can be true of firms not even in financial distress,  rather those which aren’t far away from financial distress given their high level of volatility. With a stock return volatility of $80\%,  $ there is a moderate probability that Amyris would encounter financial distress,  thus likely restricting the firm from even raising debt capital in the first place.

To add further realism to the above example,  suppose there is considerable uncertainty about the overall risk level of the corporation. Indeed,  there may be strong disagreements about the level of risk between management and potential debt holders. Whereas Amyris management might think that the overall asset volatility is only $50\%,  $ ,  potential bond holders might think it is much higher,  and thus it can be relatively difficult to agree on the appropriate coupon rate for the debt. Importantly,  it is not simply that there might be disagreement over the current level of volatility,  but also in case management were to alter the overall level of business risk down the road. As theorized by Brennan and Schwartz (1988),  if the firm were instead to issue a convertible debenture,  the holders of the convertible would be somewhat immune to the uncertainty regarding the overall risk of the corporation. That is,  the negative impact of the risk on the cost of the debt component of the convertible is offset by the positive impact on the equity option component of the convertible. Put differently,  volatility reduces the value of debt,  but increases the value of options. Indeed,  this logic implies that two firms with different levels of risk might end up issuing convertible debentures with nearly identical terms,  including the coupon payments.

Stein (1992) developed a complementary theory to the previous work of Brennan and Schwartz (1988). According to Stein,  small,  growth firms are often unable to raise debt efficiently due to high financial distress costs. Many of these firms prefer to issue equity,  but not at the current stock price if management believes the stock is undervalued. Moreover,  as we discussed earlier,  an equity issue will typically cause investors to anticipate that the current stock price is overvalued,  thereby driving the stock price down. In Stein’s model,  management of the convertible is suer is confident that the cost of financial distress is low,  that is,  management is optimistic that investors will not redeem the convertible for cash at maturity. In fact,  Stein’s model posits that management believes they will be able to call the convert tible at a future date and thereby force the holders to convert to equity at the higher conversion price relative to the stock price at issue. Thus,  the issuance of a convertible debenture doesn’t communicate a negative signal about the current stock price as a regular equity issue would.

# Dividend Policy

“Companies are returning a lot of money to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. And a lot of people say that’s not a good use of capital. I think that’s normal reallocation of capital.” 1

# INTRODUCTION TO DIVIDEND POLICY

This lecture note provides a broad overview to dividend policy,  covering the following topics:

1. Valuation of stocks with the dividend-discount model 2. Mechanics of dividends 3. The impact of dividend policy in perfect capital markets 4. Dividends and taxes 5. Dividends as a signaling mechanism 6. Dividends versus share repurchase s.

A dividend is a primary mechanism for returning cash to shareholders. Most mature and profitable firms pay regular cash dividends. There are exceptions,  notably,  Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. Per the quote above,  Jeff Bezos,  way back in 1997,  stressed cash flows over earnings. Nothing has changed on this point during the past twenty-four years. And Amazon has yet to pay a cash dividend despite a market capitalization of over $\S 1.0$ trillion as of February 2023.

The value of an asset is the summation of the expected future cash flows discounted at the appropriate discount rate. Likewise,  a firm’s value is the summation of the expected future cash flows discounted at the firm’s cost of capital. For a stock,  the expected future cash flows to a shareholder are the dividends the firm will pay out over its expected life. Shareholders also think of terms of selling the stock and realizing expected capital gains (or losses). That is,  the expected return to the stock over the next year is:

$$
\mathsf{E x p e c t e d\,   R e t u m\,   o n\,   S h a r e\,   o f\,   S t o c k}=\mathsf{E}[\,  \mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{s}}]=\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}\mathsf{I}\mathsf{V}_{1}]}{\mathsf{P}_{0}}+\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{1}]\!-\!\mathsf{P}_{0}}{\mathsf{P}_{0}}
$$  

According to Equation 1,  the expected return on the share of stock this year is equal to the sum of the expected dividend and the expected capital gain on holding the stock,  all divided by the current stock price. For example,  the dividend yield on the average stock in the Dow 30 is roughly $1.9\%$ . If the expected capital gain on the average Dow 30 stock is $6.9\%$ ,  then the expected return is equal to $8.8\%$ .

We can rewrite Equation 1 as the derivation of the current stock price:

$$
\mathsf{P}_{\mathfrak{o}}\,  =\,  \frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}\mathsf{I}_{1}]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{s}}\right]}\!+\!\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{1}]}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathfrak{s}}]}
$$  

Equation 2 expresses that the current price of a stock is equal to the expected dividend at the end of the year and the price of the stock at the end of the year,  all discounted at the stock’s cost of equity capital. And the cost of equity capital on the stock is simply the expected return on other stocks with the same risk,  else the law of one price would not hold,  and thus arbitrage would occur.

Given we can express the current price as a function of the expected dividend this year and the price at the end of next year,  we can do the same for the expected price at the end of next year:

$$
\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{1}]=\mathsf{\frac{E[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{2}]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right]}\!+\!\frac{E[\mathsf{P}_{2}]}{\left[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right]}}
$$  

That is,  at the end of the year,  the shareholder looking to determine the price,  $\mathsf{P}_{1},  $ will estimate the dividend,  $\mathsf{D I V}_{2},  $ at the end of year two as well as the price,  $\mathsf{P}_{2},  $ at the end of year 2,  and discount back one period to obtain $\mathsf{P}_{1}$ . And likewise,  we can express today’s price as a function of the expected dividends for the next two years and the price at the end of the second year:

$$
\mathsf{P}_{0}=\;\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{1}]}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]}\;+\;\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{2}]}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]^{2}}\;+\;\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{2}]}{[1+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]^{2}}
$$  

Expanding over the expected life of the corporation,  which is infinity,  absent bankruptcy or a merger,  we can express the current price as the summation of the discounted expected future dividends as well as a liquidating price in the final period (which can extend to infinity). That is,  as shown in Equation 5:

$$
\mathsf{P}_{0}=\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{1}]}{[\mathsf{I}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]}\,  +\,  \frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{2}]}{[\mathsf{I}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]^{2}}\,  +\,  \frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{3}]}{\left[\mathsf{I}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right]^{3}}\,  +\,  \ldots\,  +\,  \frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{F}}]}{\left[\mathsf{I}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right]^{\mathrm{F}}}\,  +\,  \frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{F}}]}{\left[\mathsf{I}+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}\right]^{\mathrm{F}}}
$$  

$$
\mathsf{P}_{0}=\;\Sigma\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{D}|\mathsf{V}_{\mathrm{i}}]}{[1\!+\!\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]^{\mathrm{i}}}\;+\;\frac{\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{P}_{\mathrm{e}}]}{[1+\mathsf{R}_{\mathrm{s}}]^{\mathsf{F}}}
$$  

Equation 5 is simply the discounted cash-flow formula for a stock. And even though Amazon hasn’t paid a dividend since going public in 1997,  it has a high stock valuation because of the expectation of high dividends in the future,  even if at a far-off date. While the dividend-discount model is theoretically the correct way to value a stock,  this doesn’t mean it is as feasible for say a company like Amazon where other stock valuation models may be employed.

# MECHANICS OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS

In our context,  the term,  dividend,  usually refers to a cash dividend,  though some companies issue stock dividends. For those public corporations which pay cash dividends,  the frequency is typically quarterly and sometimes supplemented by an extra or a special dividend.

For an example of the mechanics of a dividend payment,  Goldman Sachs declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\S 2.50$ per common share on January 13,  2023,  payable on March 30,  2023,  to shareholders of record on March 2,  2023. To ensure there is no uncertainty about whether or a not an investor owns the shares on March 2,  2023,  Goldman’s stock will trade ex-dividend one business days before the record date. That is,  if an investor purchases shares in Goldman’s stock on or after March 2,  2023,  she will not receive the $\S 2.50$ cash dividend payable on March 30,  2023. Thus,  March 2,  2023 is the ex-dividend date (will not receive dividend) and March 1,  2023,  the day prior,  is the cum dividend date (will receive dividend).

# MILLER AND MODIGLIANI: DIVIDEND POLICY IN PERFECT Capital MARKETS

The prevailing wisdom,  whether in corporate boardrooms,  Main Street,  or on Wall Street,  is that dividend policy influences shareholder wealth. A common argument is that since CEOS can control dividend policy,  dividends are less risky than capital gains. As a result,  the commonly-held view is that dividend-paying stocks have a lower cost of capital,  and thus it benefits firms to pay dividends. An influential paper by Miller and Modigliani in 1961 issued a strong challenge to conventional wisdom. They show that under certain assumptions,  dividend policy does not alter firm value,  rather firm value is driven by the operating assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.

“Like many other propositions in economics,  the irrelevance of dividend policy,  given investment policy,  is obvious once you think of it. It is,  after all,  merely one more instance of the general principle that there are no financial illusions in a rational and perfect economic environment. Values there are determined solely by real considerations—in this case the earnings power of the firm’s assets and its investment policy—and not by how the fruits of the earnings power are packaged for distribution.” (p. 414,  Miller and Modigliani,  1961).

Miller and Modigliani did not necessarily seek to discredit the views of practitioners who had strong priors as to the importance of dividend policy. Instead,  their primary objective was to understand when and why dividend policy matters,  and to do so,  it is necessary,  to begin with restrictive assumptions:

(1) Perfect capital markets: there are no taxes or transactions costs; all investors have access to the same information set (no information asymmetry) (2) Rational behavior: investors prefer to maximize wealth and are in different to how wealth arises.

To illustrate the Miller and Modigliani theory on dividend policy,  consider the fictional firm,  ALLEQUITY,  which has a market capitalization of $\S 1$ billion with a stock price of $\S 20$ per share and 50 million outstanding shares. Given the name,  ALLEQUITY does not have any debt outstanding. Due to steady growth,  ALLEQUITY reinvests all of its operating cash flows back into the business to expand. Moreover,  ALLEQUITY does not have any excess cash on its balance sheet. ALLEQUITY has never paid a dividend in its corporate life.

ALLEQUITY decides to end its no-dividend policy and plans to pay a one-time dividend of $\S 0.50$ per share to its existing shareholders. Given ALLEQUITY has no excess cash,  it will finance the dividend by issuing new shares,  and the new shareholders,  or existing shareholders wishing to add to their positions,  will not receive the $\S 0.50$ dividend on the new shares. Table 1 depicts the $\S 0.50$ per share dividend financed by the new equity issue.

Table 1

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5379a78fbf2b5f35bb7e6a327ae029525bf3091fd447380d422e961205022bb4.jpg)

As shown in Table 1,  the equity issue will only be subscribed at $\S 19.50$ (or less,  in which case it would be over subscribed and thus pushing the price up to $\S 19.50)$ since the new shares will not be entitled to the dividend,  and therefore will be treated as ex-dividend. Given 50 million shares are outstanding,  ALLEQUITY will raise 1.28 million new shares to finance the $\S 0.50$ dividend. Note that on April 22,  the total market value of $\S\,   1$ billion does not incorporate the $\S 25$ million raise from the new equity issue as that cash is restricted,  that is,  for the cash dividend.

From the viewpoint of an original investor who owned 100 shares in ALLEQUITY,  the value of their holdings was $\mathbb{S}2{,  }000$ before the dividend payment. Afterward,  they held the same amount of shares,  but at a stock price of $\S 19.50,  $ ,  and thus the value of their holdings has declined to $\S 1{,  }950$ . But due to the cash dividend payout,  they have $\S 50.00$ additional cash,  therefore still the same amount of wealth,  $\mathbb{S}2,  000,  $ ,  as the case before the dividend payment.

Given zero taxes in the Miller and Modigliani model,  the stock price will drop by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date,  else arbitrage will occur. That is,  if stock prices decline by less than the dividend,  then arb it rage urs will buy shares the day beforehand,  collect the dividend and receive a capital loss less than the amount of the dividend. And if the stock price declines more than the amount of the dividend,  then arb it rage urs short the stock the day before,  realize a gain on their short position which more than offsets the amount of the dividend they have to pay as a result of shorting the stock.

Miller and Modigliani conclude that dividend policy does not create value given the assumptions. Specifically,  a firm’s value is driven by the value of the assets-in-place and growth options on the lefthand side of the balance sheet rather than by the disbursement of the resulting cash flows.

The prevailing wisdom when Miller and Modigliani published their seminal work on dividend policy,  and still expressed today by many practitioners,  is that dividends are less risky than capital gains and thus lead to higher share prices,  all else held constant. The notion is that a lower discount rate can be attached to the near-term dividend stream versus the capital gains and hence,  the creation of shareholder value on

The right-hand side of the balance sheet. That is,  if management has more control over the dividend payout than over the stock price,  the argument is that the cost of capital can be lowered by paying dividends. But if the firm can reduce the cost of capital for the original shareholders,  then it is offsetting this reduction with an increase in the cost of capital for the new shareholders. However,  there is no reason for new shareholders to bear more risk than what they are being compensated for. Moreover,  if shareholders wish to manufacture dividends,  they can do so and even for stocks which don’t pay dividends. That is,  it is relatively costless for shareholders to sell shares for a non-dividend payout firm and thus mimic the dividend policy of a firm which pays dividends. To this point,  the Miller and Modigliani dividend arguments mirror their prior work on capital structure whereby investors can replicate a firm’s capital structure at no cost.

It is the case that dividend-paying stocks tend to have a lower cost of capital than stocks which do not pay dividends. But this is not driven by dividend policy,  rather it is driven by the lower riskiness of the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. For example,  utility firms have low cost of capital and high dividend yields. The low cost of capital is driven by the relatively low asset beta of utility firms,  not by a high dividend yield. And given the tangible nature of the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet,  utility firms tend to pay out their cash flows as dividends. That is,  dividend policy is endogenous to the underlying risk of the assets on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.

# DIVIDENDS AND TAX POLICY

Miller and Modigliani chose to assume zero taxes in their model,  not because of naivety,  rather because they recognized that taxes do matter and thus can significantly influence dividend policy. Historically,  dividends have been taxed at a higher rate than capital gains. Since 2013,  however,  dividends and capital gains have both been taxed at the rate of $23.8\%$ . Given capital gains are deferred until the shares of stock are sold,  indeed can be deferred indefinitely,  capital gains still hold a tax advantage over dividends.

To illustrate the impact of taxes on dividends,  consider the generic firm,  DIVIDEND,  with the following assumptions:

(a) All investors face a marginal tax rate of $23.8\%$ on dividends and capital gains (b) All investors are strictly buy-and-hold,  thus no realization of capital gains (c) DIVIDEND has expected cash flows of $\S 200$ million per year (d) DIVIDEND has zero expected growth,  and net income equals cash flow (e) DIVIDEND returns all cash flows to its shareholders (f) Shareholders have excess capital losses to shield any taxes on capital gains (g) Investors require an after-tax return of $8.0\%$ (h) There is no debt.

Initially assume DIVIDEND does not distribute cash flows as dividends,  rather repurchase s shares each year to return excess cash to shareholders. Assuming no growth,  the value of DIVIDEND is: 9

$$
\mathsf{V}=\S 2.5\;\mathsf{b i l i o n}=\frac{\S 200\;\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{0.08}
$$  

Suppose DIVIDEND decides to pay out $50\%$ of its net income as dividends and will repurchase shares to distribute the residual cash flows to the shareholders. Thus,  rather than re purchasing $\S 200$ million of stock from its shareholders,  DIVIDEND will pay $\S 100$ million via dividends and the residual $\S 100$ million via share repurchase s.

Since shareholders value after-tax returns,  DIVIDEND’s decision to institute a dividend reduces shareholder wealth. From the context of the shareholder,  the value of DIVIDEND is:

$$
\mathsf{V=S 2.2025\b i l i o n=\frac{\S 100\m i l i o n\times\Gamma[1-0.238]}{0.08}\,  +\,  \frac{\S 100\m i l i o n}{0.08}\,  }
$$  

Thus,  DIVIDEND’s decision to pay out $50\%$ of its net income in the form of dividends results in an $11.9\%$ decrease in its shareholder value due to cash flows now allocated to the IRS which otherwise would have gone to the shareholders. By assuming all investors face the marginal tax rate of $23.8\%$ and moreover that all capital gains can be offset with capital losses elsewhere,  these assumptions magnify the loss in value. If instead,  shareholders realize all capital gains annually and have no offsetting capital losses,  then there are no tax disadvantage to paying dividends.

The above analysis is based on after-tax stock returns,  whereas we observe pre-tax stock returns in financial markets. Thus,  if shareholders of DIVIDEND require an after-tax stock return of $8\%,  $ ,  the pre-tax expected stock return increases to $9.08\%$ after instituting the dividend,  that is:

$$
\mathsf{E}[\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{E}}]=9.08\%=\frac{\S 200~\mathsf{m i l i o n}}{\S 2.2025~\mathsf{b i l i o n}}
$$  

Academic researchers have found support for the tax argument that high-dividend yield firms realize higher returns than low-dividend yield firms. However,  the results are not nearly as dramatic as would be expected by the example above,  which assumes that all shareholders face a positive tax rate on dividends but can avoid taxes on capital gains. In reality,  taxable investors often realize capital gains on stocks 10 ,  thus decreasing the wedge between dividend payments and share repurchase s as a method to return capital to shareholders.

Tax rates vary substantially across investor groups. High net-worth investors in states such as California,  Illinois,  and New York,  for example,  have high marginal tax rates on dividends versus tax-free endowments and pension funds. Consequently,  high-tax rate investors are likely to avoid high dividend yielding stocks,  and the empirical evidence is consistent with this prediction. However,  not all retail investors avoid dividend stocks,  indeed there is a clientele of specific retail investors who wish to $"{\sf c l i p}"$ dividends,  thereby realizing taxes. Meanwhile,  institutional tax-free investors tend to load up relatively more on high dividend yielding stocks given they offer high-expected returns on a risk-adjusted basis than comparable lowdividend yielding firms. The net result of this clientele effect,  namely for tax-free institutions to buy highdividend yield stocks with relatively high pre-tax expected returns,  is to push their prices higher,  and thus returns lowers,  than if only taxable investors held these stocks.

In the extreme form,  tax-free investors don’t need to own the shares permanently,  instead purchase the shares of the high-dividend stocks on the cum-dividend date and then sell the shares on the ex-dividend date,  a practice referred to as dividend capture. Suppose DIVIDEND pays a quarterly dividend of $\S 0.50$ per share,  and initially,  only taxable investors hold the shares and face the marginal tax rate of $23.8\%$ . Given the $23.8\%$ tax rate,  DIVIDEND’s stock price will decline $\S 0.38$ on the ex-dividend date and thus create an arbitrage opportunity for tax-free investors. That is,  a tax-free investor will buy shares of DIIVIDEND at the close on the cum-dividend date and sell the shares at the open on the next day,  the ex-dividend date. To hedge out overnight systematic risk,  the arb it rage ur can short S&P 500 futures based on DIVIDEND’s beta. Ideally,  the arb it rage ur will capture the $\S 0.50$ dividend and realize a capital loss of $\S 0.38$ for an overall profit of $\S 0.12$ per share.

The above example is an extreme case of dividend arbitrage. In reality,  investors do not allow this arbitrage opportunity to persist as tax-free investors will bid up the stock well in advance of the exdividend date.

# DIVIDEND PAYOUT TRENDS

Historically,  firms have paid out roughly $50\%$ of their net earnings as dividends. Figure 1 displays the dividend-payout ratio for S&P 500 firms,  which shows a slight decline since World War II.

# Figure 1

Dividends tend to be quite sticky,  that is,  they mostly remain constant quarter to quarter. And as Table 2 illustrates,  dividend cuts are extremely uncommon.

Table 2 Annual Dividend Changes

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e180faa8f869864043f4fda7c7346594a34576569298d2fafead92eca0bef1bb.jpg)

Table 2 is consistent with recent survey evidence of financial executives who answered YES to the following questions: 12

(a) Try to avoid reducing the dividend: $94\%$ (b) Try to maintain a smooth dividend stream: $90\%$ (c) Reluctant to make a change that may have to be reversed: $78\%$ (d) Would prefer external funds versus dividend cut to undertake project: $65\%$

These recent survey results of financial executives are consistent with a classic survey paper by John Lintner of Harvard Business School over fifty years ago. Lintner found that CEOs prefer stable dividends with persistent growth and set dividends as a target percentage of earnings. Very little has changed since Lintner’s survey as CEOs exhibit a preference for stable dividends remain fairly constant,  raising them only when they are convinced that growth is long lasting and prefer not to cut dividends,  consistent with the empirical evidence on changes in dividends.

# DIVIDENDS AS SIGNALS

In perfect capital markets,  dividend announcements do not provide new information. For example,  Miller and Modigliani’s model of dividend policy assumes all investors possess the same information set,  that is,  shareholders are privy to the same information as possessed by management. Numerous academic studies have analyzed the stock price reaction to dividend announcements. When firms increase their dividends substantially,  stock prices increase $1{\it-}3\%$ surrounding the announcement. And when firms cut their dividends,  stock prices declines $5.8\%$ on average,  thus of a substantially larger magnitude.

A large amount of research has focused on the impact of dividends as signaling future profitability. Indeed,  the literature is so extensive that there are several academic papers which provide lengthy literature reviews and summaries of the massive empirical research on dividend policy. Overall,  the empirical results have been remarkably weak in establishing an empirical link between changes in dividends and subsequent changes in future profitability,  and thus,  the signaling models have somewhat fallen out of favor. More recent work documents that while dividend changes do not predict changes in future profitability,  dividend changes are predictive of the volatility of future profitability. For example,  cash-flow volatility decreases (increases) following increases (decreases) in dividend payouts. Indeed,  by focusing on the second moment rather than the first moment,  these results better help us interpret the survey evidence that managers are more likely to increase dividends when they are reasonably confident they will not have to decrease their dividends down the road.

When Miller and Modigliani wrote their paper on dividends,  share repurchase s were infrequently used by corporations,  but today share repurchase s are as important as dividends in returning excess cash to shareholders. We can think of share repurchase s as the opposite of equity issues.

Companies typically repurchase shares of common stock via open-market stock repurchase programs. For example,  on February 26,  2019,  Home Depot announced a $\S 15$ billion stock repurchase program which would take place over the next three years. Assuming no new share issuance,  this repurchase program would reduce Home Depot’s shares by over six percent during the next three years. Home Depot has been a serial re purchaser,  having repurchased over a third of its shares during the past ten years. Home Depot is not obligated to complete the program and can repurchase its shares just like any investor would,  though subject to certain restrictions. In March 2020,  Home Depot suspended its share repurchase program as part of several steps to shore up liquidity during the COVID-19 outbreak. In February 2021,  announced its resumption of the 2019 repurchase program and subsequently announced an extension of the share repurchase program in August 2022.

# Stock Buyback by REPURCHASE

In perfect capital markets,  shareholders are in different between the firm returning cash via dividends or repurchase s. That is,  there is no valuation impact for shareholder repurchase s as shareholders can replicate a share repurchase by selling her shares just like we saw with dividend policy that a shareholder can create or undo dividends. We demonstrate below via a simple example.

Consider REPURCHASE,  a firm with assets-in-place valued at $\S 1$ billion,  growth options valued at $\S 200$ million and excess cash of $\S 75$ million. Assume REPURCHASE has no debt,  and thus its market capitalization is $\S 1.275$ billion. With 50 million shares outstanding,  the current stock price is $\S 25.50$ . We label the cash of $\S 75$ million as excess cash; that is,  this cash is not necessary to fund the existing assetsin-place or even the growth options.

Table 3

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/135f046b7d6e3f0f4ebd9cb34485fb6de8afaebe626262075aac39b523df7300.jpg)

Suppose management wishes to distribute the excess cash to shareholders via a share repurchase program rather than increasing its dividend rate or paying a special dividend. Table 3 displays REPURCHASE’s market-value balance sheet information before and after the share repurchase. REPURCHASE buys back 2.94 million shares at the current price of $\S 25.50$ for a total repurchase amount of $\S 75$ million. Since we assume capital markets are perfect,  there is no information about the value of the assets-in-place or the value of the growth options,  and thus the repurchase announcement doesn’t signal any new information about the value of the firm. Consequently,  there is no share price impact.

# Taxes and Share Repurchase s (versus Dividends)

As discussed earlier in this lecture note,  dividend payout reduces the after-tax cash flows to taxable shareholders. With share repurchase s,  high tax-rate investors are not required to sell their shares in the open market when corporations engage in share repurchase programs. Consequently,  there is a tax advantage to share repurchase s versus dividends as a means of redistributing capital to shareholders.

Holding everything else constant,  a corporation which distributes all cash flows to shareholders via openmarket repurchase programs will have a higher valuation than an identical firm which distributes its cash flows via dividends since the after-tax cash flows will be higher for the firm which repurchase s its shares. But as we point out below,  dividend payout has signaling advantages relative to share repurchase s.

# Signaling and Share Repurchase s (versus Dividends)

Like dividends,  share repurchase s can signal private information known by management to external shareholders. If management believes the corporation’s shares are undervalued,  a share repurchase program announcement will convey management s’ belief. And assuming that management acts on behalf of its shareholders,  management will not announce a share repurchase program if they believe the shares are overvalued. Otherwise,  the share repurchase program benefits the selling shareholders at the expense of the long-term shareholder as a result of re purchasing overvalued stock. The average stock price reaction to share repurchase announcements is roughly 2-3 percent which is consistent with the notion that management believes their shares are undervalued when announcing these programs.

A key difference between the signal from a dividend initiation or a dividend increase from a share repurchase program is that changes in dividends tend to reflect information about long-term future earnings. As discussed earlier,  corporations tend to increase dividends when management is reliably confident about the long-term future cash flows of the corporation,  and thus the signal is often more material than the signal from a share repurchase program that the stock may temporarily undervalued. Moreover,  management is extremely hesitant to cut dividends,  whereas with share repurchase programs,  they tend to not always follow through and purchase the entire amount of shares allotted in the program when announced.

It has been over sixty years since Miller and Modigliani published their seminal work on dividend policy. The prevailing view at the time,  both in academia and in practice,  was that dividends are safer than capital gains and thus the payout of dividends increases firm value. Today,  in many corporations,  this view remains widely held,  and especially at the boardroom level,  namely that dividends are safer than capital gains. But this view is incorrect as shown by Miller and Modigliani.

Dividend policy surely matters else,  CEOs wouldn’t spend so much talking about dividend payout. Clearly,  the payment of dividends to taxable investors is value reducing,  all else equal,  but investors are rational and make optimal decisions,  that is,  taxable investors are less likely to hold high-dividend payout stocks. And while stock prices do respond significantly to changes in dividends,  researchers have been unable to find robust links between dividend changes and resulting changes in profitability. But this does not mean that management didn’t expect increased (decreased) profits when they increased (decreased) dividends,  instead,  profitability is driven by a multitude of factors and shocks which can result in considerable variability to profits.

Perhaps,  the most important takeaway from the theoretical work led by Miller and Modigliani and the enormous amount of subsequent empirical results is that what really matter with respect to creating shareholder wealth is for managers to invest (reject) in positive (negative) net present value projects as this is where value is created or destroyed. And the primary purpose of capital structure and distribution decisions is to support the value created on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.

# Financial Risk Management

Throughout this course,  we have discussed risk,  generally in the context of risk and return. We use basic summary statistics such as the standard deviation (“volatility”) as a measure of risk. For example,  the annual volatility of Tesla’s daily stock returns over the past five years is roughly $65\%$ . Meanwhile,  the annual volatility of the S&P 500 over this same period is about $22\%$ . I n terms of the CAPM,  Tesla’s equity beta to the S&P 500 is roughly 1.7 . Thus,  we can bifurcate Tesla’s historical equity volatility into systematic risk of $37\%$ ( $22\%$ X 1.7) and idiosyncratic risk of about $28\%$ . By comparison,  the annual volatility of Microsoft over the same period is $31\%,  $ less than the systematic component of Tesla’s volatility and slightly more than Tesla’s idiosyncratic risk . Another approach is to look at the total risk of Tesla’s enterprise and then further differentiate between the risk of Tesla’s debt versus its equity.

Should Tesla target a lower volatility for its equity risk? If Tesla can reduce the volatility of its stock returns from $65\%$ to $50\%$ for example,  does this risk reduction lead to an increase is shareholder wealth? That is,  does the high volatility of Tesla’s stock impede Tesla’s effort to “create the most compelling car company of the $21^{\mathfrak{s t}}$ century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles” ( Tesla Vision Statement)? Or instead,  is Tesla’s high stock price volatility a byproduct of Tesla’s super -aggressive business strategy? Stated differently,  can Tesla reduce its high beta and high idiosyncratic risk without altering its business strategy? The correct answer is likely not by a lot. A company’s cost of capital,  beta ,  stock volatility,  and various forms of multiples (e.g.,  EBITDA multiple) are largely an artifact of the company’s underlying industry in which it operates.

Notwithstanding Tesla’s ambitious business strategy,  there are ways in which management can reduce the overall business risk. For example,  Tesla has a $\S 2.5$ billion line of credit with a banking syndicate which it can access in case of unforeseen negative economic shocks such as Covid-19. Of course,  even if rarely utilized,  a pre-committed credit line can be costly since it requires the bank or syndicate of banks to fund the corporation and sometimes in the bad state of the world when there is systematic economic stress on the overall banking system. But for Tesla,  the credit line can buoy its overall operating model and allow it to avoid raising additional funds during a crisis period.

This lecture note discusses the relevance of financial risk management,  including the purchase of insurance and hedging practices,  in perfect capital markets,  and importantly in the real world. As we show in the next section,  there is no role for active financial risk management in perfect capital markets since investors can replicate a corporation’s risk management decisions at zero cost. In the real world,  however,  financial risk management can play an important role in the success of a corporation,  specifically in terms of facilitating the creation of value on the left-hand side of the balance sheet.

# Financial Risk Management in Perfect Capital Markets

Modigliani and Miller proved over sixty years ago that capital structure has no influence on firm value in perfect capital markets. As discussed in prior lecture notes,  perfect capital markets assume a world free of taxes,  information a symmetries,  transactions costs,  and other real-world frictions. Moreover,  in perfect capital markets,  investors are unable to profit ex ante by trading securities or financial assets and thus markets are considered efficient. Importantly however,  cash flows are not known with certainty,  even in perfect capital markets and thus firms exhibit risky cash flows just like in the real world.

Consider American Tower Corporation with thousands of cellular tower sites around the world. Cellular towers are steel structures which supports antennas and other communications equipment for wireless carriers. Cellular towers are subject to a variety of risk exposures such as extreme weather,  human casualties,  and theft. While cellular towers are designed to withstand strong winds and including hurricanes,  they are not immune to Category 4 or 5 hurricanes and certainly not to tornadoes. From a human standpoint,  working on cellular towers is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world as it involves climbing hundreds of feet in the air and often carrying heavy equipment. The theft at cellular towers tends to mostly involve copper wiring and sometime backup batteries.

American Tower has three basic ways in which it can address these various risks. First,  it can simply accept these risks,  that is,  by doing nothing further than accounting for them in the NPV calculations. That is,  when American Tower decides to construct a new tower,  it will incorporate probabilities of the occurrences of these various events and attempt to provide the optimal level of remediation consistent with maximizing shareholder wealth. Alternatively,  American Tower can build towers which would withstand any type of bad weather,  including Category 5 hurricanes. And likewise,  American Tower can construct towers which are far easier to climb and with guaranteed safety supports,  thus eliminating nearly all fatalities. And it can put enough protective mechanisms in place to eliminate theft. While these preventive measures serve to extinguish the future bad events,  the cost is obviously prohibitively high at some level and thus not economically feasible. Stated differently,  over investing to eliminate these risk

Factors does not maximize $+\mathsf{N P V}$ . We can think of the first option as American Tower financially selfinsuring against these various negative outcomes. In the second option,  American Tower operationally insures against these outcomes by constructing towers to be completely resilient.

The third option is that American Tower purchases insurance from a third party against the occurrence of these events. That is,  American Tower constructs the towers based on a NPV model to maximize shareholder wealth,  thus incorporating the optimal level of these potential negative events,  and then transfers the risks to an insurer. Consider the possibility of cellular towers destroyed or damaged by severe weather. American Tower has roughly 200,  000 towers worldwide. Assume a blended repair/replacement cost of $\S 125,  000$ per each negative occurrence due to extreme weather. For any given year,  the likelihood of extreme weather damaging cellular towers is 0.15 percent. Thus,  American Tower expects to have 300 of its 200,  000 towers damaged annually at a total cost of $\S 37.5$ million. That is,

Expected Loss $=$ Tower Count $\times$ Loss Probability $\times$ Damages

$$
\S 37.5\,  \mathsf{m i l i o n}=200,  000\,  \times\,   0.0015\,  \times\,  \S 125,  000
$$  

By comparison,  American Tower has expected operating expenses of $\S 6.1$ billion,  and thus the expected losses due to weather-related tower damages is less than $1.0\%$ of total operating expenses. Of course,  in the event of unprecedented extreme bad weather where the towers are located,  the realized losses can be several times higher and materially reduce net income. The issue for American Tower is two-fold. First,  there is a lot of variability in the occurrence of weather events and thus there is the possibility of the extreme tail event,  and perhaps even beyond historical occurrences. Second,  American Tower has zero control over the variability of extreme weather,  at least ex post after the construction of the towers. Therefore,  American Tower might consider a hedge against a volatile expense item beyond its control.

Assume that American Towers chooses to hedge $100\%$ of its expected weather-related losses over the coming year. Thus,  it will purchase insurance against $\S 25$ billion of maximum losses across the 200,  000 towers. For simplicity,  assume a single insurance premium is made at the beginning of the year and the insurance company will make a single payment at the end of the year based on aggregate losses. Assume there are zero administrative and operating costs during the year for the insurance company to manage its exposure to the 200,  000 towers. Finally,  assume capital markets are perfect. What is the price of the insurance?

Given competition and perfect capital markets,  the insurance company will earn zero economic rents on the transaction,  that is,  the expected NPV will equal zero. If we assume that weather has a zero beta to the stock market,  the appropriate discount rate or cost of capital for the insurance company is the one-year risk-free rate. The current yield on one-year U.S. Treasury bills is $4.9\%$ . Thus,  American Tower will pay an insurance premium of $\S 35.75$ million today against expected losses of $\S 37.50$ million and maximum losses of $\S 25$ billion.

Insurance Premium $=$ Expected Loss / [1 $^+$ Discount Rate]

$$
\S 35.75\;\mathsf{m i l l i o n}=\S 37.50\;\mathsf{m i l l i o n}\;/\;(1.049)
$$  

Suppose American Tower also plans to insure against the theft of copper and back-up batteries from its cellular tower sites. Assume the expected annual losses from theft are $\S 37.50$ million,  the same as from extreme weather events. To compare the estimate of the premium of insuring against theft to the severe weather premium,  also assume a payment upfront by American Tower and the insurance carrier will make a single payment at year end based on total losses.

Given the assumption of zero systematic beta risk with respect to severe weather,  the risk-free rate is the appropriate discount rate or cost of capital. For theft from cellular towers,  it is feasible that there is systematic beta risk,  albeit with a negative sign. That is,  to the extent theft from cellular towers increases during market downturns,  then perhaps the underlying beta is negative. For our purposes,  assume a beta of -0.25. Further assume a market risk premium of $6.5\%$ relative to Treasury bills. Using the CAPM,  the discount rate for insuring against theft from cellular towers is:

$$
\mathsf{E}(\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{A}})=\mathsf{R}_{F}+\mathsf{\beta}_{\mathsf{A}}\times[\mathsf{E}(\mathsf{R}_{\mathsf{m}})-\mathsf{R}_{F}]
$$  

$$
3.275\%=4.9\%+\cdot 0.25\times 6.5\%
$$  

Using a discount rate of $3.275\%,  $ the insurance premium for theft from towers is:

$$
\S 36.31\;\mathrm{milliion}=\S 37.50\;\mathrm{milliion}\,  /\,  [1\,  +\,  . 03275]
$$  

Given the negative beta for theft,  American Tower will pay an upfront premium for theft insurance which exceeds the upfront premium for weather insurance with the zero beta. The payment of the theft insurance premium increases the expected profits of American Tower during market downturns and decreases the expected profits during upturns,  that is,  relative to not purchasing insurance against theft from towers. Thus,  America Towers pays a higher insurance premium for theft insurance versus extreme weather insurance,  given the negative beta,  to compensate the insurance carrier on the other side of the transaction.

What is the impact of American Tower purchasing insurance with respect to severe weather and theft? The insurance purchase will reduce the volatility of earnings and thus the overall risk of the corporation. Indeed,  American Tower has transferred some of its risk onto an insurance carrier. But since American Tower is purchasing insurance at a fair price,  the NPV is zero,  and thus shareholders do not benefit from the purchase of insurance,  at least in perfect capital markets. That is,  American Tower does not possess information about weather or theft which places the firm at an advantage relative to insurance carriers. Moreover,  to the extent some investors seek to avoid weather and theft risk,  they can purchase insurance protection on their own.

Turning back to the Modigliani and Miller capital structure propositions,  we know that in perfect capital markets investors can replicate and undo any capital structure changes undertaken by management. For example,  suppose management chooses to reduce shareholder risk by cutting back on leverage. Indeed,  this is a form of risk management which reduces the volatility of the stock. But investors can replicate this action via reducing leverage on their own. Likewise,  in subsequent work,  Miller and Modigliani demonstrate the irrelevance of dividend policy as investor can easily create and undo dividends in their own personal accounts when perfect capital markets hold. The same goes for all financial decisions on the right-hand side of the balance sheet,  including various forms of financial risk management such as the purchase of insurance and the hedging of certain cash flows.

# Financial Risk Management in the Real World

Notwithstanding the irrelevance of financial risk management in perfect capital markets,  corporate managers expend a lot of effort,  money,  and time on numerous risk management measure in the real world. Thus,  it must be that the various assumptions behind perfect capital markets are the reason that risk management can increase shareholder value. Whereas Modigliani and Miller ushered in modern corporate finance,  we think of much of the subsequent academic research as in a post-modern world of corporate finance. Under Modigliani and Miller,  shareholders instruct management to focus on the creation of shareholder wealth via the acceptance of all $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects and the rejection of all -NPV projects on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. The post-modern framework of corporate finance continues the framework of value creation via accepting (rejecting) $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects (-NPV Projects) on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. But it also stresses that financial policy matters and can influence the project selection decisions on the left-hand side of the balance sheet. Today,  we know for example that cost of financial distress and information asymm etry can greatly limit a firm’s ability to undertake profitable investments when cash is constrained. That is,  external financing is not always readily available in the real world for $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects as assumed by Modigliani and Miller.

We next consider some hypothetical examples of firms facing investment decisions and analyze the feasibility of financial risk management in support of the underlying investments. Consider the fictional drug company,  BIOPHARMA,  which maintains all its operations in the United States,  but derives half of its revenue outside the United States,  specifically in the European Union. Based on current exchange rates,  BIOPHARMA forecasts total cash flows of $\S 500$ million. But a substantial appreciation of the USD relative to the EURO could lead to a reduction in cash flows to $\S 200$ million. Obviously,  a depreciation of the USD would increase BIOPHARMA’s cash flows. In a Modigliani and Miller world,  the investors of BIOPHARMA can easily hedge against such exchange-rate fluctuations if they choose to do so.

BIOPHARMA invests heavily in R&D to maintain the growth trajectory of its drug pipeline. Assume the R&D investment over the coming year to maximize shareholder wealth is roughly $\S 350$ million. Further assume that due to the uncertain nature of its drug development pipeline,  BIOPHARMA faces considerable constraints in raising external funds,  whether equity or debt. That is,  BIOPHARMA needs to rely on internally generated funds to finance its large investments in R&D. As covered in the Information Asymmetry and Capital Structure lecture note,  it is advised that a firm such as BIOPHARMA retain excess cash on its balance sheet to offset any shortfalls in internally generated funds. However,  BIOPHARMA has not had sufficient cash flows or external financing to establish excess cash by which to support its growing R&D program.

Now we can address how a risk management program to hedge BIOPHARMA’s currency exposure can enhance shareholder wealth maximization as illustrated in Table 1. We describe three scenarios in Table 1: (a) no change in the currency rate,  (b) the USD appreciates relative to the EURO,  and (c) the USD depreciates relative to the EURO. As described above,  if currency rates between the United States and Europe remain stable,  BIOPHARMA will have sufficient expected cash flow of $\S 500$ million to fund its $\S 350$ million R&D program. But a substantial appreciation of the dollar reduces the cash flow to $\S 200$ million and thus below the optimal R&D investment of $\S 350$ million. For example,  assume the $\S 200$ million amount of R&D spending generates NPV of $\S 80$ million versus $\S\,   120$ million NPV for the optimal R&D of $\S 350$ million.

Table 1

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/a2035e9a15a94f44afd0bb17b2b99b5dd3ca3a237af8e0f5f89fa1ef71e3dfd0.jpg)

The goal for BIOPHARMA is to hedge an amount which allows it to spend the optimal $\S 350$ million on R&D. BIOPHARMA can hedge the currency risk exposure with a currency forward contract which sets the exchange rate in advance. That is,  BIOPHARMA will attempt to lock in the expected revenues from Europe by selling EUROs at the forward exchange rate since its non-U.S. revenue payments are in EUROs.

As displayed in Table 1,  a stable exchange rate yields no hedging P&L and BIOPHARMA moves forward to execute on its subsequent R&D expenditures of $\S 350$ million. With a strongly appreciating USD,  the nonhedged cash flows plummet to $\S 200$ million which would result in an otherwise R&D reduction from $\S 350$ million to $\S 200$ million. However,  since BIOPHARMA sold EUROs forward as a hedge against the appreciation of the USD to ensure expected cash flows of at least $\S 350$ million,  the hedging profits yield

  $\S 150$ million. The benefit of the hedging program is that it allows BIOPHARMA to realize the additional

  $\S 40$ million of NPV by spending $\S 350$ million rather than $\S 200$ million on the planned R&D.

In the scenario where the USD depreciates substantially and thus BIOPHARMA realizes a loss on the currency hedge,  it still has more than sufficient cash flows to carry out the optimal level of R&D. Overall,  the hedging program is a success since it allows for sufficiently generated internal cash flows to undertake all $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects. That is,  in a world in which external funds are costly to raise due to either information asymmetry or costs of financial distress,  a hedging strategy as part of a risk management program can better align the timing of cash flow receipts with that of its planned investments.

The second hedging example for consideration is DRILLOIL,  a firm which specializes in oil exploration. Whereas exchange rate volatility is a major source of risk for BIOPHARMA,  oil price volatility is a major risk factor to DRILLOIL. When oil prices decline,  DRILLOIL suffers a drop in cash flows from its existing oilproducing fields. Due to this decline in cash flows,  DRILLOIL will generate less available internal funds for the exploration of new oil properties. But when oil prices are low,  the opportunities for exploration also diminish. Thus,  when internally generated cash flows are low,  it turns out that there is also less demand to finance new ventures. And on the upside,  cash flows are high for oil companies when oil prices are high,  and thus there are more funds to finance profitable new exploration when it requires large expenditures.

We illustrate with a numerical example as done for BIOPHARMA. For comparison,  the cash-flow estimates,  absent of hedging,  for DRILLOIL are identical to those for BIOPHARMA. Assuming oil prices remain stable over the coming year,  DRILLOIL plans to budget roughly $\S 350$ million for its new exploration efforts,  consistent with maximizing $+\mathsf{N P V}.$ . In the event of a substantial decrease (increase) in the price of oil,  the exploration budget will decline (increase) to $\S 250$ million ( $\S 450$ million).

Table 2

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8bb4a407819702adddad69d7d037cc1e49e04f4a961923e527c37afc367c0455.jpg)

To ensure DRILLOIL will have sufficient cash flows to explore for new oil in a depressed oil market,  management will engage in a hedging program,  perhaps by selling oil futures to lock in a price today,  which should provide for the $\S 250$ million budget to finance new exploration. Thus,  DRILLOIL will only need to hedge an amount which generates a hedging P&L of $\S 50$ million from declining oil prices. As designed,  the hedging program of DRILLOIL requires relatively smaller hedges than the BIOPHARMA hedging program due to the nature of the internal self-hedging attributed to the reduced optimal investment when oil prices are low.

While the DRILLOIL example calls for some hedging to ensure sufficient funds are available to fund exploration in a low oil-price regime,  this is simply an artifact of the scenario contemplated. It is also possible that the optimal exploration investment would be sufficiently small in the low oil-price regime such that hedging is not needed. The point is not to say that DRILLOIL should not hedge,  rather that the incentives to hedge are less. For example,  as shown in Table 2,  the optimal exploration budget declines to $\S 250$ million when oil prices are low from the normal budget of $\S 350$ million. And since DRILLOIL expects cash flows of $\S 200$ million when oil prices decline,  it only needs to hedge to generate $\S 50$ million of hedging profits as opposed to $\S 150$ million. And the benefit of the hedge is that by allowing DRILLOIL to invest $\S 250$ million,  the additional NPV is $\S 15$ million beyond the NPV if only using the expected cash flow of $\S 200$ million.

In the two examples above,  we show that hedging can increase value,  not because of reducing volatility,  per se,  rather hedging can offset market frictions such as information asymmetry which may restrict the financing of $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects with external funds. Another market friction we have discussed in a prior lecture note is the cost of financial distress. In a Modigliani and Miller world of perfect capital markets,  financial distress is not costly. This is not to say that firms do not experience default in a Modigliani and Miller world,  but that default is not costly as the equity holders simply turn the keys over to the debt holders and there are no incremental negative external i ties on customers,  suppliers,  employees,  and so forth.

The Trade-off Theory of Capital Structure lecture note describes how the tax benefits of debt financing are reduced by the cost of financial distress which increase with the firm’s leverage. In the two examples above,  an acceleration in the USD versus the EURO or declining oil prices,  can potentially result in BIOPHARMA and DRILLOIL,  respectively,  approaching bankruptcy to the extent they have debt in their capital structure.

Suppose for DRILLOIL,  the optimal capital structure based on the simple trade-off between interest tax shields and cost of financial distress is roughly $15\%$ debt and $85\%$ equity. A major consideration in limiting debt to only $15\%$ of the capital structure is the high volatility of oil prices. Thus,  to the extent that DRILLOIL can successfully reduce the likelihood of financial distress via hedging oil prices,  the benefit of hedging is that it allows a higher level of leverage,  and thus greater interest tax shields,  than otherwise. Importantly,  the benefit of the hedging program is not that it reduces the volatility of the cash flows per se,  rather that it reduces the expected cost of financial distress at given levels of leverage.

# Concluding Comments

Corporate managers receive high compensation,  partly due to a compensating wage differential,  to take risks,  specifically to take good risks. Positive NPV projects are good risks to take even though they may turn out to be ex post disasters. Within projects,  there are numerous embedded risks,  some within the control of management and other risks outside of managerial control. Value can be created by hedging external risks if such hedging reduces the likelihood of financial distress or cash shortfalls. Moreover,  in light of agency costs,  hedging can improve the incentive alignment between shareholders and corporate management.

In perfect capital markets,  hedging generates no value,  zero alpha,  that is,  even if such hedging results in overall lower risk. Investors can mimic any hedging program undertaken by corporate management and likewise undo any hedging program by entering offsetting transactions. Even in the real world,  investors can mimic financial hedging programs undertaken by management,  and at low cost. But in terms of

Creating value via hedging for example in the real world,  the company itself must undertake the hedging such that by doing so,  management is more apt to have sufficient cash for operations and for new projects,  and/or reduce the likelihood of financial distress. In the real world,  information asymmetry is the norm and financial distress is value reducing. Thus,  hedging can create value if it provides the necessary cash flows to fund $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects even if the firm has been subject to poor performance as a result of negative shocks beyond the control of management. Similarly,  hedging can create value if it can reduce cash-flow volatility and thus reduce the probability of financial distress and therefore allow for greater leverage to generate higher interest-tax shields.

Consider airlines for example. Air travelers generally purchase tickets well in advance of their planned flight,  often a month or two in advance. The airline industry is highly [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitiveness]] and thus profit margins often tend to be narrow. The two big cost items for airlines are pilot compensation at roughly $30\%$ of total expenses and jet fuel at $25\%$ . While pilot compensation is stable and predictable over short periods of time,  as the case with many of the other cost items of airlines,  jet fuel can exhibit large price swings due to the high volatility of oil prices.

Given the lag period between the ticket purchase and time of travel,  coupled with the volatility of jet fuel prices,  an increase in jet fuel prices after the ticket purchase can eradicate the expected profits of the flight and even result in losses. The friction is that airline ticket prices do not automatically adjust at the time of travel via fuel surcharges. To mitigate this risk,  airlines can hedge against the jet-fuel price volatility risk in essence via pre-purchasing fuel at the time of the ticket purchase rather than a couple of months later when the flight takes place.

The hedging against jet fuel pricing risk is conceptually straightforward. In practice,  however,  it is a different matter. For example,  the airline can’t simply buy t he physical jet fuel when the ticket is sold and take delivery as it would then need to maintain numerous storage facilities near various airports across the country. Instead,  the airline can hedge via a financial instrument,  for example,  a forward contract with a third party to purchase jet fuel at a specified price and date of delivery. Speculators can take the other side of the forward contract as well as oil refiners looking to hedge against decreasing jet fuel prices. But if most airlines wish to hedge,  and in the same direction,  the forward market for jet fuel may not be liquid enough to handle all the price pressure from hedging. Consequently,  many airlines hedge against jet fuel pricing risk using more liquid measures of petroleum products such as the underlying crude oil itself,  West Texas Intermediate Crude,  for instance. Since jet fuel is a derivative product of oil,  jet fuel prices closely track the prices of crude oil,  albeit a little higher on average due to the extra refining cost.

An issue in hedging via crude oil is that of basis risk,  namely that jet fuel does not move lockstep,  with a premium,  to oil prices,  rather the difference in prices tends to exhibit volatility,  and sometimes high volatility at that. Another issue with hedging against jet fuel price risk is that while short-term demand for air travel tends to be predictable,  exceptions occur. For example,  when COVID-19 erupted in the U.S. during March 2020,  both oil prices and air travel plummeted. Thus,  for those airlines which hedged via forward contracts,  they were hit with a dummy whammy during 2020,  that is,  they realized massive losses on their hedges,  and they were ex post over-hedged due to the abrupt decline in air travel. In other words,  airlines not only paid way too much ex post for jet fuel by hedging,  but they also purchased way

Too much jet fuel relative to the actual travel undertaken. Overall,  due to the various frictions with hedging,  its practical benefits can be substantially less than the conceptual benefits during episodic events.

# Mergers & Acquisitions

If you use the search phrase,  “do mergers create or destroy value,  ” on Google,  the overwhelming response is that mergers destroy value. Many highly respected business reporters,  Wall Street analysts,  notable consulting firms such as BCG and McKinsey,  and even some finance professors,  question whether mergers,  in general,  create value.

“ When Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to pay \$26.2 billion to acquire LinkedIn (LNKD) last month,  I — along with many others was left scratching our heads. Why would Microsoft pay such a high premium for a money-losing company with slowing growth and the worst user engagement of any major social media platform?

Microsoft claims the deal has massive synergies that will justify the purchase price. It seems much more likely,  however,  that the software giant will end up taking a major write-down on LinkedIn,  just as it did last year with Nokia $\langle\mathbb{S}\boldsymbol{Z}. 5$ billion) and in 2012 with aQuantive $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{S}}6.2$ billion). The company has an established track record of destroying value by overpaying for acquisitions.

Of course,  Microsoft is far from the only company to destroy shareholder value by overpaying to acquire other companies. Most studies find that acquisitions fail to create value for shareholders between 7090% of the time. We’ve emphasized time and time again that big acquisitions can be accretive to GAAP earnings but actually destroy shareholder value .” 1

The focus on mergers tends to be on various large-scale mergers which have failed. But the same is true of many projects,  whether they are new product offerings,  marketing programs,  R&D,  CAPX,  joint ventures,  and so forth. Many projects fail,  at least most are not screaming successes,  and it is challenging to create the right benchmark as each project is different. And this is especially true for mergers. Based on my experience in mergers not only as a researcher for the past few decades,  but also from the board level and from direct involvement in various mergers,  my view is that when you look at the overall record of mergers rather than just focusing on mergers which fail ex post,  mergers create value. Nonetheless,  the data is extremely messy,  and documenting conclusive evidence of the creation of value resulting from mergers is an arduous task.

The purpose of this lecture note is to provide a high-level overview of mergers and acquisitions,  and from the perspective of corporate finance. The goal is not to learn a lot of facts about mergers,  instead to enhance and deepen our understanding of corporate finance theory and practice.

# MERGERS AS A PROJECT

Consider two firms,  ACQUIRER and TARGET. ACQUIRER has a market value of $\S 20$ billion,  and TARGET has a market value of $\S 10$ billion. Neither firm has debt in its capital structure. ACQUIRER and TARGET decide to merge,  and ACQUIRER will change its name to COMBINED. For the merger to create economic value,  the following must be true:

$\mathsf{V_{C O M B I N E D}}>\mathsf{V_{A C Q U I R E R}}+\mathsf{V_{T A R G E T}}$

That is,  if the value of the combined firm exceeds the values of the two merging parties on a standalone basis,  there is economic justification for the merger. The gains from the merger arise from several avenues such as economies of scale,  eliminating efficiencies,  revenue synergies,  etc. Suppose ACQUIRER and TARGET are in the same industry,  and the rationale for the merger is to achieve economies of scale. Assume the merger is expected to generate cost savings over a period of several years with a present value of $\S 2$ billion. Thus,  the value of COMBINED is $\S 32$ billion,  that is,  $\S 20$ billion ${}+\,  \oint\scriptstyle\frac{10}{\sqrt{\pi}}$ billion $+\,  \,  {\pounds}2$ billion.

From the view of ACQUIRER’s management team ,  the question is whether the merger generates $+\,  \mathsf{N P V}$ . That is,

$$
\mathsf{N P V}_{\mathsf{M E R G E R}}=\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{C O M B I N E D}}-\mathsf{V}_{\mathsf{A C Q u l R e R}}\mathrm{~-~}\mathsf{P u r c h a s e~P r i c e}_{\mathsf{T A R G E T}}
$$  

ACQUIRER should proceed not only if there are gains from the proposed merger,  that is,  satisfying Eq. 1 ,  but also that it receives part of the merger gains such that the NPV is positive in Eq. 2 and hence does not overpay for TARGET. In the example above,  assume the merging parties split the value creation evenly. Thus,  the NPV of the merger is $\S\,   1$ billion from ACQUIRER ’s perspective as it acquires TARGET for $\S\,   1\,   1$ billion. In this case,  the merger creates overall value,  and each firm realizes part of the merger gains. Of course,  the merger could have created value,  yet ACQUIRER may have overpaid,  for example,  if it paid $\S 13$ billion to purchase TARGET. Here,  not only did TARGET receive all the merger gains,  but also received an extra $\S 1$ billion due to the over payment by ACQUIRER.

The above example of bidder over payment might appear to be a silly textbook exercise,  but it occurs often in the real world and many view bidder over-payment for targets as quite common.

# Announcement Period Abnormal Returns

The cleanest evidence on whether mergers create value for shareholders comes from short-term event studies where the average abnormal stock market reaction at merger announcement is a gauge of value creation or destruction. In efficient capital markets,  stock prices immediately adjust to a merger announcement,  incorporating any expected value changes. Table 1 displays abnormal returns measured over a three-day window surrounding the merger announcement for both targets and acquirers,  as well as for the targets and acquirers combined.

Target firm shareholders are clear winners in merger transactions. Target firms realize significant increases in shareholder value,  $+16.0\%$ average abnormal return during the 1973-1998 period,  and slightly less,  $+14.6\%$ average abnormal return,  for the 1980-2005 period. In results not shown here,  the average target abnormal return increases to $25\%$ for longer windows which start about a month before the merger announcement and goes through the closing of the merger transaction. The purpose of the long window,  roughly four months,  is to reflect rumors and leaks before the merger announcement and to capture the resolution of uncertainty at the merger closing date.

The evidence for value creation for acquirers is not clear cut. Over the 1973-1998 period,  the average abnormal return to acquirers is $-0.70\%$ versus $+0.73\%$ for the 1980-2005 period. In terms of statistical significance,  neither of these estimates is significant. Thus,  acquirers don’t appear to be losers,  but they aren’t clear winners based on the above evidence. It is also worth pointing out there is a substantial amount of cross-sectional variation in the acquirer returns across the acquisitions,  but I am just reporting the simply averages here. While the average acquirer return does not appear to be statistically different from zero,  there are cases in which the acquirer return is hugely positive and in other cases,  hugely negative. Moreover,  a significant positive stock price reaction to an acquirer does not guarantee future success with the acquisition as it is simply an ex ante reaction and the ex post realization can widely diverge from the init ial expectations. The same is true for mergers in which the stock market’s initial assessment is negative.

On a combined basis,  the returns are positive for both periods,  $+1.80\%$ for the 1973-1998 period and $+1.06\%$ for the 1980-2005 period. Moreover,  these results hold up post-2005 based on announcementperiod returns of mergers from our proprietary merger database at AQR Arbitrage. Thus,  mergers appear to create value for shareholders overall,  but the announcement period gains from mergers seem to accrue mainly to shareholders of target firms. Due to [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitiveness]] markets with auctions,  bidding wars,  and the threat of potential bidders,  it is intuitive that target management extracts most of the unexpected value creation resulting from merger announcements. Also,  management of target firms are not eager to give up their senior leadership positions,  and thus,  higher control premiums are one method to convince management to agree to the merger.

The skeptical view of mergers as mentioned at the beginning of this lecture note stems in part from three observations. First,  many mergers fail ex-post and are thus roundly criticized. Second,  in many cases,  the acquirer’s stock price takes a beating at the time of the merger announcement,  a point which this lecture note subsequently covers. Third,  the average return to acquirers,  as shown above,  appears minuscule. That is,  why go through all the trouble of a significant corporate event if it only generates a small stock price increase on average?

The expectation is that managers of public corporations engage in projects which create value. Thus,  the stock price of corporations reflects the expectation of $+\mathsf{N P V}$ project announcements often several years into the future. Given this,  the stock price reaction to a project announcement reflects two components,  relative size and timing. If the project announcement reveals a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ that is larger than expected,  then a positive stock price reaction will occur. And the fact that when a firm announces a project there is a resolution of uncertainty,  that is,  the project is announced today rather than at an expected later date. Put differently,  it is challenging to manufacture alpha,  and not only in financial markets by mutual funds,  hedge funds,  individual investors,  etc.,  but it is also difficult for corporate management to manufacture unexpected alpha in real asset markets. For example,  if a management team has a fantastic track record of investing in $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects,  th e firm’s stock price will reflect their talents and even before their next acquisition announcement.

# Form of Payment and Mergers

The full sample results,  as described above,  hide an important distinction based on the financing of mergers. Specifically,  mergers financed with stock,  have different value effects than mergers funded with cash.

From the acquirer’s perspective,  a stock -financed merger consists of two simultaneous transactions,  a merger,  and an equity issue. Recall from the Information Asymmetry and Capital Structure lecture note,  equity issues generate negative abnormal returns averaging $^{-2}$ to -3 percent during a short period around the equity issue announcement. As discussed,  theoretical models can explain this finding,  mostly focusing on information differences between managers and outside investors. The basic idea is that managers are more likely to issue equity when they perceive the stock market overvalues the firm's shares. The issue is not so much that management wishes to issue overvalued shares; instead,  they want to avoid issuing

Undervalued stock. Consequently,  rational investors downward adjust their expectations of future cash flows when equity issues are announced,  thereby triggering a stock price decline. Therefore,  it is essential to separate the stock-financed mergers from mergers financed with debt or retained earnings to have a better appreciation of the merger wealth gains from the a cquirer’s perspective.

Table 2 displays announcement-period returns based on the form of financing. Interestingly,  the negative announcement-period return for acquiring firms is limited to those which finance with stock. Acquiring firms that use at least some stock to finance their mergers have reliably negative average abnormal returns of $-1.5\%$ versus $+0.40\%$ for acquirers which don’t use any stock in the funding of their mergers. These findings are consistent with the notion that the announcement-period stock price reaction for the acquirer to a stock-financed merger represents a combination of a merger announcement and an equity issue which may signal over-priced stock.

Target firm shareholders also do better when there is no equity financing. And financing has a significant impact on inferences about the overall value creation from mergers. The combined average abnormal returns for stock-financed mergers are $+0.6\%,  $ thus close to zero,  and increases to $+3.6\%$ for non-stock financed mergers. To draw inferences about the value creation on the left-hand-side of the balance sheet from mergers,  the analyst will give more weight to the $+3.6\%$ estimate for the non-stock financed mergers. Moreover,  as indicated above,  these stock price reactions reflect the resolution of uncertainty; that is,  stock price already incorporate the expectation of merger announcements.

# The Impact of Merger Arbitrage on Acquirer Returns 5

Soon after launching a merger-arbitrage practice at AQR Arbitrage 6 in 2001 based on our academic research,  we started to notice a phenomenon which is counter to one of the underlying assumptions in perfect capital markets,  that is,  the assumption traders do not have an impact on market prices. Our anecdotal observation was the negative stock price reaction to stock mergers on the announcement date appeared to be negatively correlated to the amount of sho rting by merger arb it rage urs in the acquirer’s stock price. To better understand our anecdotal observation,  a cursory description of merger arbitrage is provided below.

Merger arbitrage is a specialized investment strategy which amounts to providing insurance to target firm shareholders against deal failures. As noted earlier,  target shareholders realize large wealth increases when mergers are announced and as a result,  the target shareholders may have an outsized weight in the target firm depending on their investment objectives. Second,  the future return distribution of the target firm is dramatically altered as the targ et’s stock price trades at a small discount to the acquirer’s offer. If the merger is successful,  this discount diminishes as the merger approaches consummation,  generating a small positive return during the period between merger announcement and the merger closing. However,  if the merger fails,  the target’s stock price usually plummets,  generating a large negative return. Merger arb it rage urs receive compensation,  via the deal spread,  for providing liquidity to target shareholders and for bearing this risk of deal failure.

In the case of stock mergers,  the arb it rage ur not only buys shares in the target firm,  but also shorts the stock of the acquiring firm to isolate the deal risk. Fixed-exchange ratio stock mergers are the most straightforward of stock-financed mergers. At the merger announcement,  the acquirer agrees to exchange a fixed number of acquirer shares for each target share. Consequently,  for each target share purchased,  the merger arb it rage ur sells short the fixed number of acquirer shares per the merger agreement. These trades are typically placed simultaneously to minimize mis-hedging risk.

Not surprisingly,  acquirer management often criticizes the short selling around the merger period as they view it as negative sentiment regarding the merger. The reality is that merger arb it rage urs are facilitating the merger,  and playing a useful role in corporate finance,  by their willingness to hold the shares of the target firm until the acquirer can consummate the merger. And when the merger closes,  the short position in the acquirer collapses against the long position in the acquirer (which was long the target until the merger closed) and thus the shares shorted in acquirers ’ plummets when the merger closes.

Our research documents that nearly half of the negative stock price response to fixed-exchange stock mergers is due to the short-selling pressure by merger arb it rage urs at the time of the merger announcement. In a different type of stock merger,  floating-exchange stock mergers,  the number of acquiring shares is unknown until just before the merger closing. For example,  the acquirer will offer $\S 20$ in acquirer stock and the exchange ratio is set based on the acquirer’s stock price just before the merger is consummated,  typically a few months after the merger announcement. Consequently,  arb it rage urs don’t short the acquiring stock until a p ricing period immediately before merger closing,  which determines the hedge ratio. Interestingly,  in these stock mergers,  the acquirer’s stock price increases $0.58\%$ at the merger announcement versus declining $2.73\%$ for fixed-exchange ratio acquirers. However,  near the merger completion when the exchange ratio is provided,  the acquirer’s stock price declines $3.18\%$ for the floating-ratio acquirers. That is,  for a floating-rate stock merger,  the stock price of the acquirer increases at the announcement just like for a cash merger,  even though the stock market has full information that stock will be the form of payment. But near the end of the merger,  arb it rage urs began to short the acquirer stock once the exchange ratio is revealed. The graph below shows the cumulative average abnormal return around merger closings for floating ratio stock mergers.

# Preand Post-Merger Profitability

Many academic studies have focused on various measures of operating performance to identify the sources of gains from mergers and to determine whether the expected gains at the merger announcement are ever actually realized. If mergers create value for shareholders,  the benefits should eventually show up in the firms’ cash flows. To test this conjecture,  a highly-cited study by Andrade,  Mitchell,  and Stafford focus on operating margins,  specifically cash flows to sales. We create a measure of average abnormal operating performance,  which is the difference between the combined firm’s operating margin and the corresponding industry median operating margin. On average,  there is an improvement in operating margins following the merger of roughly 1 percent and is statistically significant. Also,  as discussed later,  industry shocks are a primary source of merger activity. To the extent the industry benchmark firms are also undertaking value-enhancing mergers or otherwise restructuring internally in response to industry shocks,  the measured change in operating performance will be biased down. Overall,  the improvement in post-merger operating performance is consistent with the positive announcementperiod stock market returns to the combined acquirer and target returns.

# MERGER WAVES

Mergers tend to occur in waves rather than evenly through time. There has been a total of six waves in U.S. corporate history:

1 st Wave (1895-1904)

Horizontal mergers which resulted in high concentration,  the monopolization of industries. The U.S. Congress created the Sherman Antitrust Act to halt these mergers.

2 nd Wave (1922-1929)

During a high growth period,  vertical integration occurred driven by developments in transportation,  communications,  and merchandising.

3 rd Wave (1965-1969)

Firms began to diversify outside of their core industries,  many of them creating large conglomerates.

4 th Wave (1981-1989)

The 1980 s was the decade of the big deal,  hostile takeovers,  and leveraged buyouts. Roughly half of all large firms received a takeover offer.

5 th Wave (1993-1999)

Strategic mergers dominated this period with many stock-financed mega mergers and a high level of global mergers.

6 th Wave (2003-2008)

Period of high liquidity and leveraged friendly acquisitions by private equity firms.

For each of the above waves,  different forces seem to be at work in different environments. However,  two broad generalizations can be made. First,  for the various merger waves,  there were large underlying economic and technological changes taking place. Second,  the waves occurred mostly during periods of high stock market valuations.

There are two leading hypotheses to explain merger waves. The first is a neoclassical explanation,  namely that merger waves are driven by economic shocks,  positive and negative,  to various industries. The theory is that these shocks to industries cause shifts in industry structure and mergers are often the least-costly method to adapt to the new structure. Harold Mulherin and I laid the early work for this theory back in

The mid-1990 s and supported it with empirical evidence that a large proportion of merger activity is driven by economic,  financial,  regulatory and technological shocks to industries.

The alternative theory is that managers time market over valuations of their firms and thus buy other firms when their stock prices are high and is,  therefore,  a behavioral story. There has been some anecdotal and systematic support for the over valuation story. However,  when researchers have tested between the two hypotheses,  the conclusion has been mainly that clustering of shocks to industries results in the wellknown merger waves. Nonetheless,  the behavioral story still has considerable merit and likely can explain numerous mergers.

# FREE CASH FLOWS AND AGENCY COSTS

The Agency Costs and Capital Structure lecture note describes how agency costs results in management not always acting on behalf of the shareholders. Before the seminal work by Jensen and Meckling in 1976,  the academic literature largely ignored agency costs,  and indeed the initial response to their work was not well received when they presented their paper before publication as it upset the status quo in a significant way. Since the publication of the Jensen and Meckling paper,  the agency cost theory literature has exploded and continues to be a vibrant area in academic research and practitioner research as well. In effect,  its influence has been to take the textbook profit maximization world to be more adaptable to the real world where sometimes managers are inclined to make decisions which are at odds with maximizing shareholder wealth.

Jensen and Meckling suggest that one route to avoid the agency costs associated with issuing equity is for the owner to raise all external funds via debt. Indeed,  they proposed the leveraged buyout (LBO) years in advance of the LBO structure becoming part of many U.S. corporations. Given the prevalence of the corporate organization with widely diffuse shareholders separate from the management team,  Jensen and Meckling recognized there must be agency issues of debt for the LBO model.

A benefit of going to the capital markets to finance new projects is that the management team is forced to convince the capital markets that the project merits the necessary capital. And for firms which have plenty of retained earnings by which to invest in the project,  the management team doesn’t face as much outside scrutiny for the project under consideration.

Managers often have an incentive for their firms to grow larger than the optimal size. Compensation,  power,  and prestige are all associated with larger firms,  and thus,  it is logical for many managers to focus on making the firm larger,  even if it might mean investing in – NPV projects. Many corporations,  especially large corporations,  will sometime generate large amounts of free cash flow,  that is,  cash flow over and beyond that necessary to finance all $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects.

Jensen (1986) developed a highly influential theory by which debt can be used to monitor and motivate managers,  especially those managers with free cash flow. Consider a firm which has invested in several past $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects and it now generate excess free cash flow. As discussed in the Introduction to Dividend Policy lecture note,  management could choose to increase the dividend and or repurchase stock to pay out the excess cash. It is also possible that there are no further $+\mathsf{N P V}$ projects to invest in,  and management chooses to invest in -NPV projects,  perhaps consistent with empire building.

The beauty of debt,  according to Jensen’s free -cash flow theory,  is that it

“enables managers to effectively bond their promise to pay out future cash flows. Thus,  debt can be an effective substitute for dividends,  something not generally recognized in the corporate finance literature. By issuing debt in exchange for stock,  managers are bonding their promise to payout future cash flows in a way that cannot be accomplished by simple dividend increases. In doing so,  they give shareholder recipients of the debt to take the firm into bankruptcy court if they do not maintain their promise to make the interest and principal repayments. Thus,  debt reduces the agency costs of free cash flow by reducing the cash flow available for spending at the discretion of managers. These control effects of debt are a potential determinant of capita l structure.” (p. 324)

Jensen’s point is that debt holders have contractual requirements to impose discipline on management which shareholders do not possess. For shareholders to remove management,  they must do so via a costly proxy battle or takeover. But if the firm is levered,  the debt holders can more easily remove management in certain states of the world,  for instance,  if they miss their interest and principal payments.

Consider,  for example,  the market – value balance sheets for ALLEQUITY and LEVER below. Assume that both firms are presented with a $+\mathsf{N P V}$ project opportunity which requires an investment of 1,  000. ALLEQUITY could undertake the investment via existing retained earnings. In contrast,  LEVER would have to seek external financing via the debt or equity markets to undertake the $+\mathsf{N P V}$ opportunity. At the margin,  the discipline of having to seek external funds will more likely dissuade the firm from accepting the project if it were – NPV rather than $+\mathsf{N P V}.$ . And even aside from having to go to the capital markets to raise financing for new ventures,  the higher leverage at LEVER versus the considerable “financial slack” 13 at ALLEQUITY,  also results in more careful decision making and cost controls for the existing assets-in-place as the margin for error is much slimmer due to the mandatory interest payments.

Table 2: Project Selection at ALLEQUITY vs LEVER

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/d04f32840c6bd0b92fe593566320e464d46c1b3d1b8ea13f7c5c8a063bf5b156.jpg)

The prediction from Jensen’s free cash flow theory is that leverage can lead to improved managerial decision making. Academic research has generally provided considerable support for Jensen’s free cash flow theory. For example,  the stock market responds more positively to acquisition announcements by acquirers with higher leverage than with zero or low leverage. The results are consistent with the logic that levered firms must go to the capital markets if they are to expand the firm via acquisition and thus subject to external monitoring due to the need to raise external funds. But for unlevered firms with excess cash,  the management team is not under pressure to seek outside funding and thus more immune from external forces. The results imply that agency costs are a major detractor to shareholder wealth creation and that capital structure adapts to account for them. These results do not necessarily mean that companies should always increase leverage. Instead,  the point is that agency costs are real,  and debt is one mechanism which is used to control them,  yet debt is not used nearly as much as Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis might imply. This seemingly under utilization of debt suggests there are some substantive costs to too much debt as discussed in Agency Costs and Capital Structure and in Information Asymmetry and Capital Structure.

# FREE CASH FLOW THEORY AND DISCIPLINARY MERGERS

A major critique of mergers has to do with the managerial motives. Various studies have shown that selfinterested managers may pursue mergers which benefit them personally and at the expense of their shareholders. To the extent that management compensation is positively correlated with overall firm size,  then there is an incentive for management to pursue a merger even if it has negative net present value. But is there enough scrutiny to ensure that this negative outcome doesn’t happen? According to Jensen’s free cash flow theory,  the market will force debt,  a leveraged buyout at the extreme,  on firms which have free cash flows,  that is,  profitable firms which invests their retained earnings in – NPV projects.

My first research agenda after graduate school and initial foray into understanding mergers was to focus on this very question. This research took place at the end of the 1980 s,  a period of very high merger activity,  particularly hostile attempts to acquire large firms. Indeed,  the hostile activity against large

Mainstream corporations was so prevalent that many of the corporations enlisted various states and the federal government to intervene to reduce hostile mergers. We took the approach of looking at the historical merger record of those corporations which were subject to merger pressure,  often hostile pressure.

Goodyear Tire provides the anecdotal evidence. During the 1980 s,  Goodyear decided to diversify into the petroleum industry,  supposedly to hedge its exposure to oil (petroleum is the second leading input in the production of tires). When Goodyear announced its intention to acquire a large oil and gas exploration firm,  its stock price dropped nearly $15\%$ over a few days surrounding the acquisition announcement. A few years later,  Sir James Goldsmith attempted a hostile takeover of Goodyear intending to divest all of Goodyear’s non -tire businesses. With the help of the Ohio State Legislature,  Goodyear was able to stymie the hostile takeover by Sir James Goldsmith,  yet was still forced to divest its non-tire assets and to re capitalize the firm via a debt-financed share repurchase.

We find that the Goodyear example generalizes to a large sample of mergers. Our research documents that acquirers which made value-reducing acquisitions,  based on their announcement-period stock price reactions,  were subsequently subject to hostile takeover pressure,  often with the intent on unwinding the prior bad acquisitions . Firms which made acquisition announcements that didn’t result in a negative stock price response were less likely to be subject to takeover pressure themselves. Thus,  our finding was that the market for corporate control served as a useful mechanism to ensure that good mergers were more likely to occur than bad mergers. In our words,  “takeovers can be both a problem and a solution.”

Whereas the hostile role of discipline was played by the likes of T Boone Pickens,  Sir James Goldsmith,  and Carl Icahn during the 1980 s,  today we are witnessing a significant revision of the role and specifically by activist hedge funds. Today’s hedge fund activists target poorly performing firms,  many of which had been prior acquirers. Overall,  hedge fund activists have resulted in higher stock returns and operating performance for the targeted firms. And Carl Icahn,  mentioned above for his disciplinary role in the 1980 s,  is still at it in today’s market for corporate control.
