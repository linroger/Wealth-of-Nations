**7. # <a name="_heading=h.el92aunujoq0"></a>Moats of BMW**
BMW operates in the competitive luxury automotive market,  facing challenges and competition from both established luxury car makers and newer entrants,  especially in the electric vehicle sector. Relative to its competitors,  BMW possesses the following competitive strengths and weaknesses.

## <A NAME="_HEADING=H0.\1FL2C7PHN3RE"></A>7.1 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
- **Differentiation Strategy**: BMW leverages a differentiation strategy to distinguish itself from competitors such as Tesla,  Toyota,  Ford,  and General Motors. This strategy emphasizes providing distinctive features and superior quality in its vehicles,  catering to consumer demands for innovation and specific transportation preferences. This approach enables BMW to attract customers and sustain its profitability.

- **Global Supply Chain and Distribution Network**: BMW employs a market penetration strategy to boost sales in established markets via dealerships and various distribution channels. This approach includes ramping up efforts to market and sell more automotive products in specific regions,  especially in developing markets where there is significant potential for growth.

## <A NAME="_HEADING=H0.\1TJVIO4UC068"></A>7.2 COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES
- **Cost Leadership Tension**: While BMW incorporates cost leadership into its strategy,  its main focus is on differentiation. The brand's commitment to premium branding and high-quality products suggests that it might not be as [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] on price alone,  especially against competitors who prioritize and achieve better cost efficiencies.
- **Challenges in Market Penetration**: BMW faces challenges with market penetration,  particularly in areas where its presence is limited. These difficulties are intensified by the aggressive marketing strategies and technological advancements of its competitors,  which hinder BMW’s ability to expand its market share in these regions.

The first,  a €2 billion buyback,  was executed from July 2022 to June 2023. The second program,  also valued at up to €2 billion,  is scheduled to be completed by December 2025. BMW's share buyback initiatives are strategically aligned with the group's overall priorities and are flexibly executed based on the generation of free cash flow. This approach underscores BMW’s commitment to enhancing shareholder value while maintaining strategic focus on its core business objectives.

1. # <a name="_heading=h0.\1bvwl0xsisug"></a>Financial performance and forecast

## <A NAME="_HEADING=H.LPYQA8W1Z6GK"></A>9.1 THE REVENUE DRIVER
- **The robust competitive power in the auto business sector captures the long-term stable growth of revenue.** The total delivery volume globally is projected to exhibit a 3% CAGR over the next five years,  driven by the robust growth in the BMW series. We forecast that the 5 series will regain its position as the mainstream product and experience a strong increase in sales volume in the following year as the changeover of 5 series is to be launched and bring the whole series back to life,  despite it experienced a softer decline in 1Q24.
- **The adoption of BEV products in the market will further fuel substantial growth.** In 2023,  the BEV penetration rate in the total delivery of the BMW Group is 14.7%. We expect there to be ongoing significant growth in the adoption of BEV products. The penetration rate is expected to reach 35% in 2028. The band new “Neue Klasse” platform,  as the third generation of EV,  will provide a massive leap for BMW in BEV and PHEV,  contributing a solid growth in revenue. However,  considering the intense competition in China and the fact that tech companies like Xiaomi are gradually entering the EV market,  we believe that BMW will not achieve significant success in China's increasingly EV-dominated market in the future.
- **Sixth generation battery technology will become the benchmark in production,  quality,  performance costs and ecology of battery cells.** The new battery cell technology will become the key component for the success of EVs for BMW. According to BMW,  the new battery cells will have a 30% increase of range and reduce the charging time by 30%. Moreover,  the battery cost on pack level and drivetrain will have a 40%-50% reduction. And the new battery will be produced with renewable energy and recycled materials to cut the carbon emissions by 60%. All these features will outperform the current battery cells in the market and become the new benchmark.
- **The** **growth for Financial Services amid rate cuts as central banks globally approaches the end of quantitative tightening.** As central banks around the world are nearing the end of their quantitative tightening,  we predict that interest rates will gradually decrease starting from the end of 2024,  providing upward momentum for Financial Services. Consequently,  we anticipate that the growth rate of business volume for Financial Services will increase from 1.64% in 2023 to 4% in 2024,  reaching its peak in 2025.

## <A NAME="_HEADING=H.XAI1CYO48KPJ"></A> 9.2 MAIN ASSUMPTION AND THE FORECAST RESULT
- **Segment Breakdown:** Automotive segment maintain it high revenue and high profit status,  we expected automotive segment will contribute around 90% of total revenue in forecasted periods and maintain a gross profit margin at 17%.

## <A NAME="_HEADING=H0.\1Y22J34ZNUS"></A>9.4 MULTIPLES V.S. INDUSTRY AVERAGE

The BMW set financial goals for EBT/EBIT margin and Return on capital employed. Moreover,  according to the value drivers provided by the company itself,  RoCE,  Return on sales and Capital turnover are the main factors for the value added. Thus,  here we used the relative ratios and multiples above for the multiple valuation and peer comparison.
 ![500](Untitled%205-20240518012520208.png)
The current EV multiples of BMW are close to or lower than the industry average and significantly lower than those of market peers like Mercedes. The gap between valuation multiples suggests that there is potential for BMW to catch up with the valuation levels of its industry peers,  indicating that the market may not have fully realized the value of BMW. On the other hand,  BMW’s EPS and margins are higher than peers average,  suggesting its high profitability.

Due to BMW's valuation multiple being lower than the industry average,  the target price derived through the comparable company multiples method is €185.2,  which is considerably higher than the results obtained from the DCF and Profit Model.
