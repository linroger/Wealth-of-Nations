# 10.3 MARKET STRUCTURE AND SIZE  

Table 10.1 summarizes the structure and size of the repo market, as of July.   
2021.5 A main division of the market is between the tri-party and bilat-.   
eral markets. In tri-party trades, an agent provides various collateral management services. In bilateral trades, the two counterparties to each repo.   
transaction manage all of the operational details..  

One of the key services of the tri-party system is to eliminate the risk that. collateral is sent without cash being received or that cash is sent without collateral being received. At the initiation of a trade, this is accomplished as follows. The repo buyer sends cash and the repo seller sends collateral not to each other, but to a tri-party repo agent. The agent, after verifying receipt of both cash and collateral, moves the cash into the seller's account and the collateral into the buyer's account. Similarly, at the expiration of the repo, the agent verifies that appropriate amounts of cash and collateral are available and, only then, moves the cash into the buyer's account and the collateral into the seller's account..  

A second significant tri-party service ensures that repo margin is. enforced along the lines described earlier in the chapter. More specifically,. for every transaction, the tri-party agent verifies that the collateral received. is acceptable relative to parameters set by the repo buyer, values that collateral at current market prices, and issues daily variation margin calls as required by the haircut schedule of the repo buyer..  

The third significant tri-party service is to optimize the use of general collateral. As mentioned earlier, each repo buyer accepts collateral that conforms with, for example, customized constraints on asset class, credit rating, and maturity. At the same time, each repo seller has a portfolio of diverse securities it wants to post as collateral. Furthermore, not surprisingly, repo. loans earn a higher rate when extended against less desirable collateral. The tri-party agent, then, accounting for the constraints across its customers,. their repo trades on a particular day, and current market prices and repo rates, suggests to each repo seller an optimal allocation of its available collateral, that is, a schedule of which collateral should be posted to which repo. buyer.

Table 10.1 shows that the tri-party repo market is divided into two segments. The larger segment, with nearly $\$3$ trillion of outstanding collateral value, consists predominantly of GC trades between repo investors (e.g., money market funds) and dealers, who fund their securities positions with repo. The smaller segment, at $\$238$ billion, is the General Collateral Finance or GCF repo service. In this "blind-brokered" market, dealers trade anonymously with each other to redistribute funds received from repo investors. GCF repo trades are cleared by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC), which means that each counterparty to a GCF repo trade faces the FICC, instead of its original trade counterparty.6 This segment of the market also includes sponsored repo, in which non-member repo counterparties that are backed by members can trade GCF repo on their own accounts.7  

The bilateral repo market is summarized in the rightmost column of Table 10.1. Because tri-party is particularly focused on managing the collateral of GC trades, the bilateral market is used for the GC trades of those who, for various reasons, do not participate in tri-party, and for specials trades. Like the tri-party market, the bilateral market is divided into an uncleared and a cleared segment. Relatively little aggregated data is available about the uncleared segment precisely because its transactions are completely managed by the individual counterparties. The bilateral, cleared market comprises the delivery-for-payment or $D V P$ service of FICC. The trades in this inter-dealer. market can be arranged or blind-brokered, and they are cleared by the FICC. The size of the DVP market is about. $\$1.2$ trillion in loan value..  

Figure 10.7 considers the repo market from the perspective of various sectors of market participants. Note that, in accounting terms, lending cash or buying repo is an asset, and borrowing cash or selling repo is a liability. While broker-dealers do sell repo to finance security holdings, they also run large matched books through which they make markets in repo, that is, they. buy repo from some customers and sell to others in a balanced way. The combination of a matched book and long financing leads to the profile shown in the figure, namely, a large quantity of repo assets offset by repo liabilities and an additional quantity of repo liabilities. Money market funds, as discussed, are in the business of investing short-term funds and use repo to do so. The. foreign sector (excluding foreign bank offices in the United States) is approximately balanced in repo assets and liabilities, while bank repo liabilities are somewhat greater than their repo assets. The Federal Reserve borrows cash in the repo market through its reverse-repo facility, as explained in Chapter O. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) borrow money through repo, while the remaining sectors shown - municipals; GSEs, like FNMA and FHLMC; and mutual funds (MFs) - invest in repo as a liquid, short-term investment.

Continuing the discussion of repo market structure, Table 10.2 gives the composition of collateral in tri-party repo, ex-GCF. Underlining the safety of repo transactions, a large portion of collateral is government guaranteed, with $62\%$ in Treasuries and $21\%$ in government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBs). Furthermore, although not shown in the table, the. $\$238$ billion of GCF repo consists entirely of Treasury,. Agency, and GSE MBS. Some of the tri-party market, however, as shown in Table 10.2, does include repo using riskier collateral.  

To conclude this section, Table 10.3 gives the median haircut on collateral in tri-party, ex-GCF. Recalling that a cash lender loses money only if its counterparty defaults and the collateral falls in value by more than. the haircut, cash lenders demand higher haircuts for riskier collateral. Risk in this context is measured not only by price volatility and the possibili-. ties of large price declines but also by illiquidity: in the event of a default, lenders recover only what they can realize through the sale of the collateral they hold. Consistent with these considerations, the median haircuts in Table 10.3 do increase with risk. The most liquid, government-guaranteed collateral requires a haircut of only $2\%$ , while the riskiest and least liquid securities require a haircut of $8\%$
