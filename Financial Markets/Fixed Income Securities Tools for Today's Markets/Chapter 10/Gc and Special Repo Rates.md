# 10.5 GC AND SPECIAL REPO RATES  

This section discusses the interest rates on repo loans. Conceptually, there is.   
a distinct rate for every repo term and for every type of collateral: one rate.   
for overnight repo on investment-grade corporate collateral; another rate for one-month repo on government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities; etc..   
There is, however, a benchmark repo rate, called "the GC rate," which is the.   
overnight rate earned by lenders willing to accept any Treasury collateral..  

Some insight into the determination of the GC rate can be gained by. comparing the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) with the GC rate. The interbank EFFR is a highly creditworthy, overnight, unsecured rate, which. can be compared with the GC rate, a highly creditworthy, overnight, secured rate. To this end, Table 10.5 shows percentiles of the differences between. effective fed funds and the GC rate, from January 2001 to July 2021.  

The median, or 5Oth percentile, of the difference is one basis point. It is not surprising that an overnight unsecured rate, EFFR, tends to be above an overnight secured rate, GC. It is also not surprising that the spread is relatively small, because, as an overnight rate between banks, EFFR is a rate on a very high-quality loan. What is surprising and instructive, however, is by how much these two rates can diverge, in either direction. The 95th. percentile of the spread, for example, has EFFR 15 basis points above GC, while the 5th percentile has EFFR 13 basis points below GC. And at greater. extremes, for the 0.5 and 99.5 percentiles, EFFR is 113 basis points above and 37 basis points below GC, respectively.

To explore these large deviations, Figure 10.8 graphs the EFFR-GC spread over time. There are five particularly large and sudden increases in the GC rate, which result in large, negative spreads. In general, these episodes are all manifestations in the Treasury repo market of a relatively desperate need to raise cash and a willingness to pay high rates to do so. The first was in September 2001, shortly after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. Damage to infrastructure in downtown New York City temporarily disrupted the normal flow of funds and sent market participants, including banks, scrambling for cash. Liquidity provision by the Federal Reserve and infrastructure repair restored market order in a couple of weeks.  

The next events, September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2018, are at quarter end and year end, respectively. Many market participants are believed to engage in "window dressing" at the end of reporting periods, possibly to impress investors and possibly to meet various regulatory. requirements. This entails temporary measures such as increasing liquidity and cutting back on loans, which, if prevalent enough, push up repo rates as borrowers hunt for cash among willing lenders. Quarter- and. year-end market disruptions have become less frequent over the decades,. as the Federal Reserve has successfully anticipated and accommodated the resulting scarcities of cash. As the two highlighted events suggest, however, quarter- and year-end disruptions are not extinct.

Continuing with the next negative spread events in Figure 10.8, in September 2019, a number of cash-draining incidents happened at about the same time: quarterly corporate tax payments; settlement of newly. issued Treasuries; and a holiday in Japan, which temporarily sidelined some Japanese investors in US repo. But the magnitudes of these incidents seem small relative to the realized cash scarcity and to the Federal Reserve's subsequent large and long-lasting injections of liquidity. Furthermore, banks did not lend to take advantage of the resulting abnormally high repo rates. despite having significant reserves. Another, though smaller, negative spread event occurred in March 2020, when banks also refrained from lending. at seemingly advantageous rates and from purchasing seemingly mispriced Treasuries, which was the larger dislocation at the time. The reluctance of banks to commit funds during these market dislocations is discussed later in the chapter.  

In addition to large negative spreads, Figure 10.8 shows several instances of very large positive spreads, particularly through the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The two largest such events were in the second half of August 2007, which marked the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis, and mid-September 2008, when Lehman Brothers filed its bankruptcy. During credit events, when market participants worry about each other's ability to satisfy their obligations, there is a rush out of risky assets and into safe assets, including GC repo. As a result, GC repo rates decline and the EFFR-GC spreads become large.

Having completed an overview of the GC rate, the discussion turns to special rates, the rates earned on loans when particular bonds are required as collateral, usually to facilitate short sales. While any bond can "trade special," that is, be required as collateral in a special repo trade, the most common specials in the US repo market are recently issued Treasuries bonds. As mentioned in earlier chapters, the most recently issued Treasuries tend to be the most liquid, and, for this reason, often trade at a premium to otherwise similar bonds. Similarly, market participants who want to short bonds prefer to trade in these bonds and are willing to pay to do so. And the way they pay more to short these bonds is to lend at a relatively low repo rate when taking these bonds as collateral.  

The special spread of a bond to a given term is defined as the difference between the GC rate and the special rate on that bond to that term. Table 10.6 shows the overnight special spreads of various recently issued bonds. The on-the-run (OTR) bond of each maturity is the most recently issued bond of that maturity, the old bond is the second most recently issued, and so forth. The overnight special rate for the on-the-run five-year bond, for example, is 13 basis points below the GC rate, while the old 10-year special rate is 11 basis points below GC. The special spread for each bond is idiosyncratic and time varying, depending on supply and demand for that bond as collateral, which, by the way, often involves a different set of market participants than the supply and demand for sale or purchase of the bond outright. Despite the idiosyncratic nature of special spreads, more can be said about them in terms of the Treasury auction cycle.  

Figure 10.9 graphs the overnight special spread of the OTR 10-year. Treasury note over time. Recall from Chapter O that a new 10-year note is issued every February, May, August, and November and is reopened after one month and again after two months. The special spreads in the figure, therefore, correspond to different bonds as new 10-year notes are issued. The dotted, vertical, gray lines mark the dates of these new issues; the solid,. gray lines mark their first reopenings; and the dashed, gray lines mark their second reopenings. The first lesson from the figure is that, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, the behavior of the special spread is very idiosyncratic: some OTR 10-year notes become very special, and some do not.8 The second lesson is that the OTR notes tend to become particularly. special into their first reopening. Of the bonds shown in the graph, only. one clearly violates this rule: its specialness peaks in January 2021, which corresponds to its second reopening.

Figure 10.10 describes the average behavior of special spreads over the. auction cycle from November 2008, when the Treasury auction cycle first settled into quarterly issuance and monthly reopenings, through July 2021.. This period of time spans the issuance of 51 10-year notes. The thick, black. line in the figure gives the average special spread across these 51 notes as a function of the number of days to the first reopening. For example, with 13 days to the first reopening, the average special spread across the 10-year notes in the sample is 85 basis points. The thick, dark gray line in the figure gives the average special spread as a function of the days to the second reopening, and the thick, light gray line gives the average special spread as. a function of the days to the next new issue.9

The figure shows that, on average, the special spread is relatively low. right after an auction, but then increases into the next auction. Furthermore, the increase into the first reopening is highest, reaching 156 basis points the. day before the first reopening. The increase into the second reopening is. smaller, reaching 48 basis points the day before the second reopening. And. the increase into the new issue is smallest, reaching less than 20 basis points in the days before the new issue..  

The market behavior behind these results is as follows. When a note is. first issued, the previously issued note is still the most liquid in the maturity range and the most popular choice as a short. As the first reopening. approaches, two things happen. First, liquidity shifts from the previously issued note to the new OTR note. Second, dealers increase shorts in the OTR note to hedge their market-making purchases of notes issued in the. next auction. This segment of short demand disappears just after the first. reopening but builds up again into the second reopening. The special spread. does not increase as much as into the first reopening, however, because the supply of the OTR notes is now significantly larger. The cycle then repeats. once more, into the issue of the next OTR note, but the supply of the current. OTR notes is now too large for the special spread to increase by very much.  

While the story in the previous paragraph describes average behavior,. Figure 10.9 illustrates how the behavior of special spreads varies across bond issues. Figure 10.10 emphasizes this point by showing, with dotted lines around the averages, two-standard-deviation confidence intervals. For example, while the average special spread of an OTR 10-year one day before its first reopening is 156 basis points, the two-standard-deviation range around that average is from 116 to 196 basis points..  

To conclude the discussion of special spreads, recently issued bonds can command a price premium not only because they are relatively liquid but also because they have value as collateral in the repo market. Put another way, not only can holders of recent issues trade out of their holdings easily, but they can borrow money cheaply by posting these issues as collateral. In fact, along the lines of Figure 10.10, traders can model the special spread of an individual issue over time and thereby estimate the value, over its life, which arises from its expected repo specialness.
