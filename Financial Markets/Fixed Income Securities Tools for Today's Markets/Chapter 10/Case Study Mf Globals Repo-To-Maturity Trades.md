# 10.7 CASE STUDY: MF GLOBAL'S REPO-TO-MATURITY TRADES  

In March 2010, MF Global was a broker-dealer and futures commission. merchant, in the business of making markets in exchange-traded and. over-the-counter derivatives.12 Experiencing poor performance, in particular, a fiscal-year loss of $\$195$ million in its core businesses, the company hired Jon Corzine as CEO. Corzine worked for Goldman Sachs from 1976 to 1999 and was chair and CEO from 1994 to 1999. He was a US senator from New Jersey from 2001 to 2006 and the governor of New Jersey from 2006-2010.  

Corzine was told by the ratings agencies that MF Global would need to increase earnings to avoid a ratings downgrade, with Moody's specifying a target of between $\$200$ million and $\$300$ million pretax annual profits by September 30, 2011. Faced with this timeline, and pursuing part of a larger vision for the company, Corzine focused on proprietary trading and discovered a particularly attractive opportunity in European government bonds.  

Europe was in the throes of its sovereign debt crisis, with rising concerns. about the solvency of countries in weaker fiscal positions. As one way of dealing with the situation, the European Union created the European Finan-. cial Stability Facility (EFsF), in which all of the countries in Europe, as of. May 2010, essentially guaranteed each other's debt until the end of June. 2013.  

TABLE 10.7 European Short-Term Government Bond Rates, as of December 2010. Rates Are in Percent.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Country</td><td>Short-Term Bond Rate</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>0.70</td></tr><tr><td>Italy</td><td>2.25</td></tr><tr><td>Spain</td><td>3.32</td></tr><tr><td>Portugal</td><td>4.50</td></tr><tr><td>Ireland</td><td>6.00</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In this setting, Corzine proposed repo-to-maturity (RTM) trades in the short-term bonds of the weaker European sovereigns. More specifically, MF Global would buy the short-term debt of the weaker sovereigns and sell repo to the maturity of the bonds. Table 10.7 gives the prevailing rates. on short-term government bonds at that time. Term repo rates on these bonds were essentially risk-free rates, and approximately equal to Germany's. short-term bond rate. Furthermore, haircuts on European sovereign repo. were about $3\%$ . Hence, in these RTM trades, MF Global could earn the rates in Table 10.7 on its bond purchases, funded at a repo interest rate cost of about $0.70\%$  

These RTM trades were designed to minimize risk. First, no investments were to be made in the government bonds of Greece, the weakest sovereign at the time. Second, by investing in short-term bonds only, specifically those that mature before the earliest possible expiration of the EFSF in June 2013, default risk was minimal: bondholders would lose principal only if Europe as a whole reneged on its EFSF commitments, which was considered extremely unlikely. Third, by selling the repo to the maturity of the bonds, there was no risk of losing funding in the middle of the trade.13 Funding the trades with overnight repo, by contrast, runs the risk that funders refuse to roll as sovereign creditworthiness deteriorates and prices fall. In that scenario, instead of realizing the full principal amount at maturity, MF Global could be forced into selling the bonds early at a loss in order to pay off the repo loans.  

The RTM trades were also attractive from an accounting perspective. Assume that MF Global owns a bond today. Then, by selling the repo today, the firm receives money today and extinguishes future cash flows: the bond's principal payment at maturity is used to pay off the repo loan. By this reasoning, accounting rules at the time regarded selling the repo as equivalent to selling the bond today. Therefore, when MF Global bought a bond and sold the repo, it could immediately book the profits from the trade (i.e., the difference between the bond coupon and repo interest) and did not have to disclose the trades to investors. The immediate booking of profit was particularly appealing to Corzine, who was under pressure to show earnings to the rating agencies. But the failure to disclose the trades would contribute to the firm's problems later on. In any case, MF Global quickly grew its position in RTM trades, from which it booked $\$15$ million in profits in the third. quarter of 2010; $\$47$ million in the fourth quarter; $\$25$ million in the first. quarter of 2011; and more than $\$38$ million in the second quarter.  

MF Global's risk manager, Michael Roseman, understood one significant risk of the RTM trades. Had the repo counterparty been a dealer, the haircut would likely have been fixed over the term of the repo. There would be variation margin calls, of course, but those are limited to restoring the initial haircut. MF Global's repo, however, was with the London Clearing House (LCH), which has the right to change haircuts at any time. Roseman recognized that, if the sovereign credit situation worsened and LCH increased haircuts, MF Global might not have enough cash on hand to stay in the trades. That is, bonds might have to be sold at a loss to raise cash to post as additional margin. He therefore supported a position limit of $\$4.75$ billion, because, at that size and at an assumed worst-case scenario of average haircuts at $15\%$ , MF Global would be able to meet future margin requirements with readily available cash.  

MF Global grew its RTM positions rapidly, reaching the $\$4.75$ billion limit by year-end 2010. MF Global wanted to increase its position further, however, and fired Roseman at the end of January 2011. The trajectory of. MF Global's position is shown in Figure 10.11. Positions increased dramat-. ically in 2011, reaching a peak of $\$11.5$ billion in June. This peak position included a significant volume of reverse RTM trades, in which MF Global shorted French government bonds and loaned the proceeds in repo. These. reverse RTM trades were expected to reduce margin requirements and the. volatility of variation margin calls, because, to the extent that the prices of. weaker sovereign bonds and French bonds move together, changes in the. collateral value of the weaker sovereigns posted by MF Global are offset. by changes in the collateral value of French bonds held by MF Global. To the extent that weaker sovereign bond prices fall more than French bonds, of course, the reverse RTM trades do not hedge the RTM trades. And, in any case, the reverse RTM trades do not reduce the risk of repo haircuts increasing for the weaker sovereigns.  

Along with MF Global's position size, Figure 10.11 shows haircuts over time for repo on the bonds of two of the more challenged European sovereigns, namely, Ireland (IE) and Portugal (PT). Haircuts were increased several times, from $3\%$ , when MF Global first put on its trades, to $80\%$ in July 2011. In other words, for these sovereigns, required margin on a repo of 100 of collateral value rose from 3 to 80. These dramatic increases in margin were likely due partially to deteriorating sovereign credits and partially to the size and perceived precariousness of MF Global's position.

The cash implications for MF Global are summarized in Table 10.8,. which shows -- across all sovereigns - RTM positions, dollar margin, and percent margin over time. As position size increased to its peak in June 2011, the percent margin rose somewhat from its initial value. From then on, however,. as LCH raised haircuts on the weaker sovereigns, the percent margin kept. increasing despite MF Global's having reduced positions dramatically. Correspondingly, the dollar margin required for a position of about. $\$6$ billion increased from $\$170$ million in early June to $\$665$ million in late October. The table also shows that MF Global would have done well to stay within Roseman's position limit, which was sustainable even if average haircuts. increased to $15\%$  

In the second and third quarters of 2011, problems in addition to the cash drain from rising haircuts caused counterparties and creditors to withdraw support from MF Global. First, regulators and accountants decided that selling repo did not constitute the sale of a bond.14 This change led. regulators to increase MF Global's capital requirements significantly and forced MF Global to disclose its RTM positions, which, in the midst of the European sovereign debt crisis, surprised the market unfavorably. Second, MF Global lost $\$192$ million in its core businesses, that is, unrelated to the. RTM trades. MF Global was downgraded to below investment grade, and it filed for Chapter 11 at the end of October 2011..  

MF Global lost over $\$400$ million in the liquidation of its RTM positions, a huge number relative to the profits given earlier. Particularly provoking is the fact that $50\%$ of the RTM portfolio, and, for example, over $90\%$ of its position in Italian sovereign bonds, matured within two months of the bankruptcy. And, as shown in Figure 10.11, haircuts on Ireland and Portugal sovereign bond repo fell back to $15\%$ by the end of November. In short, had MF Global sized its position to account for the financing risk of increased haircuts, it might have profited rather than have been destroyed by its RTM trades.  

# Note and Bond Futures  

utures on government bonds are among the most liquid fixed income. products around the world, used to hedge interest rate risk and to take. positions on changes in bond prices. Figure 11.1 shows how the total DV01 traded across all US Treasury bonds and futures is divided across instruments.1 By this metric, the 10-year note futures contract is the single instru-. ment with the greatest volume, and volumes traded in other futures contracts rival those of on-the-run Treasury securities. Futures contracts are appealing. because of their liquidity, and also because relatively little cash is required to establish sizable positions. The US Treasury futures discussed in this chapter trade on the CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade), which is part of the CME Group.  

A forward contract on a bond is an agreement that fixes the price at which a bond is to be bought and sold on some future date. Forward contracts on bonds are rarely traded in the United States, because, as is shown next, the same economics can be achieved by trading bonds and repo. Under-. standing forward contracts is important, however, because futures are essentially forwards with the complexities of daily settlement and various delivery options. This chapter, therefore, first describes forward contracts and then adds these features of futures contracts. The exposition includes a discussion of basis trades, in which futures are traded against synthetic forward bond positions, and the chapter concludes with a case study about basis trades through the volatility of March 2020, at the start of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns.  

For concreteness in explaining concepts, this chapter focuses on the. 10-year US Treasury note contract. Other US bond futures are similar, as. are many government bond futures around the world. Contracts on UK and Chinese government bonds, for example, are particularly similar to those.
