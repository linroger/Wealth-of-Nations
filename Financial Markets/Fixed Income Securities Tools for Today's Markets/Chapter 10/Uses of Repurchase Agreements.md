# 10.2 USES OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  

This section describes the four major uses of repurchase agreements: investing and cash management, long financing, shorts or short financing, and collateral swaps.  

Repo is popular as a short-term investment and as a place to park cash for a short period of time. Not only is lending cash through repo particularly safe, as explained in the previous section, but lenders can calibrate the default risks they are willing to bear by choosing haircuts (e.g.,. $2\%$ for Treasuries, $5\%$ for investment-grade corporates), the set of acceptable collateral (e.g., government bonds with maturities less than two years, any government bond, government bonds and investment-grade corporates), and their repo counterparties. Furthermore, by choosing the term of the repo agreement (e.g., overnight, 30 days), lenders can choose their desired liquidity, that is, the time after which they will again have use of their cash. Along these lines, repo is an important alternative to bank deposits. Both repo and bank deposits are highly liquid, but, while bank deposits of up to $\$250,000$ are federally insured, larger deposits at many banks might not be considered as safe as secured repo investments..  

Because of repo's popularity as a short-term investment, many repo buy-. ers are called repo investors. The most important class of such investors are money market funds, which are described in detail in Chapter O. Because shareholders in these funds can easily redeem their shares for cash except,. perhaps, in times of great stress, managers of money market funds maintain liquidity by investing a large portion of their assets in particularly liquid products, like repo. Mutual funds, which must also plan for some amount of shareholder redemptions, also invest in repo as a liquid investment. Other repo investors, like municipalities and nonfinancial corporations, are motivated by the need to manage cash inflows and outflows. A municipality receives tax payments and makes expenditures throughout the year, but the timing of receipts generally does not match the timing of outlays. Therefore, cash on hand needs to be invested in short-term, safe products, like repo. Similarly, because the receivables and payables of nonfinancial corporations do not generally coincide, repo is often used to park excess cash on hand.  

A second common use of repo is long financing, which refers to the pur-. chase of financial instruments with mostly borrowed money. An important example, illustrated in Figure 10.3, is the use of repo by broker-dealers to facilitate market making in bonds. As shown in the top panel of the figure, a customer sells bonds to the trading desk, for which the desk pays cash. But the business model of trading desks is to earn relatively small fees relatively frequently using a minimum of scarce capital. Therefore, rather than using. capital to purchase the customer's bonds, the trading desk chooses to raise funds in the repo market, that is, to repo out the bonds, or sell the repo, to. a repo buyer. Note that, because of haircuts, the trading desk cannot raise the full value of the bonds it bought in the repo market. Consequently, the trading desk does use a small amount of its own capital to fund margin, that is, to pay the customer that portion of the purchase price that is not funded with repo. In short, a fixed income market-making desk funds its inventory predominantly with repo, but in small part with capital.

FIGURE 10.3 Long Financing.  

The bottom panel of Figure 10.3 shows how the trading desk exits its cash and repo market positions. At some point after the desk's original purchase of the bonds, another customer comes along wanting to buy those same bonds. The trading desk sells the bonds to the customer, uses the proceeds to pay off its repo borrowings and takes back the bonds for delivery to the customer. At this point it can be pointed out that purchases and sales of a particular bond on a given day cancel, and do not require repo funding. It is only the residual inventory carried from one day to the next that needs to be funded.3  

Another example of long financing would be a trader or investor who wants to lever returns by buying a bond with borrowed money. At initiation,. the investor buys the bond in the cash market and repos it out to raise most of the purchase price. To terminate the trade, the investor sells the bond in. the cash market and uses the proceeds to pay off the repo loan. Of course, if the bond price falls in the interim, the investor must raise cash elsewhere to discharge the loan. While the market-making desk described in the previous. paragraph also seems to bear the risk of falling prices, market makers tend to hedge the interest rate risk of their inventory. Therefore, any loss on the long position, which leaves a deficit with respect to the repo loan, can likely. be covered by the corresponding profits of a hedging, short position..  

Sometimes the purchaser of a bond knows the exact term over which the bond needs to be financed. In most cases, however, the term of financing is not known. In the case of the market-making desk, the customer that ultimately purchases the bond from inventory may appear very soon after. the desk itself purchases the bond or days later. In the case of the leveraged investor, market conditions might cause the investor to terminate the position sooner or later. Therefore, the repo agreement in long financing trades may expire before the end of the trade. In that case, the repo seller needs to roll the repo. Consider a repo seller who has financed the purchase of $\$100$ million face amount of the 2.75s of 02/15/2028 with an overnight repo. along the lines of Figure 10.1. If the repo seller wants to stay in the trade for an additional day, that is, if the repo seller does not yet want to repay the repo loan, the repo buyer would have to agree to roll the loan for another day. If the repo buyer does agree, collateral or cash is adjusted to maintain the appropriate amount of margin, and the repo seller can keep the money. for another day. If the repo buyer does not agree, the repo seller must find another counterparty to finance the position and use the money borrowed from that counterparty to repay the loan due to the original repo buyer. The. process of rolling a repo is depicted in Figure 10.4. Note that, because the price of the bonds may have changed over the day, the repo seller may receive more or less cash from the new repo buyer than is needed to discharge the loan due to the original repo buyer.  

The duration of repo agreements can be overnight,4 term (i.e., any fixed duration greater than one day), or open. Open repos are overnight repos that roll automatically for an additional day until cancelled by the lender of cash. The popularity of this contractual form reflects the many instances in. which counterparties are unsure of how long financing will be needed..

FIGURE 10.4  Roll of a Repurchase Agreement.  

At this point, it can be noted that operational aspects of repo markets are complex. Consider the roll in Figure 10.4. The repo seller needs to post its bonds to the new repo buyer to get cash, but the original repo buyer is unlikely to release those bonds until its loan is repaid -- that is, after all, the whole point of holding collateral. Issues like this are resolved through the services of a third-party agent, as described in the next section.  

A third common use of repo is the establishment of short positions or short financing. A short position is initiated by selling a bond without owning it, whether as a bet that its price will fall or as part of a larger trade to hedge a particular long position. In the top panel of Figure 10.5, a hedge fund sells bonds that it does not have to some buyer in the cash market. The hedge fund then takes the bonds it sold from a broker-dealer in the repo market, delivers those bonds to the buyer, receives the proceeds of the bond sale, and then lends those proceeds to the broker-dealer. To unwind its short position, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 10.5, the hedge fund buys the bonds in the cash market, returns the bonds to the broker-dealer, collects its loan proceeds from the broker dealer, and uses those proceeds to pay for its purchase of the bonds in the cash market.  

Using the language of this chapter, the hedge fund does buy the repo,. but its motivation is very different from cash managers or investors who buy repo: the hedge fund's motivation is not to park or invest cash, but to borrow the bonds. For this reason, it is more commonly said that the hedge fund does a reverse repo or that it reverses in the bonds. Note that. this industry jargon is such that a single transaction - the repo agreement.

between the broker-dealer and the hedge fund -- changes names depending on the counterparty: the broker-dealer does a repo or repos out the bonds, while the hedge fund does a reverse repo or reverses in the bonds..  

The different motivations for buying repo introduce another aspect of the repo market. As mentioned already, when cash managers and investors buy repo, they choose the general asset classes and maturities they are willing to accept as collateral. But they do not care about which particular bonds they receive. For this reason, these trades are called general collateral or GC. trades, and the repo seller chooses which bonds to deliver subject to some set of general parameters. By contrast, a market participant who shorts a bond and does a reverse repo requires the exact bond that was sold in the cash market. These trades, therefore, are called special collateral or specials trades. The pricing of GC and special spreads is discussed later in the chapter.  

The fourth and final use of repo discussed here is a collateral swap, which is described in Figure 10.6. A broker-dealer might choose to hold an inventory of corporate bonds but would like its overall holdings to be more liquid, that is, more easily and at a lower cost turned into cash, should the need arise. This preference for additional liquidity might result from prudent management, regulatory requirements, or both. In any case, at the same time, an insurance company or pension fund with long-term holdings of Treasury bonds might be happy to sacrifice liquidity temporarily in order to earn some extra return. The broker-dealer and the insurance or pension company, therefore, might agree on a collateral swap: the broker-dealer exchanges its corporates for Treasuries over the term of the trade, paying a fee to do so (e.g., 25 basis points on the value exchanged).
