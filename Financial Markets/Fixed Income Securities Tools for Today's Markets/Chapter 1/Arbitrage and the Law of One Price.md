# 1.4 ARBITRAGE AND THE LAW OF ONE PRICE  

While the law of one price is intuitive, its real justification rests on a stronger. foundation. It turns out that a deviation from the law of one price implies the existence of an arbitrage opportunity, that is, a trade that generates profit. without any chance of losing money.4 But because arbitrageurs would flock toward any such trade, market prices can be expected to adjust quickly so as to rule out any significant deviations from the law of one price. Put another way, arbitrage activity can be expected to enforce the law of one price.  

To make this argument more concrete, consider an arbitrage trade based on the richness of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022, as reported in Table 1.4. More specifically, sell or short' the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 and simultaneously buy a portfolio of bonds, from among the bonds in bold in Table 1.4, which perfectly replicates the cash flows of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022. Because the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 are rich relative to the bonds in bold, selling the former and buying a portfolio of the latter, in a way that generates no future cash flows, should generate a riskless profit. Table 1.5 describes this replicating portfolio and this arbitrage trade in more detail.  

Columns (2) through (4) of Table 1.5 correspond to the three bonds cho-. sen from Table 1.2 to construct the replicating portfolio. Row (ii) gives the face amount of each bond in the replicating portfolio, that is, the portfolio is long about 2.90 face amount of the 2.875s of 11/15/2021; about 2.94 of the. 2.125s of 05/15/2022; and about 102.98 of the 1.625s of 11/15/2022. Rows (iv) through (vi) show the cash flows from those face amounts of each bond. For example, 102.97582 face amount of the 1.625s of 11/15/2022 generates coupon payments of $102.97582\times1.625\%/2=0.83668$ on November

15, 2021, and on May 15, 2022, and coupon plus principal payments of $102.97582\times(1+1.625\%/2)=103.8125$ on November 15, 2022. Row (vii) gives the price of each of the bonds, simply copied from Table 1.2, and row. (vili) gives the cost of purchasing the face amount of each bond given in row. (iii). As an example of the latter, the cost of purchasing 2.94454 face amount of the 2.125s of $05/15/2022$ at a price of 102.0662 (per 100 face amount) is $2.94454\times102.0662\%=3.00538$  

Column (5) of Table 1.5 gives details of the rich bond to be sold, namely, the 7.625s of 11/15/2022. Its cash flows on the three payment dates are given in rows (iv) through (vi). And, most importantly, note that the sums of the cash flows of the three replicating bonds for each date equal the cash flows of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022. More specifically, $2.94454+0.03129+$ $0.83668=3.8125$ $2.97583+0.83668=3.8125$ ; and trivially, $103.8125=$ 103.8125. Hence, the replicating portfolio, as defined by the three bonds and their respective face amounts in row (iii), do indeed replicate the cash flows of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022. Section A1.1 in the appendix to this chapter shows how to derive the face amounts of the bonds in this or any such replicating portfolio.  

The discussion now returns to the arbitrage trade. According to row. (ix) of Table 1.5, an arbitrageur can sell 100 face amount of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 for 111.3969 and buy the replicating portfolio for 111.2797, which is just the sum of the costs of the three bond positions given in row. (viii). The net proceeds of this trade, given in row. $\mathbf{\rho}(\mathbf{x})$ , is 0.1172, or about  

12 cents. But, by definition of the replicating portfolio, this trade will neither generate nor require cash on any of the three future payment dates. Hence, through this trade, the arbitrageur receives 12 cents today without incurring any future obligations. While these proceeds may seem small, the trade described in Table 1.5 can, at least in theory, be scaled up dramatically. For example, selling $\$500$ million of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 and buying the appropriately sized replicating portfolio would generate a riskless profit of $\$123,456,7890$  

As discussed at the start of this section, if a riskless and profitable trade like the one just described were readily available, arbitrageurs would collectively rush to do the trade and, in so doing, force prices to relative levels that admit no further arbitrage opportunities. In the present example, arbitrageurs would drive the price of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 lower and the price of the replicating portfolio higher until the two were equal.  

The crucial link between arbitrage and the law of one price can now be explained. The total cost of the replicating portfolio, 111.2797, given in row (ix) of Table 1.5, exactly equals the present value of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 as reported in Table 1.4. In other words, exactly the same value for the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 is computed through the law of one price (i.e., applying discount factors derived from the prices of bonds in the replicating portfolio) and through arbitrage pricing (i.e., finding the price of the replicating portfolio). This is not a coincidence. Section A1.2 in the appendix proves that these two pricing methodologies are mathematically identical. Hence, applying the law of one price, that is, pricing with discount. factors, is identical to relying on the activity of arbitrageurs to eliminate relative mispricings. Put another way, discounting cash flows can be justifiably regarded as shorthand for the more complex and persuasive arbitrage pricing. methodology.  

Despite the theory, of course, as of mid-May 2021, the market price of the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 is quoted at about 12 cents more than the value of the replicating portfolio. This can be attributed to one or a combination of factors. First, there are transaction costs in doing arbitrage trades that could significantly lower or even wipe out any arbitrage profit. In particular, all of the prices in this chapter are ask prices, whereas, in reality, an arbitrageur might have to buy bonds at ask prices but sell other bonds at lower bid prices. Second, transaction costs in the financing markets (see Chapter 10), which are incurred when borrowing money to buy bonds and when borrowing bonds to short them, might similarly overwhelm any arbitrage profit. Third, it is only in theory that US Treasury bonds are commodities, that is, fungible collections of cash flows. In reality, bonds have idiosyncratic characteristics that manifest themselves in prices. The discussion of Table 1.4 mentions the richness of older, high-coupon bonds, and the next section will show idiosyncratic differences in the pricing of Treasury STRIPS.  

# 1.5APPLICATION: IDIOSYNCRATIC PRICING OF TREASURY STRIPS  

In contrast to coupon bonds that make payments every six months, zero coupon bonds make no payments until maturity. Zero coupon bonds issued by the US Treasury are called STRIPS. For example, $\$1,000,000$ face amount of STRIPS maturing on May 15, 2030, promises only one payment: $\$1,000,000$ on that date. STRIPS are created when a particular coupon bond is delivered to the Treasury in exchange for claims on its future coupon and principal components. Table 1.6 illustrates the stripping of $\$1,000,000$ face amount of the 0.625s of 05/15/2030. As of mid-May 2021, the bond has nine years remaining to maturity, which means it will make 18 coupon payments, from November 15, 2021, to May 15, 2030, and one principal payment, on May 15, 2030. STRIPS received in exchange for coupon (interest) payments are called TINTs, INTs, or C-STRIPS, while STRIPS received in exchange for principal payments are called TPs, Ps, or P-STRIPS. Table 1.6 shows that stripping $\$1,000,000$ face amount of the 0.625s of 05/15/2030 generates $\$1,000,0000\times0.625\%/2=\S3,125$ face amount of C-STRIPS maturing on each coupon payment date and $\$1,000,000$ face amount of P-STRIPS maturing on the bond's maturity date.  

The Treasury not only creates STRIPS but retires them as well. For. example, upon delivery of all of the STRIPS in Table 1.6, the Treasury would reconstitute the $\$1,000,000$ face amount of the 0.625s of 05/15/2030. It is critical to note, however, that C-STRIPS are fungible while P-STRIPS are not. When reconstituting a bond, any C-STRIPS maturing on a particular date may be applied toward the coupon payment of that bond on that date.. By contrast, only P-STRIPS that were stripped from a particular bond may be used to reconstitute the principal payment of that bond.6 This feature of the STRIPS program implies that P-STRIPS, and not C-STRIPS, are likely to inherit the cheapness or richness of the bonds from which they are stripped.

STRIPS prices are essentially discount factors. If the price of C-STRIPS maturing on May 15, 2030, is 85.9453 per 100 face amount, then the implied discount factor to that date is 0.859453.  

As of mid-May 2021, the STRIPS market provides another illustration of the idiosyncratic pricing of US Treasury bonds, that is, of the occasional failures of the law of one price to describe prices accurately. Table 1.7 iso-. lates one such case by reporting the prices of three STRIPS that all mature on May 15, 2030. In theory, because each of these zero coupon bonds pay. $\$1$ on May 15, 2030, they should all sell for the same price. But they don't. The C-STRIPS maturing on that date are priced at 85.95, while two P-STRIPS, one from stripping the 0.625s of 05/15/2030 and the other from stripping. the 6.25s of 05/15/2030, are priced at 86.85 and 87.04, respectively. Reiterating the discussion earlier, these price discrepancies do not necessarily imply an arbitrage opportunity of buying the C-STRIPS and shorting one of. the P-STRIPS because of likely significant market frictions. An investor planning to buy and hold one of these zero coupon bonds to maturity, however, would certainly be most attracted to the C-STRIPS.  

Figure 1.2 shows a broader pattern of the idiosyncratic pricing of. STRIPS. The thick, round data points are C-STRIPS prices, and the plus. signs are P-STRIPS prices, where prices are on the left axis. As an aside, because STRIPS prices are discount factors times 100, the C-STRIPS data points depict a collection of discount factors out to 30 years, down to a value of 48.60 at 30 years. But returning to the main point, many P-STRIPS. prices are clearly not identical to C-STRIPS prices of identical maturity. To highlight this point, the difference between P-STRIPS and C-STRIPS prices of the same maturity are graphed as short dashes against the right axis. A few of the differences are negative, but most are positive, and some significantly so, reaching a peak of 1.91 per 100 face amount at a term of 18.5 years.
