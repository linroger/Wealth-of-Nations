# 1.1 GOVERNMENT COUPON BONDS  

The cash flows from government coupon bonds are defined by coupon rate; maturity date; and, synonymously, face amount, principal amount, or par value. For example, in May 2014 the US Treasury sold a bond with a coupon rate of. $2.5\%$ and a maturity date of May 15, 2024. Purchasing $\$1$ million face amount of these $^{\bullet\circ}2.5s$ of $05/15/2024^{\mathfrak{N}}$ entitles the buyer, as of settlement in mid-May 2021, to the schedule of payments depicted in Table 1.1. More specifically, the Treasury promises to make a coupon payment every six months equal to half the bond's annual coupon rate of $2.5\%$ times the face amount, that is, $2.5\%/2\times\S1,000,000=\S12,500$ Finally, on the maturity date of May 15, 2024, in addition to the coupon payment on that date, the Treasury promises to pay the bond's face amount of $\$1,000,000$ 1.  

This chapter restricts attention to US Treasury bonds, but the analytics presented here apply easily to bonds issued by other countries, because cash flows across sovereign bonds differ mostly with respect to the frequency of coupon payments. Government bonds in France and Germany, for example, make annual coupon payments, while those in Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom pay semiannually, as in the United States.  

Returning to the US Treasury market, Table 1.2 reports the prices of selected US Treasury bonds as of May 14, 2021. Per market convention, bond prices are always quoted per 100 face amount. Also, each price in the table is a full or invoice ask price, that is, the total price at which traders. stand ready to sell that particular bond. (The division of full price into a flat or quoted price and accrued interest will be explained later in the chapter.) From the third row of the table, then, for example, purchasing the 1.625s.

The bonds in Table 1.2 are selected from the broader list of US Treasuries for two reasons. First, it is convenient for the computations in the next section that bonds mature in approximate six-month intervals. Second,. when two or more Treasury bonds mature on a given date, the most recently issued bond is chosen because it is likely to be more liquid and, consequently, its quoted price more reliable. For example, the 0.25s of 05/15/2024, which were issued in 2021, are chosen over the 2.5s of 05/15/2024, which were featured in Table 1.1 and issued in 2014..
