# 11.13 CASE STUDY: BASIS TRADES IN MARCH 2020  

In the wake of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdown, US Treasury yields fell during the second half of February and early March 2020, in a relatively orderly flight to safety. Starting March 9, however, many mar-. ket participants sold Treasury bonds to raise cash, temporarily reversing the decline in yields and ushering in a period of heightened market volatility.. These market movements are illustrated in Figure 11.9, which shows yields of the CTD bonds into the June 2020 two-year (TUM0), five-year (FVM0), and 10-year (TYM0) Treasury note futures contracts.  

For a couple of years before the pandemic, Treasury futures had often traded somewhat rich to their underlying bonds. Many attributed this rela-. tive mispricing to a preference for futures over bonds by regulated financial institutions seeking to limit the sizes of their balance sheets: long futures. positions do not appear on the balance sheet, while purchased bonds do. In any case, Figure 11.10 shows that, through much of February 2020, TYM0 traded a bit rich to its CTD, in that the net basis of the CTD into TYM0 fluc. tuated between zero and minus five ticks. Figure 11.11 shows that TUM0 and FVM0, along with TYM0, traded slightly rich in that the implied repo rate of the CTD bonds into these contracts exceeded the actual repo rate, represented by SOFR.11

Responding to the chronic richness of futures contracts, hedge funds and their relative value traders consistently bought the CTD basis. To understand the attractiveness of this trade, consider a hedge fund that on February 10, 2020, buys $\$1$ billion face amount of the TYM0 CTD basis at. $-4.0$ ticks, which is consistent with the levels shown in Figure 11.10. Given that interest rates are almost certainly not going to rise enough to change the CTD, the net basis will be zero at expiration, and the profit on the trade would be $(4/32)\%$ times $\$1$ billion, or $\$1.25$ million. If levered 20-to-1, which many. believe was typical for trades of this type, the hedge fund would assign $\$50$ million of capital to the trade and earn a return on capital, from February 10 to June 30 (141 days), of $\$1.25$ million $\$50$ million or $2.5\%$ , which is about. $6.5\%$ annualized. If levered 40-1, which has been characterized as common for these trades, assigned capital would be $\$25$ million and the annualized return would be about 13%.12

Buying the basis at a negative price and holding the position until the net basis converges to zero had indeed, for some time, been a relatively reliable and stable money machine. From March 9, however, when Treasury yields became much more volatile, so did the P&L of long basis trades. The newfound volatility of the trade can be seen from the net and gross basis of TYM0 in Figure 11.10 and from the implied repo of TYM0, FVM0, and TUM0 in Figure 11.11. The market dislocations at that time can also be seen from rising spreads between CTD yields and the yields of nondeliverable, but otherwise comparable bonds. The TUM0 line in Figure 11.12 shows the difference between the yields of the 1.875s of 02/28/2022 and the CTD into TUM0, that is, the 2.375s of 03/15/2022. While these two bonds traded at a low and stable spread through February and early March, that spread rose and became much more volatile over the rest of March. Similarly behaved are the FVM0 and TYM0 spreads, that is, the spread between the 1.875s of 08/31/2024 and the CTD into FVM0, that is, the 1.25s of 08/31/2024, and the spread between the 2s of 11/15/2026 and the CTD into TYM0, that is, the 2.25s of 02/15/2027. Generally speaking, liquidity is in high demand. when markets are volatile, and the most liquid bonds tend to trade at a premium. CTD bonds, which inherit the liquidity of their associated futures. contracts, trade in volatile markets at a premium relative to bonds that - in normal times - are comparable. This premium, however, like the demand for liquidity, can be quite volatile, as evident from Figure 11.12..

Long basis trades seem riskless, so long as they can be held to expiration. Through volatile markets, however, traders might not actually be able to maintain their positions. To illustrate, Table 11.9 describes a $\$1$ billion long TYM0 CTD basis trade initiated at -8.33 ticks on March 6, 2020, and held through March 12, 2020. The table assumes that a trader buys $\$1$ billion face amount of the bonds; sells a conversion-factor weighted and tailed number of futures contracts, in this case, 7,978 contracts;13 and sells the CTD repo to the expiration of the contract. For this trade, therefore, as explained earlier in the chapter, the daily $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ , measured as of the delivery date, equals the change in the net basis times the $\$1$ billion face amount of the bond position.  

The net basis closed at about $-18.5$ ticks on March 9, generating a loss of about $\$3.2$ million. This is a sizable loss given that the target horizon profit of the trade is only the original 8.33 ticks, that is, $(8/32)\%$ times $\$1$ billion, or. $\$2.5$ million. Many hedge funds manage risk, at least in part, by loss limits, and a loss of this magnitude might result in a trader being forced to exit the position. From then on, Table 11.9 reports that the trade makes money, as the net basis rises to nearly zero. By reporting only daily closes, however, the table minimizes the true volatility of the trade: a trader might be forced out of the positions because of a large, adverse intraday change in the net basis.  

Another way a trader might be forced out of the basis trade is the need.. to come up with cash. As of March 6, with maintenance margin at $\$1,275$ per contract, the short of 7,978 contracts requires posting a bit more than $\$10$ million to the exchange.14 With the trade losing money on March 9, the hedge fund needs to make daily settlement payments on the futures contracts. and variation margin payments on the term repo positions, which essen-. tially sum to the P&L for the day, that is, to about $\$3.2$ million. In addition, because of increased market volatility, the exchange increased the margin. requirement from $\$1,275$ to $\$1,375$ per contract, generating a margin call. of nearly. $\$800,000$ . In total, then the hedge fund has to come up with an additional $\$4$ million on March 9. This is a very large number relative, once again, to the target profit of. $\$2.5$ million. These cash requirements also clar-. ify the concreteness of allocated capital, because that capital really does need to be available to meet the cash requirements of the trade. In any case, as the. trade makes money after March 9, cash requirements fall, but not as quickly as indicated by the. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ ; the exchange increased margin requirements once again on March 11..  

A final way a trader might be forced out of a basis trade applies only to those that finance the bond purchases with overnight rather than term repo. In calm markets, rolling over overnight repo is nearly equivalent to term repo. More precisely, if the term repo rate reflects future, unchanging overnight rates, and if financing is plentiful, then there is no important difference in borrowing overnight and borrowing term. In more volatile markets, however, borrowing overnight adds two significant sources of risk.  

First, the overnight rate can rise or fall relative to what could have. been locked in to term. In March 2020, as shown in Figure 11.13, the overnight repo rate, as represented by SOFR, declined precipitously as the Federal Reserve lowered rates to accommodate market conditions. Bearing. this risk actually worked in favor of traders who had not locked in term repo rates - with one caveat to be discussed presently - as they could roll overnight repo at lower and lower rates. Another way to express the advantage of not locking in term rates is to compare the gross and net basis of TYM0 in Figure 11.10. As the repo rate falls, the carry of the CTD increases, which means that its gross basis increases relative to its net basis..  

Second, in stressed markets, prime brokers might reduce risk by limiting. lending to hedge funds in the basis trade, or, with similar effect, by increasing repo haircuts. In that case, basis traders who did not lock in term repo might. have to reduce position size or even exit a position at a loss. Some evidence of this funding risk through March 2020 can be seen from the difference. between the 99th percentile repo rate and SOFR in Figure 11.13. Through. February, the spread of the highest rate percentile of repo transactions over. the median SOFR rate was typically only 10 or 11 basis points. In March, however, that spread was between 20 and 50 basis points on several days and hit a peak of 174 basis points on March 16. These data strongly imply. that at least some overnight repo borrowers had trouble borrowing money. against Treasuries. Furthermore, basis traders who had not locked in term. rates might very well have had to roll over borrowing at rates very much above term rates they might have locked in at an earlier date..

# Short-Term Rates and Their Derivatives  

but even within a single currency there are typically several rates that reflect differences in collateral, market participants, and term. This chapter introduces some of the most important short-term interest rates across currencies and describes the global transition away from LIBOR. The chapter then describes a number of interest rate derivatives contracts - one-month SOFR. futures, fed funds futures, three-month SOFR futures, Euribor FRAs, and. Euribor futures - and explains their use in hedging exposures to short-term interest rates. A detour shows how combining fed funds futures prices with Federal Reserve Board meeting dates is used to imply expectations of the Federal Reserve's target rate and to construct benchmark interest rate curves for general use. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion on the difference between futures and forward rates. Notes on pricing rate forwards and futures on rates with term structure models can be found in the appendix to Chapter 12.
