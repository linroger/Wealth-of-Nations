# 11.11 FUTURES PRICE AND THE QUALITY OPTION BEFORE EXPIRATION  

It is shown earlier, and illustrated in Table 11.7, that the futures price at expi-. ration is the minimum ratio of price to conversion factor across deliverable bonds. This section analyzes the futures price before expiration. The basic. idea is as follows. If the CTD were known with certainty, then (abstracting. from the futures-forward difference) the futures price would equal the for-. ward price of the CTD divided by its conversion factor. But because the CTD is not known with certainty, and because the seller of the futures contract has the option to choose which bond to deliver, the futures price is reduced by the value of that delivery option..  

To illustrate this idea graphically, Figure 11.6 shows a yield-price curve for TYU1, as of May 14, 2021, along with the ratios of forward prices to. conversion factors for two deliverable bonds - the shortest-duration bond in the basket, the 2.875s of 05/15/2028, and the longest-duration bond in. the basket, the 1.125s of $02/15/2031.$ The horizontal axis gives the assumed yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 as of May 14, 2021, which for graphical. clarity, is limited to the range of $4.00\%$ to $5.50\%$ . The yield of the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 and the repo rate are assumed to be at fixed spreads to the. yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028.9 The futures price corresponding to each.

FIGURE 11.6 TYU1 Price with Two Deliverable Bonds, as of May 14, 2021. Yields Are Assumed to Move in Parallel with a Volatility of 100 Basis Points per Year.  

yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 is calculated using a very simple model, which assumes that i) changes in the yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 from its starting value along the horizontal axis to the expiration date, September 30, 2021, are normally distributed with a volatility of 100 basis points per year; ii) spreads of the yield of the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 and the repo rate to the yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 are fixed; and iii) delivery occurs on September 30, 2021; that is, only the quality option is considered. The appendix to this chapter describes the pricing of futures in a term structure. model in more detail.  

There are only four and a half months from the pricing date of the figure,. May 14, 2021, to the last delivery date, September 30, 2021. Therefore, when yields are very low on May 14, 2021, it is extremely likely that the relatively low-duration 2.875s of 05/15/2028 will be CTD at expiration. Or,. put differently, it is extremely unlikely that rates will rise enough for the relatively high-duration 1.125s of 02/15/2031 to become CTD. Recognizing this, the market assumes that the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 will be delivered and sets that bond's net basis very close to zero, or, equivalently, sets the futures price very near the ratio of that bond's forward price to its conversion factor. This can be seen in Figure 11.6: for low rates, the semi-transparent, gray band representing the futures price converges to the forward price-conversion factor ratio of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028. Analogously, when rates are very high on  

May 14, 2021, it is extremely likely that the relatively high-duration 1.125s of 02/15/2031 will be CTD; its net basis is near zero; and the futures price converges to the ratio of its forward price to its conversion factor.  

For intermediate rates shown in the figure, the futures price is less than the forward price-conversion factor ratio of both bonds. Buyers will not price the futures under the assumption that the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 are delivered with certainty, because the sellers - who minimize the value of the futures - will switch from delivering the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 to delivering the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 exactly in those scenarios that hurt the buyers. Hence, the futures price must be lower than it would be under the assumption that the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 will be delivered with certainty. By the same logic, the futures price must be lower than it would be under the assumption that the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 will be delivered with certainty. In fact, the distance between either bond curve and the futures price curve. at a given yield represents the value of the seller's option to switch from delivering one bond to delivering the other. That value is low when rates are very high or very low, because one bond or the other is almost certain to. be delivered. Furthermore, if the assumed volatility of yields were higher, so that yields are more likely to move far from their levels as of the pricing date, the option to switch would increase in value, and the futures curve would be even more below the bond curves.  

Figure 11.7 illustrates the value of the quality option as of May 14, 2021,. for yields as of that pricing date ranging from. $0\%$ to $7\%$ , in terms of the net. basis of three bonds: the low- and high-duration bonds described earlier, and an intermediate-duration bond in the basket, the 3.125s of 11/15/2028. These curves are computed using the same model as in Figure 11.6..  

The net basis of the low-duration bond, the 2.875s of 05/15/2028, is. near zero for low yields, because at those levels of yields on May 14, 2021, it will almost certainly be the CTD at expiration. As rates increase, however, because it becomes more likely that the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 will be CTD, the net basis of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 increases. Put another way, this net. basis increases because the value of the seller's option to switch away from delivering the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 increases. In contrast, the net basis of the high-duration bond, the 1.125s of 02/15/2031, is near zero for high yields, when it will almost certainly be CTD at expiration. As yields fall, however, its becoming CTD is less of a certainty, and its net basis increases..  

The net basis of the 3.125s of 11/15/2028 is never close to zero, because it is never likely to become CTD. While the set of deliverables can, in gen-. eral, lead to ranges of yields in which intermediate-duration bonds are CTD at expiration, for TYU1 as of May 14, 2021, and under the assumption of parallel shifts, the CTD at expiration is heavily likely to be either the lowest-duration bond, the 2.875s of 05/15/2028, or the highest-duration bond, the 1.125s of 02/15/2031. Nevertheless, at a yield level of about. $4\%$ as of the pricing date, the 3.125s of 11/15/2028 are as close as they ever are to being CTD at expiration, and their net basis falls to a minimum of about nine ticks. For lower yields and for higher yields, the 3.125s of 11/15/2028. are even less likely to wind up as the CTD, as their net basis increases accordingly.

FIGURE 11.7 Net Basis of Three Bonds Deliverable into TYU1, as of May 14, 2021. Yields Are Assumed to Move in Parallel with a Volatility of 100 Basis Points per Year.  

The net basis graphs in Figure 11.7, as manifestations of the quality. option, can be described more directly in terms of option terminology.. The net basis of the low-duration bond resembles a call option on. rates, or, equivalently, a put option on bond prices; the net basis of the intermediate-duration bond resembles a straddle on rates and bond prices;. and the net basis of the high-duration bond resembles a put on rates or a call option on bond prices..  

The price-yield curve of TYU1 in Figure 11.6, which incorporates the. seller's quality option, can be used to derive the Dv01 of the futures con-. tract, as defined in Chapter 4: the change in price for a one-basis-point decline in rates. The DV01s of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 and 1.125s of 02/15/2031, divided by their respective conversion factors, along with the DV01 of TYU1, are graphed Figure 11.8. As expected, the DV01 of the. shorter-maturity bond is relatively low and flat, with the flatness indicative of its lower convexity, while the Dv01 of the longer-maturity bond is relatively high and steep, with the steepness indicative of its higher convexity. The futures price-yield relationship, however, differs markedly from that of a. coupon bond. At low yields as of the pricing date, the futures Dv01 resembles the Dv01 divided by conversion factor of the bond most likely to be CTD at expiration, namely the shorter-maturity 2.875s of 05/15/2028. Analogously, at high yields as of the pricing date, the futures DV01 resembles that of the 1.125s of 02/15/2031 divided by its conversion factor. At intermediate yields, the DV01 of the futures contract gradually changes from following. that of the short-maturity bond to following that of the high-maturity bond.. Therefore, its DV01 increases as yields increase, which means that TYU1 is negatively convex over that region of intermediate yields. This negative convexity is also visible, of course, in the shape of the TYU1's price-yield curve. in Figure 11.6.

As of May 14, 2021, the yield of the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 was, in fact,. $1.26\%$ . In this low-rate environment, it is clear from Figures 11.6, 11.7, and. 11.8 that the 2.875s of 05/15/2028 are solidly CTD: the quality option is worth very little; the futures contract - apart from daily settlement considerations - is essentially a forward contract on the 2.875s of 05/15/2028; and the futures price is approximately equal to the forward price of that bond divided by its conversion factor. These conclusions are all evident in Table 11.8, which shows that, as of May 14, 2021, the net basis of the 2.875s of $05/15/2028$ is 1.1 ticks, and, therefore, the futures price of. $131{-}17+$ , or about 131.55, is very close to the ratio of that bond's forward price to its conversion factor, $109.7172/0.8338$ , or 131.59.  

These observations raise the question of why the notional coupon of the contract has not been lowered from $6\%$ . As discussed already, when the yield curve is flat at $6\%$ , conversion factors make all bonds equally deliverable, which, in turn, lowers liquidity dependence on a single CTD and reduces the profitability of a squeeze. That the term structure is not flat, and that bonds sell at idiosyncratically variable yields means that conversion factors are not perfect with respect to these objectives, but setting the notional coupon close to prevailing market levels does significantly reduce differences in deliverability across bonds. Again, then, why has the notional coupon not been set closer to market levels, that is, at somewhere between $1\%$ and $2\%:$ After all, the current notional coupon of. $6\%$ was reduced from its previous level of $8\%$ in response to lower market rates..  

A likely answer has two parts. First, with the increase of volumes and. liquidity of both Treasury bonds and Treasury futures, the risks of a fall in liquidity or a squeeze have diminished. Second, as evident from the discussions in this chapter, valuing the quality option is quite complex. Overall,. market participants - apart from basis arbitrage traders - seem to prefer a. simpler contract, one effectively without delivery options, which is, therefore, easier to price and hedge..  

# 11.12THE TIMING, END-OF-MONTH, AND WILD-CARD OPTIONS  

As mentioned earlier, the timing option allows the seller to deliver at any. time during the delivery month. For TYU1, for example, delivery is allowed at any date between September 1, 2021, and September 30, 2021. To understand whether sellers should deliver late or early, consider a trader who is long the bond and short the futures. Delivering late earns carry on the bond coupon until delivery and preserves full use of the quality option. Deliver-. ing early and investing the proceeds at the repo rate gives up carry on the bond and any remaining value of the quality option. Therefore, so long as carry is positive, it is optimal to delay delivery. Because coupon rates are typically greater than repo rates, carry is typically positive and late delivery typically optimal. If carry is negative, however, which is most likely for shorter-maturity contracts when the short end of the term structure is downward sloping, then the carry advantage of early delivery has to be weighed against the lost option value..  

Before analyzing the end-of-month option, the discussion turns to the. fact that the last trading date of Treasury note and bond futures is seven. business days before the last delivery date. For TYU1, for example, the. last trading date is September 21, 2021, while the last delivery date is. September 30, 2021. This feature of the contract requires an adjustment. to futures hedges just after the last trading date. To see this, consider a basis position on the last trading date. For simplicity, continuing with TYU1, assume that the 2.875 of $05/15/2028$ is almost certain to be CTD, and that, with the delivery date so near, its forward and spot prices are approximately equal. Now consider a. $\$1$ billion long basis position in that. CTD, which is long. $\$1$ billion face amount of the bond and short 8,338  

TYU1 contracts. This position is hedged because the futures price equals the. CTD bond price divided by its conversion factor, 0.8338. If, for example,. the price of the bond falls from 111.62 to 110.62, causing a loss on the. (long) bond side of the trade of. $\$1$ billion $\times(111.62\%-110.62\%)$ , or $\$10$ million, the futures price falls $8,338\times\mathbb{5}100,000\times(111.62\%/0.8338-$ $110.62\%/0.8338)$ , for a gain on the (short) futures side of the trade of an offsetting $\$10$ million. After the last trading date, however, the futures price. is frozen at its last settlement price, say of. $111.62/0.8338$ or 133.8690, and the delivery price of the CTD is frozen at. $133.8690\times0.8338=111.62$ If the CTD now falls in price to 110.62, the value of the long bond position again falls by $\$10$ million, but the short futures position gains nothing. Put another way, because the basis trader is short 8,338 contracts, only 8,338 times $\$100,000$ , or $\$833.8$ million face amount of the CTD can be. sold at the fixed futures settlement price of 111.62. The remaining. $\$166.2$ million long face amount of the CTD suffers a loss from its fall in price of. $\mathbb{S}166,200,000\times(111.62\%-110.62\%)$ , or $\$1.662$ million.  

Given the impact of freezing the futures price as of the last trading date,. the futures hedge has to be changed from a conversion-factor weighted number of contracts to a matching notional amount of contracts. In the example, after the last daily settlement on September 21, 2021, at a futures price of 133.8690, the long basis trader can sell an additional 1,662 TYU1 contracts for a total short of 1,000 contracts. From then on, the position is hedged because the trader can sell all $\$1$ billion face amount of the bonds through. the futures contract at a fixed price of. $133.8690\times0.8338=111.62.$ 10  

Returning now to the end-of-month option, say that, after the last trading date, the futures price is frozen at. $F_{s}$ and that a long basis trader is long bond $i$ and short a matching notional amount of contracts. This trader, plan-. ning to deliver bond $i$ , has locked in a delivery price of $c f^{i}$ times $F_{s}$ . But a profit can be earned by switching to bond. $j_{\cdot}$ , that is, by selling bond $i$ , buying bond $j_{:}$ and delivering bond $j_{:}$ , if there is a bond $j$ such that,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}&{}&{p^{i}-p^{j}+c f^{j}\times F_{s}>c f^{i}\times F_{s}}\ &{}&\ &{}&{p^{i}-c f^{i}\times F_{s}>p^{j}-c f^{j}\times F_{s}}\end{array}
$$  

Equation (11.22), which says that the switch is profitable, is equivalent to Equation (11.23), which says that bond $j$ is cheaper to deliver than bond $i$  

The end-of-month option - switching from bond. $i$ to bond $j$ in the previous paragraph -- is potentially valuable, but it often turns out not to be worth much in practice. First, since the time between the last trading and last delivery dates is relatively short, relative bond prices do not tend to change very much. Second, traders who are long the basis actively monitor opportunities to profit by switching into bonds that are cheaper to deliver. As a result, any time a deliverable bond does cheapen relative to others, many traders. have an incentive to buy that bond to switch and the cheapening comes to. an abrupt halt.  

The last of the delivery options, the wild-card option, arises because futures prices settle every day at $2{\mathrm{p.m}}$ . CT, but notice of delivery is due a few hours later. Consider a long $\$1$ billion CTD basis (i.e., the 2.875s of 05/15/2028) into TYU1 sometime during the delivery month, but before. the last trading date. As discussed before, before the last trading date, the long CTD position of the basis trade is hedged against changes in its price by a short of 8,338 contracts. Now, if on a particular day the price of the. CTD rises significantly between the time the futures price settles and the time notice of delivery is due, that is, if the bond price rises while the futures settlement price from $2\mathrm{pm}$ is still applicable, the trader can profit by selling $\$166.2$ million face amount of the CTD at its now higher price and giv-. ing notice to deliver the remaining $\$833.8$ million face amount through the futures at the now stale settlement price. The profit from this liquidation of the position is the increase in the value of the $\$166.2$ million CTD face amount. Whether exercising the wild-card option is worthwhile depends on how much the price of the CTD increases relative to how much carry is sacrificed by exercising the timing option early.
