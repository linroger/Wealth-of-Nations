# 3.1 REALIZED RETURNS  

The gross horizon return of a bond depends on the price at which the bond.   
was bought; the coupon payments it earns over the horizon; the interest on the reinvestment of those coupon payments over the horizon; and the price.   
of the bond at the end of the horizon. The net horizon return of the bond.   
adjusts its gross return for the cost of financing its purchase..  

Begin with a simple example. An investor buys $\$1$ million face amount of the US 7.625s of 11/15/2022 at 114.8765 in mid-November 2020. Six months later, in mid-May 2021, the price of the bond is 111.3969.1 The gross return of the bond over the horizon is, therefore,  

$$
\frac{\$1,113,969+\S38,125-\S1,148,765}{1,148,765}=0.2898\%
$$  

In words, the six-month holding period return in this example equals the value of the bonds at the end of the six months, or $\$1,113,969$ ; plus the coupon payment at that time of half $7.625\%$ on the $\$1$ million face amount, or $\$38,125$ ; minus the initial cost of the bonds, or $\$1,148,765$ , all divided by that initial cost. Note that the coupon income of the bond is sufficient to overcome the fall in price and result in a positive horizon return.  

Realized return over a horizon that extends past a coupon payment. depends on the rate at which coupon payments have been reinvested. If a bond makes a coupon payment in one month, but the horizon is two months, the horizon return depends on the one-month reinvestment rate, from the coupon payment date to the end of the horizon. For the purposes of illustration, consider the simple case of an investment in the 7.625s of 11/15/2022 over a horizon of one year. If the price of the bond at the end of the year is $\$1,080,000$ , and if the coupon payment of. $\$38,125$ after six months is reinvested for the subsequent six months at a money market rate of, say,  

$0.05\%$ , then the realized return of the investment over the year is,  

$$
\frac{\left.51,080,000+\mathbb{S}38,12\thinspace5\left(1+\frac{0.05\%}{2}\right)+\mathbb{S}38,12\thinspace5-\mathbb{S}1,148,765\right.}{1,148,765}
$$  

The discussion now turns to the return net of the cost of financing the purchase of a bond. This might be an explicit cost; that is, a trader or investor might borrow the purchase price of the bond for six months at an interest rate of $0.05\%$ . In that case, the interest cost of the borrowing over the invest-. ment horizon, $\$1,148,765\times0.05\%/2=\$287$ , would be subtracted from the. numerator of Equation (3.1) to give a return net of financing of,  

$$
{\frac{\S1,113,969+\S38,125-\S1,148,765-\S287}{1,148,765}}=0.2648\%
$$  

Not surprisingly, the net return of $0.2648\%$ is the gross return, $0.2898\%$ minus the half-year borrowing cost of $0.05\%/2$ , or $0.025\%$  

There are actually several subtleties in describing the net return on. a bond investment in this way. First, market participants do fund bond. purchases using the purchased bonds as collateral in the repurchase or repo market, which is the subject of Chapter 10. Second, only a portion of the. purchase price can typically be funded in this market. In the present case,. for example, an investor might be able to borrow only. $\$1,125,790$ , or only $98\%$ , of the total purchase price. In this case, the interest cost would only. be half of $0.05\%$ on that $\$1,125,790$ , or $\$281$ , and the net return would be. $0.2653\%$ , which is very slightly higher than the result from Equation (3.3).. Third, regardless of how much is actually borrowed, the net return is. calculated with the total purchase price as the denominator of (3.3). This formulation of net return, therefore, can be thought of as a return on balance sheet, that is, on the value that can be considered and reported as an asset. Fourth, return on capital would be computed differently. If a hedge fund borrows $98\%$ of the value of the bond in the repo market, while putting up $2\%$ , or $\$23,975$ of its own capital, then this investment's return on capital - abstracting from any additional allocations of risk capital to the trade - would be,.  

$$
{\frac{\S1,113,969+\S38,125-\S1,148,765-\S281}{\S22,975}}=13.27\%
$$  

The $13.27\%$ return on capital is 50 times the net balance sheet return of $0.2653\%$ . This high return on capital is due to the fact that the trade, as described, has a leverage of 50, that is, an asset value of $\$1,148,765$ pur chased with capital of only. $\$23,975$  

The fifth and final subtlety with respect to net returns is that financing costs should most likely be considered even without any explicit repo borrowing. Any money used to purchase a bond had to have been raised at some cost (e.g., a bank paying money to attract deposits; a life insurance company compensating investors for the savings portions of their policies; a hedge fund offering a return on its assets under management). Furthermore, any money invested in a particular bond has an opportunity cost in the sense that this money might have been used to fund a different investment.
