# 0.1 GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MARKETS  

Fixed income markets are large and global. Figure O.1 shows the outstand-. ing amounts of debt securities, by residence of issuer. Debt securities are. instruments designed to be traded, like bonds issued by corporations or by governments. Grouping by residence of issuer means, for example, that US. Treasury bonds held by China's central bank are included in the total for the United States. As of March 2021, the global total of outstanding debt. securities was about $\$123$ trillion. For reference, the total capitalization of. global equity markets at the time was $\$110$ trillion, although stock market. values are significantly more volatile.  

Figure O.1 shows that the five largest issuers, in terms of amounts out-. standing, are in the United States, the Eurozone, China, Japan, and the. United Kingdom, which together comprise nearly. $90\%$ of the total. The Eurozone includes countries that both belong to the European Union (EU) and use the euro as a national currency. Some individual members of the Eurozone, indicated with asterisks in the figure, are significant issuers of. debt securities on their own. Note that the figure displays their amounts. outstanding with gray bars, but their contributions to the cumulative total are included once, with the Eurozone total..  

Figure O.2 decomposes debt outstanding in the five largest regions by sector. The large fraction of government debt in Japan reflects decades of government borrowing and spending intended to stimulate the economy.. The fraction of government debt in the United States, the Eurozone, and the United Kingdom is lower, at about. $50\%$ , but has increased significantly since the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Corporations in the United States are relatively more likely to issue bonds directly to the public, while corporations in the Eurozone, Japan, and the United Kingdom are relatively more likely to borrow funds from intermediaries, like banks, which, in turn, raise money from the public. While Figure O.2 includes the breakdown for debt in China, the relatively large role of the government in financial and nonfinancial enterprises makes comparisons across sectors and regions less meaningful.

Table O.1 and Figure O.3 show the notional amounts of outstanding interest rate derivatives across the globe. These derivatives are described in later chapters, but derivatives essentially allow market participants to take positions on interest rates, whether for hedging, investment, or speculative purposes. The notional amount of a derivative is used to calculate the cash flows that one of the derivative's counterparties pays the other. Adding together all notional amounts, however, can significantly overstate market size. First, the largest market participants, namely dealers, tend to be simultaneously long and short nearly identical derivatives. Second, options are actually equivalent to only fractions of the notional amounts of their underlying securities. Later chapters elaborate on these points, but, for the purposes of this overview, this table and figure are reported in notional amounts.  

While derivatives may trade in a particular locality, there is no sense in which derivatives are issued in one place or another: local regulations aside, any entity, residing anywhere, can enter into these derivatives contracts. A typical classification, therefore, is the currency in which the cash flows of the derivative are denominated. The first two columns of Table O.1 show notional amounts for swaps, options, and forward rate agreements. Most of the outstanding amounts are denominated in US Dollars (USD) and Euro (EUR). The quantities in the table hint at the overstatement of market size by notional amount: if the sizes of the markets for these UsD derivatives were really $\$150$ trillion, they would be larger than the combined size of all global debt securities markets. The second two columns of the table show the notional amounts of standardized, exchange-traded interest rate futures and options. Amounts outstanding of UsD-denominated contracts are by far the greatest, with those denominated in British Pounds (GBP) and EUR making up most of the rest of the overall market.

Finally, Figure O.3 gives the notional amount of credit default swaps (CDS) outstanding. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 14, but, roughly speaking, CDS allow investors to take positions that are equivalent to lever-. aged long or short positions in bonds with credit risk. The figure divides the market into credit sectors: CDS can be written on nonfinancial com-. panies, financial companies, sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABS), and mortgage-backed securities (MBs). Within each sector, a single-name CDS references a single credit (e.g., the government of Spain), while an index. CDS references a portfolio of credits (e.g., 25 European financial companies). Note that the CDS market is much smaller in notional amount than the derivatives markets depicted in Table O.1.
