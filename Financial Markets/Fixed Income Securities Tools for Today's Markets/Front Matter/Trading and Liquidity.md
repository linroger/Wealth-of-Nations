# 0.6 TRADING AND LIQUIDITY  

An important feature of any market is liquidity, loosely defined as the extent to which a market participant can trade a desired volume of securities at close to a prevailing market price. This section begins with some definitions of liquidity and some summary statistics across fixed income markets. Several trends impacting liquidity are discussed next, including electronification; dealer regulation and risk taking; the growth of principal trading firms $(P T F s)$ ; the growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs); and the growing con-. centration of asset managers. The section concludes with the implications of these trends with respect to liquidity and recent concerns about systemic. fragility.  

Because liquidity is hard to define precisely, there are many ways to measure it. The following are among the most common metrics:  

Bid-ask spread gives the difference between the higher ask price, at. which a small amount of a security can be immediately purchased, and the lower bid price, at which a small amount of a security can be immediately sold. A market maker might expect to earn the bid-ask spread,  

on average, by buying securities from customers at the bid and selling.   
to other customers at the ask. Equivalently, defining the mid price as the average of the bid and ask prices, and assuming the mid represents the.   
fair market price, a customer can conceive of the cost of trading as half.   
the bid-ask spread: buying at the ask instead of the mid and selling at.   
the bid instead of the mid..  

Volume and turnover measure the amount of a security that trades over some time interval, as an absolute amount or as a percentage of the total outstanding amount of that security, respectively. A particular volume measure is average daily volume $(A D V)$ , which averages realized daily volumes over some observation period. Volume and turnover both give insight into the size of a trade being contemplated. For example, it should not be too difficult to sell $\$1$ million face amount of a bond when its ADV is $\$500$ million. On the other hand, it will likely be quite challenging to sell $10\%$ of an outstanding bond issue when its daily turnover is $2\%$  

Market depth is a measurement of liquidity used in connection with a. central limit order book (CLOB). Through a CLOB, traders submit limit orders to buy a certain volume of a bond at a particular price (or less), or to sell a certain volume of a bond at a particular price (or more). Market depth is then defined in terms of the sum of the volumes of limit orders placed at prices from the mid to some level above or below the mid. For example, if the mid price is 100 and there are limit orders to buy. $\$10$ million face amount of bonds at prices of 99 or less, then a seller could immediately sell $\$10$ million at 99. Unlike the bid-ask spread, therefore, market depth measures liquidity for orders of different sizes.  

Price impact or implementation shortfall. A buyer of a significant volume of a particular security can expect the market price to increase in the course of executing the purchases, as a seller of a significant volume can expect the market price to fall. Price impact measures the extent to which the market price can be expected to change as a result of a large transaction, and implementation shortfall measures the difference between the realized purchase or sale price on a large transaction relative to the market price before the transaction. Both price impact and implementation shortfall are typically estimated using data from past transactions. Asset managers and traders use the resulting models to estimate the transaction costs of their proposed trades. Dealers also use these models to quote prices at which they are willing to guarantee execution of large client orders.  

The liquidity of fixed income securities varies dramatically across asset classes, across subclasses of those broader classes, and across individual securities within those subclasses. Using ADV, Table O.5 illustrates the variation of liquidity across broad asset classes. The ADVs in the table range from over $\$650$ billion for Treasuries and over $\$250$ billion for agency MBS to about $\$9$ billion for munis and even less for agency securities, asset-backed securities, and non-agency MBs. Variation of liquidity within these asset classes depends on the individual markets. In the Treasury market, for example, the most recently issued bonds in each maturity range. are by far the most liquid (see, for example, Figure 11.1). In the corporate bond market, liquidity varies with age, credit quality, and issue size. Like Treasuries, the most recently issued corporates are the most liquid: one study reported that the monthly turnover of corporate bond issues declined from about $45\%$ in the first month after issuance to about $13.5\%$ in the second month and continues to decline thereafter. With respect to credit quality, investment-grade bonds are more liquid than less creditworthy high-yield bonds. In fact, $51.1\%$ of the ADV of corporates in Table O.5 is due to trading in investment-grade bonds and only. $17.5\%$ to high-yield bonds. (The remaining ADV is from private placements, $25.8\%$ , and convertibles, $5.6\%$ .) Finally, with respect to issue size, one study showed that larger issues traded on a greater number of days in a year than smaller issues. To cite a few statistics, investment-grade bonds from issues greater than $\$1$ billion trade, on average, on about 170 days a year. By contrast, investment-grade bonds from issues less than $\$250$ million trade, on average, on fewer than. 20 days in a year. Note, by the way, that describing liquidity in terms of the number of days on which a particular bond trades at all indicates the illiquidity of corporate bonds, at least relative to Treasuries. As a final example, the liquidity of muni issues also declines rapidly with age. Over the whole of 2019, the volume of munis that traded within a month of their issuance was about. $\$585$ billion. But the volume of munis that traded between one and three months of their issuance was only $\$138$ billion, and between three and six months only $\$77$ billion, etc. Furthermore, the total 2019 trading volume of all munis that had been issued 10 or more years previously was only about \$91 billion.35

The text now turns to a discussion of trends affecting liquidity in fixed income markets.  

# Electronification  

Equity and futures markets, which comprise relatively few distinct securities, migrated to electronic trading much more quickly than did bond markets, which comprise a vastly greater number of distinct issues. Traditionally, bonds were traded by voice. Customers traded with dealers, and dealers traded with each other, either directly or anonymously through interdealer brokers (IDBs). While a lot of bond trading is still by voice, electronic trading has been growing steadily. Dealer-to-customer (D2C) trades can take place on single-dealer or multi-dealer platforms, mostly through request-for-quotes (RFQ). In this process, a customer requests dealers to provide price quotes to trade a particular size of a particular security or portfolio of securities. The customer then chooses with which dealer to trade.36 A customer can also receive direct streams from dealers, through which dealers continuously send bid and offer prices for particular securities. The customer can then decide if and when to trade at the streamed prices. Dealer-to-dealer (D2D) trades can take place on interdealer electronic platforms, usually through a CLOB. Through a CLOB, traders submit limit orders to buy or sell a security, as described earlier, or they buy or sell that security immediately by lifting the offers or hitting the bids of other dealers who have submitted limit orders. PTFs have become more important in recent years and are discussed presently. PTFs often participate directly on interdealer platforms and also set up direct streams from individual dealers.  

In the Treasury market, from February 2019 to May 2020, $65\%$ of all trades were electronic. This percentage breaks up into $33\%$ D2D trades, which nearly all trade electronically, and $67\%$ DTC trades, of which. $48\%$ trade electronically. The electronic trades over this time period were $54\%$ through CLOBs, $33\%$ through RFQ, and. $13\%$ through streaming.  

In the corporate bond market, electronic trading of investment-grade bonds increased from $10\%$ in 2011, to $19\%$ in 2017, and $31\%$ in 2020, and reached $38\%$ in December 2020. Lower but growing percentages of. high-yield bonds trade electronically, from $11\%$ in 2017, to $21\%$ in 2020, and to more than. $25\%$ in December 2020. Electronic trading of corporates is further ahead in Europe, growing from. $39\%$ of the market in 2017 to $47\%$ in 2020.37  

# Dealer Regulation and Risk Taking  

Dealers traditionally take risk in order to make markets. Customers can buy securities in significant size from dealers, because dealers are willing to bear the risks of buying and holding significant inventories in those securities. Customers can sell securities in significant size to dealers, because dealers are willing to bear the risks of holding and subsequently selling those securities. There are really two distinct risks here: market risk and execution risk. With respect to market risk, a dealer holding an inventory of corporate bonds can pretty easily hedge the risk of general interest rate changes, and even the risk of general changes to credit spreads, but hedging the unique credit risk of individual bonds can be difficult and expensive. With respect to execution risk, a dealer must typically "work out" of a large position. For example, after buying a large block of securities from a customer, the dealer cannot usually sell that whole block at once: the loss from the resulting price impact would likely wipe out any spread or fee that the dealer had charged the customer. Therefore, the dealer usually sells the larger position gradually, in smaller pieces, running the risk that other market participants happen to jump in to sell the same security at the same time, and also extending any idiosyncratic market risks of the position..  

Dealers in banking entities were subjected to more stringent regulation. after the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In particular, capital requirements. were increased, both adjusted for risk and as a raw percentage of assets; liquidity requirements were formally added; and trading purely for the account of the bank, rather than for facilitating customer transactions, was - with the. exception of Treasury bond trading - severely restricted by the Volcker rule.  

Because of this new regulatory regime, and perhaps also because of their own choices to reduce risk, banking entities are less willing to hold securities inventory and less willing to bear the risks of making markets. Figures O.17 and O.18 illustrate this point in the US Treasury and corporate bond markets, respectively.  

Figure O.17 shows that the amount of 10-year Treasury notes sold at auction has been increasing steadily, and particularly rapidly in recent years, while, at the same time, dealers - who are mostly within banking. entities -- have been purchasing lower and lower percentages of those sales. Both the issue sizes and allotments to dealers, given in the figures by the very light gray lines, vary significantly from month to month, mostly because of the auction cycle of new and reopening sales described previously.. To show the trend more clearly, therefore, the solid lines are centered seven-month averages of the underlying series. In any case, in the last few month of the observation window, the allotment to dealers is well under $15\%$ . Figure O.18 shows that primary dealers are holding much smaller net. positions in corporate bonds than before the crisis, while the total amount of corporate bonds outstanding has increased dramatically.38

# Growth of PTFs  

In the Treasury market, the reduction of dealer market making has been made up, at least in part, by PTFs. These firms typically trade to make money on their accounts and try to make relatively small amounts of money. on each of very many trades. They are often high-frequency trading firms (HFTs) as well, but do not have to be. In any case, the PTF business model or trading style relies heavily on electronification, and the advance of electronification is in good part due to demand from PTFs. Market participants were shocked in 2015 by an inadvertent leak of the top 10 firms by trading volume on the largest platform for the electronic trading of Treasuries: only two were banks. Figure O.19 uses more recent data to show how PTFs have grown in prominence in the Treasury market. Over the sample period, PTFs and dealers each comprised $48\%$ of trading in the interdealer broker. market (with buy-side firms, like asset managers, comprising the remainder).. Furthermore, true to their usual nature, about. $93\%$ of PTF trades were electronic, compared with $58\%$ of dealer trades. Note, by contrast, that only $18\%$ of buy-side trades were electronic..  

# Growth of ETFs  

Shares of an ETF represent fractional holdings of the fund's underlying portfolio and trade on an exchange. Authorized Participants $(A P s)$ of an ETF can create ETF shares by buying underlying assets, adding them to the fund's. portfolio, and selling ETF shares against those additional assets. APs can also reduce the number of outstanding ETF shares by taking assets from the underlying portfolio, selling them, and purchasing existing ETF shares corresponding to the sold assets. An ETF has a NAV, usually expressed as a value per share, which is an estimate of the value of the underlying port-. folio. However, investors buy or sell shares of an ETF on an exchange at a. market-determined price, which may be greater than, equal to, or less than the NAV. Unlike APs, investors cannot exchange their shares for securities in the underlying portfolio, nor can they deliver securities in exchange for new ETF shares.

ETFs in general, including fixed income ETFs, have experienced phe-. nomenal growth. The first fixed income ETF was listed in 2002, and, by. the end of 2020, assets under management in global bond ETFs exceeded $\$1.5$ trillion.39 An important motivation for bond ETFs is the creation of. liquid trading vehicles from relatively illiquid assets. As discussed earlier, in part because there are so many distinct corporate bond issues, individual corporate bonds are relatively illiquid, particularly as they age. By contrast, a small number of large and diversified portfolios, traded on exchanges and traded electronically in the form of ETFs, can be very liquid. Furthermore,. growing liquidity and electronic trading in ETFs drive more electronic trading of corporate bonds, which further improves ETF liquidity, and so forth. In fact, a market has developed for trading portfolios comprising bonds that are all or mostly all held by ETFs.40 In any case, Figure O.20 illustrates the liquidity advantages of ETFs. For each asset class shown, ETF assets under management (AUM) are a small fraction of total amounts outstanding. At the same time, however, ETF ADV is a large fraction of total ADV. For example, ETFs hold only. $4.8\%$ of high-yield corporate bonds outstanding,. but the ADVs of these ETFs comprise $24.3\%$ of the ADV of all such bonds.. In other words, high-yield corporate bond ETFs are significantly more liquid than high-yield corporate bonds..  

Skeptics have argued that day-to-day ETF liquidity lulls investors into.   
a false sense of security, in the sense that, under stressed market condi-.   
tions, ETF liquidity will revert to the liquidity of the underlying bonds and.   
essentially disappear. This theory was tested in March 2020, when markets roiled from the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns. Under-.   
lying bond market liquidity did evaporate, with even primary issues of both.

investment-grade and high-yield bonds coming to a halt. Over the same time, however, ETF trading volumes increased dramatically. In other words, investors could not trade individual bonds, but could trade ETFs. The pricing. of ETFs over the period, however, surprised some observers. As bond prices plummeted, ETFs traded at significant discounts from NAV; that is, the prices of the ETFs were very much below the estimated value of their underlying. portfolios. Similarly, when bond prices rapidly recovered, ETFs traded at significant premiums to NAV, that is, at prices well above estimated portfolio values. Critics took this pricing behavior as evidence that ETFs were not working well, in the sense that investors could not trade shares at their true values. But by the definition of illiquidity during stress events, "true values" of individual bonds cannot be accurately determined at those times. It is most likely, therefore, that observed discounts from NAV resulted from stale bond prices: as prices swiftly fell with nearly no liquidity, bond prices recorded for the purposes of estimating NAV were stale, higher prices. Similarly, as prices rebounded quickly with little liquidity, NAV was estimated with stale, lower prices, making it seem that ETFs traded at a premium. Supporting this nar-. rative was the fact that when prices were falling and ETFs were selling at a discount to NAV, investors were nevertheless giving bonds to APs to create new ETFs. Despite the apparent loss in value, investors could sell their bonds most efficiently by first exchanging them into ETFs.41.  

# Growing Concentration of Asset Managers  

Concentration in the asset management industry has been growing for some time. Assets under management at the top 20 global managers were $29\%$ of total assets in 1995, $38\%$ in 2000, and $43\%$ in 2020. Furthermore, in 2020, the top 10 global managers managed $31\%$ of total assets, and the top five,. $21\%$ . With respect to flows, a 2018 study found that $42\%$ of asset management trading in investment-grade corporate bonds came from the top five managers.42 Increasing concentration in asset management implies a growing demand in the market for larger trades or, equivalently, a growing amount of execution risk from having to break up large orders into smaller transactions.  

# Summary of Trends  

The trends just presented can be combined into the following narrative. Dealers are allocating less risk to market making, while asset managers need to execute larger and larger trades. Therefore, dealers focus on their largest and best clients, pushing others to electronic platforms. The growth of PTFs makes up for some of the liquidity withdrawn by dealers, but by providing frequent liquidity on small trades rather than by assuming the execution risk of larger orders. The net results of these intersecting trends, therefore, are as follows:  

Liquidity has become plentiful for small trades in relatively liquid, electronic markets.   
Liquidity can still be challenging for larger trades, even in relatively liquid markets, and, of course, for trades in less liquid markets.   
More customers must bear the execution risk of their own trades, instead of paying dealers to assume this risk.  

# Liquidity and Fragility  

The changing nature of liquidity in bond markets has raised the issue of. market resilience or, its reverse, market fragility. In particular, some believe that liquidity provision by PTFs is less stable than by dealers. The argument. is that PTFs will shut down in stress conditions, so as to avoid any losses on their own accounts, while dealers will continue to make markets for their clients, with whom they have ongoing and valuable business relationships.. The "flash rally" in the Treasury market on October 15, 2014, provided a. case study in which to examine this argument..  

On that day, there was a release of retail sales data at $8{:}30{\mathrm{am}}$ , but it is generally agreed that the news was not particularly surprising. Nevertheless, Treasury yields dropped relatively steeply over the next hour or so. Then, over the 12 minutes from. $9{:}33{\mathrm{am}}$ to $9{:}45{\mathrm{am}}$ , the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell by 16 basis points and then rose by 16 basis points (i.e., prices rose by a lot and then fell by a lot). This was an extremely large move for such a short time period - the daily standard deviation of the 10-year yield was perhaps four or five basis points per day. Was any particular group of market participants to blame for this flash rally? Does the event forewarn of worse occurrences to come?  

Subsequent analysis showed that over the 12 minutes in question, trading volume increased dramatically and market depth dropped precipitously. In other words, trading continued throughout the interval, and in large quantities, but through very many small orders and a consistent replenishment of limit orders. Market depth provided by both PTFs and dealers fell during the window. While market depth supplied by PTFs fell by a much larger percentage, PTFs supplied much more of the total throughout. Furthermore, PTFs did not change their bid-ask spreads by much, while dealers did at times. A joint study of regulators concluded that: "In very broad terms...PTFs, as a group, reacted...primarily by reducing limit order quantities, while the bank-dealers reacted by widening bid-ask spreads and, for brief periods of time, removing their offers to sell securities.43 Evidence from the flash rally, therefore, is consistent with the different nature of liquidity provision by PTFs and dealers; is not consistent with PTFs closing shop during a stress event; and is consistent with a liquidity regime that is shifting execution risk to the buy side.  

There was a similar flash event on February 25, 2021, though this time Treasury prices fell significantly and then recovered in a short amount of time. The event was again characterized by sharply reduced market depth and sharply elevated trading volumes, that is, by rapid replenishment of limit orders.44 The extent to which markets are susceptible to similar and perhaps worse occurrences remains a topic of concern.  

# Prices, Discount Factors, and Arbitrage.  

coupon bonds. It shows that prices of these bonds can be used to extract. discount factors, which are the market prices of one unit of currency to be received on various dates in the future..  

Relying on a principle known as the law of one price, discount factors extracted from a particular group of bonds can be used to price bonds that are not part of that original group. Furthermore, a particularly persuasive relative pricing methodology, known as arbitrage pricing, turns out to be mathematically identical to pricing with discount factors. Hence, discounting can rightly be used and regarded as shorthand for arbitrage pricing.  

Market prices on a single, fixed date are used to illustrate that the law. of one price and arbitrage pricing describe the US Treasury market relatively. well, but not perfectly. Bonds are not commodities: their prices reflect sup-. ply and demand characteristics that are not fully captured by their scheduled cash flows. The US Treasury's Separate Trading of Registered Interest and. Principal of Securities (STRIPS) are introduced next, both as a topic of independent interest and as an additional illustration of the complex realities of pricing in bond markets..  

The chapter concludes with accrued interest and day-count conventions,. which are used throughout fixed income markets and throughout this book.  

For clarity of exposition, prices and examples in this chapter are all as. of the close of business on Friday, May 14, 2021. Also, because transactions. in the US Treasury market typically settle. $^{\mathfrak{\ w}}\mathrm{T}+1$ ," that is, bonds and cash are exchanged one business day after the trade date, all trades in the examples settle on Monday, May 17, 2021.
