# 0.3 US MARKET PARTICIPANTS  

This section describes sectors of market participants. The volumes of debt. securities and loans that appear as assets on the financial balance sheets of various sectors are shown in Figure O.6, while the volumes that appear. as liabilities are shown in Figure O.7. Households, nonfinancial business,. and general government (i.e., federal and municipal) hold a combined $\$10.0$ trillion of debt securities and loans for their own savings or cash. management purposes. Banks, various fund vehicles, insurance companies, pension funds, and other financial entities hold debt securities and loans as intermediaries, investing and managing funds for the ultimate benefit of others. The Monetary Authority, that is, the Federal Reserve, holds assets in the implementation of monetary policy. And the rest of the world, or foreign entities, invest $\$14.0$ trillion in US debt securities and loans on their own or as intermediaries. On the liability side, the federal government borrows $\$24.3$ trillion, and municipalities borrow $\$3.2$ trillion to finance. government expenses that are not covered by taxes and fees. Households borrow $\$17.3$ trillion mostly to finance consumption, and nonfinancial businesses borrow $\$18.0$ trillion to finance investments and acquisitions. The remaining financial sectors borrow as intermediaries, using funds borrowed from some sectors to lend or invest elsewhere. And finally, the rest of the world borrows $\$4.9$ trillion through US debt securities and loans. The text now discusses several of these sectors in greater detail.

# Households  

Table O.3 gives the financial assets and liabilities of the household sector.9 The financial assets of the sector far exceed its financial liabilities, meaning that the sector, as a whole, has significant net worth. The sector invests significant amounts directly in equity and debt markets, although a greater fraction of assets is invested through intermediaries, like pensions,. mutual funds, and the savings components of life insurance policies.. A large fraction of financial assets is also held in near cash equivalents, that is, in deposits and shares of money market funds. On the liability side, households borrow mostly through mortgages, which are the subject of Chapter 15, or through consumer credit..

The primary components of consumer credit are home equity loans, auto. loans, credit card loans, and student loans. The outstanding credit balances of these sectors over time are depicted in Figure O.8. Home equity loan balances grew rapidly with the run-up of housing prices preceding the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and have declined steadily since.10 Credit card loans. also grew going into the crisis, though not as dramatically, and also declined. after the crisis, but had then recovered, until declining again with the COVID. pandemic and shutdowns. Auto loans, while also declining through the crisis, seemingly emerged as taking the place of declining home equity loans and relatively flat credit card loans. Student loans have increased independently of the economic cycle, which is a policy result: the federal government has been guaranteeing student loans for decades and, since 2010, directly owns all of its student loans. As of March 2021, government student loan balances comprised over 92% of the total.11

Figure O.9 reports balances that are 90 or more days delinquent, that is,. balances on which the borrower has not made payments for 90 or more days. Not surprisingly, home equity delinquencies increased during and for several years after the financial crisis, as falling housing prices made it impossible for many homeowners to recover their outstanding mortgage and loan balances by selling their homes. Home equity delinquencies have since steadily declined, perhaps reflecting more careful underwriting in the aftermath of the crisis. Credit card delinquencies also increased after the crisis, perhaps reflecting weakened consumer balance sheets, but have since declined to pre-crisis levels. Auto loan delinquencies increased after the crisis as well, then fell, and increased again, perhaps an expected consequence of the rapid growth in balances. Student loan delinquencies have been increasing for. many years, which has raised a number of policy concerns, from the perspective of both students and the federal government. Note that the precipitous decline in student loan delinquencies in the second half of 2020 is an artifact of federal COvID forbearance programs.

# Nonfinancial Business  

Figure O.10 shows the composition of liabilities for nonfinancial businesses, separated into corporate businesses, which are likely to be relatively large, and noncorporate businesses, which are likely to be relatively small. Corporate businesses, which are more likely to have track records of earnings and established creditworthiness, have broader access to markets. They can. sell debt securities to raise. $30\%$ of their financial liabilities, while noncor-. porate businesses sell essentially none. The "Other" source for corporate businesses includes direct investment from abroad, which is not at all a part of small business liabilities. Noncorporate businesses, then, rely mostly on mortgages, for which they need only unencumbered property. The differences in the liability structures of these two groups reflect the life cycle of. business borrowings, from "family and friends," to bank loans, to investor groups, to private placements of debt, and finally  for the largest and most established companies - to public debt securities. Chapter 14 discusses private placements and public debt issues in more detail..  

# Commercial Banks  

Commercial banks accept deposits from their customers, pay them inter-. est, and offer them safety -- in part through federal deposit insurance - and. immediacy or liquidity, that is, the ability to withdraw funds whenever necessary. Deposits, which are not classified as debt securities or as loans, are not

included in Figure O.7, but constituted. $93\%$ of commercial bank liabilities..   
Other liabilities include investments by the bank's parent company, long-term.   
debt, commercial paper, assorted loans, and repurchase agreements, or repo,.   
which are loans collateralized by debt securities, as discussed in Chapter 10.  

While deposits are certainly the main source of funding for bank invest-. ments, they are actually a product or output of banking, just like business loans and mortgages are bank products. Depositors value the safety and immediacy of deposits, and they incorporate deposits into their manage-. ment of cash and liquidity. Furthermore, banks actively manage the liquidity they offer to depositors, in part by having some fraction of liabilities in longer-term debt, and in part by investing some fraction of assets in liquid products that can be sold quickly and easily to meet any unexpected withdrawals of deposits.  

Turning to assets, Figure O.11 shows the asset composition of large and small commercial banks. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans are all considered the main business of banking.. In addition to these assets, however, along the lines of the previous paragraph, banks hold liquid assets. The most liquid, of course, are cash, reserves. or deposits at the Federal Reserve, and other money market (MM) instru-. ments. But these assets have the disadvantage of earning very low rates of. return. Therefore, to earn higher rates of return while maintaining satisfactory liquidity profiles, banks also hold Treasuries, agency securities, and MBS, which can be sold relatively easily should the need arise..

FIGURE 0.11 Assets of Commercial Banks, Largest 25 Banks and All Other Banks,e as of June 2021. Source: Assets and Liabilities of Commercial Banks in the United States, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System..  

Figure O.11 also reveals some differences between large and small banks. First, commercial bank assets are highly concentrated. There are over 4,000 commercial banks in the United States, but $\$12.5$ trillion of the sector's $\$19$ trillion of assets, or $66\%$ , are held by the largest 25 banks.12 As an aside, the number of banks in the country has been declining gradually but swiftly: there were over 14,000 banks in 1984. This decline is likely an adjustment from historical restrictions on interstate banking and branching that prevented larger banks from satisfying market demand. In any case, a second difference between the largest and smaller banks is the difference in the fractions of their assets in real estate loans: $17.4\%$ for the largest banks and $36.7\%$ for the smaller banks. The concentration of a small bank's assets in real estate loans, which are often local, can challenge the bank's viability through regional economic downturns.  

# Life Insurance Companies  

Life insurance products often pay death benefits, of course, but they are also. often savings vehicles, through which policy holders invest funds with the. advantages of tax deferral. Life insurance companies are, therefore, financial intermediaries that collect and invest premiums so as to meet their obligations under policies sold and to earn additional returns for their shareholders. Furthermore, long-term fixed income assets are natural hedges to the. long-term nature of their policy liabilities. Reflecting these considerations, the asset portfolios of life insurance companies contain large fractions of. corporate bonds and equities, $36.4\%$ and $8.5\%$ , respectively, with an additional $18.8\%$ in mutual fund shares that are some mix of bonds and equities. In fact, their corporate bond investments make life insurers very significant players in that market: their direct holdings of $\$3.5$ trillion of corporate bonds comprise about $24\%$ of the total $\$14.7$ trillion outstanding. While Treasuries are theoretically useful as a match for long-term liabilities, they do not earn enough to meet insurer return hurdles. As a result, Treasuries comprise only $2.4\%$ of life insurance company assets. Finally, life insurance companies also use derivatives to achieve their return and hedging objectives..  

# Pension Funds  

Historically, the majority of pensions were defined benefit (DB) plans, in which the sponsor promises to pay retirees according to a formula that. depends on the number of years worked, contributions to the plan, salary.  

history, etc. Sponsors collect employee and their own contributions into a pension fund, and then invest the assets of that fund so as to be able to honor promised obligations. A low-risk strategy combines relatively high contributions to the pension fund with low-risk investments, while a high-risk strategy combines relatively low contributions with aggressive investments. In any case, investment risk in DB plans resides with the sponsor, which, in the end, is responsible for paying the promised benefits. For decades now, however, defined contribution (DC) plans have become more important. In these plans, employees and employers contribute to individual employee accounts, and each employee can typically choose among a few investment options. Upon retirement, employee benefits are determined completely by the funds accumulated in their respective accounts. Hence, in DC plans, investment risk resides with employees. Employers can, of course, offer both types of plans or a hybrid of the two types..  

Government employees, at the federal, state, and local levels, nearly always have DB plans or an option to participate in a DB plan. In the private sector, however, the trend has been for corporations and other employers to avoid the risks and costs of managing pension funds, that is, to migrate. from DB to DC plans. In 1975, there were about 33.0 million participants in private DB plans and 11.5 million in private DC plans. In 2019, the numbers were 32.8 million and 109.1 million, respectively.13 Furthermore,. corporations are actively shedding DB pension fund risk through pension risk transfer transactions, in which they pay insurance companies to assume. their pension liabilities. In any case, for any portfolio manager of a DB plan, long-term debt instruments naturally hedge the present value of fixed liabilities. On the other hand, allocations to equities hold out the prospect of. having to make smaller contributions to the fund. A study of the largest. $100\mathrm{DB}$ plans offered by US public companies in 2020 found that $50\%$ of assets were invested in fixed income, $32\%$ in equity, and $18\%$ in other categories (e.g., real estate, private equity, hedge funds).14  

# Money Market Funds  

As mentioned earlier, in the context of deposits, there exists significant demand for assets that provide both safety and immediacy. Money market funds, created in the 1970s, were designed to offer safety and immediacy,. while paying higher rates than banks at the time were allowed to pay on. deposits. Money market funds are divided into three broad categories:.  

government funds, which purchase only short-term, government-backed. debt; prime funds, which invest predominantly in short-term, high-quality corporate debt, like commercial paper; and tax-exempt funds, which invest. in short-term, high-quality, tax-exempt municipal debt. Before changes implemented after the financial crisis of 2007-2009, investors could buy money market fund shares for. $\$1$ per share; their money was invested in relatively safe and liquid assets; and, except in extraordinary circumstances, they could sell their shares at any time for $\$1$ per share. More specifically,. a fund that i) complied with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules governing the safety and liquidity of fund investments, known as 2a-7. rules; and ii) had a portfolio or net asset value (NAV) corresponding to a. value per share of between 99.5 cents and. $\$1.005$ , could offer and redeem. shares at a "fixed NAV" or "stable NAV" of $\$1$ per share. But if the value. of the fund fell such that the value per share fell below 99.5 cents, the fund would "break the buck" and shares would no longer be redeemed at $\$1$ , but rather at a value corresponding to the fund's NAV. Hence, money. market fund shares were very similar to bank deposits, but did not have the. benefit of an explicit government guarantee, like federal deposit insurance. Instead, money market shareholders had to rely on their fund sponsors. or management companies to make up for any NAV shortfalls. Only one money market fund had ever broken the buck, in 1994, but it was to happen a second time during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.  

In September 2008, a few days after the failure of the mortgage. government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC, and a few days before the failures of the investment bank, Lehman Brothers, and the insurer, AIG, money market fund investors embarked on a flight-to-safety, through which they withdrew huge volumes of cash from prime funds and deposited huge volumes into government funds. Relatively suddenly, investors came to believe that financial entities might not be able to pay. off their maturing commercial paper, which comprised a significant part of prime money market fund portfolios. And, in fact, the day after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the Reserve Primary Fund became the second fund in history to break the buck: the value of its sizable holdings of Lehman Brothers commercial paper had fallen so precipitously that the. fund's NAV fell to 97 cents per share.15 Fearing that investor flight from prime money market funds would exacerbate already stressed conditions in money markets, including the ability of financial entities to continue borrowing in CP markets, the Treasury instituted a program through which it guaranteed money market fund shares for one year, and the Federal Reserve created a facility that extended nonrecourse loans to banks collateralized by asset-backed commercial paper bought from money market funds.  

After the crisis, the SEC changed several rules governing money market funds.16 First, 2a-7 rules were tightened to increase the safety and improve the liquidity profiles of money market fund portfolios. Second, institutional prime and tax-exempt money market funds, as opposed to funds with. only retail investors, must allow share price to float with the fund's NAV. Proponents of this change argue that floating NAVs raise awareness that fund values can fluctuate and may discourage withdrawals timed to precede a fund's breaking the buck. Opponents argue that money market fund investors, particularly institutional investors, are well aware of the risks;. that floating NAVs have little to no bearing on flights-to-safety away from prime funds; and that floating NAVs significantly increase the accounting, operational, tax, and legal complexities of using money market funds for cash management. The third post-crisis change was that prime and tax-exempt money market funds had to have the power, under various stress conditions, to impose redemption fees of up to. $2\%$ and gates that prevent withdrawals for up to 10 business days in any 90-day period. Redemption fees, which are paid into the fund, are intended both to discourage investor withdrawals in a crisis and to recover losses from liquidating assets in a crisis to meet those withdrawals. Gates are intended to give funds a grace period in which to manage through stressed market conditions. If, however, a fund cannot restore stability by the end of its grace period, the fund is liquidated. Government funds, by the way, may choose to include the power to impose fees and gates, but very few have done so. While redemption fees and gates are intended to increase fund stability, they might actually encourage earlier, preemptive redemptions. In any case, both the floating NAV rule on institutional prime funds and the inclusion of redemption fees and gates on all prime funds went into effect in October 2016..  

Figure O.12 shows the balances of money market funds over time, by sector. The timing of the steep drops in the balances of both prime and tax-exempt funds corresponds closely to the October 2016 effective date just mentioned. The inconvenience of floating NAVs and the potential loss of immediacy from redemption fees and gates clearly reduced the attractiveness of prime funds. In 2020, as part of a broad flight-to-quality brought on by the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns, balances in government money market funds increased markedly. Over the whole of 2020, institutional prime fund balances stayed relatively constant at $\$600$ billion, while retail prime fund balances fell gradually from about $\$500$ billion to $\$200$ billion. Prime balances did fall dramatically, however, in March 2020, and institutional balances fell more than retail balances, but, due to swift action by the Treasury and Federal Reserve in support of financial markets in general and money market funds in particular, balances recovered relatively quickly. In any case, it seems that the possibility of redemption fees and gates in March 2020 did encourage preemptive withdrawals by prime investors and sales of assets by prime fund managers, who raised liquidity in order to avoid triggering fees and gates. Consequently, at the time of this writing, the SEC is revisiting fees and gates and considering other changes to the regulation of institutional prime funds.17
