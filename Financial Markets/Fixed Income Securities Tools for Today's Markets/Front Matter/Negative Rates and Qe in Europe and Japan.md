# 0.5 NEGATIVE RATES AND QE IN EUROPE AND JAPAN  

Lending $\epsilon1$ at a negative rate means receiving less than $\epsilon1$ when the loan matures. Conversely, borrowing 1 at a negative rate means paying back. less than 1 at maturity. Buying a bond at a negative yield means purchasing. the bond for more than its face amount, receiving no interest over the life. of the bond, and receiving only face amount at maturity.27 Individuals with relatively small amounts of money can avoid lending at negative rates by. keeping money in cash. For individuals and corporations with larger sums,. however, holding cash is very cumbersome, and depositing funds at a bank at a modestly negative rate of interest may be the best available choice. There are also reasons to buy long-term bonds trading at a negative yield, despite their being guaranteed to lose money in nominal or euro terms. First, if bank deposit rates are negative, say at $-0.50\%$ , then purchasing. a bond yielding $-0.25\%$ might be preferable to a deposit. Second, if the future is characterized by falling prices, that is, by deflation, then a negative yielding bond can offer a positive real return. For example, a bond yielding. $-1\%$ when prices are falling at a rate of $2\%$ is actually gaining $1\%$ in real terms, that is, in purchasing power. Third, from a short-term trading.  

perspective, negative yielding bonds increase in price if yields fall. In other words, a trader makes money by buying a bond at a yield of. $-1\%$ if market yields subsequently fall to. $-1.5\%$  

The Fed never lowered its target interest rate below zero as part of its easing program, but the European Central Bank (ECB) combined negative rates with QE starting in 2014, and the Bank of Japan did so in 2016. These policy decisions contributed to a peak of more than $\$18$ trillion of global debt trading at negative yields in December 2020, and nearly as much as recently as summer 2021, with more than $50\%$ of that volume in European bonds and about a third in Japanese bonds.28 At the time of this writing, with central banks around the world expected to increase rates in response to inflation, the volume of negative yielding bonds is significantly lower, at less than $\$5$ trillion in early 2022.  

The Eurosystem refers to the ECB and the collection of national cen-. tral banks in the euro area. Individual banks conduct transactions with and keep reserves at their respective national central banks, which, in turn, interact with the ECB. For simplicity, however, the discussion here is written as if banks trade directly with the ECB. The ECB targets interest rates by setting a deposit facility rate, which banks earn on their reserve deposits at the ECB, and a rate on main refinancing operations, which banks pay to borrow. from the ECB through short-term repo transactions.29 In its easing of monetary conditions, the ECB lowered these policy rates from $3.25\%$ and $4.25\%$ respectively, in July 2008, to $-0.50\%$ and $0\%$ , respectively, in September 2019. An individual bank might try to avoid earning a negative interest rate on its reserve deposits by lending out its reserves, which essentially passes them on to another bank. The banking system as a whole, however, cannot reduce the total amount of reserves supplied by the ECB and, therefore,. cannot collectively avoid the negative rates on reserves. While the logic of reducing rates to stimulate economic activity can be extended to negative or even significantly negative rates, policymakers around the world have not been eager to go far along that path. Banks quickly passed negative rates on to their corporate depositors but have been reluctant or unable to do so for the vast majority of their retail depositors. Consequently, contrary to policy objectives, extended periods of negative rates seem to have reduced. both bank profitability and lending activity.30  

To ease monetary conditions beyond reducing interest rates, the ECB turned both to loans to banks and to QE. Figure O.15 shows the assets of the ECB or, more precisely, the consolidated assets of the ECB and the national banks in the Eurosystem. Over the whole period, the multiplicative expansion of the balance sheet was similar to that at the Fed, shown in. Figure O.13. The ECB began at a slower pace, however, and, at the start, placed a heavier reliance on bank loans. Before the financial crisis, the ECB loaned money to banks on a collateralized basis for a week through its main refinancing operations (MROs) and for three months through its longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs). As the ECB wanted to ease monetary conditions, it offered longer-maturity LTROs, first up to a year and then up to three years. The logic was that banks have more flexibility to expand their lending if they are more certain of their source of funds. Then, starting in 2014, with the aim of making its loans even more stimulative,. the ECB began targeted long-term refinancing operations (TLTROs), which made four-year loans to banks in amounts based on the amounts that banks, in turn, loaned to their customers. At the time of this writing, MROs are for a week, LTROs for three months, and TLTROs for terms up to four. years. As evident from Figure O.15, however, the ECB eventually expanded. its balance sheet less through loans and more through QE, that is, through the purchase of securities. While government debt issues comprise the vast majority of these purchases, the ECB began purchasing nonbank corporate

obligations in early 2016, and, as of early 2022, owns more than 350   
billion of these securities.31  

The ECB faces a unique challenge in implementing QE. European law prevents the ECB from funding individual European governments, or more broadly, from encouraging any unsound budget policies. In this spirit, to preserve ECB purchases as purely monetary rather than fiscal interventions, the ECB has aimed to purchase the bonds of various national governments in proportions to their capital keys, which reflect the sizes of their populations and economies. Furthermore, in 2015, the ECB limited itself to purchasing at most one third of the outstanding amount of any country's bonds. As QE purchases grew, however, keeping within these constraints has been difficult, and the ECB faced court challenges with respect to some of its decisions. One obstacle of growing significance has been that Germany has the greatest capital key, but a relatively small amount of debt outstanding. The ECB gave itself more leeway, therefore, for purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme in March 2020: the one-third limit would not be applied; the shortest eligible maturity would be 28 days rather than one year, which allowed for the purchase of short-term German government bills; bonds with less than investment-grade ratings would be eligible, which allowed for the purchase of Greek government debt; and some flexibility. would be tolerated with respect to the capital keys constraint.32  

Apart from allocating purchases across countries, the sheer magnitudes. of ECB purchases have become challenging. For example, in June and July. 2021, the ECB purchased 134.7 billion of government bonds from France,. Germany, Italy, and Spain, while, over the same time period, the net issuance of those countries was only $\epsilon89$ billion. Furthermore, by the end of 2021, the ECB was expected to own more than $40\%$ of all German and $40\%$ of all Italian government bonds outstanding.33  

One development that has made QE easier for the ECB is the relatively recent, large-scale issuance of debt by the European Commission (EC). EC debt is an obligation of the European Union as a whole, and not the obligation of any particular country. While not unprecedented, such supranational European debt has never before been issued on the scale planned from 2020 to 2026. The EC is issuing. $\epsilon100$ billion of SURE (Temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) bonds and $\epsilon800$ billion of. NextGenerationEU bonds to finance expenditures aimed at supporting economic recovery from the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns.34 The total of these supranational issues is a modest, but not insignificant, fraction of the roughly. $\in12.5$ trillion of European government debt outstanding in 2021. From the perspective of the ECB, the debt issues of the EC not only provide more eligible bonds for purchase, but also bonds that are not subject to the cross-country purchase allocation constraints described earlier. EC debt purchases do face other constraints, however: at the time of this writing, the ECB can invest at most $10\%$ of its portfolio in supranational debt and can hold no more than. $50\%$ of the debt of any one supranational issuer.  

The Bank of Japan (BOJ) was the first central bank to introduce QE.. Reacting to low growth and deflation, the BOJ had already, by 2001, pushed TONAR (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate), the Japanese interbank rate, to nearly zero. Looking for additional means of stimulus, the BOJ began its QE operations by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) with maturities greater than two years. Various additional lending and purchase programs were subsequently introduced, which included the purchase of. corporate obligations, but, as shown in Figure O.16, its balance sheet did not increase at anything like the trajectory pursued by the Fed and ultimately the ECB until 2013, with the BOJ's Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing $(\mathcal{Q}\mathcal{Q}E)$ . This program committed not only to massive asset purchases,. which were to include long-term JGBs, corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds, and equities, but also to lowering yields on long-term JGBs. QQE showed some promising economic results at first, but by 2016 the BOJ took further action. First, it "went negative," lowering the rate on some bank reserves to $-0.10\%$ . Second, it began yield curve control or yield curve targeting, in which it committed to buy (or sell) 10-year JGBs so as to keep their yields at approximately $0\%$ . Yield curve control was effective in that the BOJ did not have to purchase so great a volume of bonds as previously to keep rates low. In other words, the mere threat of central bank trading to keep yields at $0\%$ is enough to keep market-determined yields at that level.. The effectiveness of this threat is manifested in Figure O.16 as a slower increase in BOJ assets from 2016 until the outbreak of the COVID pandemic in 2020. While inflationary pressures in the United States and Europe, at. the time of this writing, have pushed the Fed and ECB into more restrictive. monetary postures, economic conditions and continued low inflation in Japan are keeping the BOJ committed to its expansionary policies..
