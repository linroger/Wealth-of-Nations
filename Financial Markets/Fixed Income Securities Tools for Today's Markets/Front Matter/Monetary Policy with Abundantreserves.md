# 0.4 MONETARY POLICY WITH ABUNDANTRESERVES  

To introduce the roles of the Federal Reserve system or "the Fed" as a modern central bank, Table O.4 shows its pre-crisis balance sheet, as of December 2007. One role, the creation and maintenance of a widely accepted national currency, is achieved by purchasing government bonds with that currency. The currency of the United States is comprised of green bills labeled as liabilities of the Federal Reserve, that is, as "Federal Reserve Notes." In terms of the balance sheet, therefore, outstanding currency is a liability and Treasury securities are assets. Put another way, currency is "backed" by government bonds. As shown in the table, $\$773.9$ billion of currency outstanding was about $83\%$ of Federal Reserve liabilities.

A second role of the central bank is to provide liquidity to banks under short-term distress. As mentioned earlier, bank assets, like loans, are relatively illiquid, while bank liabilities, like deposits or short-term borrowings. from other financial institutions, may be due immediately. Therefore, a bank. may find itself solvent but illiquid, that is, with assets of sufficient value to pay off its liabilities but without enough cash on hand to meet its immediate obligations. In these situations, a bank can borrow from the Fed through the discount window on any acceptable collateral. The discount window. borrowings of a well-managed bank are expected to be infrequent and of relatively limited duration.  

The third role discussed here, as set out in the Federal Reserve Act, is to "maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates...so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates." Despite the three objectives, by the way, the Fed is often said to have a "dual mandate" of full employment and low inflation. In any case, two points are made before proceeding:  

1. To ensure that banks have the resources to honor all requests to withdraw deposits that they are likely to receive, banks have been required to maintain cash and reserves, which are deposits held at a Federal Reserve bank. Until 2008, banks did not earn interest on their reserve balances.18   
2. The Fed sets the total amount of reserves in the banking system. To add to reserves, the Fed might buy a Treasury bond from a bank. The bank's account at its Federal Reserve Bank is credited with the purchase  

price -- which increases bank reserves and the liabilities of the Fed - and. the Treasury bond is added to the assets of the Fed. The Fed can also add to reserves by lending money to a bank through a repurchase agreement or repo.19 The money is credited to the bank's account at the Fed, which is a reserve liability of the Fed, and the loan obligation is added. to the Fed's assets. To reduce reserves, the Fed can do the opposite of. these two transactions, that is, sell a bond to a bank or borrow money from a bank through a repo. In light of this discussion, the quantity of Treasury assets and net repo assets on the Fed's balance sheet enter into the determination of the total amount of reserves in the banking system.  

Before the financial crisis of 2007-2009, reserves were scarce in the sense that banks traded reserves among themselves in the interbank fed funds market. Banks that needed reserves to satisfy their reserve requirements borrowed fed funds, while banks that had excess reserves, on which they did not earn interest, loaned fed funds at the market-determined fed funds rate. In this setting, if the Fed wanted to ease monetary conditions, to stimulate the economy (i.e., growth was too low and inflation not a threat), it would add reserves to the banking system, which - by increasing supply relative to demand in the market for reserves - would decrease the fed funds rate and likely increase the volume of bank loans to commercial enterprises. Similarly, if the Fed wanted to tighten monetary conditions, to slow the economy (e.g., growth was too inflationary), it would remove reserves from the system, which would increase the fed funds rate and likely decrease bank loans to commercial enterprises. Finally, the means by which the Fed changed reserves were called open market operations and consisted almost exclusively. of lending and borrowing money through repurchase agreements.  

In response to the financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession, the Fed tried to stimulate the economy as just described, by reducing the fed funds rate from $5.25\%$ in September 2007 to a range of between. $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ by December 2008. But having reduced interest rates to nearly zero and wanting to stimulate the economy even more forcefully, the Fed began what became known as quantitative easing $(\mathcal{Q}E)$ : it purchased great quantities of US Treasury securities and "agency MBS," which are MBS issued by government agencies and GSEs. At the start of the program, purchases of MBS directly eased stresses arising from the overleveraged positions in mortgages and mortgage products that were at the heart of the crisis. Experts do not agree, however, on the mechanism by which the subsequent massive purchases of both Treasuries and MBS were to stimulate the economy, although  

possibilities include lowering intermediate- and long-term interest rates.   
(rather than just the fed funds rate); pushing investors out of relatively safe.   
Treasuries and agency MBS and into riskier products like corporate bonds.   
and loans; and flooding banks with reserves. In fact, the chairman of the.   
Fed at the time said a few years later that "the problem with QE is that it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."20.  

Figure O.13 shows the composition of the asset side of the Fed's balance. sheet from June 2006 to June 2021. Note that the total of Fed assets is often referred to by market participants simply as the Fed's "balance sheet." In any case, during the financial crisis itself, from 2007 to 2009, assets were elevated by expanded repo lending, lending through the discount window,. loans through emergency facilities that the Fed put in place at the time, and through swap lines, through which the Fed lends US dollars to foreign central banks, collateralized by foreign currency. While small in hindsight, this bal-. ance sheet expansion before QE was unprecedented, increasing from about $\$900$ billion at the start of 2007 to over. $\$2$ trillion by the end of 2008.. From then, the Fed fully engaged in QE by purchasing Treasuries and agency MBS, and the balance sheet grew dramatically. By the end of 2014, however, the Fed decided that economic conditions had improved enough to discontinue further stimulus. It stopped buying new assets, though it continued to. roll over principal repayments from its holdings. From December 2015 to summer 2019, it raised the target Fed funds rate from a range of $0\%$ to $0.25\%$ to a range of $2.25\%$ to $2.50\%$ and, in what was named the "normalization" of the balance sheet, began allowing assets to decline with principal repayments. The Fed was clear to point out, however, that the balance sheet would not decline to anywhere near its size before the financial crisis, because, as explained later, post-crisis monetary policy requires greater levels of reserves. Along these lines, in summer 2019, the Fed resumed the reinvestment of principal payments to maintain the size of the balance sheet. Then, in response to turmoil in the repo market in September 2019, further described later, the Fed started growing the balance sheet again. The Fed also judged that "implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures" warranted lowering rates and reduced the Fed funds target range to $1.50\%$ to $1.75\%$ by November 2019. Finally, with the onset of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns, the Fed reduced rates back to the range of between $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ and aggressively bought Treasuries and MBs. As of June 2021, the Fed's balance sheet stood at $\$8.25$ trillion, more than nine times its size before the financial crisis.

QE not only increased the size of the Fed's balance sheet but also changed its nature in a way that necessitated a new approach to implementing monetary policy. This is best described in terms of the liability side of the balance sheet, which is shown in Figure O.14 for three dates: the end of 2007, before the financial crisis; the end of 2019, before the pandemic; and, most recently, the end of the second quarter of 2021. At the end of 2007, consistent with the pre-crisis implementation of monetary policy, about $2\%$ of the Fed's liabilities were bank reserves, and reserves were scarce. After years of QE, however, with Fed asset purchases adding to bank reserves, bank reserves rose to $37\%$ of Fed liabilities by the end of 2019 and $43\%$ by June 2021. Reserves had become abundant, and banks essentially stopped borrowing from and lending reserves to each other.21 Consequently, in this new regime of abundant reserves, the Fed could no longer influence short-term rates by adding to or subtracting reserves from the banking system.  

The Fed currently sets interest rates through two administrative rates,. the interest on reserve balances (IORB) and the reverse repo facility (RRP) rate. The IORB is the rate that the Fed pays banks on their reserve deposits.. Focusing on overnight, safe rates, that is, putting aside spreads due to longer terms, riskier investments, and fees, the IORB fixes the rate at which banks are willing to borrow and lend. No bank would borrow at a rate above the IORB: it would be less costly to use reserves and sacrifice earnings at the IORB. And no bank would lend at a rate below the IORB: it would be more profitable to keep reserves on deposit and earn the IORB.22.

If banks were the only participants in money markets, then setting the. IORB would set overnight, safe rates in the system. But nonbanks with funds to lend might very well lend at rates below the IORB. First, only banks hold reserves and, therefore, only banks can lend to the Fed directly at the IORB. Second, because of post-crisis regulations, discussed later, banks are not willing to accept deposits from all comers and then hold those funds as their own reserves at the Fed. Therefore, other significant market participants, particularly money market funds, might very well lend funds at rates below the IORB. To prevent these lenders from pushing market rates below Fed targets, the Fed offers to pay a minimum rate to these participants through its RRP. More specifically, through the RRP, money market funds and some other entities can lend money to the Fed, taking Treasury securities as collateral, at the Fed's administered RRP rate.23 It has turned out, in fact, that the facility has had to grow very large and very quickly to keep rates in the. Fed's policy range. Figure O.14 shows that, as of June 2021, the Fed's repo. liabilities of $\$1.3$ trillion constituted $16\%$ of the Fed's total liabilities..  

Putting these pieces together, the Fed sets rates in the regime of abundant. reserves as follows: the Fed sets a target range for the market-determined fed funds rate; it sets the IORB to determine the rate at which banks are willing to borrow and lend; and it sets the RRP rate as a floor to the rate at which money market funds and others will lend. At the time of this writing, the fed funds target range is between $0\%$ and $0.25\%$ ; the RRP rate is $0.05\%$ ; and the IORB is $0.15\%$ . This means of implementing monetary policy has been. successful in that the weighted-average of fed funds transactions has most recently been between $0.06\%$ and $0.10\%$  

Policy implementation with abundant reserves has not been as success-. ful, however, with respect to banks responding to market conditions with-. out Fed assistance. Put another way, it has not been clear at what level reserves really are abundant. In mid-September 2019, reserves dropped by about $9\%$ somewhat suddenly, from a variety of causes, including corporate tax payments and the settlement of new Treasury issues, both of which move funds from banks to the government. Banks might have been expected,. with their abundant reserves, to supply funds to any market participant needing funds. But that did not happen. Instead, in the ensuing scramble. for funds, when the Fed's target range was between $2\%$ and $2.25\%$ , the transaction-weighted repo rate on a particular day averaged $5.25\%$ , and one trade was done at $10\%$ . As mentioned earlier, the Fed responded swiftly by adding reserves, but the episode demonstrated that the determination of. the quantity of reserves in a system of abundant reserves was not necessarily straightforward.  

The reasons that reserves proved inadequate were traced to the interactions of monetary policy with bank regulation. First, since the financial crisis, banks have been subject to a leverage ratio, which requires that capital equal a minimum fraction of assets, regardless of the risk of those assets. In particular, reserves at the Fed, which are safer than any other instrument in the system, and repo lending on Treasury securities, which is extremely safe, are now both subject to capital requirements. Second, since the financial crisis, banks must hold enough high-quality liquid assets $(H Q L A)$ to meet certain scenarios of cash withdrawals and funding needs. Furthermore, while Treasury securities can be used to meet HQLA requirements, there appears to be a bank examiner preference for reserves. Third, a stigma remains for banks that have daylight overdrafts, that is, temporary negative balances at Fed accounts that have to be resolved by the end of the day. Returning to September 2019, then, banks were not willing to make additional repo loans, despite the relatively high rates available, because the loans would increase assets and capital requirements; use reserves; and risk daylight overdrafts.24  

A similar episode occurred in March 2020. News of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns resulted in disorder in Treasury markets,. manifested through high costs of trading and high spreads between otherwise similar securities. These disturbances were much more severe than those in September 2019, but banks again seemed unwilling to use their resources,. and the Fed again intervened by reducing the fed funds target range, offering unlimited repo loans, purchasing Treasuries and MBS, and temporarily excluding reserves, Treasuries, and Treasury repo from leverage ratio calculations.25 As a more permanent response to the episodes of both September 2019 and March 2020, the Fed instituted a standing repo facility (SRF) in July 2021, through which primary dealers and bank counterparties can borrow money overnight from the Fed on government-backed collateral. To discourage the use of the facility except under stressed conditions, the borrowing rate is set above market rates. At the time of this writing, with the RRP rate at $0.05\%$ and the IORB at $0.15\%$ , the rate on the SRF is $0.25\%$  

Several policy issues arise with QE and the implementation of monetary policy in a regime of abundant reserves. First, the Fed was established and has traditionally accepted deposits only from banks. The idea was that the public deposits funds into banks, and banks decide to whom to make loans. In other words, the private banking sector was responsible for capital allocation decisions. The Fed has always held some quantity of government bonds, of course, because, in the current monetary system, as explained earlier, government bonds are the assets against which circulate the liability of central bank currency. But the purchase of much greater quantities of Treasuries - currency has fallen to only. $26\%$ of Fed liabilities - and the. purchase of MBs by the Fed, are effectively capital allocation decisions. Furthermore, the acceptance by the Fed of large deposits from the public through the RRP has disintermediated banks as well. A second policy issue is that the existence of the RRP may encourage the public, in a crisis, to withdraw funds from banks and buy money market fund shares, to be deposited in the RRP. While withdrawing money from banks in cash has always been an option during crises, before the RRP this was very inconvenient for large sums. Third, to the extent that there is some limit on the size of a central bank's balance sheet, maintaining a large balance sheet in relatively normal times limits room for action in future times of stress. Fourth, the Fed is now paying banks interest on their reserves, which it was not doing before 2008..  

This can be viewed as a cost to taxpayers when, for example, the Treasury is. borrowing through three-month T-bills -- and the Fed is investing some of its assets in those same T-bills -- at five or six basis points, while the Fed is borrowing from banks through reserves at 15 basis points. And this issue could become more acute when the Fed eventually increases rates by increasing the IORB. In fact, one of the reasons that the Treasury has been keeping more. of its cash balances or deposits at the Fed is to avoid the situation in which Treasury holds stores of cash as deposits at banks, earning a relatively low rate of interest, while the banks are depositing those fund at the Fed and earning the IORB.26 Figure O.14 shows that Treasury deposits have grown. to about $11\%$ of Fed liabilities.
