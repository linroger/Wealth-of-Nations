# 0.2 US MARKETS  

This section describes debt and loan instruments in the United States, categorized as in Figure O.4. The total amount outstanding across all instruments, as of June 2021, was $\$76.4$ trillion.' By way of comparison, the market capitalization of US equities at the same time was about. $\$45$ trillion. Treasury securities and municipal securities are discussed in this section in some detail, while sectors discussed in later chapters of the book are treated very. briefly here.

# Treasury Securities  

In less than a decade, Treasury securities have grown from the third largest. category, behind mortgages and corporate and foreign bonds, to the largest category, at $\$24.3$ trillion. When the US government spends more than. it collects in taxes and fees, which has been the case for most of the last 50 years, it needs to borrow money to fund its deficit spending. It does so through the array of instruments shown in Figure O.5. Treasury bills or T-bills mature in one year or less and are discount securities, which means. that they sell for less than, or at a discount from, their promised payment at maturity. Treasury notes and bonds are coupon-bearing securities; that is, they earn a fixed coupon or interest rate on their principal, face, or par amounts through maturity, and then repay that principal amount at maturity. Strictly speaking, and in the accounts of the government, notes are issued with 10 or fewer years to maturity, while bonds are issued with more. than 10 years to maturity. The distinction had more meaning historically,. when bonds were subject to a maximum, statutory rate of interest. In. common parlance today, however, the words "notes" and "bonds" are used interchangeably. In any case, Chapter 1 describes the cash flows of Treasury. notes and bonds in more detail..

Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) protect investors against inflation with principal amounts that increase or decrease with changes in the consumer price index (CPI). Consider, for example, a TIPS with a principal amount of $\$100$ and a coupon rate of $1\%$ per year. If CPI has increased by $10\%$ , the principal amount of the TIPS will have increased to $\$110$ , and the investor earns $1\%$ on that higher principal amount. This investor is just as well off having $\$100$ and earning $\$1$ per year at the original price level as having $\$110$ and earning $1\%\times\$110$ or $\$1.10$ per year at a price level that is $10\%$ higher. Hence, TIPS earn a fixed real or inflation-adjusted return, while coupon-bearing Treasuries earn a fixed nominal or dollar return.? For this reason, by the way, in discussions that include both TIPS and Treasury bonds, the latter are often referred to as nominal bonds. In any case, while comprising only $5.6\%$ of the total in  

Figure O.5, TIPS have an outsized importance as measuring the market's perception of inflation and the price of inflation risk. As of January 2022, for example, the rate on five-year nominal Treasury bonds was about $2.8\%$ higher than the rate on five-year TIPs. Roughly expressed, therefore, the market expects an average inflation rate of. $2.8\%$ over the subsequent five years. More precisely expressed, given inflation expectations and risk preferences, investors require a premium of. $2.8\%$ to buy five-year nominal. bonds and to assume inflation risk over that horizon..  

Figure O.5 next lists floating-rate notes (FRNs). These are relatively new, having been first issued in January 2014. FRNs are sold with two years to maturity, and they pay a variable rate of interest equal to the going rate on 13-week T-bills plus a fixed spread. This spread entices some investors, who might otherwise roll investments of short-term T-bills, to sacrifice some liquidity and buy two-year FRNs instead. From the perspective of the Treasury, FRNs lock in funding for two years, but at a cost only slightly above that of short-term bills.3 In fact, over 2021, FRNs were sold at a. spread of less than five basis points.4 In addition, somewhat cynically, FRNs seem to cost less than two-year notes, because government accounting of interest rate cost does not penalize the risk of rates increasing in the future. In any case, the issuance of FRNs has remained limited, comprising about $2\%$ of the total in Figure O.5..  

US Treasury issues are among the most actively traded securities in the. world. This is due, in good part, to the significant role of the US dollar in international markets and to the perception of US government debt as among the best stores of value available. An additional explanation, however, is the careful management of Treasury debt issuance. More specifically, the US Treasury sets a regular auction schedule that lets investors know, in advance, which securities will be sold when and in what quantities. Furthermore, the Treasury has gradually modulated this schedule over many years to suit both the borrowing needs of the government and changing market conditions. To appreciate these points, Table O.2 describes the auction schedule as of January 2022.  

"Issue frequency" describes how often new securities of each type are. issued. The Treasury has settled, for example, on issuing new notes with. two, three, five, and seven years to maturity every month, while issuing new

10-year notes, along with new 20- and 30-year bonds, every quarter. Both the set of issues and their frequency have changed over time, however. For example, issuance of the 20-year bond was eliminated in 1986 and brought back in May 2020, while issuance of 30-year bonds was stopped after August 2001 and resumed in February 2006. And in 2000, the US Treasury introduced the concept of reopenings, which means auctioning or selling more of an existing issue. For example, Table O.2 reports that 10-year notes are issued quarterly and reopened monthly. In August 2021, the Treasury sold about $\$59$ billion of a new $1.25\%$ 10-year note, that is, a note that had not been issued before, that pays interest on principal at an annual rate of $1.25\%$ , and that matures on August 15, 2031. The following month, in. September 2021, the Treasury sold another. $\$42$ billion of that same issue,. that is, more notes with a coupon of $1.25\%$ that mature on August 15,. 2031. And again the next month, in October 2021, the Treasury sold another $\$41$ billion of that same issue. In November 2021, however, a quarter after the first issuance of the $1.25\%$ 10-year notes, the Treasury sold. $\$62$ billion of a new 10-year note, with a coupon of. $1.365\%$ and a maturity date of. November 15, 2031.  

One result of the auction schedule is that the most recently issued bonds. of each type and maturity tend to be the ones most actively traded. In the. previous example, as of November 15, 2021, the just-issued $1.365\%$ notes maturing on November 15, 2031, are called the 10-year on-the-run notes. and are likely to become the most actively traded of notes with approximately 10 years to maturity. The $1.25\%$ notes maturing on August 15, 2031, which had been the 10-year on-the-run notes, become the old notes, and over time, as even newer 10-year notes are issued, become the double-old notes, the triple-old notes, etc.  

Returning to Figure O.5, nonmarketable securities is another small category of Treasury issuance. Included in this category are about $\$140$ billion of savings bonds, which are discount securities sold directly to individual investors, and about $\$120$ billion of State and Local Government Series bonds, commonly known as $S L U G s$ , which are mentioned later in the context of municipal bonds.  

The final category in Figure O.5 refers to Treasury bonds sold into government accounts. These bonds are also nonmarketable and represent debt that the US government owes itself. The social security trust funds, for example, at the end of 2020, held about $\$3$ trillion in Treasury bonds. Most people argue that these bonds do not represent any additional Treasury indebtedness, or, in other words, that there is no difference between social security benefits being paid by the Treasury directly or being paid indirectly through the payment of interest and principal on bonds in the social security trust funds. By this logic, Treasury bonds held in government accounts are excluded from most descriptions of government indebtedness. More specifically, in terms of Figure O.5, US government debt is usually equated to "Total Debt Held by the Public," or $\$23$ trillion, rather than to "Public Debt Securities," which adds the. $\$6.2$ trillion held in government accounts, for a grand total of. $\$23.5$ trillion.  

In discussing the magnitude of government debt, and in comparing government indebtedness across countries, debt held by the public is usually normalized by gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of the goods and services produced in a country in a single year. The idea here is that countries with greater GDPs can safely carry greater levels of debt. With US GDP at about $\$22$ trillion as of June 2021, the ratio of debt to GDP in the United States is about. $100\%$ , which is extremely high by historical standards. The ratio was over $100\%$ during World War II; subsequently declined to between $20\%$ and $50\%$ ; climbed to about $80\%$ in the aftermath of the. financial crisis of. $2007{-}2009$ ; and then shot up to above. $100\%$ in the wake of the COvID pandemic and economic shutdowns. For comparison purposes, the ratio of debt to GDP in Japan is currently over $230\%$ ; in Greece about $175\%$ ; in France about $100\%$ ; in the United Kingdom about $85\%$ ; in Germany and China, less than $60\%$ ; and in Switzerland, less than $40\%$  

Despite the historically high ratio of US debt to GDP, foreign investors. continue to find US Treasuries attractive and hold a large fraction of the. amount outstanding. As of June 2021, investors outside the United States held $\$7.2$ trillion Treasuries, or $33\%$ of the $\$21.8$ trillion marketable securities shown in Figure O.5. These holdings include. $\$1.28$ trillion $(5.9\%)$ in Japan, $\$1.06$ trillion in China $(4.9\%)$ , and $\$0.53$ trillion $(2.4\%)$ in the United Kingdom.  

# Municipal Securities  

The $\$4$ trillion municipal securities market includes more than 50,000. issuers and approximately one million individual bond issues. Municipal bonds, sometimes called municipals or simply munis, are issued by states and local governments to fund their expenditures. Unlike most fixed income markets, the muni market is dominated by retail investors: as of June 2021, over $70\%$ of principal outstanding was held directly by individuals,. or indirectly by individuals through mutual funds and other investment vehicles.  

Interest payments from munis are exempt from federal tax so long as. funds raised from selling those munis are used for public projects. Therefore, investors who pay federal taxes are willing to accept lower rates of interest from munis than they would from bonds whose interest is taxed at the federal level, like corporates and Treasuries, controlling, of course, for differences in credit quality. And municipal issuers can raise funds at rates below what they would otherwise have to pay. The story is somewhat more complicated, however, because capital gains on price appreciation from munis is not. exempt from federal tax. To avoid this tax, however, the market has evolved to minimize the proportion of return in the form of (taxed) price appreciation rather than (untaxed) interest. More specifically, most munis - in the current low-rate environment - are issued at a coupon rate of $5\%$ and, consequently, at a premium to par, that is, at a price greater than face amount. In this way, these munis are unlikely to trade at a discount and thus subject subsequent buy-and-hold purchasers to taxes on capital gains. With respect to state taxes, the treatment of municipal interest varies by state. Most states. tax bonds issued in other states and exempt their own bonds, while some. states tax both their own and other states' bonds. Washington, D.C., does. not tax any municipal bond interest, and Utah exempts municipals issued in. states that exempt Utah's bonds! Utah's exemption is more significant than it may seem, because states with no income tax automatically qualify. The final piece of the tax story is that about $\$500$ billion of municipals do not qualify for the federal tax exemption, because their proceeds are used for working. capital, for funding private business development, or for refinancing existing debt through particular kinds of transactions.5 These taxable munis pay interest at rates comparable to those in the corporate and Treasury markets, again controlling for differences in credit quality.  

Muni bonds can be divided into three broad groups. General obligation (GO) bonds, which constitute about $25\%$ of the market, are backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality. Revenue bonds, which constitute about two thirds of the market, are backed by revenues from particular projects, like tolls from a bridge or highway. And within revenue bonds is a. $\$600$ billion subset of industrial revenue bonds, through which municipal-. ities issue (tax-exempt) debt to raise funds for private enterprises engaged in qualifying projects. The third group consists of prerefunded or defeased bonds. A muni in this category has been canceled as a municipal liability by the setting aside of sufficient cash and Treasury securities to fund all of its remaining payment obligations. These prerefunded or defeased bonds continue to exist and trade, but with their credit risk improved to that of Treasuries.6  

Default rates on municipal securities have been very low. From 1970 to 2020, Moody's reports a five-year cumulative default rate for the sector. of $0.08\%$ , which is much lower than the equivalent for corporate bonds, as discussed in Chapter 14. Nevertheless, credit risk is an important consideration for investors in the muni market, with underfunded pension obligations a particularly significant and perennial cause for concern. Historically, GO bonds, which are backed by the issuer's taxing power, were perceived as safer than revenue bonds, which are backed by particular sources of revenue that could diminish or disappear over time. This perception changed significantly, however, with the bankruptcy of Detroit in the summer of 2013. The settlement provisions that emerged in November 2014 were a combination of law, political forces, and negotiations across many interested parties. The results can be roughly summarized as follows. First, while a court ruled that state laws protecting pension benefits were trumped by federal bankruptcy law, Detroit pensions recovered over. $95\%$ of their value, although cost of living adjustments were reduced or eliminated. Health and life insurance benefits, however, recovered only $10\%$ of value. Second, holders of water and sewer bonds, which had strong legal claims to the associated revenue streams, suffered no loss of principal. Third, GO bonds suffered significant losses, depending on their exact provisions. Unlimited tax bonds carry a pledge by issuers to raise taxes, if necessary, to pay bondholders. The unlimited tax bonds involved in the Detroit bankruptcy were, in addition, backed by specific, segregated, and voter-approved tax receipts. Nevertheless, these bonds recovered only $74\%$ of principal, and this negotiated, less-than-full recovery was attributed to the dwindling of their dedicated tax receipts due to deteriorating economic conditions in Detroit. Worse off, however, were Detroit's limited tax GO bonds, which had neither a pledge of unlimited tax increases nor dedicated tax receipts. They recovered only $34\%$ of principal. The revelation that GO bonds can be treated like unsecured claims changed credit analysis and pricing in the muni market.  

Before the financial crisis of 2007-2009, a majority of muni bonds were. insured against default, for a fee, of course, by private insurers. In fact, most of Detroit's GO bonds were insured, which meant that insurers, rather than investors, suffered the losses described in the previous paragraph. In any case, muni insurers suffered massive losses during the financial crisis, not from their muni businesses, but from having insured mortgage-related products. The ensuing damage to the industry ultimately resulted in less than $5\%$ of new muni issues being insured. More recently, perhaps in part due to the Detroit bankruptcy, and perhaps in part due to the COvID pandemic and shutdowns, there has been a resurgence of muni insurance, rising to perhaps $10\%$ of new issues.7  

# Other Us Markets  

Mortgages. The second largest sector in Figure O.4 contains mortgages, at $\$17.3$ trillion. Mortgage loans are used to purchase properties and are collateralized by those same properties. Mortgage balances finance the purchase of one- to four-family residences $(70\%)$ ; commercial property $(18\%)$ .n multi-family residences $(10\%)$ ; and farms $(2\%)$ . A remarkable feature about. the US mortgage market is that only about. $45\%$ of mortgage loan balances are held by the original lenders. The remaining. $55\%$ of balances are securitized, that is, sold by the original lenders; packaged into securities; and then sold to investors. Chapter 15 describes this market in much greater detail.8  

Corporate and Foreign Bonds. The third largest sector in Figure O.4. comprises corporate and foreign bonds, at. $\$14.7$ trillion, which includes bonds sold by US nonfinancial corporations $(45\%)$ ; by US financial corporations $(31\%)$ ; and by foreign corporations to US investors. $(24\%)$ , all to raise money to fund their operations and corporate transactions. Chapter 14 describes this market in detail.  

Loans and Advances. Continuing counterclockwise in Figure O.4, a little less than half of the $\$9.0$ trillion of Loans and Advances are made by banks, and the rest by an assortment of nonfinancial and financial entities. An important feature of this sector is the securitization and trading of bank loans, which is described in Chapter 14. Consumer credit, at $\$4$ trillion, is discussed in the next section, in the context of household balance sheets.  

Agency/GsE Debt. The penultimate category of instruments in Figure O.4 includes "agencies" or "agency bonds," which are issued by government agencies and GSEs. These entities span a range of associations with the federal government, and their debt issues enjoy varying levels of support from the federal government. At one extreme are the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). These agencies are part of the government, and their debt issues are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the United States. Moving from the full-faith-and-credit framework, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), which provides electricity for local power companies in Tennessee and surrounding states, is considered a federal agency. Formally, however, it is a corporation that is wholly owned by the US government, and its debt is backed by its own revenues, not - at least explicitly -- by the federal government. Further awayfrom full-faith-and-credit are the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). They are known as GSEs, but are owned by private shareholders and, having failed during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, are now under government conservatorship. Leading up to the crisis, their debt was not explicitly backed by the government, but the market expectations for full government support of their bonds was fully realized during and after the crisis. These two entities are discussed in great detail in Chapter 15.  

Commercial Paper. The final category in Figure O.4 is Commercial Paper (CP), through which the most highly rated corporations borrow short-term funds from the public. CP is discussed further in Chapter 14.
