# 5.2 KEY RATES: OVERVIEW  

Key-rate $^{\bullet}O1s$ or key-rate Dvo1s, along with key-rate durations, are designed: i) to describe how the risks of a bond portfolio are distributed along the term structure, and ii) to hedge those risks using some set of. bonds, usually the most liquid government bonds of various maturities.. To introduce the topic, Table 5.1 shows the key-rate durations for the. JPMorgan Government Bond Fund and its benchmark portfolio, the. Bloomberg-Barclays US Government Bond Index, as of May 31, 2021. The "Total" durations, in the last row of the table, have similar interpretations as the yield-based durations of Chapter 4. The JPM fund's total duration of 5.73 means that its value increases by approximately $5.73\%$ for a parallel decline in par rates of 100 basis points. The JPM fund, therefore,. has less duration risk than its benchmark, which has a duration of 6.78. The other rows of the table give the key-rate durations of these two bond portfolios. From the "5yr" row, for example, the JPM fund increases in value by approximately $0.80\%$ when the five-year par rate declines by 100 basis points, but all other par rates remain unchanged. Similarly, from the 20-year row, the benchmark portfolio increases in value by approximately $1.67\%$ when the 20-year par rate declines by 100 basis points, but all other par rates remain unchanged.  

The key-rate duration profile of a portfolio, therefore, decomposes its. total duration, that is, its sensitivity to parallel shifts in par rates, into sepa-. rate durations or sensitivities to changes in individual par rates. Consistent with key-rate durations as a decomposition of total duration, the sum of all key-rate durations of a portfolio is equal or very nearly equal to the total duration of the portfolio.

The key-rate duration profiles in the table say a lot about the exposures. of the two portfolios to par rates of different terms. The interest rate risk of. the JPM fund is somewhat concentrated in seven- to 20-year par rates, while the risk of the index is concentrated in five- to seven-year and, even more so, in 20- to 30-year rates. Part of the reason for the relative differences in these exposures is that the JPM fund invests in US agency mortgage-backed. securities, which are particularly sensitive to seven- to 10-year rates, while the benchmark index contains only government bonds. In any case, as a. result of these key-rate duration differences, the two portfolios will perform. differently as the shape of the term structure fluctuates..  

The JPM fund reports exposures to the nine key rates listed in Table 5.1.. The index fund reports only eight key rates, leaving out the six-month rate.. The number of key rates chosen involves a trade-off, along the lines of the. introduction. With too few key rates, the term structure is likely to move in a way not captured by the framework. With too many, risk management becomes cumbersome and costly.  

Along with the number of key rates, the terms of the key rates need be chosen. Because key-rate Dv01s and durations are designed to be hedged with a relatively small set of liquid bonds, the most popular choices for key rates are those that correspond to the maturities of on-the-run Treasuries. Including the Treasury's regular issuance of six-month and one-year bills, along with its regular issuance of two-, three-, five-, seven-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year bonds, the JPM and index funds in Table 5.1 have clearly made this popular choice.
