# 5.1 KEY RATES: MOTIVATION  

The main motivation for multi-factor hedging is to control curve risk, that is, the risk that rates across the term structure do not move in parallel or in any fixed relationship. Figure 5.1 illustrates this phenomenon using changes in the term structure of on-the-run US Treasury yields on selected days in June

FIGURE 5.1 Changes in the Term Structure of On-the-Run US Treasury Yields, Selected Days, June 2021.  

2021. (On-the-run bonds are the most recently issued bonds - and usually the most liquid - in their respective maturity ranges.) Each point on each curve represents a change in an on-the-run Treasury yield over a business day. The 20-year term point on the June 18, 2021, curve, for example, shows that the yield of the on-the-run 20-year Treasury bond fell by 9.7 basis points from June 17, 2021, to June 18, 2021.  

The June 16, 2021, curve shows a significant change in the curvature of. the term structure: short-term rates rose some; intermediate-term rates rose a lot; and long-term rates rose very little. The June 18, 2021, curve is an example of a flattening of the term structure: short-term rates rose, intermediate rates fell some, and long-term rates fell a lot. The June 21, 2021, curve is an example of a steepening: short-term rates stayed about the same, while longer-term rates rose significantly. And finally, the June 22, 2021, curve can be very roughly categorized as a parallel shift. From Figure 5.1 as a whole,. hedges constructed with the single-factor metrics of Chapter 4 would not have performed reliably over several days in the second half of June 2021.
