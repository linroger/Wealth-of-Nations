# 13.1 MARKET SIZE AND PARTICIPANTS  

Table 13.1 shows outstanding amounts of interest rate swaps.1 Products include OIS, fixed-for-floating swaps, FRAs, interest rate caps and floors, and swaptions. Counterparties include all those that report positions to the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), that is, US entities, US subsidiaries of foreign entities, and foreign swap dealers that register with the CFTC so as to do business with US persons. The first column of the table divides these reporting entities into selected sectors. The second and third columns give the total long and short notional amounts in each sector. As explained in Chapter 2, the notional amount of a swap is the amount. on which payments are based. And, to be consistent with bond terminology, "long" positions are those that increase in value when interest rates fall (e.g., receiving fixed), while "short" positions are those that increase in value when interest rates rise (e.g., paying fixed). Because every swap contract has one counterparty long and the other short, total longs must equal total shorts across the whole market. According to Table 13.1, the total notional amount. of the market is $\$210.7$ trillion. This is an enormous number compared to the sizes of markets as presented in Chapter O: the total amount of debt and loans outstanding in the United States in Figure O.4 is only $\$76$ trillion. As it turns out, however, notional amount outstanding vastly exaggerates the size of the IRS market.  

The fourth and fifth columns of the table give a long and short "five-year equivalent" notional amount, which is the notional amount of five-year swaps that has the same risk as the raw notional amount. The risk sensitivity of swaps is discussed in the next section, but say, for example, that one sector was long $\$100$ million of 10-year swaps, which have a DV01 of 0.090; that is, a one-basis-point decline in rates increases the value of the position by $\$100$ million times $0.090/100$ , or $\$90,000$ . Say also that five-year swaps have a DV01 of 0.045. Then, the actual swap position - $\$100$ million of 10-year swaps - has the same risk as $\$200$ million of five-year swaps, and its "five-year equivalent" notional amount is $\$200$ million. On the other hand, a position of $\$100$ million two-year swaps, which has a DV01 of 0.018, has

a five-year equivalent notional amount of $\$100$ million times 0.018/0.045, or $\$40$ million. Returning to Table 13.1, the total five-year equivalents in the market are $\$137.1$ trillion, which is significantly less than the total notional amount of $\$210.7$ trillion. First, the options on swaps included here have lower risk than the risk of their underlying notional amounts.2 Second, a large proportion of swaps have terms less than five years. In fact, because bond markets, like the US Treasury and corporate bonds markets, have maturities concentrated in the five- to 10-year range, five-year swap equivalents are better than raw notional amounts for comparing market sizes.  

The sixth and seventh columns of Table 13.1 report entity-netted notionals (ENNs), which net long and short five-year equivalents that are denominated in the same currency between each pair of counterparties. For example, if Counterparty A is receiving fixed from Counterparty B on $\$100$ million five-year equivalents and simultaneously paying fixed to Counterparty B on $\$60$ million five-year equivalents, then Counterparty  

A is long $\$40$ million ENNs against Counterparty B and, symmetrically, Counterparty B is short $\$40$ million ENNs against Counterparty A. Summing long or short ENNs across all counterparty pairs in a sector or across the market as a whole gives the corresponding elements of the. table. Total market ENNs are $\$16.1$ trillion, which are much less than five-year equivalents. As explained in the next section, participants in the IRS market often take off risk by taking on new, risk-offsetting positions, not by unwinding existing trades. As a result, pairs of counterparties are. often both long and short to each other, and their ENNs are much less than their five-year equivalents. In any case, at $\$16.1$ trillion, the size of the IRS market is comparable to that of other US fixed income markets, as reported. in Chapter O.  

Swap dealers, whose business is to make markets in swaps, are very likely to accumulate both long and short positions with their clients and. are even more likely to do so with swaps clearinghouses, which are the legal counterparties to all cleared trades. In fact, the reduction of dealers' approxi-. mately $\$100$ trillion long and short five-year equivalents to $\$9.3$ trillion long and $\$7.6$ trillion short ENNs accounts for most of the reduction of total five-year equivalents to total ENNs. Significant reductions also characterize hedge funds, which are in the business of trading swaps, and banks, which, as described later, use hedged swap positions to facilitate their customer loan. businesses.  

The final column of Table 13.1 is just the difference between long and short ENNs, which reveals whether a sector, as whole, is long or short swaps. (Differences are not exact because of rounding.) There is probably too much variation across hedge funds and asset managers, with each entity pursuing its own investment strategies, to explain the signs of these sectors' net ENNs. Banks as a sector are short, perhaps as a result of hedging the interest rate risk of their mortgage assets, although, as discussed next, banks and other. financial companies receive fixed to transform their long-term fixed-rate debt into synthetic floating-rate debt. Pension funds and insurance companies are likely overall long, as discussed below, to hedge the interest rate risk of their long-term liabilities. Finally, also as discussed presently, nonfinancial compa-. nies pay fixed both to transform their floating-rate bank loans into synthetic fixed-rate loans and to hedge the risk of increasing rates before anticipated. sales of long-term debt..
