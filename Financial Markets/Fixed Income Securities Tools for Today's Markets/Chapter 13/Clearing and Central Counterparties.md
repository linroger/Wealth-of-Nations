# 13.5 CLEARING AND CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES  

Figure 13.6 illustrates the difference between bilateral and cleared swaps. The top section of the figure shows a bilateral swap, in which Counterparty A pays fixed to and receives floating from Counterparty B. All aspects of the trade, from its execution to the ongoing exchange of cash flows and margin, are arranged between the two counterparties, and each counterparty bears all of the risk should the other default. While the diagram looks simple when there are only two counterparties, managing a large book of swaps trades with many counterparties is very complex. Every day, each counterparty has to send VM to or collect VM from each of its counterparties, in addition to sending or collecting any contractual interest payments due that day. Furthermore, each counterparty must track its exposure to each of its counterparties and perform ongoing due diligence as to their creditworthiness.  

The middle section of Figure 13.6 illustrates a cleared swap between. two firms that are members of the clearinghouse. Members 1 and 2 first. execute a swap with each other, which is not shown in the figure, in which. Member 1 pays fixed to Member 2. That swap is then given up for clearing,. which means that it is canceled and replaced with the two swaps shown in the figure: one in which Member 1 pays fixed to the clearinghouse, acting in its capacity as a central counterparty (CCP), and one in which the CCP pays fixed to Member 2. Note that the CCP takes no cash flow risk or market. risk: the amounts received from Member 1 are simply passed to Member 2,. and the amounts received from Member 2 are simply passed to Member 1. In any case, each member now legally faces the CCP and posts collateral to the CCP. If either member defaults, the CCP manages the default and suffers losses. However, as discussed further presently, large losses might have to be covered by the broader membership. This backstopping of losses by the membership is represented in the figure as the light gray circles surrounding the swap cash flows. On the other hand, if the CCP defaults, Members 1 and 2 have recourse only to the CCP, not to each other..

FIGURE 13.6 Bilateral versus Cleared Swaps.  

The bottom section of Figure 13.6 illustrates a cleared swap between a member of the clearinghouse and a client of that member. The original swap between the two (not shown), as before, is transformed into two swaps, each facing the clearinghouse. And, as before, a default by the member is backstopped by the CCP and the broader membership. However, a default by the client, who is sponsored by Member 1 to face the CCP, is backstopped first by Member 1. This backstopping is represented in the figure by the dark gray circle around the cash flows of this swap. But if Member 1 defaults as well, then, as before, losses are backstopped by both the CCP and the broader membership. This fallback is represented in the figure by the light gray circle surrounding the darker one. While this section of the figure illustrates a trade between Member 1 and its client, the logic of this paragraph can be extended to other trading permutations: member trades are backstopped by the CCP and the broader membership, while client trades are backstopped first by the sponsoring member and then by the CCP and the broader membership..  

Relative to bilateral trading of IRS, clearing greatly simplifies operations.. Regardless of the number of positions and the history of who traded with. whom, at the end of each day, each counterparty to the CCP makes only one net payment to or receives one net payment from the CCP. Clearing also. greatly simplifies counterparty risk management in that each counterparty need be satisfied only with the creditworthiness of the CCP, although that creditworthiness - while extremely high - can be challenging to evaluate. precisely. While clearing confers significant and extensive advantages, these. come at some opportunity costs. Clearing nets positions within the same product class, but sacrifices netting across product classes. For example, a dealer who has IRS, repo, and credit default swap positions with one particular client might very well prefer to net the cash flows across those positions in-house instead of holding the IRS position against one CCP, the repo directly against the client, and the credit default swaps against a different CCP. The legal requirement to clear, however, outlaws this in-house netting option. Clearing also outsources margin methodologies and default management to the CCP, which, while advantageous to smaller counterparties, might not be optimal for those with broader operations.  

Risk management at a CCP subsumes many functions. First, the CCP must set criteria for admitting members and monitoring their creditworthiness over time. Second, the CCP must set margin requirements. As discussed. already, the amount of VM calls is conceptually straightforward, as they reflect changes in NPV. The appropriate amounts of IM, however, depend. on complex analyses of market volatility and liquidity conditions. Third, the CCP must establish procedures for default management and execute them. well as defaults occur. When a client of a member defaults, the sponsoring. member is responsible, and when a member defaults, the CCP is responsible. More specifically, the CCP must make VM STM payments to the non-defaulting sides of the swap and replace the defaulting swaps along the lines described earlier. Note that, while a dealer may decide to replace lost exposure with similar exposure, the business model of the CCP is not to take any market risk at all. The swap lost must ultimately be replaced with a swap of exactly the same terms. In any case, the CCP's first source of funds is the IM posted by the defaulting member, along the aforementioned lines. If that proves insufficient, however, the CCP gathers the necessary funds according to a prespecified default waterfall..  

Figure 13.7 illustrates a waterfall but is not drawn to the scale of the underlying resources. The first resource, just discussed, is the IM posted by the defaulting member. In addition to posting IM, however, members have to contribute to a default fund or guarantee fund, in proportion to the size of their positions against the CCP. One rule of thumb is that the total default fund should be large enough to withstand the simultaneous default of the two members with the largest positions. In any case, if the defaulter's IM is not sufficient to cover the CCP's losses, the defaulter's default fund contribution is tapped.17 If that is insufficient as well, capital contributed by the. CCP is tapped. Relative to the size of the total of all members default fund contributions, CCP capital is typically quite small. This buffer is sometimes referred to as the CCP skin-in-the-game, and its size is the subject of much debate. To oversimplify that debate, CCPs argue that, because almost all of the risk comes from member positions, almost all of the waterfall pro-. tections should come from members. Members, on the other hand, argue. that, because CCPs manage risk with the profits of their shareholders as an important consideration, they should contribute a significant buffer as well. In any case, if CCP capital is exhausted with losses still needing to be covered, the default fund from the surviving members is tapped. The waterfall to this point explains the sense in which the membership as a whole backstops member contracts. It is also the sense in which CCPs mutualize losses. Loose descriptions of clearing say that CCPs "eliminate" counterparty credit risk,. but that is not accurate. When a swap is cleared, its counterparty credit risk moves from the original counterparty to the CCP and its membership as a whole.

FIGURE 13.7 Example of a CCP Default Waterfall. Steps Are Not Drawn to Scale.  

With VM covering daily market moves, IM covering all but the largest of market moves between VM calls, and the default fund sized to withstand the default of the two members with the largest positions - who are almost certainly large and heavily regulated financial institutions themselves - only a record-breaking financial tsunami could generate losses that require stepping further down the waterfall. The next sources of funds, however, are as follows. Members agree to comply with certain assessments or call for funds should the waterfall get to this point. These assessments are called unfunded, because the CCP does not hold them in reserve, as it does IM and default fund contributions. While legally binding, there is always some concern that, in a crisis, assessments might not be honored promptly and in full. If assessments are insufficient to cover losses, then some fraction of VM. owed to market participants would not be paid, in a process known as VM. haircutting. After that, the sources of last recourse include voluntary contributions and other actions taken by members. If that proves insufficient, CCP ceases operations.  

This section concludes with a brief mention of three topical public policy issues. First, the shift to clearing the vast majority of IRS may or may not have significantly reduced systemic risk relative to various alternatives, but it has certainly concentrated that risk. Nearly all GBP-denominated IRS are cleared at the London Clearing House (LCH); the vast majority of USD-denominated IRS are cleared at LCH as well, with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) a distant second; the vast majority of EUR-denominated swaps are cleared at LCH, with the exception of the smaller but growing segment of STR swaps, in which Eurex has a growing market share; and clearing of JPY-denominated swaps is shared between LCH and the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC).18 From a systemic risk perspective, legislators and regulators seem to have followed the advice of Andrew Carnegie: "put all your eggs in one basket and then watch that basket."  

A second policy issue pertains to CCP margin. Margin, along with other risk management practices of a CCP, are designed to make it extremely. unlikely that any counterparty loses money from counterparty risk. Part. of this outcome, however, is due to the ability of CCPs to set IM and also to raise required IM when market volatility or financial stress increases. In this sense then, reducing counterparty risk increases liquidity risk. Many. are concerned with how increasing IM might exacerbate financial stress, known as margin procyclicality, but there are no easy solutions. Raising. margin in a crisis is an important risk management tool at a CCP but might make it challenging for members and other market participants both to meet their increasing obligations to the CCP and to continue meeting their. non-derivatives obligations.  

The third policy issue relates to CCP governance. Before clearing was required, market participants could consider clearing as one of several  

choices and could decide to clear or not to clear. With required clearing.   
and the concentration of clearing in very few CCPs, market participants,.   
including members, have much less leverage with respect to CCP risk.   
management and other practices. The resolution of this issue is also far from straightforward.
