# 13.2 IRS CASH FLOWS AND ANALYTICS  

Chapter 2 describes the cash flows and pricing of a SOFR swap, and Chapter 12 explains the difference between borrowing or lending at rolling overnight rates versus term rates. This section builds on those foundations.  

# Cash Flows of Ois versus Fixed-for-Floating Swaps  

Figure 13.1 illustrates the cash flows of a. $\$100$ million three-year. $1.64\%$ versus SOFR swap, which is an OIS, while Figure 13.2 illustrates the cash flows of a $\epsilon100$ million three-year $0.36\%$ versus six-month Euribor swap,. which is a fixed-for-floating swap. Both swaps settle on February 16, 2022, and both figures are from the perspective of the fixed receiver. The SOFR swap makes annual cash flows using the actual/360 convention on both its fixed and floating legs. Therefore, the fixed interest earned after each 365-day year, from February 16, 2022, to February 16, 2023, and from February 16, 2023, to February 16, 2024, is. $\$100,000,0000\times1.64\%\times365/360=$ $\$1,662$ , 778. Similarly, the fixed interest earned after the 366-day year from February 16, 2024, to February 16, 2025, is $\$100,000$ $000\times1.64\%\times$ $366/360=\$1,667,333.$ The floating cash flow of the SOFR swap over a. given year, as explained in Chapter 2, equals the daily-compounded interest earned on $\$100$ million at realized SOFR rates over that year. Because each year on this swap starts and ends on February 16, the relevant SOFR rates are those from and including February 16 of one year through February 15 of the next year. Furthermore, because SOFR on February 15 is not published until the morning of February 16 (see Chapter 12), swap counterparties are given until February 17 to make payments on both legs of the swap. This payment delay is indicated in the figure by the light vertical lines to the right of February 16 of each year and by floating payment arrows pointing slightly past February 16.

Fixed-for-floating swaps use realized term rates to determine floating-. rate payments. The payment frequency on the fixed leg of these swaps can be annual or semiannual, while the payment frequency on the floating leg usually matches the tenor of the index rate. Figure 13.2 illustrates the cash flows of a swap of a fixed rate of $0.36\%$ against six-month Euribor. The fixed side of this swap pays annually and follows the 30/360 convention.. Recalling that there are always $360~^{\circ}30/360$ days" in a year, the annual payment on the fixed leg is simply 100 million $\times0.36\%\times360/360$ , or 360,000. The floating side of the swap follows the actual/360 convention and pays semiannually to match the tenor of the floating-rate index, namely,. six-month Euribor. The rate used to determine each floating-rate payment is the Euribor setting two business days before the beginning of the payment. period.4 Because six-month Euribor on February 14, 2022, was. $-0.46\%$ and because there are 181 days between February 16 and August 16, 2022, the first floating-rate payment of the swap in Figure 13.2 is. $\in100,000,000$ $\times~(-0.46\%)\times181/360$ , or $-{\in}231,278$ . This means that the fixed receiver actually receives $\mathbf{\epsilon}231{,}278$ from the floating leg of the swap. Note that there is no payment delay in fixed-for-floating swaps, because the cash flows are known well in advance of each payment date.  

# Swap Valuation: More on the Floating Leg  

Chapter 2 explains the trick in valuing SOFR swaps, that is, adding a fic tional payment of the notional amount at maturity to both legs of the swap. This trick is so much a part of swap valuation that the terms "fixed leg" and "floating leg" typically include these fictional notional amounts. In any case,. the fixed leg of a swap now looks like a coupon bond, which makes periodic interest payments and a final "principal" payment and can be priced with the tools of the early chapters of this book. The floating leg of a swap now looks like a floating-rate bond. In terms of valuation, this means that the floating leg is worth par or notional amount on all reset dates..  

To elaborate on this last point, in the example of Figure 13.1, the floating leg is worth $\$100$ million on each February 16 of 2022, 2023, and 2024. Intuitively, because SOFR is the fair, risk-free market rate of interest, investors are willing to pay exactly. $\$100$ million at the beginning of. each annual period for a "floating-rate bond" that pays compounded SOFR interest at the end of each year. Between reset dates, the value of the floating leg of the swap equals the accrued value of its notional amount at the already realized SOFR rates. Say, for example, that SOFR over the first 100 days of the swap was $0.05\%$ , giving an accrued value of $\$100,000,000$ $(1+0.05\%/360)^{100}=\S100{,}013{,}85$ 0. From that point on, the floating leg. continues to accrue at the fair market rate, which is SOFR, and will be worth $\$100$ million, after interest is paid out, on February 16, 2023. Hence, after those 100 days, investors are willing to pay exactly. $\$100,013,890$ for the hypothetical floating-rate bond. To summarize, inclusive of the fictional notional amount, the floating leg of the SOFR swap is like a deposit that pays the fair market rate of interest. It accrues value until all interest earned is withdrawn (i.e., on reset dates), at which point its value falls back to the original deposited amount..  

Valuing the floating leg of the Euribor swap is somewhat different. Unlike. OIS, fixed-for-floating swaps determine floating-rate payment amounts at the beginning of each period. This does not affect valuations on reset dates - with. an important caveat given next - but does change valuations between reset. dates. To explain, turn again to the swap in Figure 13.2. The cash flow of the floating leg of the swap on February 16, 2025, is 100 million plus interest at six-month Euribor effective from August 16, 2024. But if Euribor is appropriate for discounting swap cash flows, then, by definition, the present value of that cash flow as of August 16, 2024, is $\epsilon{}100$ million. Now step. back to February 16, 2024. On August 16, 2024, the floating leg is worth 100 million, as just shown, plus interest at six-month Euribor effective from February 16, 2024. Once again, then, by definition, the present value of the floating leg as of February 16, 2024, is. $\epsilon100$ million. Proceeding backward along these lines shows that the floating leg is worth. $\epsilon{}100$ million on each reset date. Between reset dates, however, the value of the floating leg is the discounted value of 100 million plus the interest payment already. determined as of the previous reset date. In other words, the value of the. floating leg between reset dates equals the value of a zero coupon bond that matures on the next reset date, paying par plus the interest set on the previous reset date. Another difference between pricing SOFR and six-month Euribor swaps, however, is that six-month Euribor is not a risk-free rate:. as an interbank term rate, it includes a spread due to the credit risk of the banking sector. Therefore, discount factors and rates derived from Euribor swaps may not be appropriate for valuing the cash flows of these swaps. This point is ignored for the present but revisited in the last section of the chapter.  

# Net Present Value (Npv)  

At initiation of a swap, its value is zero. The fixed rate in the market at any moment, in fact, is such that the value of the fixed and floating legs are equal. or, equivalently, such that the initiation of the swap requires no exchange of. money upfront. As time passes, however, a swap increases in value to one counterparty and decreases to another. To illustrate, return to the three-year. SOFR swap in Figure 13.1. At initiation, it has a fixed rate of. $1.64\%$ , which sets the present value of both its fixed and floating legs to. $\$100$ million. Say that, one year later, just after the first interest payments on each leg of the swap, the fair two-year SOFR swap rate is $1\%$ . Because rates have declined, the present value of the remaining cash flows of the fixed leg of the. $1.64\%$ swap increases, say to $\$101,280,000$ . The value of the floating leg of the swap, on a reset date, is $\$100,000,000$ . Therefore, the NPV of the swap to the fixed receiver is $\$101,280,000$ minus $\$100,000,000$ , or $\$1,280,000$ . The fixed receiver of. $1.64\%$ is in-the-money on the now two-year swap, because traders initiating new two-year swaps are receiving only. $1\%$ . Conversely, the NPV of the swap to the fixed payer is $-\$1,280,000$ : the fixed payer of $1.64\%$ is out-of-the-money, because new traders are paying only. $1\%$  

With NPV defined, the text can mention gross market value, which is. defined as the sum of the absolute values or positive NPVs across swaps in a given market. Gross market value is sometimes used as a measure of exposure in a market but suffers from two weaknesses along these lines. First, positive and negative NPVs within counterparty pairs are added in absolute. value, rather than netted. Second, to the extent that margin is posted against NPV, gross market value can significantly overstate counterparty exposure..  

# DV01 of a Swap  

With the fixed leg conceptualized as a coupon bond, its Dv01 can be computed along the lines of Chapter 4, that is, by shifting the appropriate rate curve down by one basis point and revaluing. Because the value of the floating leg of a SOFR swap at any time equals its accrued value, no matter. how rates might move at that moment, its DV01 is zero. And because the value of the floating leg of a Euribor swap is equal to that of a bond paying interest and "principal"' and maturing at the next reset date, its Dv01 can. also be computed along the lines of Chapter 4. To clarify with some orders of magnitude, at a flat term structure of $2\%$ , the DV01 of the fixed leg of a $2\%$ 10-year swap is like that of a 10-year bond, or about 0.09; the DV01 of the floating leg of the SOFR swap is zero; and the DV01 of the floating leg of the fixed versus six-month Euribor swap is like that of a zero coupon. bond with six months to maturity, or about O.005. In the case of the Euribor swap, it could be said that the DV01 of receiving fixed is the DV01 of the. fixed leg minus the DV01 of the floating leg, or, in the numerical example,.  

$0.09-0.005=0.085$ . As argued in Chapter 5, however, bonds subject to different parts of the term structure are far from perfectly correlated. Therefore, the 10-year fixed leg and the essentially six-month floating leg should. be hedged separately, the former with other instruments having about 10 years to maturity, and the latter with other instruments having about. six months to maturity. Recall, by the way, that Section 5.5 discusses PV01 and partial $^{\ '}O1s$ , which specifically address the interest rate sensitivities of swap books.  

# Unwinding IRs Risk Positions  

Say that the counterparties of the three-year SOFR swap in Figure 13.1 are Counterparty A, who is receiving fixed, and Counterparty B, who is. paying fixed. Say further that Counterparty A decides to take off the inter-. est rate risk of the swap one year later, in the scenario described already,. in which the prevailing two-year SOFR swap rate is. $1\%$ and the NPV to Counterparty A of the existing swap is. $\$1,280,000$ There are typically three ways in which Counterparty A can proceed. First, Counterparty A can ask. Counterparty B to unwind the trade. Because the NPV is positive to Counterparty A, Counterparty B would pay Counterparty A that NPV and the two would then tear up the trade. An advantage of this approach is that the. trade really disappears, just like a particular bond or futures contract that is bought and subsequently sold. Unfortunately for Counterparty A, however, Counterparty B might want to keep the trade alive: this swap might. be part of a larger trading portfolio; paying the NPV immediately might entail funding costs; and the trade's removal might increase overall counterparty risk exposure to Counterparty A. Also, because only Counterparty B can unwind this particular trade, Counterparty B has negotiating lever-. age and might offer to pay less than the theoretically fair NPV. In any case, in practice, counterparties like Counterparty A find it difficult to unwind existing trades.  

A second way for Counterparty A to take off the interest rate risk of the swap with Counterparty B is to pay. $1.64\%$ for two years to another counterparty, receiving at initiation. $\$1,280,000$ as the NPV of paying $1.64\%$ in a $1\%$ rate environment. This trade would flatten the interest rate. risk of the existing swap: paying. $1.64\%$ to and receiving SOFR from this. new counterparty exactly offsets receiving. $1.64\%$ from and paying SOFR to Counterparty B. This approach has problems too, however. It may be difficult to find a counterparty who wants to receive $1.64\%$ on a two-year swap and is willing to pay some NPV to do so, when the market rate is $1\%$ Put another way, the most liquid two-year swap contracts have a fixed rate. equal to the prevailing market rate and are worth zero at initiation. Another problem with the approach is that the original swap does not disappear. Over the next two years, both the swap with Counterparty B and the swap.  

with the new counterparty coexist, and Counterparty A has to manage or bear the counterparty risk on both..  

The third way for Counterparty A to take off the interest rate risk of the swap, which is the most common in practice, is to pay $1.0\%$ on a new two-year swap, but adjust its notional amount so as to hedge the risk of the existing swap. In this example, with these two-year swaps differing only in the fixed rates, and those only by. $0.64\%$ , the adjustment will be extremely small. To illustrate the general point, therefore, say that Counterparty A was offsetting the risk of receiving fixed on an existing $\$100$ million 25-year swap, which has a DV01 of 0.196, by paying fixed on a new 30-year swap, which has a DV01 of 0.225. In that case, Counterparty A would pay fixed on $\$100$ million times $0.196/0.225$ , or on about $\$87.1$ million of the 30-year swap. The advantage of this approach is that, by choosing to trade the most liquid swap, Counterparty A can relatively easily obtain a competitive rate. The problems with the approach are that the two swaps are not quite risk offsetting, that is, the hedge might have to be adjusted over time, and that, as in the second approach, both the original swap and the new swap remain in existence with their respective counterparty risks..  

The practice of taking off swap interest rate risk not by unwinding. trades, but by initiating offsetting trades, gives rise to notional amounts that exaggerate interest rate risk, as described in the previous section, and to a heightening of operational complexities in the IRS market. Furthermore,. to the extent that net long positions are held against different counterparties than net short positions, counterparty risk must be managed or borne on both the long and short sides. The industry does mitigate the proliferation of trades by regular compression programs, which cancel trades across the system, accompanied by relatively minor cash payments, in a way that minimally changes the risk profiles of participating counterparties. The predominance of IRS clearing mitigates the counterparty risk implications of the proliferation of trades, as trades are transformed so that each counterparty faces the clearinghouse as its legal counterparty.  

A fundamental question is why the industry has not migrated to practices that better facilitate the unwinding of swaps. As explained in Chapter 14, the proliferation of credit default swaps was significantly reduced by meaningful standardization of contract coupon and maturity. Similarly standardized IRS do exist, in the form of Market Agreed Coupon (MAC) swaps, but volumes are low. Standardized swap futures are another possibility, and they do exist, but also trade in relatively limited volumes. One explanation for why the IRS market has not moved in these directions is that market participants actively want specific coupons and maturities. And there are hedging applications -- some discussed herein - in which customized swaps are preferable. A recent study, however, argued that between about $60\%$ and $80\%$ of IRS trading volume can be considered.  

standardized, which implies that significant volumes could be migrated to practices that reduce trade proliferation.5
