# 14.12 OPPORTUNISTIC CDS STRATEGIES  

In theory, CDS traders take the behavior of debt issuers as given, and debt issuers essentially ignore CDS trading on their obligations. In practice, however, because of the complexities of CDS contracts (e.g., specifying events of default; defining reference entities and deliverable obligations; setting rules for settlement auctions), both CDS traders and issuers have occasionally tried to profit from crossing the lines separating their respective markets. These instances have been called opportunistic CDS strategies.  

A particularly well-known example is the case of the real estate company, Hovnanian, and its "manufactured default." In February 2018, Hovnanian and an asset manager that had bought over $\$300$ million of protection on Hovnanian conducted the following transactions:  

1. The asset manager loaned Hovnanian a significant sum at below-market rates.   
2. Hovnanian conducted a bond exchange offer, in which it issued new, very long-term debt that would sell at a significant discount, given its relatively low credit rating; and in which some of its higher-priced outstanding bonds were purchased by one of its own subsidiaries.  

3. Hovnanian committed to skip the coupon payment on its bonds owned by that subsidiary. This default would not trigger cross-default provisions, but would trigger a credit event with respect to Hovnanian CDs.24  

Through these transactions, Hovnanian was able to borrow at advantageous rates, and the asset manager, if the credit event occurred, would benefit not only from the triggering of its long CDS position, but also from the issuance of the low-priced bond issue, which, because it was deliverable. into the CDS, would lower the CDS settlement auction price and increase. the payout to protection buyers. While Hovnanian did skip the coupon payment per its commitment, the company ultimately reversed course and paid before the end of the 30-day grace period. Pressure from regulators and from asset managers who had sold protection on Hovnanian, along with a settlement between the asset managers on both sides of the CDS, led to the abandonment of this manufactured default.  

The Hovnanian case threatened confidence in the integrity of the defi-. nition of "default" in the CDS market. In response, ISDA changed the defi-. nition of "failure to pay" to include the language, "it shall not constitute a. Failure to Pay if such failure does not directly or indirectly either result from,. or result in, a deterioration in the creditworthiness of financial condition of the Reference Entity."25  

While this change in definition is likely to eliminate some opportunistic CDS strategies, other possibilities remain. With respect to the buyers of CDS protection influencing default, consider the case of the telecommunications company, Windstream. In 2015, in the course of a restructuring,. the company seems to have violated an existing bond covenant. No one objected until 2017, however, when a hedge fund bought some of the bonds and sued to put the company into default. Many market participants believe that the hedge fund bought CDS protection on Windstream, bought the bonds, and then sued to collect on the CDS. And the hedge fund did prevail in court, despite other bondholders' willingness to waive the alleged covenant violation. In this case then, not only did the event of default not reflect underlying credit conditions, but CDS buyers also seem to have precipitated that default.26  

Opportunistic strategies seem also to have been pursued by sellers of CDS protection. In 2018, an asset manager, widely believed to have sold pro-. tection on the publishing company, McClatchy, made the following agree-. ment with the company. The asset manager would buy newly issued bonds. from a subsidiary of McClatchy, with the proceeds used to refinance (and extinguish) the existing bonds of McClatchy itself. Because outstanding CDS included McClatchy, but not its subsidiary, as reference entities, McClatchy CDS would be "orphaned" -- without any underlying debt, McClatchy could not possibly default. Furthermore, protection buyers would still have to. make premium payments. News of this agreement dramatically reduced the value of protection, generating profits for sellers of protection. As it turned. out, the proposed deal did not go through and, in early 2020, McClatchy. filed for bankruptcy. And, in the subsequent CDS auction, the final price was. two; that is, McClatchy CDS eventually paid 98 cents on the dollar.27  

As a final example of opportunistic CDS strategies, in this instance with the issuer as first mover, consider the case of Sears Holding Corp. At the. time of its bankruptcy, in late 2018, there was a lot of CDS outstanding not. on the holding company, but on its subsidiary, Sears Roebuck Acceptance Corp (SRAC). But relative to SRAC CDS, there was relatively little SRAC debt outstanding, perhaps about $\$200$ million. Therefore, CDS buyers were willing to pay a premium to buy SRAC debt: they could thus ensure having enough bonds to sell into the settlement auction, which, in turn, would keep the final auction price low and default compensation high. Recall that in the Europcar auction, with too few submitted limit sell orders, the final auction price was 100 and protection buyers received nothing. In any case, Sears realized that -- because of the CDS market - the market value of SRAC bonds far exceeded the expected discounted value of their cash flows and offered to sell a previously overlooked $\$900$ million of intercompany SRAC notes. CDS buyers were outbid in this sale, however, by CDS sellers - who wanted to prevent these SRAC bonds from being delivered into the settlement auction.. In the end, however, to stop the back-and-forth litigation, CDS buyers and. sellers came to a settlement on their own.  

There are several examples of opportunistic CDS strategies other than the ones described here, but at least two lessons emerge. First, market participants need to be aware of special situations that could cause final recovery to differ from expectations. Second, if opportunistic strategies were ever to dominate trading, many market participants might very well abandon the market, believing that it no longer offered straightforward transfers of credit risk.
