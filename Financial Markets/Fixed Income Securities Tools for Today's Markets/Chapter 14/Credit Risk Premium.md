# 14.4 CREDIT RISK PREMIUM  

If credit spreads, on average, just compensated for credit losses, then. risk-averse investors would just as soon buy safe government bonds at the same average return, but without the downside risk. For corporate debt to. be attractive, therefore, spreads must not only compensate for credit losses,. but also provide an additional credit risk premium. This section reviews some evidence that, on average, corporate bond spreads do, indeed, more. than compensate for credit losses.  

One study estimates that the average corporate yield spread over. default-free bonds in the United States from 1866 to 2008 was 153 basis points, while the average credit loss was only 75 basis points. This long-term evidence indicates a substantial credit risk premium, in that average spreads. are about twice average credit losses.10  

Another study, over the more recent period 2002-2015, also finds a significant credit risk premium. Defining the premium as credit spread minus expected losses, the second column of Table 14.8 reports the median ratio of premium to credit spread, and the third column reports the median ratio of premium to expected loss, by rating. To interpret these numbers, consider a Baa-rated bond at a spread of 200 basis points. At the premium to spread ratio of $76\%$ given in the second column, $76\%$ of 200 or 152 basis points are due to a risk premium, while only the remaining 48 basis points are compensation for expected losses. Expressed in terms of the third column of the table, these 152 basis points of credit risk premium are over three times the expected loss of 48 basis points. Over the sample period of this. study, bonds with Baa to B ratings are an investor sweet spot in the sense of. providing the highest premium for the amount of risk borne.11
