# 14.5 CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS  

In a single-name credit default swap (CDs), a protection buyer or CDS buyer pays a fee, premium, or coupon to a protection seller or CDS seller in exchange for a compensation payment in the event that an issuer defaults. Bonds and CDS together comprise the markets for trading credit risk..  

A CDS contract is defined by a reference entity, a list of credit events, a term or maturity, reference obligations, and a notional amount. As an example, consider a five-year CDS on a notional amount of $\$1$ million of Genworth Senior Unsecured 6.5s of 06/15/2034. A payment by the seller of this CDS would be triggered if, before its maturity, Genworth is determined by an industry-led determinations committee to have experienced a credit event, like a bankruptcy filing or a failure to pay outstanding obligations.12 In that scenario, the protection seller must make the protection buyer whole with respect to. $\$1$ million face amount of the underlying bonds..  

More specifically, through physical settlement of the contract, the protection buyer delivers $\$1$ million face amount of the bond to the protection seller in. exchange for $\$1$ million. Alternatively, through cash settlement of the con-. tract, if the price of the bond were determined to be, for example, $\$400,000$ the protection seller pays. $\$600,000$ to the protection buyer, again making the protection buyer whole on the $\$1$ million face amount. (The existence. of several reference obligations and the CDS delivery option, along with the auction mechanism by which protection sellers compensate protection buyers, is discussed presently.).  

In exchange for the compensation payment in the event of default, the protection buyer pays a quarterly premium until the earlier of the maturity of the CDS or the event of default, in addition to paying or receiving an upfront amount at the initiation of the contract. The details of the premium and the upfront amount are discussed herein. For now, however, note that the CDS spread refers to the actual or hypothetical annualized premium on a CDS with an upfront payment of zero. In other words, a protection buyer can be thought of as paying the CDS spread in exchange for compensation. in the event of default.  

Table 14.9 gives selected sovereign and corporate five-year CDS spreads. as of November 2021. For example, the cost of compensation for a credit event in Greece over the subsequent five years is 112.3 basis points or $1.123\%$ annually. (For sovereigns, which do not file for bankruptcy, credit. events include a moratorium on or a repudiation of debt obligations in addition to a failure to pay.) The CDS spread for Genworth, at 378.3 basis points, implies a cost of. $\$37,830$ per year to insure against a default of the $\$1$ million face amount of the 6.5s of 06/15/2034 mentioned already. The cost of insuring $\$1$ million face amount of bonds for five years ranges in the. table from a low of. $\$910$ per year for German government bonds to a high. of $\$62,450$ per year for the bonds of MBIA Insurance.

Whereas single-name CDS allow market participants to trade the credit of a single name, index CDS allow for the trading of broader credit portfolios. The five most popular index CDS are: CDX.NA.IG, which represents a portfolio of 125 single-name CDS on North American (NA), investment-grade (IG) names; CDX.NA.HY, on 100 single-name CDS on North American, high-yield (HY) names; iTraXX Europe Main, on 125 single-name CDS on European, investment-grade names; iTraXX Europe Crossover, on 50 single-name CDS on European, high-yield names; and iTraxx Europe Senior Financials, on senior debt of 25 names in that sector.. The detailed workings of CDS indexes are described in the London Whale case study presented later. Note that industry jargon is different for index than for single-name CDS. The buyer of index CDS receives the premium and pays compensation in the event of default - just like the buyer of a. portfolio of bonds - while the seller of index CDS pays the premium and receives compensation in the event of default -- just like the short seller of a portfolio of bonds.  

Figure 14.4 graphs historical CDS spreads for the 10-year iTraxx Europe Main and iTraxx Europe Crossover (XO) indexes. The cost of protection for the XO index spiked during the financial crisis of 2007-2009, during the height of the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011-2012, and at the. start of the pandemic and economic shutdowns in early 2020. (The behavior of CDX.NA.HY, not shown, was qualitatively similar, though it spiked to significantly higher levels during the financial crisis.) The fluctuations of the. iTraxx Europe Main have been comparatively modest, reaching 200 basis points during the sovereign debt crisis, but settling in recent years at about. 100 basis points.  

Figure 14.5 shows the slope of the term structure of CDS spreads for the. iTraxx Europe XO index, in particular, the difference between the 10- and three-year index CDS spreads. In normal times, the annual cost of protection is higher for 10 years than for three years, because greater possibilities of disruption arise in the more distant future. During the financial crisis and at the height of the European sovereign debt crisis, however, the cost of three-year protection was greater than or equal to the cost of 10-year protection. In particularly stressful financial times, near-term events are the most uncertain, after which -- at least for all surviving entities -- credit risk is likely to have returned to levels that prevail in calmer times..  

# Uses of CDS  

This introduction to CDS now turns to market participants. An often cited use case is a corporate bond investor hedging the default risk of a bond by buying CDS protection. This case does not really stand on its own, however, because an investor is likely to give up most if not all of the bond's credit spread by buying protection. Or, put another way, an investor not wanting to bear the credit risk of a particular bond can just sell that bond. Other use cases, therefore, are worth exploring.

As mentioned earlier and discussed presently, selling CDS protection very much resembles buying a bond: both the protection seller and the investor receive coupons over time and lose money in the event of a default. Many sellers of protection, therefore, choose to bear credit risk through  

CDS rather than bonds. One reason might be that the relatively few CDS contracts on a particular name (e.g., a five- and 10-year) are more liquid than that name's many outstanding bond issues. Similarly, selling protection. on an index might be a lot less costly than assembling a similarly diversified portfolio by buying individual corporate bonds. Even if an asset manager ultimately wants to hold the bonds, the fastest way to put on the position might be to sell protection and then, over time, buy the bonds and unwind the protection sold. A second reason to prefer selling protection over. buying bonds might be to isolate credit risk from interest rate risk. Many insurance companies, for example, engage in replication synthetic asset. transactions (RSATs), in which, for example, they buy government bonds of a maturity that suits their asset-liability management requirements and. then sell protection on a credit that they like for investment purposes. A third reason, also discussed in this chapter, is that selling protection allows an investor to take risk with relatively little capital, whereas buying a bond requires that cash be available or explicitly borrowed.  

Protection buyers, on the other hand, very much resemble short sellers: both pay coupons over time and win money in the event of a default. One reason to short corporate credit in CDS form is that it may be most efficient to do so, given the relatively significant trouble and expense of borrowing. corporate bonds to short them. A second reason, paralleling a discussion in the previous paragraph, is that an investor might want to sell a corporate. bond, but its liquidity would require a gradual, relatively slow unwind. In that case, if urgency is important, the best strategy might be to buy protec-. tion immediately in the more liquid CDS market, and then gradually sell the bond and unwind the purchased protection. A third reason to buy CDS protection is to hedge against risks that are not traded at all. For example, an entity doing business with Italian firms that have no publicly traded debt or related CDS might want to hedge against deteriorating credit conditions in that country by buying protection on Italian banks. This example has important consequences, as it implies that market participants might purchase protection on credits to which they have no direct exposure. And this, in turn, means that the amount of CDS outstanding on particular credits might exceed their outstanding debt. Back to the example, if many market participants want to hedge financial risk in Italy, the amount of CDS protection bought on Italian banks could exceed the amount of Italian bank debt outstanding.  

A recent study puts the global outstanding notional amount of CDS at $\$9.4$ trillion, split $62\%$ in index CDS and $38\%$ in single-name CDS. Notional amounts are misleading indicators of outstanding risk, however, for the same reasons that apply to interest rate swaps, which are discussed in Chapter. 13. Net notional outstanding then, from the same study, which nets each. entity's long and short positions, is only. $\$1.5$ trillion, with two-thirds of that. in index CDS and one-third in single-name CDS. CDX.NA.IG and iTraxx  

Europe account for about $70\%$ of traded index amounts, and the top five aforementioned CDS contracts account for more than $90\%$ of index activity. With respect to the single-name market, about 800 distinct names are referenced in each quarter of trading, but only about 550 of those names are referenced in every quarter. This implies that the single-name market consists of a core group of names that are traded consistently over time and other names that trade when interest is high in their particular credit situations.13
