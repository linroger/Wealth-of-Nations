# 15.3 ADJUSTABLE-RATE MORTGAGES  

While the overwhelming majority of mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are available as well. The distinguishing feature of an ARM is that the mortgage interest rate can vary over time, but the details of the loan contract can be relatively complex. To illustrate, consider one relatively common variety of ARMs, a 30-year 5/1 hybrid ARM with a 2/2/5 cap structure.  

The phrase "hybrid ARM" means that the mortgage rate is fixed for. some number of years before it begins to vary according to some set of rules. In a 5/1 hybrid ARM, for example, i) the mortgage rate is fixed. for the first five years; and ii) at the end of that time, and every one year thereafter, the mortgage rate is reset. The new mortgage rate at each reset. equals some rate benchmark, like the one-year rate on US Treasury bonds, plus a gross margin, which is set and fixed at the initiation of the mortgage..  

To put some numbers on this, say that the gross margin is. $2.75\%$ , the index is the one-year Treasury rate, and the one-year Treasury rate applied to the. reset is $0.25\%$ . In that case, the mortgage rate over the subsequent year is set to $3.00\%$ . The Treasury rate is typically observed with a lookback, perhaps 45 days, so that the borrower knows the applicable mortgage rate sometime before it goes into effect.  

Once the mortgage rate of an ARM is set, the monthly payments are calculated as in the case of a fixed-rate mortgage. To be more specific, consider the 30-year $5/1$ hybrid ARM example at the end of year five. Say that the outstanding balance is $\$80,000$ (computed based on the mortgage rate over the first five years) and that the mortgage rate is to be reset to $3\%$ The remaining maturity, of course, is 25 years. The mortgage payment is then computed such that the present value of that monthly payment over the next 25 years or 300 months equals $\$80,000$ . It is as if a new fixed-rate. mortgage for the outstanding balance and the remaining term is being offered at the new mortgage rate.  

The $2/2/5$ cap structure of the example limits the extent to which the. mortgage rate can change over the life of the ARM. The three numbers refer to the initial adjustment rate $c a p$ , the periodic adjustment rate $c a p$ , and the lifetime adjustment rate $c a p$ , respectively. The initial adjustment rate cap of $2\%$ says that the mortgage rate for the sixth year of the mortgage, set at the. end of year five, cannot increase or decrease the rate by more than $2\%$ (i.e., a rate of $3\%$ can neither rise above $5\%$ nor fall below $1\%$ ). The periodic adjustment rate cap of $2\%$ says that, at the end of any year, the rate cannot increase or decrease by more than $2\%$ . And the lifetime adjustment cap of $5\%$ says that, over the life of the mortgage, the rate cannot increase by more. than $5\%$ . Furthermore, the mortgage rate is typically constrained to remain. above the gross margin rate.  

ARMs typically offer lower initial interest rates than fixed-rate mortgages but expose homeowners to the risk that rates increase. The average loan size of ARMs is significantly higher than that of fixed-rate mortgages, perhaps because wealthier, larger borrowers have more tolerance for interest rate risk. In recent years, the volume of ARMs, as a percentage of all mortgages, has fallen to the single digits. Perhaps, with mortgage rates near historic lows, borrowers perceive the risk of higher rates as exceeding the potential benefit of lower rates. Also, ARMs are still held in some disrepute from the financial crisis of 2007-2009. In the years leading up to the crisis, many people were tempted to buy into the housing boom by the relatively low initial payments of ARMs, accentuated by teaser rates, a practice at the time of offering particularly low rates over the first year or two of the ARM. Many homebuyers overextended themselves through these products and faced default as the rates on their ARMs reset higher and the housing market collapsed.  

# 15.4PREPAYMENTS  

The prepayment option allows a homeowner to pay off or prepay a mortgage, in whole or in part, at any time, by paying the bank the outstanding balance. In the example of Table 15.4, the homeowner may pay the bank $\$80,089,43$ at the end of 10 years and has no further obligations under the mortgage. But if the mortgage rate has fallen over those 10 years, say to $3.50\%$ , then - using. $3.50\%$ instead of. $4.50\%$ in Equation (15.4) - the. present value of the remaining payments will have risen to $\$87,365.60$ Hence, in that scenario, the prepayment option is in-the-money: the homeowner may pay the bank. $\$80,089,43$ to extinguish a liability with a present value of $\$87,365.60$ . On the other hand, if the mortgage rate has stayed the same or risen above $4.50\%$ after those 10 years, then the present value of the mortgage liability will be less than $\$80,089,43$ , and the homeowner will. have no incentive to prepay..  

In practice, of course, most homeowners with mortgages do not have the cash to pay off an existing mortgage. They can take advantage of an in-the-money prepayment option, however, by refinancing an existing mortgage. Continuing with the example, the homeowner might borrow $\$80,089,43$ at the then-prevailing mortgage rate of. $3.50\%$ , and then use that cash to prepay the existing. $4.50\%$ mortgage. In that case, one way. to describe the savings to the homeowner is in terms of the reduction in monthly mortgage payments: using the math given earlier, the monthly payment on a 20-year $\$80,089,43$ mortgage at $3.50\%$ is $\$464.48$ , which is $\$423$ a month less than the $\$506.69$ on the existing mortgage. Note. that the homeowner is not constrained to refinance with the bank that extended the original mortgage. Another originator might have brought the refinancing opportunity to the attention of the homeowner and might be offering a lower rate or lower transaction costs.  

Refinancing activity is usually constrained by the value of the home. Assume, in the example, that the homeowner can economically borrow only $80\%$ of the value of the home; that is, the LTV has to be less than or equal to $80\%$ . In that case, the value of the home when the existing $\$100,000$ mortgage was extended had to have been greater or equal to $\$123,000$ and 10 years later, at the time of the. $\$80,089,43$ refinancing, has to be above $\$100,112$ . In fact, if the value of the home after 10 years is greater than that $\$100,112$ , the homeowner might do a cash-out refinancing, which means borrowing more money than the outstanding balance of the existing mortgage. In the example, if the home is still worth. $\$123,000$ at the time of the. refinancing, the homeowner could borrow. $\$100,000$ in the refinancing mort-. gage, pay off the existing mortgage with. $\$80,089,43$ , and take the residual $\$19,910.57$ in cash to be used for other purposes. Increasing leverage in this way can, of course, be dangerous. Rising property values in the run up to the financial crisis of 2007-2009 encouraged significant volumes of cash-out refinancings that left many homeowners with negative home equity when home values subsequently plummeted. In fact, in response to that experience, the GSEs currently do not accept cash-out refinancing loans with LTVs greater than $80\%$  

When interest rates are low, refinancings can generate significant mortgage volumes. Over the most recent period of falling rates, refinancings as a percentage of residential mortgage originations increased from $33\%$ in 2018, to $46\%$ in 2019, and to $65\%$ in the first half of 2020.7  

Homeowners sometimes exercise prepayment options with curtailments,. but these are not nearly so significant as refinancings. These prepayments take. place mostly when homeowners pay off very old, low-balance mortgages,. simply to own a home free and clear of debt. Financial considerations, like the existing mortgage rates relative to market mortgage rates become secondary,. lost in the excitement of literal or figurative mortgage-burning parties.  

Prepayments occur for other reasons as well, most notably turnover and defaults. Turnover refers to the ongoing economic activity of selling and buying homes. Turnover generates prepayments, because homes, which are the collateral for mortgages, cannot be sold until the mortgages are paid off. Disasters that destroy homes also generate turnover prepayments, because mortgages become due in those situations as well.  

Defaults refer to cases in which homeowners fail to make contractual mortgage payments. In these cases, for mortgages packaged into MBS, interest and principal are advanced by the servicer and ultimately paid by the. insurer. Hence, from the perspective of mortgage investors, defaults are eco-. nomically equivalent to early payments of principal, rather than as losses to. principal invested.
