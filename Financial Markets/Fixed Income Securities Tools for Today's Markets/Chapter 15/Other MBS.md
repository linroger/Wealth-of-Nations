# 15.11 OTHER MBS  

This section briefly describes MBS other than individual pools. As mentioned earlier, because pass-through securities are relatively large, diversified, and insured portfolios of mortgages, they are owned by a broader investor base and trade with more liquidity than individual mortgages. Taking this another step, the agencies combine pools into larger MBS, to create even more diversified and, if successful, more liquid securities. These conglomerated MBS with FNMA collateral are called Megas; with FHLMC collateral, Giants; and with collateral from both agencies, Supers.  

Another type of MBS of significant size are REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits) or CMOs (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations). While pass-through MBS have proved popular with many investors, others are less comfortable with prepayment risk, that is, with securities whose duration can fluctuate widely, as illustrated in Figure 15.6. Some CMO and REMIC classes or tranches address this problem. SEQs (sequential pay classes), for example, are structured as follows. The cash flows from an underlying portfolio of pools are passed through to a number of distinct SEQ classes. All classes receive monthly interest payments, but principal payments from the underlying pools are directed first to pay off the A class. Once the principal amount of the A class is fully paid off, principal payments from the pools are directed to the B class, and so forth. While SEQ classes still bear significant prepayment risk, their effective maturities can be bucketed with somewhat more granularity than standard pass-through MBS.  

PACs, or planned amortization classes, are further along in the spec-. trum of creating more complicated structures so as to create some securities with less prepayment risk. Once again, the cash flows of an underlying. portfolio of pools are divided across a number of classes. PAC classes, how-. ever, promise fixed schedules of principal payments so long as prepayment rates stay within set ranges. Making this possible are support or companion classes that absorb prepayment fluctuations within these ranges. If prepay-. ments are relatively fast, then the support classes get paid principal quickly, enabling the PAC classes to maintain their fixed payment schedule. Con-. versely, if prepayments are relatively slow, the support classes absorb the.  

shock by being paid principal particularly slowly. If prepayment rates move outside the set ranges, however, the PAC bonds will experience faster or slower principal payments as well. Similar to PACs are TACs (targeted amortization classes), which protect only against faster prepayments, and which are usually included in structures that include PACs as well. The issuance of CMOs offering PACs and TACs is viable, because their classes can be sold for more than the underlying pools. In other words, some investors are willing to pay up enough for MBS with prepayment protection so as to more than compensate the investors who buy and take on the amplified risks of the support classes.  

Interest-only (IO) and principal-only (PO) strips are another wellknown set of MBS products. The cash flows of an underlying portfolio of pools are directed into these two classes by a simple rule: all interest payments are paid to the IOs and all principal payments to the POs. The price sensitivities of these strips are larger than many other fixed income products. As rates fall and prepayments increase, the cash flows of the IOs begin to vanish. This loss of value more than offsets any gains from higher discount factors on remaining cash flows, and IO prices decline. Hence IOs, like mortgage servicing rights, have negative durations at low levels. of rates. Conversely, POs gain dramatically in value as rates decline. They have the relatively high interest rate sensitivity of zero coupon bonds, with the added effect of early repayment of principal when rates are low..
