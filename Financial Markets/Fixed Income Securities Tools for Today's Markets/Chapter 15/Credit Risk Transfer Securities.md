# 15.12 CREDIT RISK TRANSFER SECURITIES  

One reform following the 2008 government rescue of the GSEs was to have the GSEs sell some of the mortgage default risk from their MBS guarantees to the private sector. To this end, GSEs started to offer credit risk transfer (CRT) securities to the public in 2013, called Connecticut Avenue Securities (CAS) at FNMA and Structural Agency Credit Risk (STACR) securities at FHLMC.17 The basic idea is that investors buy bonds at par; earn a spread over a short-term rate; and, in exchange for that spread, bear some of the default risk on a reference pool of mortgages. More specifically, as defaults on that pool reach certain thresholds, investors lose some or even all of the principal on their bonds. A somewhat simplified explanation of how CRTs work is presented in this section, with reference to a recent offering, CAS 2020-R01, summarized in Table 15.8. The notes actually offered to the public through CAS 2020-R01 are highlighted in bold, namely, the M1, M2, and

B1 classes. The A and B2 classes, along with the M1, M2, and B1 amounts.   
in the FNMA column, are fictional: they are included in the description of.   
CRTs only to explain how the cash flows of the actual notes are determined.  

The first step in creating a CRT is to select a group of mortgage loans. for inclusion in the reference pool. All candidate loans are conforming but are further scrutinized to exclude those with "underwriting defects" and "performance deficiencies." This screening is one of several ways the GSEs seek to assure CRT investors that they are taking representative mortgage. default risk, rather than default risk of a particularly weak group of loans. In any case, the reference pool chosen for CAS 2020-R01, at the time of issue, had over 100,000 loans and a total balance of about. $\$29$ billion.  

At issuance, investors buy a total of. $\$1.033$ billion principal amount of notes at par, $\$303$ million in the M1 class, $\$523$ million in the M2 class, and $\$207$ million in the B1 class. The proceeds from this sale are deposited into a. trust that earns enough to pay investors a short-term rate on their principal,. here one-month LIBOR. In addition, the GSE commits to contribute some of the $^{\mathrm{g}}$ -fees it earns to pay the CRT investors a spread over that short-term. rate, in particular, 80, 205, and 325 basis points on the M1, M2, and B1 classes, respectively. In exchange for that spread, the investors bear some of the default risk of the reference pool of mortgages, in a manner to be. described presently.  

The return of principal to CRT noteholders depends on the principal cash flows of the reference pool. It is important to emphasize, however, that cash flows from the reference pool do not, in any sense, flow to CRT investors. The owner of each loan in the reference pool, whether a GSE or some MBS investor, receives all of the interest and principal cash flows from that loan. The interest and principal paid to CRT investors comes from the CRT trust, with the interest supplemented by the GSE contributions mentioned in the previous paragraph..  

As the reference pool makes voluntary principal payments (i.e., sched-. uled principal payments and prepayments that are not due to default), principal is returned to the CRT notes. The A or senior class receives principal in proportion to its outstanding balance relative to the remaining balance of the reference pool. At issuance, for example, the A class is. $\$27,851/\$28,996$ or about $96\%$ of the outstanding reference-pool balance. Therefore, the A class is allocated $96\%$ of the voluntary principal payments from the reference pool. Of course, as mentioned earlier, the A class does not really exist, and is just used for calculating cash flows due to the actual notes. But, along. those lines, the principal balance of the A class is reduced by these fictional returns of principal. The remainder of principal payments from the reference pool, or about $4\%$ at the time of issuance, is allocated to the M1, M2, B1,. and B2 or subordinate classes, in order of seniority. This means that, so long. as the M1 class has an outstanding principal balance, all of the principal payments to the subordinate classes are allocated to M1. When the M1 notes are completely paid off, these principal payments are allocated to M2 and so on. Note that the principal payments to the M1, M2, and B1 classes are real. The calculation of the payments are as described, based on the principal payments of the reference pool, but the payments themselves come from the CRT trust into which the original sale proceeds were deposited.  

The text now turns to the crux of the structure, namely, the allocation of default losses in the reference pool to CRT note investors. Once again, to assure CRT investors, the issuing agency holds the first-loss tranche, which, for CAS 2020-R01, is the fictional B2 class. According to Table 15.8, FNMA held $\$58$ million of this class, which is assigned losses starting from a credit support of $0\%$ to a total thickness of $0.20\%$ of the original. $\$28.996$ billion reference-pool balance, which is also. $\$58$ million.18 if the reference pool suffers $\$1$ million of losses, the principal of the B2 class falls from its original $\$58$ million to $\$57$ million. If the pool experiences another. $\$5$ million of losses, another $\$5$ million of B2 principal is written down, to. $\$52$ million, and so forth. If cumulative losses ever reach. $\$58$ million, the B2 class is. written down to zero.19  

If losses are large enough to burn through the first-loss tranche, the real CRT investors start to lose principal. According to Table 15.8, the original principal of the B1 class was $\$218$ million, of which. $95\%$ or $\$207$ million was held by private investors, and $5\%$ or $\$11$ million was assigned to.  

FNMA. FNMA holds $5\%$ of the B1 class, as well as $5\%$ of the M1 and M2 classes, as "skin-in-the-game," to assure investors of each class that their interests and FNMAs are aligned. These $5\%$ holdings of each class are examples of vertical slices, because they are treated just as investor holdings in the same class. Horizontal slices, by contrast, are treated better or worse than other classes, like the B2 and A classes.  

With credit support of $0.2\%$ , B1 does not suffer any principal write-downs until reference-pool losses exceed $0.2\%$ or $\$58$ million, or, equivalently, until the B2 class has been wiped out. Any further losses, however, are for the most part borne by B1 noteholders. If the reference pool experiences $\$1$ million of losses beyond $\$58$ million, $95\%$ of those losses or $\$950,000$ result in a write-down of B1 principal from the original $\$207$ million to $\$206,050,000$ , and $5\%$ or $\$50,000$ of those losses result in a write-down of FNMA's fictional B1 principal from $\$11$ million to $\$10,950,000$ . Operationally, the CRT trust sends $\$950,000$ to FNMA, which uses those funds either to compensate MBS investors, or, if the loans are held in its own portfolio, to avoid suffering losses on its own account.  

The B1 class is wiped out itself if losses beyond. $\$58$ million equal the. class thickness of $0.75\%$ of the original reference pool, that is,. $0.75\%$ times $\$28.996$ billion, or $\$218$ million. In that case, further losses hit first the M2. and then the M1 classes, in the same way as just described for the more junior classes. All in all, FNMA's B2 class bears the first. $0.2\%$ of losses; the B1, M2, and M1 classes bear the next $3.75\%$ of losses, with $\$1.033$ billion borne by private investors and. $\$55$ million by FNMA; and any further losses are retained by FNMA. With long-term, historical losses rarely exceeding. $4.00\%$ , this structure, which resembles that of most other CRTs, is designed. to protect FNMA against losses other than those from its first-loss class and its skin-in-the-game vertical slices.  

Finally, circle back to the relative ratings and spreads of the various. CRT classes in Table 15.8. The more junior the class, the more exposed the principal to loss, the lower the rating, and the higher the spread. CRTs are bought mostly by money managers and hedge funds, with money managers. favoring the more senior and hedge funds the more junior classes. Across some recent issues, about $80\%$ to $95\%$ of M1 classes were bought by money managers, and between about $60\%$ and $75\%$ of B2 classes were bought by hedge funds.20  

The pandemic and economic shutdowns starting in 2020, bringing. heightened concerns about homeowner defaults and the effects of forbearance programs, have challenged the CRT market. Both GSEs, in fact,. stopped issuance for a time, but FHLMC re-entered the market in summer 2020, as did FNMA in the last quarter of 2021.  

# Fixed Income Options  

This chapter describes some of the more common fixed income options, namely: callable bonds, which have embedded options; Euribor futures options, which are futures-style options; bond futures options, which are equity-style options; caps and floors; and swaptions. The reader is assumed to have some familiarity with the basics of options and options pricing. Also, with the transition to LIBOR replacements still in process at the time of this writing, caps and floors and swaptions are presented in terms of LIBOR.  

While fixed income options are sometimes priced using term structure. models, along the lines of Chapters 7 through 9, this chapter focuses on. pricing with variations of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing. model. This simpler approach is often used by practitioners when the objec-. tive is not to determine which options among many are relatively cheap or rich, but rather to interpolate the prices of some options from the prices of similar, but more liquid options, and to calculate usefully accurate deltas or hedge ratios. An extensive appendix justifies the use of BSM in each case. with mathematically simplified versions of modern asset pricing techniques.
