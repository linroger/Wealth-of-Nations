# 15.8 TBA AND SPECIFIED POOLS MARKETS  

The vast majority of secondary trading of pass-through securities takes place in the very liquid TBA market, while the rest takes place in the less liquid specified pools market. The TBA market is a forward market in securitized mortgage pools, in which the seller has a delivery option. Table 15.6 shows a snapshot of TBA prices for UMBS 30-year pools from late December 2021. The rows correspond to different delivery months, the columns correspond to different mortgage pool coupons, and the entries give the corresponding forward prices. Most of the liquidity in the TBA market is concentrated in a few coupons, although a fuller stack of coupons do trade. Most of the liquidity is also in the front or first contract and the second contract, but later delivery months trade as well. The front contract with the greatest price less than par is called the current contract. The current coupon, or current coupon rate, which is often quoted as a description of the prevailing mortgage rate, is defined as the coupon that would give a TBA contract priced at par, calculated by interpolating the coupon of the current contract and the coupon of the front-month contract with a price just above par. From Table 15.6, the current contract is the January $2.0\%$ TBA, and the current coupon, calculated from the coupons and prices of the January $2.0\%$ and January $2.5\%$ TBAs, is about $2.11\%$  

A seller of $\$1$ million face amount of the January UMBS 30-year $2.5\%$ TBA commits to sell $\$1$ million principal amount of a 30-year. $2.5\%$ UMBS pool (i.e., one issued by FNMA or FHLMC) at 101-28 for settlement or delivery in January 2022. The TBA buyer commits to buy the pool delivered. by the seller. The exact settlement date is published well in advance, and is always in the stated delivery month, but varies over time and by product.12. With respect to Table 15.6, the settlement dates for the three months are January 13, 2022, February 14, 2022, and March 14, 2022..  

TABLE 15.6 Bid Prices for UMBS 30-Year TBAs as of December 30, 2021.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Coupon</td><td>1.5 %</td><td>2.0%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Jan</td><td>96-13</td><td>99-15+</td><td>101-28</td><td>103-13</td></tr><tr><td>Feb</td><td>96-08</td><td>99-08+</td><td>101-20</td><td>103-08+</td></tr><tr><td>Mar</td><td>96-03</td><td>99-02</td><td>101-12+</td><td>103-03+</td></tr></table></body></html>

Prices are given as a handle and a number of ticks or 32nds; for example, $101{-}12+$ is a price of $101+12.5/32$ , or 101.390625.  

The seller of a TBA has a delivery option in the sense of being able to. deliver any pool that falls within the general parameters just described.13. For this purpose, a "30-year" pool is defined as one with a remaining maturity of between 15 years and one month to 30 years and one month. The. name TBA is an acronym for to be announced, and comes from the seller's. option to choose the pool to be delivered after the trade date. More specif-. ically, the seller must notify the buyer of the exact pool to be delivered on. the notification date or 48-hour day, which is two business days before the settlement date. For the contracts in the table, the notification dates are January 11, 2022, February 10, 2022, and March 10, 2022. Note, by the way, that market practitioners always say TBA, never to be announced..  

Chapters 11 and 14 describe how the pricing of Treasury note and bond futures and of credit default swaps (CDS) reflect seller choices to deliver the least valuable or "cheapest-to-deliver" (CTD) securities. Similarly, TBA prices reflect seller choices to deliver the least valuable eligible mortgage. pools, which are typically those that refinance with the greatest speed and. least predictability. The analogy to Treasury futures and CDS is not perfect, however. There is typically one security that is clearly CTD into a Treasury futures or CDS contract, while many mortgage pools might be delivered into a TBA. In fact, an important part of trading in this market is forecasting the. pools likely to be delivered into TBAs given the supply and characteristics of deliverable pools outstanding. In the case of the January. $2.5\%$ TBA, for example, one dealer forecasts the delivery of pools with a WAC of $3.35\%$ , a WALA of three months, and an average loan size of. $\$340,000$ . While much. analysis is needed to explain the precision of this prediction, it makes sense that pools with these characteristics have less value than other 30-year. $2.5\%$ pools: higher WACs typically prepay faster (with the credit score caveat mentioned previously); relatively new pools typically prepay faster and have more prepayment uncertainty than seasoned, somewhat burned-out pools; and pools with high average loan balances prepay faster as well. (Note that an average loan balance of $\$340,000$ is large relative to the averages presented in Table 15.3.)  

The other secondary market for pass-through trading is the specified. pools market. Because the least valuable pools are delivered into TBAs, which is reflected in TBA prices, sellers with more valuable collateral, along. with buyers wanting more valuable collateral, prefer to trade particular or specified pools. Prices of pools traded in this market are quoted as a pay-up. relative to the comparable TBA. Table 15.7 shows a sample of pay-ups for UMBS 30-year specified pools as of December 2021. The first four rows are pools with loan balances in particular ranges. Pools with a coupon of $2.5\%$ and average loan balances between $\$123,000$ and $\$150,000$ , for example, sell at a pay-up of 37 ticks, that is, for $37/32$ or 1.15625 over the price of the UMBS 30-year $2.5\%$ front contract TBA. The pay-ups in each of the three coupon columns decrease with average loan balance, consistent with the empirical regularity that pools with higher loan balances refinance faster. That pools with average loan balances between $\$200,000$ and $\$250,000$ command a pay-up reflects the expectation, mentioned in the previous paragraph, that CTD pools have an even larger average loan balance of $\$340,000$ . For any given balance range, the pay-up increases with coupon: relatively low loan balances and slower refinancing speeds are more valuable the higher the coupon, that is, the greater the incentive to prepay and the greater the loss in value to investors as a result of refinancings.  

TABLE 15.7 Representative Pay-ups for Selected Specific UMBS 30-Year Pools, in Ticks (32nds), as of December 2021..   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Specified Pool</td><td colspan="3">Coupon</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>2.0%</td><td>2.5%</td><td>3.0%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Average Loan Balance</td></tr><tr><td>Less than $85,000</td><td>36</td><td>58</td><td>109</td></tr><tr><td>Between $85,000 and $110,000</td><td>31</td><td>49</td><td>88</td></tr><tr><td>Between $125,000 and $150,000</td><td>23</td><td>37</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Between $200,000 and $225,000</td><td>10</td><td>16</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>100% NY Loans</td><td>9</td><td>28</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>100% Investor Property</td><td>3</td><td>14</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Jumbo</td><td>-14</td><td>-18</td><td>-38</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The next row of Table 15.7 gives the pay-ups for pools made up of loans. in New York State, which, as mentioned earlier, refinance slowly relative to loans in other states. And, once again, those lower refinancing speeds are. worth more the greater the coupon. The next row is for pools composed of loans for investor property. As discussed already, investor properties face. higher refinancing rates, and, therefore, refinance more slowly, resulting in positive pay-ups that increase with coupon..  

The last row of the table gives pay-ups for pools containing jumbo loans,. that is, loans of size greater than agency conforming limits. This row differs. from others in that jumbo pools are not deliverable into TBAs. In any case,. jumbo pools trade at a negative pay-up, that is, at lower prices than TBAs,. because these extremely large loans are expected to prepay faster than any conforming pool delivered into TBAs..  

Table 15.7 gives only a sample of specified pools. Other specified pools, with other defining characteristics, trade as well, like low FICO loans, high  

SATO loans, and loans serviced by certain banks. As for this last category,. certain origination channels and servicing arrangements are more aggressive than others in encouraging homeowners to refinance. As a result, a pool of loans in less aggressive settings, like those serviced by certain banks, are. expected to prepay more slowly and, therefore, command a pay-up in the. specified pools market.
