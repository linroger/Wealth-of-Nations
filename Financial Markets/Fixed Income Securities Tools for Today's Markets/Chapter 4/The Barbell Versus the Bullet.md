# 4.8 THE BARBELL VERSUS THE BULLET  

This section presents a stylized example of asset-liability management for defined-benefit pension liabilities; applies the concepts of duration and convexity to hedging in this context, and explains how a choice arises between barbell and bullet asset portfolios, or, more generally, across asset portfolios with different convexities.  

Figure 4.10 shows the liabilities of a stylized defined-benefit pension. plan. Each black dot represents the total expected payment of the fund to. retirees over a six-month period. The first total payment, in six months, is $\$2$ million. Subsequent total payments increase, as more existing employ-. ees retire and become eligible for benefits, reaching a peak of. $\$4$ million in 10 years. From then on, deaths of retirees gradually reduce total payments,. which fall to zero in 60 years. The gray dots represent the present value of each total payment, where liabilities are discounted at the HQM curve as of mid-May 2021.  

The total present value of the liabilities in the figure is about $\$140\mathrm{mil}$ lion. For simplicity, assume that this pension fund is fully funded, so that the pension fund has $\$140$ million cash on hand. The asset-liability management problem of the fund, therefore, is to invest the $\$140$ million so as to be able to make good on pension liabilities over time, or even to earn some excess over those liabilities. Since discounting is done at the HQM corporate curve,. the pension fund would break even by realizing investment returns equal to HQM rates. If the pension fund earned lower rates, likely, for example, if it were to invest in Treasuries, then there would not be enough cash available over the 60-year horizon to meet all of the pension obligations. And if the pension earned higher rates, perhaps by investing in stocks, then it would have more than enough to fulfill its pension obligations. In this case, however, there would be a significant risk that stocks perform relatively poorly over the period and leave the pension without enough funds to meet its obligations.

FIGURE 4.10 Liabilities of a Stylized Defined-Benefit Pension Fund. Present Values Are Computed by Discounting at the HQM Curve, as of May 2021.  

Because many pension funds make future payment commitments in. line with returns on corporate bonds, the considerations in the previous. paragraph lead many funds to invest a significant portion of their funds in corporate bonds. For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that all of the $\$140$ million of pension assets are invested in corporate bonds.. More specifically, it is assumed that the pension fund can invest in one or two of the Johnson $\&$ Johnson (JNJ) bonds listed in Table 4.6. As mentioned in Chapter 3, all of these bonds were issued by JNJ in August. 2020. For expository purposes, these bonds are referred to by their original. terms, which are not that different from their terms as of mid-May 2021. For example, the 0.55s of $09/1/2025$ are called the five-year bonds, while the 2.45s of 09/1/2060 are called the 40-year bonds. The durations and convexities in the table are all yield-based metrics.  

The duration and convexity of the pension liabilities, computed by a. parallel shift in the HQM par rate curve, are 16.66 and 211.37, respectively.. To hedge against the risk that rates fall, which would increase the present. value of the liabilities, the pension fund decides to invest in an asset portfolio. with a duration of 16.66, the duration of the liabilities. But in which of the JNJ bonds should the fund invest?  

Perhaps the most straightforward answer is to invest in the 20-year. bonds, which have a duration of 15.56. With its assets invested in this bond, the fund would have an asset duration equal to that of the bond, 15.56, and a liability duration, given already, of 16.66. Were rates to fall by 100 basis points, then, along the lines of previous sections, assets would increase in value by approximately $15.56\%$ and liabilities by approximately $16.66\%$ The result is close to hedged, but not quite. On the initial portfolio value of $\$140$ million, the present value of the liabilities would then exceed the. value of the assets by. $(16.66\%-15.56\%)\times\mathbb{\mathbb{S}}140$ million, or $1.1\%$ of value, or $\$1,540,000$

To clean up that hedge, the pension fund might use cash. Denote the. amount held in cash by. $M$ , so that the fund's remaining funds,. $\$140-M$ are invested in the 20-year bond. Then, as mentioned in Section 4.4, the duration of this portfolio is the weighted average of its component durations. Note, too, that the duration of cash equals zero: its present value always equals its amount, no matter how rates change. Therefore, setting the duration of this asset portfolio equal to the duration of the liabilities,.  

$$
{\frac{M}{140}}\times0+{\frac{140-M}{140}}\times15.56=16.66
$$  

Solving,e $M=-9.90$ , meaning that the pension fund would borrow $\$9.90$ million, or about. $7\%$ of the. $\$140$ million, and invest $\$140-(-9.90)=$ $\$149.90$ or about $107\%$ in the 20-year bond.  

The asset portfolio just described hedges the duration risk of the liabilities. But how does the convexity of the asset portfolio compare with the convexity of the liabilities? As mentioned in Section 4.5, the convexity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the convexity of its components. Here, with the convexity of cash equal to zero and the convexity of the 20-year bond equal to 141.49, the convexity of the asset portfolio is,  

$$
{\frac{-9.90}{140}}\times0+{\frac{149.90}{140}}\times141.49=151.50
$$  

which is less than the convexity of the liabilities, given earlier as 211.37. Hence, this asset portfolio results in the pension fund having an overall negatively convex position. Figure 4.11 graphs the. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of this asset portfolio and of the liabilities, where the P&L of the bond is calculated as a shift in its yield, and the. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the liabilities by parallel shifts in the HQM par. rate curve. As rates fall, the values of both the liabilities and the asset port-. folio increase, as envisioned by the duration hedge. Because of the duration. hedge, in fact, the values of both increase by about the same amount for rela-. tively small rate changes. But because the liabilities have a higher convexity,. the duration of the liabilities increases more as rates decline. Therefore, for large declines in rates, the increase in value of the liabilities is greater than the increase in value of the assets, which leaves the pension fund with a net loss in value.

The $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the Liabilities Is Computed Under a Parallel Shift of HQM Par Rates. The P&L of the Bond Is Computed by a Shift in Its Yield.  

As rates increase, the values of both the liabilities and the asset portfolio. fall, again as envisioned by the duration hedge. But because the liabilities. have a higher convexity, the duration of the liabilities falls more as rates. increase. Therefore, for large increases in rates, the fall in the value of the liabilities is less than the fall in value of the assets, which, again, leaves the. pension fund with a net loss in value..  

The pension fund could manage this negative convexity by adjusting its hedge as rates change. As rates fall, and the duration of the liabilities increases more than the duration of the assets, the fund could increase its asset duration by borrowing more cash and buying more bonds. As rates rise, and the duration of the liabilities falls more than that of the assets, the fund could lower its asset duration by selling bonds and paying off some of its borrowing. This solution is fine in theory and sometimes in practice, but it is costly in the sense of requiring potentially frequent portfolio rebalancing.  

Another approach is to find an asset portfolio that not only matches the duration of the liabilities, but that also has a convexity equal to or greater. than that of the liabilities. There are, of course, many such portfolios that. can be formed from cash and the JNJ bonds listed in Table 4.6. For discussion purposes, Table 4.7 lists the portfolio already discussed, along with two additional, two-asset portfolios.

Each row gives the two assets in the portfolio; the proportion of value in each asset; the weighted-average yield of the portfolio, with weights equal to the proportions of value; the duration of the portfolio; and the convexity of. the portfolio. The weighted-average yield of the portfolio is far from a perfect. measure of ex-ante portfolio return, but will serve for the purposes of this. section. Cash, consistent with market levels at the time, is assumed to have a yield of $0.05\%$ . Portfolio duration and convexity equals the weighted average of the duration and convexity of the components, as explained earlier in the chapter.  

The first row of the table corresponds to the asset portfolio already analyzed. Its duration equals 16.66, which equals the duration of the liabilities, but its convexity is significantly less than 211, the convexity of the liabilities. The second row gives a portfolio invested in the five-year and 30-year bonds,. with the proportions such that the duration of the asset portfolio matches that of the liabilities. The convexity of the portfolio is 205.47, which is quite close to the 211.37 convexity of the liabilities. The third row gives an asset. portfolio that once again matches the duration of the portfolio, this time by investing much more in cash and the residual in the 40-year bond. This portfolio has a convexity of 271.84, which exceeds that of the liabilities.  

The relative convexities of the asset portfolios in Table 4.7 illustrate the following general principle: among portfolios with the same duration, the more spread out the cash flows of a portfolio, the greater its convexity. All portfolios in the table are constructed to have the same duration, but the first portfolio is essentially all in the 20-year bond. In the asset-liability management context, this portfolio is called a bullet portfolio: the liability. cash flows, which are spread over many years, are being hedged by a single bond with matching duration. The second asset portfolio in the table is split. between five-year and 30-year bonds, while the third is split between cash -- essentially a zero-year bond - and 40-year bonds. These two portfolio are. called barbell portfolios, because they are hedging liabilities using one bond. with less duration than the liabilities and one bond with more.  

Matched-duration portfolios with cash flows that are more spread out have greater convexities because, as explained earlier, duration is roughly linear in term, while convexity is quadratic. Consider a 10-year zero coupon bond at a yield of zero, which, according to Equations (4.28) and (4.33), has a duration of 10 and a convexity of. $10\times10.5=105$ . By contrast, a portfolio with $50\%$ of its value in a five-year zero coupon bond and $50\%$ in a 15-year zero, using the same equations, also has a duration 10, but a convexity of $50\%$ times the convexity of the five-year zero, 22.5, plus $50\%$ times the convexity of the 15-year zero, 232.5, which equals 127.5. Because convexity is quadratic in term, the convexity of the 15-year zero dominates. Hence, the portfolio with the more spread-out cash flows - the one with the longest-term bond - has the greatest convexity.  

Given the calculations in Table 4.7, how should the pension fund choose. among the alternatives? Figure 4.12 graphs the net P&L of the liabilities and each of the asset portfolios. The net. $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ of the liabilities and the bullet portfolio, $-7\%$ in cash and $107\%$ in the 20-year bond, is clearly negatively. convex: it loses value whether rates fall or rise. The barbell portfolio with. $25\%$ in the five-year bond and $75\%$ in the 30-year bond, which matches the. duration and approximately matches the duration of the liabilities, gives rise. to a net $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ that is very small over a wide range of rates. In other words, a pension fund with this portfolio need not rebalance its asset portfolio unless. rates fall significantly. Lastly, the barbell portfolio with $31\%$ in cash and $69\%$ in the 40-year, gives rise to an overall, positively convex position. The combination of assets and liabilities gains value whether rates fall or rise.

Does Figure 4.12 prove that the pension fund should always choose the most convex asset portfolio? The answer is no. As mentioned in Section 4.6, evaluating P&L purely as a function of changes in rates does not account for the passage of time. As a rough proxy for return as time passes with rates unchanged, consider the weighted-average yields in Table 4.7, which fall with convexity. In other words, markets recognize the contribution of convexity to $\mathrm{P}\&\mathrm{L}$ as rates change, as shown in Figure 4.12, and, therefore, offer. lower yields for highly convex portfolios. As a result, a portfolio with relatively low convexity and relatively high yield underperforms if rates change a lot but outperforms if rates stay about the same. By contrast, a portfolio. with relatively high convexity and relatively low yield outperforms if rates change a lot but underperforms if rates stay about the same..  

Figure 4.13 illustrates the trade-off between yield and convexity by graphing the yields of the JNJ bonds from Table 4.6 against their durations. The curve has a concave shape, meaning that any line connecting two points on the curve is below the curve. Now, in the context of this graph, compare the second portfolio from Table 4.7 - the barbell of the five-year and 30-year bonds - versus the bullet 20-year bond portfolio. The barbell portfolio, with a duration of 16.66 and a weighted-average yield of. $2.32\%$ corresponds to the point on the dotted line at a duration of 16.66. By the concavity of the yield-duration curve, this yield is very much below the yield of the 20-year bond, which has a similar duration.4 More generally, the concavity of the duration-yield curve implies that the weighted-average yield on portfolios with more spread-out component bonds, which are more convex portfolios, is lower than the yield of bullet portfolios and also of less spread-out - less convex - portfolios. Chapter 8 demonstrates more formally how the shape of the term structure ensures that the benefits of convexity are fairly offset by lower return.

FIGURE 4.13  Yields of the Johnson & Johnson Bonds in Table 4.6 Against Their Durations.  

Given the discussion in the last several paragraphs, a pension fund man-. ager who decides to match the duration of assets and liabilities has to decide whether to trade yield for positive convexity. An asset portfolio with a rela-. tively low yield but convexity exceeding that of the liabilities does not have. to be rebalanced often to avoid losses, does relatively well when rates move a lot, and does relatively poorly when rates do not move much. An asset port-. folio with a relatively high yield but convexity less than that of the liabilities has to be rebalanced often to avoid losses, does relatively poorly when rates move a lot, and does relatively well when rates do not move much. To summarize, then, the choice actually depends on whether rates will change by much or not, that is, on future interest rate volatility!.  

# Key-Rate, Partial, and Forward-Bucket '01s and Durations  

The assumption in Chapter 4 that changes in the entire term structure can be described by one interest rate factor may be convenient and appropriate in certain situations, but applications with exposures across the term structure require more realistic foundations. Consider a life insurance com-. pany that has liabilities spread out over many years in the future. The insurer could make assumptions about how rates across the term structure typically vary with the 10-year par rate and then hedge all of its liabilities by buying 10-year bonds. But what if, over a particular period, the 30-year rate falls and the 10-year rate stays the same? The present value of liabilities would. increase, asset value would be unchanged, and the insurer would experience a net loss in value.  

Given that a one-factor framework cannot reliably describe rate changes. across the term structure, market participants have pursued three broad strategies. First, build a multi-factor term structure model, based on a combination of data and market analysis. Many active hedge funds and asset managers, who build such models for investment purposes anyway, pursue. this path for hedging as well. The Gauss+ model presented in Chapter 9 is an example of this approach. Second, hedge based on empirical analyses of. relationships across rates of various terms. Examples of this approach are given in Chapter 6. Third, adopt a robust approach to hedging, which per-. forms well regardless of how the term structure evolves but which leaves little room for subjective views and gives no guidance as to investment deci-. sions. Many asset-liability managers and market makers, who do not see. themselves in the business of taking views on term structure movements, pursue this path, which is the subject of this chapter..  

The extreme of robust approaches to hedging is immunization, that is,.   
hedging away the risk of every single cash flow. An example would be buying.   
eight zero coupon bonds to fund eight semesters of college tuition payments.  

No matter what happens to interest rates and the term structure, the maturing zero coupon bonds will fund the assumed payments. Immunization is not practical, however, in many institutional contexts. An insurance company has too many liabilities on too many future dates for each of them to be funded - and therefore hedged - individually. Aside from the operational costs of such a program, the transaction costs of buying relatively small quantities of so many different fixed income securities is likely to be prohibitive.  

Practical approaches to robust hedging, therefore, incorporate enough factors to ensure acceptable performance under a wide range of term structure scenarios but limit the number of factors to maintain tractability and contain transaction costs. The three approaches described in this. chapter - key-rate $^{\ '}O1s$ and durations, partial. $^{\mathrm{~,~}01s\mathrm{~-~}}$ and forward-bucket $^{\ '}01s$ , have proved popular as striking a sensible balance between hedging. effectiveness and practicality or cost. The final section of the chapter briefly. connects multi-factor exposures with portfolio volatility..
