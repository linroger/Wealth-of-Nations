# 4.2 DV01  

DV01 is an acronym for the dollar value of an $^{\cdot}O1$ , that is, the change in the price of a bond for a change in rates of $0.01\%$ , or one basis point. As described in this section, Dv01 can be applied in the context of any one-factor model of changes in rates across the term structure. Practitioners typically use the term DV01, however, to mean yield-based DV01, which is a narrower concept described in Section 4.7.  

Table 4.2 illustrates the calculation of Dv01 for the three bonds introduced in Table 4.1. Three prices are given for each bond. The price in column three is as of the pricing date in mid-May 2021. The prices in columns two and four are the prices after a change in the 30-year HQM par rate of $-1$ or $+1$ basis point, respectively. All other par rates fall or rise as well, of course, as discussed in the previous section. Given these prices, the first step in computing DV01 is to compute the slope of the price-rate curve, that is, the change in price divided by the change in rate. For the NSC 4.10s of 05/15/2021, the slope around the current market level is,

\frac{99.6990-100.1801}{0.02\%}=-2{,}406
$$  

The left-hand side of (4.1) is the difference between the bond prices at $+1$ and $-1$ basis point divided by the change in rates of $+1-(-1)=2$ basis points, or $0.02\%$ . Note that the current price - corresponding to a shift of 0 basis points - is not used in this calculation. From a numerical perspective, it is more accurate to estimate the slope of the curve at the current rate with shifts of $+1$ and $-1$ basis point, which are centered around the current rate, rather than with shifts of. $-1$ and O basis points, which are centered slightly. below the current rate, or with shifts of O and $+1$ basis point, which are. centered slightly above the current rate..  

While Equation (4.1) gives $-2{,}406$ as the slope of the price-rate curve, its scale -- the change in price per unit change in rates, that is, a change of 1.0 or $100\%$ or 10,000 basis points - is not very intuitive. Much more intuitive. and useful is the change in price for a one-basis-point change in rates. To this end, the slope can be divided by 10,o00 to give, rounded to three decimal. places, $-0.241$ . Furthermore, because the prices of almost all fixed income products fall as rates increase, it is conventional to drop the minus sign as. understood. These two adjustments to the slope calculated in Equation (4.1) give the bond's DV01,  

$$
-\frac{1}{10,000}\frac{99.6990-100.1801}{0.02\%}=0.241
$$  

In words, a Dv01 of 0.241 means that 100 face amount of the bond increases in price by 0.241 dollars or 24.1 cents when rates decrease by one basis point. Note that DV01 measures a price change per 100 face amount because the prices in Table 4.2 are per 100 face amount. While DV01, like price, is typically quoted per 100 face amount, it is occasionally useful to quote the DV01 of particular position. In these situations, DV01 is explicitly quoted in units of currency. For example, because the DV01 of the NSC century bond is 0.241 per 100 face amount, a position of $\$10$ million has a DV01 of,  

$$
\$10,000,0000\times\frac{0.241}{100}=\S24,100
$$  

To generalize the discussion here, let. $P$ denote the price of a fixed income. instrument and let $y$ denote the single factor that determines rate changes. across the term structure, which, in the context of this chapter, is the 30-year HQM par rate. Finally, let $\Delta y$ denote the change in the factor $y$ and $\Delta P$ the change in the price given that change in. $y$ . With this notation, the DV01 of a fixed income instrument is estimated by,  

$$
D V01\approx-\frac{1}{10,000}\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta y}
$$  

The slope of the NSC bond's price-rate curve at the current rate is estimated in Equations (4.1) and (4.2) with prices at levels one basis point below and one basis point above the current rate. A more accurate estimate might be obtained by shifting the current rate up and down by 0.5 basis points, or O.1 basis points, etc. In the calculus, the limit of the resulting estimates of the slope, as the size of the shift shrinks to zero, is known as the deriva-. tive and denoted $d P/d y$ . In some cases, like the yield-based metrics discussed later in this chapter, the derivative of the price-rate function can be written. in closed form, that is, with a relatively simple mathematical formula. More generally, however, prices and the slope of the price-rate function have to be calculated numerically. In any case, the limit of Equation (4.4) as the size of. the shift shrinks to zero gives DV01 in terms of the derivative instead of the slope,  

$$
D V01=-\frac{1}{10,000}\frac{d P}{d y}
$$  

The derivative of a curve at a particular point is often illustrated with. tangent lines. In Figure 4.3, the solid black line is the price-rate curve of the NSC century bonds, which is also shown in Figure 4.2. The dashed line is the tangent line of the curve at the current market rate. This means that the slope of the line equals the derivative of the curve at the current market rate,. and that the line just touches the curve at that rate. Figure 4.3 also shows the tangent line to the curve at a rate 150 basis points below the current market rate. The slope of this tangent line is clearly steeper than the other, which means that the NSC 4.10s of 05/15/2121 are more sensitive to rates at 150 basis points below the current rate than they are at the current rate.

DV01 is said to be a local measure of interest rate sensitivity because the slope of the price-rate curve, and, therefore, Dv01, change as rate changes. This property of price-rate curves is known as convexity and is introduced later in the chapter.  

This section concludes by noting that the Dv01 of a portfolio of fixed. income instruments is equal to the sum of the Dv01s of its component instruments. A portfolio with 100 face amount of the NSC bonds - with a DV01 of 0.241 - and 500 face amount of the Treasury 1.625s of. $05/15/2026-$ with a DV01 of $5\times0.040=0.200.$ - has a total DV01 of $0.241+0.200$ , or 0.441. This very intuitive rule is proved formally in Appendix A4.1.
