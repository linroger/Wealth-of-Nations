# 12.1 SHORT-TERM RATES AND THE TRANSITION FROM LIBOR  

Since a first trade in 1969,1 LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) grew to become the dominant set of reference rates for short-term interbank borrowing. Across a wide variety of loans and derivatives, huge volumes of cash flows were set based on LIBOR. LIBOR rates were published daily for five currencies (CHF, EUR, GBP, JPY, USD) and for seven maturities (overnight, one week, one month, two months, three months, six months, 12 months),. although the three-month and to a much lesser extent the one-month terms were the most popular. For each currency, a panel of 16 banks was surveyed with the question, "At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable size just prior to $11~\mathrm{a.m}$ . (London time)?" The LIBOR fixing for each currency and term was then set equal to a trimmed mean of the survey responses.  

In the wake of the quantitative easing policies of central banks after the. financial crisis of 2007-2009, the survey methodology began to lose cred-. ibility. First, because banks with abundant reserves do not need to borrow reserves from other banks, the volume of interbank transactions fell so dramatically that survey responses became more subjective. Second, from 2012 to 2016, investigations revealed that traders at the panel banks colluded to manipulate LIBOR fixes to their advantage. Some traders were sentenced to prison, and banks collectively paid more than. $\$9$ billion in fines.  

In 2017, regulators decided to terminate LIBOR and its use by the end. of 2021. Furthermore, after consultations with industry representatives, it was decided that financial contracts in the future should reference a set of overnight, "risk-free rate" (RFR) benchmarks, which can be set objectively. based on large volumes of transactions data. The phrase "risk-free rates" is. somewhat of a misnomer, as only two of the new benchmarks - SARON in CHF and SOFR in USD - are based on collateralized repo rates, while the. other three - STR in EUR, SONIA in GBP, and TONAR in JPY - remain interbank rates. And although all of the new benchmarks are overnight. rates, regulators have permitted the continued use of two term rate indexes, after methodological reforms, namely, Euribor in EUR and TIBOR in JPY.. Table 12.1 and the following discussions outline the rates used before the transition and the RFRs compliant with post-transition regulatory principles. The table highlights in bold the overnight benchmarks in each currency that are preferred by the regulators.

CHF: Swiss franc; EUR: euro; GBP: British pound; JPY: Japanese yen; USD: US dollar.  

Swiss Franc (CHF). The CHF benchmark moved from LIBOR to SARON (the Swiss Average Rate ON, where ON stands for overnight). SARON is a volume-weighted average of the rates on general collateral, fixed income repo transactions. SARON is calculated a few times per day, along with indexes for several other terms (e.g., SAR1W for one week, and SAR3M for three months), but SARON at each day's close is the main benchmark rate.  

ro (EUR). EONIA (Euro ON Index Average) was a volume-weighted average of rates on overnight interbank loans, which was computed from transactions supplied by a panel of banks. Over time, the total volume of transactions, along with the number of banks in the panel with significant volumes, had fallen too much for the index to remain tenable. Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) had been a set of five term rates (one week, one month, three months, six months, 12 months) based on submitted quotations by panel banks, like LIBOR, although with a different administrator. As part of the transition away from LIBOR, Euribor was reformed in 2019 to follow a "hybrid methodology," which, to the extent available, uses Level 1 contributions, which consist of wholesale funding transactions of panel banks - 18 at the time of this writing - on a given day and for a given term. To the extent such transactions are not available, Euribor may rely on Level 2 contributions, which are recent transactions at other terms, or, if necessary, on Level 3 contributions, which are relevant transactions from other, closely related markets. Perhaps not surprisingly, given the monetary. regime of abundant reserves, a significant fraction of contributions are, indeed, Level 3.? ESTR, ESTER, or ESTR (Euro Short-Term Rate) is the index favored by regulators. It is a volume-weighted trimmed mean of sizable, overnight funding transactions by - at the time of this writing - 32 euro-area banks..  

British Pound (GBP). SONIA (Sterling ON Index Average) has existed since 1997, has a history of use as a reference rate for derivatives transactions, and was reformed in 2018. Like STR, the reformed SONIA is a volume-weighted trimmed mean of sizable overnight bank funding transactions.  

Japanese Yen (JPY). There were two versions of TIBOR (Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate), both based on submissions by Japanese banks:. Euroyen TIBOR, representing interbank JPY rates outside Japan. (like JPY LIBOR), and JPY TIBOR or simply TIBOR, representing interbank JPY rates inside Japan. While Euroyen TIBOR has been abandoned, TIBOR was reformed in various ways in 2017, including - along the lines of the Euribor reforms - a waterfall of. submission priorities, from actual interbank call or funding transactions, through data from similar or relevant markets, down to. "Expert judgment," though this last resort has not yet been necessary. TIBOR is published for five terms: one week, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months. TONAR (Tokyo ON Average Rate), also called TONA, was created in 2016 as a volume-weighted average of transactions in the overnight call market.  

US Dollar (UsD). fed funds is the overnight rate at which banks trade reserves at the Federal Reserve System. A further description of this market is given below. SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is a trimmed, volume-weighted median of overnight repo rates. Its calculation is described in more detail in Chapter 10. The other USD rates listed in Table 12.1 are discussed presently.  

Given the enormous volume of loans and derivatives that had been refer-. encing LIBOR, the transition to new rates, from an operational perspective, was time-consuming and costly. Changes to derivatives markets were orga-. nizationally straightforward, in that regulators could push changes through a small number of clearinghouses and large dealers. By contrast, changes in loan markets required action by a large number of smaller banks. Particu-. larly challenging in both markets, however, are legacy or existing contracts that reference LIBOR, but are difficult to change for various reasons, ranging. from their being in structures that are hard to amend to their somewhat unresponsive counterparties. The resulting backlog of legacy contracts eventually. forced regulators to postpone the cessation of a subset of LIBOR indexes. Five USD LIBOR tenors (overnight, one month, three months, six months, and 12 months) will continue to be published until June 30, 2022, for use by certain legacy contracts only. Three GBP and JPY LIBOR tenors (one month, three months, and six months) will continue to be published for legacy contracts for some time in synthetic form, which means that, instead of being calculated from survey results, as in the past, these LIBOR rates are now set. as some fixed function of the preferred, post-transition benchmarks, namely, SONIA and TONAR, respectively.  

More substantive challenges to the transition, particularly in the loan. market, arise from two key features of the new benchmarks. First, they are overnight rather than term rates. Second, they are rates with little to no bank credit risk. The challenge of moving from term to overnight rate benchmarks is described in Figure 12.1. Panel a) depicts the historical use of onemonth LIBOR as part of a longer-term, floating-rate loan. A borrower of $\$1$ million from October 1 to November 1, 2021, knows the rate of interest at the start of the period and, therefore, can compute the interest due at the end of the period, in this case,. $\$1,000,0000\times0.07525\%\times31/360=\S64.80$

FIGURE 12.1 Examples of Monthly Interest Payment Conventions for a. $\$1$ Million Monthly Resetting Floating-Rate Loan, September to November 2021.  

In this convention, interest is said to be set in advance of the loan period and paid in arrears of the loan period. With overnight rather than term benchmarks, however, borrowers typically do not know the final amount of interest at the start of the period. Panel b) shows the most straightforward structure for term loans with an overnight rate benchmark, namely, set in arrears and paid in arrears. Over the 31 days - October 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021 - SOFR was three basis points on three days, four basis points on one day, and five basis points on 27 days. On a. $\$1$ million loan, therefore, with daily compounding, the interest payment due at the end of the period is,  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle\$1,000,0000\left[\left(1+\frac{0.03\%}{360}\right)^{3}\left(1+\frac{0.04\%}{360}\right)\left(1+\frac{0.05\%}{360}\right)^{2}-1\right]}}\ {{\displaystyle\qquad=\S41.11}}\end{array}
$$  

But the borrower does not know this amount until the end of the period, when all relevant SOFR rates have been observed. Many financial institutions, whose business is the money markets, might be perfectly comfortable with this uncertainty. Nonfinancial corporate borrowers, however, might not be comfortable with uncertain interest payments at the end of one-month, three-month, or longer reset periods.  

There exist several operational fixes designed to give borrowers time to.   
compute and make interest payments. A payment delay simply gives the bor-.   
rower an extra day or so to make the payment. A lockout allows for earlier.   
computation of interest payments by not using the very last rate settings..   
For example, a one-day lockout might use the rate for October 30 for both.   
October 30 and October 31. And a lookback uses earlier rather than the latest rates. In the present example, the observation period might be shifted from October 1 through October 31 to September 30 through October 30..   
These minor tweaks, however, do not change the fact that borrowers do not.   
know how much they will pay in interest until sometime near the end of the.   
period.  

One proposed solution to this more significant challenge, depicted in. Panel c) of Figure 12.1, is to use overnight rates in a set in advance, paid in arrears structure. For example, to determine the payment on November. 1, 2021, use the interest rates from September 1 to October 1 (inclusive).. Over this period, SOFR was five basis points every day, giving an interest payment of $\S1.000,000\times\left[\left(1+0.05\%/360\right)^{31}-1\right]=\dot{\mathbb{S}}43.06$ . In this way, the borrower does know the interest due on November 1 as of October 1. The reference interest rates, however, do not correspond to the borrowing period, which may or may not be important depending on the situation and. on the structure of any complementary positions.  

The most natural solution, from a theoretical perspective, is for the mar-. ket to develop term rates, based on the benchmark overnight rates, for use in loans to borrowers who want payment certainty. Some such term rates are,. in fact, in use for some purposes, including the synthetic versions of GBP and. JPY LIBOR mentioned already. And the CME, a major US derivatives clear-. inghouse, has been encouraged to create term SOFR rates for limited use. For now, however, regulators are discouraging - as a return to the recent. weaknesses of LIBOR - the broad use of term rates that are not directly observable from significant volumes of market transactions. In the future,. perhaps, the rate derivatives described later in the chapter will trade with enough liquidity to provide acceptable term rates..  

The second substantive challenge to the LIBOR transition is that the new RFR benchmarks embed little to no bank credit risk. In the heyday of LIBOR, banks would borrow funds at LIBOR or at a spread to LIBOR and would lend funds to customers at LIBOR plus a spread. Banks were naturally hedged, therefore, against increases in the cost of funds of the banking sector. Some of the new overnight benchmarks are interbank rates, namely, STR, SONIA, and TONAR, but overnight interbank rates - as opposed to term interbank rates -- do not typically fluctuate much with credit conditions until well into a financial crisis. And the other two new benchmarks, SARON and SOFR, are based on repo rates, which, if anything, might fall as credit conditions worsen, as flight-to-quality trades flock to safer lending havens. The question for the transition, therefore, is whether banks will benchmark large volumes of their customer loans to RFRs, and even if they do so in normal times, will they continue to do so in times of stress.  

In EUR and JPY, the continued use of term Euribor and TIBOR enables. the use of credit-sensitive rates (CsRs). In the United States, there are two suites of rates that have been deemed by independent auditors as com-. pliant with international regulatory principles pertaining to benchmarks..  

Ameribor (American Interbank Offered Rate) is computed for a range. of terms from the funding transactions and executable quotes of a large number of small to regional US banks on the American Financial Exchange. (AFX). BSBY (Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index) is computed for a range of terms from the funding transactions and executable quotes of large. banks across the Bloomberg trading platform. Futures contracts are listed. on both Ameribor and BSBY rates. AXI (Across-the-Curve Credit Spread Index) is not listed in Table 12.1, because, at the time of this writing, it. had not yet been deemed compliant with regulatory benchmark principles. This index is intended as a credit spread to be added to SOFR, is available. for a range of terms, and is based on unsecured bank funding transactions. Ameribor, BSBY, and AXI, from a commercial perspective, face not only the normal challenges in bringing new products to market but also the regulatory headwinds that support broad adoption of SOFR.3.
