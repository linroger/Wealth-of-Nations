# 12.3 FED FUND FUTURES  

Banks that have accounts at the Federal Reserve system can trade these fed funds with each other; that is, they can borrow from and lend to each.  

other, at market-determined rates, in the fed funds market. These trades are predominantly for overnight borrowing and lending, and the effective fed funds rate, calculated each day, is the volume-weighted average of the overnight rates on fed funds traded that day.  

Before the financial crisis of 2007-2009, under the monetary policy regime of scarce reserves, domestic commercial banks actively traded in the fed funds market to manage their individual shortages or surpluses of reserves. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve conducted monetary policy by adding or subtracting reserves from the system so as to keep effective fed funds at or very close to a policy target rate. More recently, however, in the regime of abundant reserves, domestic commercial banks do not need to borrow funds from each other; they face various regulatory incentives to hold reserve balances; and they earn interest on reserves held at the Federal Reserve. The resulting transformation of the fed funds market has been dramatic, both in terms of a significant decline in volumes and in terms of a change in the composition of market participants. Lending is now dominated by Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) - that do not earn interest on their accounts at the Federal Reserve - and borrowing is now dominated by US subsidiaries of foreign banks - that typically do not take US deposits and are not constrained by the full range of US bank regulations. The fed funds market has thus become a means through which FHLBs can earn interest on their surplus cash in the Federal Reserve system, and foreign banks can earn a spread by borrowing from the FHLBs and depositing those borrowed funds into interest-bearing accounts at the Federal Reserve.7  

While the Federal Reserve no longer changes the quantity of reserves. in the system to influence short-term rates, it uses other policy tools to keep effective fed funds within a target range, defined by an upper and lower limit.. Figure 12.2 graphs these upper and lower limits, along with the effective fed funds rate itself, from January 2010 to January 2022. Effective fed funds is somewhat volatile, but nearly always within the policy target range..  

The fed funds effective rate is of interest to participants in the fed funds. market; to those who borrow and lend at a spread over fed funds effective; to those who trade derivatives tied to fed funds effective; and to anyone taking positions on future Federal Reserve policy. For these groups, fed fund futures can be used to manage exposures to fed funds effective. These futures contracts can be explained concisely here, because one-month SOFR futures, described in the previous section, are designed along the same lines. The final settlement rate of a fed fund futures contract in a particular delivery month. is the average of fed funds effective over that month, with non-business days taking on the previous business day's rate. Like one-month SOFR futures contracts, price is quoted as 100 minus the percentage rate; contracts are subject to daily settlement; and contracts are scaled such that a one-basis-point change in the rate results in a daily settlement flow of. $\$41.67$ .With all of these similarities to one-month SOFR contracts, hedging with fed fund. futures proceeds along the same lines as in the previous section. The text continues, therefore, with the use of fed fund futures to infer market expectations of Federal Reserve rate policy decisions..

FIGURE 12.2 Fed Funds Effective Rate and Target Range, January 2010 to January 2022.  

Table 12.6 lists fed fund futures contracts, prices, and rates as of two dates: October 1, 2021, and January 17, 2022. The rightmost column of the table lists the meeting dates of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which, on the second day of each set of meetings, announces any monetary policy changes, including changes to the federal funds target rate. As explained in Chapter 8, forward interest rates are a combination of expected rates in the future and a risk premium, but the risk premium over a year is likely to be relatively small. Also, as explained later in this chapter, near-term forward rates and futures rates are very similar. Therefore, roughly speaking, the one-month fed fund futures rates in Table 12.6 can. be viewed as market expectations of future monthly average effective fed funds. In this light, the main lesson from the table is that expectations of Federal Reserve policy changed significantly from October 1, 2021, to January 17, 2022. As of October 1, fed fund futures anticipated effective fed funds rising from eight basis points to 28 basis points by the end of 2022. As of January 17, 2022, however, by which time surging inflation had begun to worry Federal Reserve officials, fed fund futures anticipated effective fed funds rising from 8.25 basis points to 99.5 basis points by the end of 2022.

Many market participants, in fact, use fed fund futures rates together with the FOMC meeting dates to build a market term structure of fed funds. effective. The key assumption is that the Federal Reserve changes its target rate only at its scheduled meetings. This has been a good description of recent history, with only rare exceptions, like after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, during the financial crisis in 2008, and in response. to the COVID pandemic and economic shutdowns in March 2020. In any case, given this assumption, the idea is to find a set of forward rates, from. one meeting to the next, that are more or less consistent with fed fund futures prices.  

To illustrate the procedure, focus on January 17, 2022. Note that the. fed funds effective rate was eight basis points from January 1 to January 17. (not shown in the table). The FOMC could announce a new target rate the. afternoon of January 26 and, because there is no FOMC meeting in February, the rate set by the FOMC on January 26 will be the average fed funds effective rate in February. But the February contract rate is. $0.095\%$ . Hence, the market's expectation of fed funds effective after the January 26 meeting.  

is $0.095\%$ .8 To flesh out the meaning of this expectation, assume further,. consistent with recent history, that the Federal Reserve will change the target rate by either zero or 25 basis points. Then, given a post-meeting expected. rate of $0.095\%$ , the implied probability, $\boldsymbol{p}$ , of a 25-basis-point increase in rate on January 26, from 8 to $8+25$ or 33 basis points, is given by,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{0.095\%=p\times(0.08\%+0.25\%)+(1-p)\times0.08\%}\ {{p=6\%}}\end{array}
$$  

In words, with a. $6\%$ probability of the Federal Reserve increasing fed funds. effective from eight to 33 basis points, and a. $94\%$ probability of leaving fed funds effective at eight basis points, the expected fed funds effective rate is 9.5 basis points, as implied by the February contract price..  

Moving to the next meeting, because there is a possible rate target. announcement on March 16, but no meeting in April, the April futures rate of $0.355\%$ indicates a market expectation of $0.355\%$ after the announcement on March 16. Implying the results of the May meeting is more complex, because there is a meeting in June. Hence, to calculate the market's expectation of the May meeting, let $f^{M a y}$ be expected fed funds effective after the May meeting, which takes effect starting and including. May 5. The May fed futures rate of $0.450\%$ , therefore, is an average of four days at the expectation of $0.355\%$ coming out of the previous meeting, and 27 days at $f^{M{\bar{a}}y}$ . Mathematically,  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{0.450\%=\frac{4\times0.355\%+27\times f^{M a y}}{31}}}\ {{f^{M a y}=0.4641\%}}\end{array}
$$  

Continuing along these lines, the expected fed funds effective rate can. be computed for each date. Figure 12.3 shows the results of this exercise, as of October 1 and as of January 17, using fed fund futures rates from Table 12.6. This figure graphically conveys the same message as the futures. rates themselves, namely, that the market revised its rate expectation upward from October 1 to January 17. The figure, however, relying on the meeting. dates, explicitly shows the path of expected rates..  

This section concludes with an aside about curve building, that is, about. mathematically representing the term structure of interest rates. Putting aside the small differences between short-term futures and forward rates, discussed next, Figure 12.3 can be read as a flat-forward-rate representation. of the term structure. In other words, the term structure of forward rates is represented as a sequence of constant forward rates. While this structure. may seem odd from a purely economic perspective, because forward rates might be expected to change smoothly over time, flat forwards often repre-. sent all available market information. Fed fund futures, for example, provide only one rate per month. Furthermore, while flat forwards are discontinuous; that is, they jump at particular terms, they lead to relatively smooth spot rates and discount factors. To illustrate, using the relationships from Chapters 1 and 2, Figure 12.4 constructs weekly spot rates, discount factors, and forward rates from the flat forwards of Figure 12.3. These curves. can reasonably be used to discount cash flows from other short-term instruments of equivalent credit risk, or as a base curve above which spreads can be added to discount riskier cash flows..  

In building curves, there is always a trade-off between stability and smoothness. Flat forwards are very stable. Small changes in fed fund futures rates, for example, move flat forwards and corresponding spot rates or discount factors by small amounts and in sensible ways. Smooth represen-. tations of interest rate curves, however, like cubic splines, which are not described in this book, are notoriously unstable. Small changes in market rates in one part of the curve often lead to larger changes in other, relatively distant parts of the curve. Current industry practice favors more stable. methodologies, like flat forwards, combined with an effort to collect as many market data points as possible, particularly in the short end of the curve.

In general, the more market data, the less significant the discontinuities or jumps in the flat forward curve. Jumps between meeting dates, however, as. in Figure 12.3, are actually a feature of the methodology, as they capture the financial reality of short-term rates jumping after FOMC meetings..
