# 12.5 EURIBOR FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS AND FUTURES  

As mentioned earlier, Euribor is a set of term rates that continue to be used after the LIBOR transition. In particular, the three-month Euribor quote on a particular date represents the rate on a three-month interbank loan that settles in two business days. Furthermore, a term of "three months" in this market refers to the same calendar day three months later. Three-month Euribor quoted on June 13, 2022, therefore, represents the rate earned over the 92 days from June 15, 2022, to September 15, 2022.  

Forward rate agreements or FRAs are over-the-counter agreements that are used to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowing or lending.. Table 12.9 gives the terms, as of January 14, 2022, of a $\epsilon10$ million notional amount Euribor FRA at a fixed rate or contract rate of $-0.47\%$ from June 15 to September 15, 2022. The borrower or fixed-rate payer agrees to pay the lender or fixed-rate receiver on June 15 the quantity listed in the table. The fixed rate of a FRA is set equal to the Euribor forward rate at the time. of the trade, as defined in Chapter 2. In this example, this means that, as of January 14, market participants are willing to commit to borrow or lend from June 15 to September 15 at a rate of $-0.47\%$ . To see that the FRA is fairly priced at this fixed rate, note that a commitment to borrow or lend for three months on June 15 at the then-prevailing market rate, $R$ , is also fair. Therefore, committing to lend on June 15 at $-0.47\%$ and to borrow on June 15 at $R$ is fair, and the resulting September 15 interest payments from those commitments sum to $\epsilon1$ million $\times~(92/360)\times(-0.47\%-R)$ Finally, the present value of that sum as of June 15 equals the quantity in Table 12.9. Hence, the FRA described is fairly priced.  

To illustrate how FRAs can be used for hedging, consider a corporation that, as of January 14, 2022, has a line with its bank to borrow $\epsilon10$ million from June 15, 2022, to September 15, 2022, at Euribor flat, that is, at no spread. If Euribor on June 13 turns out to be. $R$ , then that will be. the rate applied to the loan, and the corporation will owe $\epsilon10$ million $\times$ $[1+(92/360)R]$ on September 15. The corporation, therefore, is exposed to the risk that rates rise from January 14 to June 13.  

The corporation can hedge this risk by locking in the forward rate of $-0.47\%$ as follows. On January 14, 2022, the corporation agrees to pay. fixed on the FRA in the table. Then, on June 15, the corporation borrows the $\epsilon10$ million it needs plus the quantity it owes on the FRA for three months at the then-prevailing rate, $R$ . In total then, the corporation owes,.

on September 15, which is exactly the same as if it had borrowed 10 million at a rate of $-0.47\%$ . Intuitively, if realized Euribor on June 15 is less than. $-0.47\%$ , the corporation borrows at relatively low rates, but owes money on. the FRA. On the other hand, if realized Euribor is greater than. $-0.47\%$ , the corporation borrows at relatively high rates but collects money on the FRA.9  

An exchange-traded alternative to Euribor FRAs are Euribor futures contracts, some of which are listed in Table 12.10, as of January 14, 2022. The tickers begin with "ER," followed by the month and year indicators. The contracts are subject to daily settlement, and the final settlement rate is set to three-month Euribor on the last trade date. The final settlement rate of the June contract, for example, is three-month Euribor on June 13, 2022, which as mentioned earlier, represents the rate on a loan from June 15 to. September 15. Three-month Euribor futures are scaled to hedge the change in interest on a 1 million, 90-day loan. Equivalently, a one-basis-point change in rate translates into a daily settlement flow of $\in1,000,000\times0.01\%$ $\times90/360$ , or $\epsilon25$  

The corporation in the FRA example hedges a. $\epsilon10$ million, 92-day loan. from June 15 to September 15, 2022. This time period corresponds exactly. to that covered by Euribor set on June 13, which is also the expiration of the June three-month Euribor contract. Furthermore, with the market at the levels in Table. $12.10\textrm{--}\textrm{a}$ rate of $-0.47\%$ - the corporation can sell the June. contract to lock in a rate of $-0.47\%$ on its planned borrowing. The number. of contracts required to hedge the. $\epsilon10$ million, 92-day loan with a contract. scaled to a $\epsilon1$ million, 90-day loan, is,

The results of the hedge are given in Table 12.11. If rates rise, so that Euribor on June 13 turns out to be. $-0.17\%$ , the corporation receives interest of $\epsilon10$ million $\times(92/360)\times$ negative $0.17\%$ , or $\in4,344.44$ ; experiences a futures gain of 30 basis points per contract, for a total gain - ignoring the small effects of daily settlement - of $30\times\in25\times10.22$ , or $\in7,665.00$ ; which together gives an overall gain of 12,009.44. Looking at the table as a whole,. the futures position successfully hedges the cost of borrowing in the sense. of locking in the receipt of about 12,011. The hedge would be exact if the. number of contracts in Equation (12.16) were taken to more decimal places.  

This hedging example is simple in that the corporation plans to borrow over the same period as covered by three-month Euribor relevant for the June contract. Along the same lines as the discussion in the context of hedging with SOFR futures, if the borrowing period were shorter or longer than that covered by the June Euribor contract, fewer or more contracts would be needed, and contracts other than June might be used.  

The example in this section is constructed to show the similarity between.   
Euribor FRAs and futures, but there are significant differences as well.   
FRAs may be subject to bilateral margin agreements, but are not subject to.   
daily settlement, like futures. FRAs, as over-the-counter products, can be.   
customized for individual trades with respect to dates covered and with respect to notional amount, while the terms of futures contracts are.   
highly standardized. In part because they are customized, however, FRAs are less liquid than futures. Hedgers typically need to decide, therefore,.   
whether customization or liquidity is more important in their particular.   
circumstances.

FIGURE 12.5  A Comparison of the June 2022 Euribor and the June 2022 SOFR Futures Contracts.  

This section concludes with a comparison of futures on a forward-. looking term rate benchmark, like Euribor, and futures on a backwardlooking compounded overnight benchmark, like SOFR. The top half of Figure 12.5 depicts the June three-month Euribor contract, ERM2, while the bottom half depicts the June three-month SOFR contract, SFRM2. Both contracts cover realized interest rates from mid-June to mid-September, though the terminal date differs somewhat, as detailed earlier. The big difference, however, is that ERM2, which references a term rate set on June 13, expires on that date. SFRM2, which references a compounded daily rate that is not known until September 21, does not expire until that later date.
