# 32.3 VOLATILITY STRUCTURES  

The models we have looked at give rise to different volatility environments. Figure 32.3 shows patterns for the volatility of the 3-month forward rate as a function of maturity for the Ho-Lee, Hull-White one-factor, and Hull-White two-factor models. The term structure of interest rates is assumed to be flat.  

For Ho-Lee the volatility of the 3-month forward rate is the same for all maturities. In the one-factor Hull-White model the effect of mean reversion is to cause the volatility of the 3-month forward rate to be a declining function of maturity. In the Hull-White two-factor model when parameters are chosen appropriately, the volatility of the 3-month forward rate has a "humped" look. The latter is consistent with empirical evidence and implied cap volatilities discussed in Section 29.2.
