# 37.2 LESSONS FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  

We now move on to consider lessons that are primarily relevant to financial institutions.  

# Monitor Traders Carefully  

In trading rooms there is a tendency to regard high-performing traders as "untouchable' and to not subject their activities to the same scrutiny as other traders.. Apparently Joseph Jett, Kidder Peabody's star trader of Treasury instruments, was often "too busy" to answer questions and discuss his positions with the company's risk managers.  

All traders--particularly those making high profits--should be fully accountable. It is important for the financial institution to know whether the high profits are being made by taking unreasonably high risks. It is also important to check that the financial institution's computer systems and pricing models are correct and are not being manipulated in some way.  

# Separate the Front, Middle, and Back Office  

The front office in a financial institution consists of the traders who are executing trades, taking positions, and so forth. The middle ofice consists of risk managers who are monitoring the risks being taken. The back office is where the record keeping and accounting takes place. Some of the worst derivatives disasters have occurred because. these functions were not kept separate. Nick Leeson controlled both the front and back office for Barings in Singapore and was, as a result, able to conceal the disastrous nature of his trades from his superiors in London for some time. Jerome Kerviel had worked in Societe Generale's back office before becoming a trader and took advantage of his knowledge of its systems to hide his positions.  

# Do Not Blindly Trust Models  

Some of the large losses incurred by financial institutions arose because of the models and computer systems being used. We discussed how Kidder Peabody was misled by its own systems in Business Snapshot 5.1..  

If large profits are always reported when relatively simple trading strategies are followed, there is a good chance that the models underlying the calculation of the profits are wrong. Similarly, if a financial institution appears to be particularly competitive on its quotes for a particular type of deal, there is a good chance that it is using a different model from other market participants, and it should analyze what is going on carefully. To the head of a trading room, getting too much business of a certain type can be just as worrisome as getting too little business of that type.  

# Be Conservative in Recognizing Inception Profits  

When a financial institution sells a highly exotic instrument to a nonfinancial corpora-. tion, the valuation can be highly dependent on the underlying model. For example, instruments with long-dated embedded interest rate options can be highly dependent on. the interest rate model used. In these circumstances, a phrase used to describe the daily. marking to market of the deal is marking to model. This is because there are no market prices for similar deals that can be used as a benchmark..  

Suppose that a financial institution manages to sell an instrument to a client for $\$10$ million more than it is worth-or at least $\$10$ million more than its model says it is worth. The $\$10$ million is known as an inception profit. When should it be recognized? There appears to be quite a variation in what different financial institutions do. Some recognize the $\$10$ million immediately, whereas others are much more conservative and take reserves so that the profit (if it materializes) is recognized over the life of the deal.  

Recognizing model-based inception profits immediately is very dangerous. It encourages traders to use aggressive models, take their bonuses, and leave before the model and the value of the deal come under close scrutiny. It is much better to recognize inception profits slowly, so that traders have the motivation to investigate the impact of several different models and several different sets of assumptions before committing themselves to a deal.  

# Do Not Sell Clients Inappropriate Products  

It is tempting to sell corporate clients inappropriate products, particularly when they. appear to have an appetite for the underlying risks. But this is shortsighted. The most. dramatic example of this is the activities of Bankers Trust (BT) in the period leading up. to the spring of 1994. Many of BT's clients were persuaded to buy high-risk and totally inappropriate products. A typical product (e.g., the. $5/30$ swap discussed in Business. Snapshot 34.4) would give the client a good chance of saving a few basis points on its borrowings and a small chance of costing a large amount of money. The products worked well for BT's clients in 1992 and 1993, but blew up in 1994 when interest rates rose sharply. The bad publicity that followed hurt BT greatly. The years it had spent building up trust among corporate clients and developing an enviable reputation for innovation in derivatives were largely lost as a result of the activities of a few overly aggressive salesmen. BT was forced to pay large amounts of money to its clients to settle. lawsuits out of court. It was taken over by Deutsche Bank in 1999..  

# Beware of Easy Profits  

Enron provides an example of how overly aggressive deal makers can cost the banks they. work for billions of dollars. Doing business with Enron seemed very profitable and banks competed with each other for this business. But the fact that many banks push hard to get a certain type of business should not be taken as an indication that the business will ultimately be profitable. The business that Enron did with banks resulted in. shareholder lawsuits that were very expensive for the banks. In general, transactions. where high profits seem easy to achieve should be looked at closely for hidden risks.  

Investing in the AAA-rated tranches of the ABS CDOs that were created from subprime mortgages (see Chapter 8) seemed like a fantastic opportunity. The promised returns were much higher than the returns normally earned on AAA-rated instruments. Many investors did not stop to ask whether the extra returns reflected risks not taken into account by the rating agencies.  

# Do Not Ignore Liquidity Risk  

Financial engineers usually base the pricing of exotic instruments and other instruments that trade relatively infrequently on the prices of actively traded instruments. For example:  

1. A financial engineer often calculates a zero curve from actively traded government bonds (known as on-the-run bonds) and uses it to price government bonds that. trade less frequently (off-the-run bonds)..   
2. A financial engineer often implies the volatility of an asset from actively traded. options and uses it to price less actively traded options..  

3. A financial engineer often implies information about the behavior of interest rates from actively traded interest rate caps and swap options and uses it to price nonstandard interest rate derivatives that are less actively traded.  

These practices are not unreasonable. However, it is dangerous to assume that less actively traded instruments can always be traded at close to their theoretical price. When financial markets experience a shock of one sort or another there is often a "flight to quality.' Liquidity becomes very important to investors, and illiquid instruments often sell at a big discount to their theoretical values. This happened in 2007-9 following the jolt to credit markets caused by lack of confidence in securities backed by subprime mortgages.  

Another example of losses arising from liquidity risk is provided by Long-Term. Capital Management (LTCM), which was discussed in Business Snapshot 2.2. This hedge fund followed a strategy known as convergence arbitrage. It attempted to identify two securities (or portfolios of securities) that should in theory sell for the same price. If the market price of one security was less that of the other, it would buy that security and sell the other. The strategy is based on the idea that if two securities have the same. theoretical price their market prices should eventually be the same.  

In the summer of 1998 LTCM made a huge loss. This was largely because a default. by Russia on its debt caused a flight to quality. LTCM tended to be long illiquid. instruments and short the corresponding liquid instruments (for example, it was long. off-the-run bonds and short on-the-run bonds). The spreads between the prices of illiquid instruments and the corresponding liquid instruments widened sharply after. the Russian default. LTCM was highly leveraged. It experienced huge losses and there were margin calls on its positions that it found difficult to meet..  

The LTCM story reinforces the importance of carrying out scenario analyses and stress testing to look at what can happen in the worst of all worlds. LTCM could have tried to examine other times in history when there had been extreme flights to quality to quantify the liquidity risks it was facing.  

# Beware When Everyone Is Following the Same Trading Strategy  

It sometimes happens that many market participants are following essentially the same trading strategy. This creates a dangerous environment where there are liable to be big market moves, unstable markets, and large losses for the market participants.  

We gave one example of this in Chapter 19 when discussing portfolio insurance and. the market crash of October 1987. In the months leading up to the crash, increasing numbers of portfolio managers were attempting to insure their portfolios by creating synthetic put options. They bought stocks or stock index futures after a rise in the market and sold them after a fall. This created an unstable market. A relatively small decline in stock prices could lead to a wave of selling by portfolio insurers. The latter would lead to a further decline in the market, which could give rise to another wave of selling, and so on. There is little doubt that without portfolio insurance the crash of October 1987 would have been much less severe..  

Another example is provided by LTCM in 1998. Its position was made more difficult by the fact that many other hedge funds were following similar convergence arbitrage strategies to its own. After the Russian default and the flight to quality, LTCM tried to liquidate part of its portfolio to meet margin calls. Unfortunately, other hedge funds were facing similar problems to LTCM and trying to do similar trades. This exacerbated the situation, causing liquidity spreads to be even higher than they would otherwise have. been and reinforcing the flight to quality. Consider, for example, LTCM's position in U.S. Treasury bonds. It was long the illiquid off-the-run bonds and short the liquid on-. the-run bonds. When a flight to quality caused spreads between yields on the two types of bonds to widen, LTCM had to liquidate its positions by selling off-the-run bonds and. buying on-the-run bonds. Other large hedge funds were doing the same. As a result, the price of on-the-run bonds rose relative to off-the-run bonds and the spread between the two yields widened even more than it had done already..  

A further example is provided by the activities of British insurance companies in the late 1990s. These insurance companies had entered into many contracts promising that. the rate of interest applicable to annuities would be the greater of the market rate and a guaranteed rate. The insurance companies stood to lose money if long-term interest rates fell below the guaranteed rate. For various reasons, they all entered into derivatives transactions to partially hedge their risks at about the same time. The financial institutions on the other side of the derivatives transactions hedged their risks by buying. huge numbers of long-dated sterling bonds. As a result, bond prices rose and sterling. long-term interest rates declined. More bonds had to be bought to maintain the dynamic hedge, sterling long-term interest rates declined further, and so on. The financial institutions lost money and insurance companies found themselves in a worse position on the risks that they had chosen not to hedge..  

The key lesson to be learned from these stories is that there can be big risks in situations where many market participants are following the same trading strategy.  

# Do Not Make Excessive Use of Short-Term Funding for Long-Term Needs  

All financial institutions finance long-term needs with short-term sources of funds to some extent. But a financial institution that relies too heavily on short-term funds is likely to expose itself to unacceptable liquidity risks.  

Suppose that a financial institution funds long-term needs by rolling over commercial paper every month. Commercial paper issued on April 1 would be redeemed with the proceeds of a new commercial paper issue on May 1; this new commercial paper issue would be redeemed with the proceeds of a commercial paper issue on June 1; and so on. Provided that the financial institution is perceived as healthy, there should be no problem. But if investors lose confidence in the financial institution (rightly or wrongly), it becomes impossible to roll over commercial paper and the financial institution experiences severe liquidity problems.  

Many of the failures of financial institutions during the financial crisis (e.g., Lehman Brothers and Northern Rock) were largely caused by excessive reliance on short-term funding. It is not surprising that the Basel Committee, which is responsible for regulating banks internationally, has introduced liquidity ratios which banks must satisfy.  

# Market Transparency Is Important  

One of the lessons from the credit crunch of 2007 is that market transparency is important. During the period leading up to 2007, investors traded highly structured products without any real knowledge of the underlying assets. All they knew was the credit rating of the security being traded. With hindsight, we can say that investors should have demanded more information about the underlying assets and should have more carefully assessed the risks they were taking--but it is easy to be wise after the event!  

The subprime meltdown of August 2007 caused investors to lose confidence in all structured products and withdraw from that market. This led to a market breakdown where tranches of structured products could only be sold at prices well below their. theoretical values. There was a flight to quality and credit spreads increased. If there. had been market transparency so that investors understood the asset-backed securities. they were buying, there would still have been subprime losses, but the flight to quality. and disruptions to the market would have been less pronounced..  

# Manage Incentives  

A key lesson from the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 is the importance of incentives. The bonus systems in banks tend to emphasize short-term performance. Some financial. institutions have switched to systems where the payment for performance in a year is. spread out over a number of future years and part of the bonus may be "clawed back"if it turns out that performance was not as good as originally thought. This has obvious advantages. It discourages traders from doing trades that will look good in the short run, but may "blow up' in a few years..  

When loans are securitized, it is important to try and align the interests of the party. originating the loan with the party who bears the ultimate risk so that agency costs are. minimized. One way of doing this is for regulators to require the originator of a loan portfolio to keep a stake in all the tranches and other instruments that are created from the portfolio.  

# Never Ignore Risk Management  

When times are good (or appear to be good), there is a tendency to assume that nothing can go wrong and ignore the output from stress tests and other analyses carried out by the risk management group. There are many stories of risk managers not being listened to in the period leading up to the financial crisis of 2007. Chuck Prince, CEO of Citigroup, said in a much quoted interview with the Financial Times in July 2007 (just before the financial crisis):  

When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.  

No doubt he regretted the comment later. As it turned out, Citigroup's losses from the financial crisis were over $\$50$ billion. Mr. Prince lost his job later in 2007.
