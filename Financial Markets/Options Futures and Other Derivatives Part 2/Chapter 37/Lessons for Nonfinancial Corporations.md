# 37.3 LESSONS FOR NONFINANCIAL CORPORATIONS  

We now consider lessons primarily applicable to nonfinancial corporations.  

# Make Sure You Fully Understand the Trades You Are Doing  

Corporations should never undertake a trade or a trading strategy that they do not. fully understand. This is a somewhat obvious point, but it is surprising how often a. trader working for a nonfinancial corporation will, after a big loss, admit to not knowing what was really going on and claim to have been misled by investment bankers. Robert Citron, the treasurer of Orange County did this. So did the traders working for Hammersmith and Fulham, who in spite of their huge positions were surprisingly uninformed about how the swaps and other interest rate derivatives they traded really worked.  

If a senior manager in a corporation does not understand a trade proposed by a. subordinate, the trade should not be approved. A simple rule of thumb is that if a trade. and the rationale for entering into it are so complicated that they cannot be understood. by the manager, it is almost certainly inappropriate for the corporation. The trades undertaken by Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings would have been vetoed using. this criterion.  

One way of ensuring that you fully understand a financial instrument is to value it. If a corporation does not have the in-house capability to value an instrument, it should not trade it. In practice, corporations often rely on their derivatives dealers for valuation information. This is dangerous, as Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings found out. When they wanted to unwind their deals, they found they were facing prices produced by Bankers Trust's proprietary models, which they had no way of checking.  

# Make Sure a Hedger Does Not Become a Speculator  

One of the unfortunate facts of life is that hedging is relatively dull, whereas speculation is exciting. When a company hires a trader to manage the risks in exchange rates, commodity prices, or interest rates, there is a danger that the following might happen.. At first, the trader does the job diligently and earns the confidence of top management.. The trader assesses the company's exposures and hedges them. As time goes by, the. trader becomes convinced that he or she can outguess the market. Slowly the trader. becomes a speculator. At first things go well, but then a loss is made. To recover the loss, the trader doubles up the bets. Further losses might then be made, and so on. The. result is liable to be a disaster..  

As mentioned earlier, clear limits to the risks that can be taken should be set by senior management. Controls should be put in place to ensure that the limits are obeyed. The trading strategy for a corporation should start with an analysis of the risks facing the corporation in foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity markets, etc. A decision should then be taken on how the risks are to be reduced to acceptable levels. It is a clear sign that something is wrong within a corporation if the trading strategy is not derived in a very direct way from the company's exposures.  

# Be Cautious about Making the Treasury Department a Profit Center  

In the last 20 years there has been a tendency to make the treasury department within a. corporation a profit center. This appears to have much to recommend it. The treasurer is motivated to reduce financing costs and manage risks as profitably as possible. The problem is that the potential for the treasurer to make profits is limited. When raising funds and investing surplus cash, the treasurer is facing an efficient market. The treasurer can usually improve the bottom line only by taking additional risks. The company's hedging program gives the treasurer some scope for making shrewd decisions that increase profits. But it should be remembered that the goal of a hedging program is to reduce risks, not to increase expected profits. As pointed out in Chapter 3, the decision to hedge will lead to a worse outcome than the decision not to hedge roughly. $50\%$ of the time. The danger of making the treasury department a profit center is that. the treasurer is motivated to become a speculator. This is liable to lead to the type of outcome experienced by Orange County, Procter & Gamble, or Gibson Greetings..  

# SUMMARY  

The huge losses experienced from the use of derivatives have made many treasurers very. wary. Following some of the losses, some nonfinancial corporations have announced. plans to reduce or even eliminate their use of derivatives. This is unfortunate because derivatives provide treasurers with very efficient ways to manage risks..  

The stories behind the losses emphasize the point, made as early as Chapter 1, that derivatives can be used for either hedging or speculation; that is, they can be used either to reduce risks or to take risks. Most losses occurred because derivatives were used inappropriately. Employees who had an implicit or explicit mandate to hedge their company's risks decided instead to speculate.  

The key lesson to be learned from the losses is the importance of internal controls. Senior management within a company should issue a clear and unambiguous policy statement about how derivatives are to be used and the extent to which it is permissible for employees to take positions on movements in market variables. Management should then institute controls to ensure that the policy is carried out. It is a recipe for disaster to give individuals authority to trade derivatives without a close monitoring of the risks being taken.
