# 37.1 LESSONS FOR ALL USERS OF DERIVATIVES  

First, we consider the lessons appropriate to all users of derivatives, whether they are financial or nonfinancial companies.  

Business Snapshot 37.1 Big Losses by Financial Institutions  

Allied Irish Bank  

This bank lost about $\$700$ million from speculative activities of one of its foreign. exchange traders, John Rusnak, that lasted a number of years. Rusnak managed to cover up his losses by creating fictitious option trades..  

Amaranth  

This hedge fund lost $\$6$ billion in 2006 betting on the future direction of natural gas prices.  

Barings  

This 200-year-old British bank was destroyed in 1995 by the activities of one trader, Nick Leeson,in Singapore, who made big bets on the future direction of the Nikkei 225. using futures and options. The total loss was close to. $\$1$ billion.  

Enron's counterparties  

Enron managed to conceal its true situation from its shareholders with some creative contracts. Several financial institutions that allegedly helped Enron do this have settled shareholder lawsuits for over $\$1$ billion.  

Kidder Peabody (see Business Snapshot 5.1)  

The activities of a single trader, Joseph Jett, led to this New York investment dealer losing $\$350$ million trading U.S. government securities. The loss arose because of a mistake in the way the company's computer system calculated profits.  

Long-Term Capital Management (see Business Snapshot 2.2)  

This hedge fund lost about. $\$4$ billion in 1998 as a result of Russia's default on its debt. and the resultant flight to quality. The New York Federal Reserve organized an orderly liquidation of the fund by arranging for 14 banks to invest in the fund..  

# Midland Bank  

This British bank lost $\$500$ million in the early 1990s largely because of a wrong bet on the direction of interest rates. It was later taken over by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).  

Societe Generale (see Business Snapshot 1.4)  

Jerome Kerviel lost over $\$7$ billion speculating on the future direction of equity indices in January 2008.  

Subprime Mortgage Losses (see Chapter 8)  

In 2007 investors lost confidence in the structured products created from U.S. subprime mortgages. This led to a "credit crunch"' and losses of tens of billions of dollars by financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup.  

UBS  

In 2011, Kweku Adoboli lost $\$2.3$ billion by taking unauthorized speculative positions in stock market indices.  

# Business Snapshot 37.2 Big Losses by Nonfinancial Organizations  

Allied Lyons  

The treasury department of this drinks and food company lost $\$150$ million in 1991 selling call options on the U.S. dollar-sterling exchange rate.  

Gibson Greetings  

The treasury department of this greeting card manufacturer lost about $\$20$ million in 1994 trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It later sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court..  

Hammersmith and Fulham (see Business Snapshot 7.2) This British Local Authority lost about $\$600$ million on sterling interest rate swaps and options in 1988. All its contracts were later declared null and void by the British courts, much to the annoyance of the banks on the other side of the transactions.  

Metallgesellschaft (see Business Snapshot 3.2)   
This German company entered into long-term contracts to supply oil and gasoline and hedged them by rolling over short-term futures contracts. It lost $\$1.3$ billion when it was forced to discontinue this activity..  

Orange County (see Business Snapshot 4.1)  

The activities of the treasurer, Robert Citron, led to this California municipality losing about $\$2$ billion in 1994. The treasurer was using derivatives to speculate that. interest rates would not rise..  

Procter & Gamble (see Business Snapshot 34.4)  

The treasury department of this large U.S. company lost about $\$90$ million in 1994 trading highly exotic interest rate derivatives contracts with Bankers Trust. It later sued Bankers Trust and settled out of court.  

Shell  

A single employee working in the Japanese subsidiary of this company lost $\$1$ billion dollars in unauthorized trading of currency futures.  

Sumitomo  

A single trader working for this Japanese company lost about $\$2$ billion in the copper spot, futures, and options market in the 1990s.  

# Define Risk Limits  

It is essential that all companies define in a clear and unambiguous way limits to the. financial risks that can be taken. They should then set up procedures for ensuring that. the limits are obeyed. Ideally, overall risk limits should be set at board level. These. should then be converted to limits applicable to the individuals responsible for managing particular risks. Daily reports should indicate the gain or loss that will be experienced for particular movements in market variables. These should be checked against the actual gains and losses that are experienced to ensure that the valuation. procedures underlying the reports are accurate..  

It is particularly important that companies monitor risks carefully when derivatives are used. This is because, as we saw in Chapter 1, derivatives can be used for hedging,.  

speculation, and arbitrage. Without close monitoring, it is impossible to know whether a derivatives trader has switched from being a hedger to a speculator or switched from being an arbitrageur to being a speculator. The Barings, Societe Generale, and UBS losses are classic examples of what can go wrong. In each case, the trader's mandate was to carry out low-risk arbitrage or hedging. Unknown to their supervisors, the traders switched from being arbitrageurs or hedgers to taking huge bets on the future direction of market variables. Systems at their banks were so inadequate that nobody knew the full extent of what they were doing.  

The argument here is not that no risks should be taken. A trader in a financial. institution or a fund manager should be allowed to take positions on the future direction of relevant market variables. But the sizes of the positions that can be taken should be limited and the systems in place should accurately report the risks being taken..  

# Take the Risk Limits Seriously  

What happens if an individual exceeds risk limits and makes a profit? This is a tricky. issue for senior management. It is tempting to ignore violations of risk limits when profits result. However, this is shortsighted. It leads to a culture where risk limits are not taken seriously, and it paves the way for a disaster. In some of the situations listed in Business Snapshots 37.1 and 37.2, the companies had become complacent about the risks they were taking because they had taken similar risks in previous years and made profits.  

A classic example here is Orange County. Robert Citron's activities in 1991-93 had been very profitable for Orange County, and the municipality had come to rely on his trading for additional funding. People chose to ignore the risks he was taking because he had produced profits. Unfortunately, the losses made in 1994 far exceeded the profits from previous years.  

The penalties for exceeding risk limits should be just as great when profits result as when losses result. Otherwise, traders who make losses are liable to find a way of temporarily hiding their losses so that they can increase their bets in the hope that eventually a profit will result and all will be forgiven.  

# Do Not Assume You Can Outguess the Market  

Some traders are quite possibly better than others. But no trader gets it right all the.   
time.A trader who correctly predicts the direction in which market variables will move $60\%$ of the time is doing well. If a trader has an outstanding track record (as Robert.   
Citron did in the early 1990s), it is likely to be a result of luck rather than superior.   
trading skill.  

Suppose that a financial institution employs 16 traders and one of those traders makes profits in every quarter of a year. Should the trader receive a good bonus? Should the trader's risk limits be increased? The answer to the first question is that inevitably the trader will receive a good bonus. The answer to the second question should be no. The chance of making a profit in four consecutive quarters from random trading is $0.5^{4}$ or 1 in 16. This means that just by chance one of the 16 traders will "get it right" every single quarter of the year. It should not be assumed that the trader's luck will continue and the trader's risk limits should not be increased.  

# Do Not Underestimate the Benefits of Diversification  

When a trader appears good at predicting a particular market variable, there is a. tendency to increase the trader's limits. We have just argued that this is a bad idea because it is quite likely that the trader has been lucky rather than clever. However, let us suppose that a fund is really convinced that the trader has special talents. How undiversified should it allow itself to become in order to take advantage of the trader's special skills? The answer is that the benefits from diversification are huge, and it may. not be the best strategy to forego these benefits to speculate heavily on just one market. variable.  

An example will illustrate the point here. Suppose that there are 20 stocks, each of which have an expected return of. $10\%$ per annum and a standard deviation of returns of $30\%$ . The correlation between the returns from any two of the stocks is 0.2. By dividing an investment equally among the 20 stocks, an investor has an expected return. of $10\%$ per annum and standard deviation of returns of. $14.7\%$ . Diversification enables the investor to reduce risks by over half. Another way of expressing this is that diversification enables an investor to double the expected return per unit of risk taken. The investor would have to be very good at stock picking to consistently get a better risk-. return trade-off by investing in just one stock.  

# Carry out Scenario Analyses and Stress Tests  

The calculation of risk measures such as value at risk and expected shortfall should always be accompanied by scenario analyses and stress testing to obtain an understanding of what can go wrong. They are very important. Human beings have an unfortunate tendency to anchor on one or two scenarios when evaluating decisions. In 1993 and 1994, for example, Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings may have been so convinced that interest rates would remain low that they ignored the possibility of a 100-basis-point increase in their decision making.  

It is important to be creative in the way scenarios are generated and to use the judgment of experienced managers. One approach is to look at 20 or 30 years of data and choose the most extreme events as scenarios. Sometimes there is a shortage of data on a key variable. It is then sensible to choose a similar variable for which much more data is available and use historical daily percentage changes in that variable as a proxy for possible daily percentage changes in the key variable. For example, if there is little data on the prices of bonds issued by a particular country, historical data on prices of bonds issued by other similar countries can be used to develop possible scenarios.
