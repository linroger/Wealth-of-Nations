# 25.3 CREDIT INDICES  

Participants in credit markets have developed indices to track credit default swap spreads. In 2004 there were agreements between different producers of indices that led to some consolidation. Two important standard portfolios used by index providers are:.  

1. CDX NA IG, a portfolio of 125 investment grade companies in North America   
2. iTraxx Europe, a portfolio of 125 investment grade names in Europe  

These portfolios are updated on March 20 and September 20 each year. Companies that. are no longer investment grade are dropped from the portfolios and new investment grade companies are added.  

Suppose that the 5-year CDX NA IG index is quoted by a market maker as bid 65 basis points, ask 66 basis points per dollar of notional principal. (This is referred to as the index spread.) Roughly speaking, this means that a trader can buy CDS protection on all 125 companies in the index for 66 basis points per company. Suppose a trader wants $\$800,000$ of protection on each company. The total cost is $0.0066\times800,000\times125$ , or $\$660,000$ per year. The trader can similarly sell $\$800,000$ of protection on each of the 125 companies for a total of $\$650,000$ per annum. When a company defaults, the protection buyer receives the usual CDS payoff and the annual payment is reduced by $660,000/125=\$280$ The most common maturity for an index CDS is 5 years, but contracts also trade with maturities of 3, 7, and 10 years. The maturity dates for these types of contracts on the index are usually December 20 and June 20. (This means that a "5-year" contract actually lasts between $4{\frac{3}{4}}$ and $5{\frac{1}{4}}$ years.) Roughly speaking, the index is the average of the CDS spreads on the companies in the underlying portfolio.6
