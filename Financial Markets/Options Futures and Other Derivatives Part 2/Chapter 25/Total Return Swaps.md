# 25.7  TOTAL RETURN SWAPS  

A total return swap is a type of credit derivative. It is an agreement to exchange the total return on a bond (or any portfolio of assets) for a floating rate plus a spread. The. total return includes coupons, interest, and the gain or loss on the asset over the life of. the swap.  

An example of a total return swap is a 5-year agreement with a notional principal of $\$100$ million to exchange the total return on a corporate bond for the floating rate plus 25 basis points. This is illustrated in Figure 25.2. On coupon payment dates the payer pays the coupons earned on an investment of $\$100$ million in the bond. The receiver. pays interest at the floating rate plus 25 basis points on a principal of $\$100$ million. At the end of the life of the swap there is a payment reflecting the change in value of the bond. For example, if the bond increases in value by $10\%$ over the life of the swap, the. payer is required to pay $\$10$ million $(=10\%$ of $\$100$ million) at the end of the 5 years.. Similarly, if the bond decreases in value by. $15\%$ , the receiver is required to pay $\$15$ million at the end of the 5 years. If there is a default on the bond, the swap is usually terminated and the receiver makes a final payment equal to the excess of $\$100$ million over the market value of the bond.

Figure 25.2 Total return swap.  

If the notional principal is added to both sides at the end of the life of the swap, the. total return swap can be characterized as follows. The payer pays the cash flows on an investment of $\$100$ million in the corporate bond. The receiver pays the cash flows on a. $\$100$ million bond paying the floating rate plus 25 basis points. If the payer owns the. corporate bond, the total return swap allows it to pass the credit risk on the bond to the receiver. If it does not own the bond, the total return swap allows it to take a short position in the bond.  

Total return swaps are often used as a financing tool. One scenario that could lead to the swap in Figure 25.2 is as follows. The receiver wants financing to invest $\$100$ million in the reference bond. It approaches the payer (which is likely to be a financial. institution) and agrees to the swap. The payer then invests. $\$100$ million in the bond.. This leaves the receiver in the same position as it would have been if it had borrowed. money at the floating rate plus 25 basis points to buy the bond. The payer retains ownership of the bond for the life of the swap and faces less credit risk than it would have done if it had lent money to the receiver to finance the purchase of the bond, with the bond being used as collateral for the loan. If the receiver defaults the payer does not have the legal problem of trying to realize on the collateral. Total return swaps are similar to repos (see Section 4.1) in that they are structured to minimize credit risk when. securities are being financed..  

The spread over the floating rate received by the payer is compensation for bearing the risk that the receiver will default. The payer will lose money if the receiver defaults at a time when the reference bond's price has declined. The spread therefore depends on the credit quality of the receiver, the credit quality of the bond issuer, and the correlation between the two.  

There are a number of variations on the standard deal we have described. Sometimes, instead of there being a cash payment for the change in value of the bond, there is physical settlement where the payer exchanges the underlying asset for the notional principal at the end of the life of the swap. Sometimes the change-in-value payments are made periodically rather than all at the end.
