# 25.5  CDS FORWARDS AND OPTIONS  

Once the CDS market was well established, it was natural for derivatives dealers to trade forwards and options on credit default swap spreads.8.  

A forward credit default swap is the obligation to buy or sell a particular credit default swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time. $T$ If the reference entity defaults before time. $T$ the forward contract ceases to exist. Thus a. bank could enter into a forward contract to sell 5-year protection on a company for 280 basis points starting in 1 year. If the company defaulted before the 1-year point, the forward contract would cease to exist.  

A credit default swap option is an option to buy or sell a particular credit default swap on a particular reference entity at a particular future time T. For example, a trader could negotiate the right to buy 5-year protection on a company starting in 1 year for 280 basis points. This is a call option. If the 5-year CDS spread for the company in 1 year turns out to be more than 280 basis points, the option will be exercised;. otherwise it will not be exercised. The cost of the option would be paid up front.. Similarly an investor might negotiate the right to sell 5-year protection on a company. for 280 basis points starting in 1 year. This is a put option. If the 5-year CDS spread for. the company in 1 year turns out to be less than 280 basis points, the option will be exercised; otherwise it will not be exercised. Again the cost of the option would be paid up front. Like CDS forwards, CDS options are usually structured so that they cease to exist if the reference entity defaults before option maturity.  

# 25.6 BASKET CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS  

In what is referred to as a basket credit default swap there are a number of reference entities. An add-up basket CDS provides a payoff when any of the reference entities default. A first-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the first default occurs. A. second-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the second default occurs. More. generally, a kth-to-default CDS provides a payoff only when the kth default occurs. Payoffs are calculated in the same way as for a regular CDS. After the relevant default has occurred, there is a settlement. The swap then terminates and there are no further payments by either party.
