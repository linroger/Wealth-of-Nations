# 36.1 CAPITAL INVESTMENT APPRAISAL  

The traditional approach to valuing a potential capital investment project is the "net. present value' (NPV) approach. The NPV of a project is the present value of its. expected future incremental cash flows. The discount rate used to calculate the present value is a "risk-adjusted" discount rate, chosen to reflect the risk of the project. As the riskiness of the project increases, the discount rate also increases.  

As an example, consider an investment that costs $\$100$ million and will last 5 years. The expected cash inflow in each year (in the real world) is estimated to be $\$25$ million. If the risk-adjusted discount rate is $12\%$ (with continuous compounding), the net present value of the investment is (in millions of dollars)  

$$
-100+25e^{-0.12\times1}+25e^{-0.12\times2}+25e^{-0.12\times3}+25e^{-0.12\times4}+25e^{-0.12\times5}=-11.53
$$  

A negative NPV, such as the one we have just calculated, indicates that the project will reduce the value of the company to its shareholders and should not be undertaken. A positive NPV would indicate that the project should be undertaken because it will increase shareholder wealth.  

The risk-adjusted discount rate should be the return required by the company, or the company's shareholders, on the investment. This can be calculated in a number of ways. One approach often recommended involves the capital asset pricing model (see the. appendix to Chapter 3). The steps are as follows:.  

1. Take a sample of companies whose main line of business is the same as that of the project being contemplated.   
2. Calculate the betas of the companies and average them to obtain a proxy beta for the project.   
3. Set the required rate of return equal to the risk-free rate plus the proxy beta times the excess return of the market portfolio over the risk-free rate.  

One problem with the traditional NPV approach is that many projects contain. embedded options. Consider, for example, a company that is considering building a plant to manufacture a new product. Often the company has the option to abandon the. project if things do not work out well. It may also have the option to expand the plant if demand for the output exceeds expectations. These options usually have quite different risk characteristics from the base project and require different discount rates..  

To understand the problem here,return to the example at the beginning of Chapter 13. This involved a stock whose current price is $\$20.$ In three months the price will be either $\$22$ or $\$18$ Risk-neutral valuation shows that the value of a three-month call option on the stock with a strike price of 21 is 0.545. Footnote 1 of Chapter 13 shows that if the expected return required by investors on the stock in the real world is $10\%$ then the expected return required on the call option is $55.96\%$ .A similar analysis shows that if the option is a put rather than a call the expected return required on the option is $-70.4\%$ These analyses mean that if the traditional NPV approach were used to value the call option the correct discount rate would be $55.96\%$ , and if it were used to value a put option the correct discount rate would be $-70.4\%$ . There is no easy way of estimating these discount rates. (We know them only because we are able to value the options another way.) Similarly, there is no easy way of estimating the risk-adjusted discount rates appropriate for cash flows when they arise from abandonment, expansion, and other options. This is the motivation for exploring whether the risk-neutral valuation principle can be applied to options on real assets as well as to options on financial assets.  

Another problem with the traditional NPV approach lies in the estimation of the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for the base project (i.e., the project without embedded options). The companies that are used to estimate a proxy beta for the project in the three-step procedure above have expansion options and abandonment options of their own. Their betas reflect these options and may not therefore be appropriate for estimating a beta for the base project.
