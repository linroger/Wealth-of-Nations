# 36.4  APPLICATION TO THE VALUATION OF A BUSINESS  

Traditional methods of business valuation, such as applying a price/earnings multiplier.   
to current earnings, do not work well for new businesses. Typically a company's.   
earnings are negative during its early years as it attempts to gain market share and establish relationships with customers. The company must be valued by estimating.   
future earnings and cash flows under different scenarios..  

The real options approach can be useful in this situation. A model relating the company's future cash flows to variables such as the sales growth rates, variable costs as a percent of sales, fixed costs, and so on, is developed. For key variables, a risk-neutral stochastic process is estimated as outlined in the previous two sections. A Monte Carlo simulation is then carried out to generate alternative scenarios for the net cash flows per year in a risk-neutral world. It is likely that under some of these scenarios the company. does very well and under others it becomes bankrupt and ceases operations. (The. simulation must have a built in rule for determining when bankruptcy happens.) The value of the company is the present value of the expected cash flow in each year using. the risk-free rate for discounting. Business Snapshot 36.1 gives an example of the application of the approach to Amazon.com in its early days..
