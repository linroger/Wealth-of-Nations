# 24.3 RECOVERY RATES  

When a company goes bankrupt, those that are owed money by the company file claims.   
against the assets of the company.' Sometimes there is a reorganization in which these.   
creditors agree to a partial payment of their claims. In other cases, the assets are sold by.   
the liquidator and the proceeds are used to meet the claims as far as possible. Some claims typically have priority over other claims and are met more fully..  

The recovery rate for a bond is normally defined as the bond's market value shortly after default, as a percent of its face value. The recovery rate depends on the seniority of the bond (i.e., the extent to which it receives repayment before other creditors) and the security (i.e., the collateral, if any, that has been provided). An average recovery rate that is often assumed is $40\%$  

# The Dependence of Recovery Rates on Default Rates  

In Chapter 8, we saw that one of the lessons from the financial crisis of 2007-8 is that the average recovery rate on mortgages is negatively related to the mortgage default rate. As. the mortgage default rate increases, foreclosures lead to more houses being offered for. sale and a decline in house prices. This in turn results in a decline in recovery rates..  

The average recovery rate on corporate bonds exhibits a similar negative dependence on default rates.? In a year when the number of bonds defaulting is low, economic conditions are usually good and the average recovery rate on those bonds that do default might be as high as. $60\%$ ; in a year when the default rate on corporate bonds is high, economic conditions are usually poor and the average recovery rate on the defaulting bonds might be as low as. $30\%$ . The result of the negative dependence is that a bad year. for defaults is doubly bad for a lender because it is usually accompanied by a low recovery rate.
