# 35.2 METALS  

Another important commodity category is metals. This includes gold, silver, platinum, palladium, copper, tin, lead, zinc, nickel, and aluminum. Metals have quite different characteristics from agricultural commodities. Their prices are unaffected by the weather and are not seasonal. They are extracted from the ground. They are divisible and are relatively easy to store. Some metals, such as copper, are used almost entirely in the manufacture of goods and should be classified as consumption assets. As explained in Section 5.1, others, such as gold and silver, are held purely for investment as well as for consumption and should be classified as investment assets.  

As in the case of agricultural commodities, analysts monitor inventory levels to determine short-term price volatility. Exchange rate volatility may also contribute to. volatility as the country where the metal is extracted is often different from the country. in whose currency the price is quoted. In the long term, the price of a metal is determined by trends in the extent to which a metal is used in different production processes and new sources of the metal that are found. Changes in exploration and. extraction methods, geopolitics, cartels, and environmental regulation also have an impact.  

One potential source of supply for a metal is recycling. A metal might be used to create a product and, over the following 20 years,. $10\%$ of the metal might come back on. the market as a result of a recycling process..  

Metals that are investment assets are not usually assumed to follow mean-reverting. processes because a mean-reverting process would give rise to an arbitrage opportunity. for the investor. For metals that are consumption assets, there may be some mean reversion. As the price of a metal increases, it is likely to become less attractive to use the metal in some production processes and more economically viable to extract the metal from difficult locations. As a result there will be downward pressure on the price. Similarly, as the price decreases, it is likely to become more attractive to use the metal in some production processes and less economically viable to extract the metal from difficult locations. As a result, there will be upward pressure on the price.
