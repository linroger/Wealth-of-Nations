# 35.1 AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES  

Agricultural commodities include products that are grown (or created from products that are grown) such as corn, wheat, soybeans, cocoa, coffee, sugar, cotton, and frozen orange juice. They also include products related to livestock such as cattle, hogs, and pork bellies. The prices of agricultural commodities, like all commodities, is determined by supply and demand. The U.S. Department of Agriculture publishes reports on inventories and production. One statistic that is watched for commodities such as corn and wheat is the stocks-to-use ratio. This is the ratio of the year-end inventory to the year's usage. Typically it is between $20\%$ and $40\%$ . It has an impact on price volatility. As the ratio for a commodity becomes lower, the commodity's price becomes more sensitive to supply changes, so that the volatility increases.  

There are reasons for supposing some level of mean reversion in agricultural prices. As prices decline, farmers find it less attractive to produce the commodity and supply decreases creating upward pressure on the price. Similarly, as the price of an agricultural commodity increases, farmers are more likely to devote resources to producing the commodity creating downward pressure on the price.  

Prices of agricultural commodities tend to be seasonal, as storage is expensive and there is a limit to the length of time for which a product can be stored. Weather plays a key role in determining the price of many agricultural products. Frosts can decimate the Brazilian coffee crop, a hurricane in Florida is likely to have a big effect on the price of frozen orange juice, and so on. The volatility of the price of a commodity that is grown tends to be highest at pre-harvest times and then declines when the size of the crop is known. During the growing season, the price process for an agricultural commodity is liable to exhibit jumps because of the weather.  

Many of the commodities that are grown and traded are used to feed livestock. (For example, the corn futures contract that is traded by the CME Group refers to the corn that is used to feed animals.) The price of livestock, and when slaughtering takes place, is liable to be dependent on the price of these commodities, which are in turn influenced by the weather.
