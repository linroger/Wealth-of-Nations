# 35.3 ENERGY PRODUCTS  

Energy products are among the most important and actively traded commodities.. A wide range of energy derivatives trade in both the over-the-counter market and on. exchanges. Here we consider oil, natural gas, and electricity. There are reasons for supposing that all three follow mean reverting processes. As the price of a source of energy rises, it is likely to be consumed less and and produced more. This creates a downward pressure on prices. As the price of a source of energy declines, it is likely to. be consumed more, but production is likely to be less economically viable. This creates upward pressure on the price.  

# Crude Oil  

The crude oil market is the largest commodity market in the world, with global demand amounting to about 90 million barrels daily. Ten-year fixed-price supply contracts have. been commonplace in the over-the-counter market for many years. These are swaps where oil at a fixed price is exchanged for oil at a floating price..  

There are many grades of crude oil, reflecting variations in the gravity and the sulfur content. Two important benchmarks for pricing are Brent crude oil (which is sourced from the North Sea) and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. Crude oil is refined into products such as gasoline, heating oil, fuel oil, and kerosene.  

In the over-the-counter market, virtually any derivative that is available on common. stocks or stock indices is now available with oil as the underlying asset. Swaps, forward contracts, and options are popular. Contracts sometimes require settlement in cash and sometimes require settlement by physical delivery (i.e., by delivery of oil)..  

Exchange-traded contracts are also popular. The CME Group and Intercontinental. Exchange (ICE) trade a number of oil futures and oil futures options contracts. Some of the futures contracts are settled in cash; others are settled by physical delivery. For example, the Brent crude oil futures traded on ICE have a cash settlement option; the. light sweet crude oil futures traded on CME Group require physical delivery. In both. cases, the amount of oil underlying one contract is 1,000 barrels. The CME Group also trades popular contracts on two refined products: heating oil and gasoline. In both. cases, one contract is for the delivery of 42,000 gallons.  

# Natural Gas  

The natural gas industry throughout the world went through a period of deregulation.   
and the elimination of government monopolies in the 1980s and 1990s. The supplier of.   
natural gas is now not necessarily the same company as the producer of the gas.   
Suppliers are faced with the problem of meeting daily demand..  

A typical over-the-counter contract is for the delivery of a specified amount of. natural gas at a roughly uniform rate over a 1-month period. Forward contracts,. options, and swaps are available in the over-the-counter market. The seller of natural gas is usually responsible for moving the gas through pipelines to the specified. location.  

The CME Group trades a contract for the delivery of 10,000 million British thermal units of natural gas. The contract, if not closed out, requires physical delivery to be made during the delivery month at a roughly uniform rate to a particular hub in Louisiana. ICE trades a similar contract in London.  

Natural gas is a popular source of energy for heating buildings. It is also used to produce electricity, which in turn is used for air-conditioning. As a result, demand for natural gas is seasonal and dependent on the weather.  

# Electricity  

Electricity is an unusual commodity because it cannot easily be stored.1 The maximum. supply of electricity in a region at any moment is determined by the maximum capacity of all the electricity-producing plants in the region. In the United States there are 140 regions known as control areas. Demand and supply are first matched within a. control area, and any excess power is sold to other control areas. It is this excess power that constitutes the wholesale market for electricity. The ability of one control area to sell power to another control area depends on the transmission capacity of the lines between the two areas. Transmission from one area to another involves a transmission cost, charged by the owner of the line, and there are generally some transmission or energy losses.  

A major use of electricity is for air-conditioning systems. As a result the demand for. electricity, and therefore its price, is much greater in the summer months than in the. winter months. The nonstorability of electricity causes occasional very large movements. in the spot price. Heat waves have been known to increase the spot price by as much as $1\small{,}000\%$ for short periods of time.  

Like natural gas, electricity has been through a period of deregulation and the elimination of government monopolies. This has been accompanied by the development of an electricity derivatives market. The CME Group now trades a futures contract on the price of electricity, and there is an active over-the-counter market in forward contracts, options, and swaps. A typical contract (exchange-traded or over-the-counter) allows one side to receive a specified number of megawatt hours for a specified price at a specified location during a particular month. In a $5\times8$ contract, power is received for five days a week (Monday to Friday) during the off-peak period ( $11\mathrm{p.m}$ . to 7 a.m.) for the specified month. In a $5\times16$ contract, power is received five days a week during the on-peak period (7 a.m. to $11{\mathrm{~p.m.}}$ ) for the specified month. In a $7\times24$ contract, it is received around the clock every day during the month. Option contracts have either daily exercise or monthly exercise. In the case of daily exercise, the option holder can choose on each day of the month (by giving one day's notice) whether to receive the specified amount of power at the specified strike price. When there is monthly exercise a single decision on whether to receive power for the whole month at the specified strike price is made at the beginning of the month..  

An interesting contract in electricity and natural gas markets is what is known as a swing option or take-and-pay option. In this contract, a minimum and maximum for the. amount of power that must be purchased at a certain price by the option holder is specified for each day during a month and for the month in total. The option holder. can change (or swing) the rate at which the power is purchased during the month, but usually there is a limit on the total number of changes that can be made..
