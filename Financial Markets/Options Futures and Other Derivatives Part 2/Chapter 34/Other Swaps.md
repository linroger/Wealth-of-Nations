# 34.6 OTHER SWAPS  

This chapter has discussed just a few of the swap structures in the market. In practice, the range of different contracts that trade is limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the appetite of corporate treasurers for innovative risk management tools.  

A swap that was very popular in the United States in the mid-1990s is an index amortizing rate swap (also called an indexed principal swap). In this, the principal reduces in a way dependent on the level of interest rates. The lower the interest rate, the greater the reduction in the principal. The fixed side of an indexed amortizing swap was originally designed to mirror approximately the return obtained by an investor on an agency mortgage-backed security after prepayment options are taken into account. The swap therefore exchanged the return on the mortgage-backed security for a floating-rate return.  

Commodity swaps are now becoming increasingly popular. A company that consumes 100,000 barrels of oil per year could agree to pay $\$5$ million each year for the next. 10 years and to receive in return 100,000S, where $S$ is the market price of oil per barrel.. The agreement would in effect lock in the company's oil cost at $\$50$ per barrel. An oil. producer might agree to the opposite exchange, thereby locking in the price it realized for its oil at. $\$50$ per barrel. Energy derivatives such as this will be discussed in Chapter 35.  

A number of other types of swaps are discussed elsewhere in this book. For example,. asset swaps are discussed in Chapter 24, total return swaps and various types of credit default swaps are covered in Chapter 25, and volatility and variance swaps are analyzed in Chapter 26.  

# Business Snapshot 34.4 Procter and Gamble's Bizarre Deal  

A particularly bizarre swap is the so-called "5/30" swap entered into between Bankers Trust (BT) and Procter and Gamble (P&G) on November 2, 1993. This was a 5-year swap with semiannual payments. The notional principal was. $\$200$ million. BT paid P&G $5.30\%$ per annum. P&G paid BT the average 30-day CP (commercial paper) rate minus 75 basis points plus a spread. The average commercial paper rate was calculated by taking observations on the 30-day commercial paper rate each day during the preceding accrual period and averaging them..  

The spread was zero for the first payment date (May 2, 1994). For the remaining nine payment dates, it was  

In this, 5-year CMT is the constant maturity Treasury yield (i.e., the yield on a 5-year Treasury note, as reported by the U.S. Federal Reserve). The 30-year TSY price is the midpoint of the bid and ask cash bond prices for the $6.25\%$ Treasury bond maturing on August 2023. Note that the spread calculated from the formula is a decimal interest rate. It is not measured in basis points. If the formula gives 0.1 and the CP rate is $6\%$ , the rate paid by P&G is $15.25\%$  

P&G were hoping that the spread would be zero and the deal would enable it to. exchange fixed-rate funding at $5.30\%$ for funding at 75 basis points less than the. commercial paper rate. In fact, interest rates rose sharply in early 1994, bond prices fell, and the swap proved very, very expensive (see Problem 34.7)..  

# Bizarre Deals  

Some swaps have payoffs that are calculated in quite bizarre ways. An example is a deal. entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers Trust in 1993 (see Business Snapshot 34.4). The details of this transaction are in the public domain because it later became the subject of litigation.6  

# SUMMARY  

Swaps have proved to be very versatile financial instruments. Many swaps can be valued by (a) assuming that the floating reference rate will equal its forward value and (b) discounting the resulting cash flows. These include plain vanilla interest swaps, most types of currency swaps, swaps where the principal changes in a predetermined way, swaps where the payment dates are different on each side, and compounding swaps.  

Some swaps require the adjustments to the forward rates discussed in Chapter 30 when they are valued. These adjustments are termed convexity, timing, or quanto adjustments.  

Equity swaps involve the return on an equity index being exchanged for a fixed or. floating rate of interest. They are usually designed so that they are worth zero immediately after a payment date, but they may have nonzero values between payment dates..  

Some swaps involve embedded options. An accrual swap is a regular swap plus a. large portfolio of binary options (one for each day of the life of the swap). A cancelable swap is a regular swap plus a Bermudan swaption..

# Practice Questions  

34.1. Calculate all the fixed cash flows and their exact timing for the swap in Business. Snapshot 34.1. Assume that the day count conventions are applied using target payment dates rather than actual payment dates.   
34.2. Suppose that a swap specifies that a fixed rate is exchanged for twice a floating rate. Can the swap be valued using the "assume forward rates are realized"' rule?   
34.3. What is the value of a 2-year fixed-for-floating compounding swap where the principal is $\$100$ million and payments are made semiannually? Fixed interest is received and floating. is paid. The fixed rate is $3\%$ per annum and fixed cash flows are compounded every six months at a rate of $3.3\%$ per annum. (Both the $3\%$ and $3.3\%$ are expressed with semiannual compounding.) The floating rate is a risk-free rate plus 10 basis points and it is compounded at the risk-free rate plus 20 basis points. The risk-free zero curve is flat at $3\%$ with semiannual compounding.   
34.4. What is the value of a 5-year swap where a risk-free floating rate is paid in the usual way and in return the risk-free rate compounded at the risk-free rate is received on the other side? The principal on both sides is $\$100$ million. Payment dates on the pay side and compounding dates on the receive side are every 3 months. The risk-free zero curve is flat at $2\%$ with quarterly compounding..   
34.5. In the accrual swap discussed in the text, the fixed side accrues only when the floating. reference rate lies below a certain level. Discuss how the analysis can be extended to cope with a situation where the fixed side accrues only when the floating reference rate is between two levels.   
34.6. Risk-free zero rates are flat at. $2\%$ in the United States and flat at. $5\%$ in Australia (both annually compounded). In a 4-year diff swap the Australian floating risk-free rate is. received and $4\%$ is paid, with both being applied to a USD principal of $\$10$ million. Payments are exchanged annually. The volatility of all 1-year forward rates in Australia is estimated to be $25\%$ , the volatility of the forward USD/AUD exchange rate (AUD per USD) is $15\%$ for all maturities, and the correlation between the two is 0.3. What is the. value of the swap?  

34.7. Estimate the interest rate paid by P&G on the $5/30$ swap in Section 34.6 if (a) the CP rate is $6.5\%$ and the Treasury yield curve is flat at $6\%$ and (b) the CP rate is. $7.5\%$ and the Treasury yield curve is flat at. $7\%$ with semiannual compounding.

# Energy and Commodity Derivatives  

The variable underlying a derivative is sometimes simply referred to as the underlying.. Earlier parts of this book have focused on situations where the underlying is a stock price, a stock index, an exchange rate, a bond price, an interest rate, or the loss from a credit event. In this chapter, we consider a variety of other underlyings..  

The first part of the chapter is concerned with situations where the underlying is a. commodity. Chapter 2 discussed futures contracts on commodities and Chapter 18 discussed how European and American options on commodity futures contracts can be valued. As a European futures option has the same payoff as a European spot option when the futures contract matures at the same time as the option, the model used to value European futures options (Black's model) can also be used to value European spot options. However, American spot options and other more complicated derivatives dependent on the spot price of a commodity require more sophisticated models. A feature of commodity prices is that they often exhibit mean reversion (similarly to interest rates) and are also sometimes subject to jumps. Some of the. models developed for interest rates can be adapted to apply to commodities..  

The second part of the chapter considers weather and insurance derivatives. A. distinctive feature ofthese derivatives is that they depend on variables with no systematic risk. For example, the expected value of the temperature at a certain location or the losses experienced due to hurricanes can reasonably be assumed to be the same in a riskneutral world and the real world. This means that historical data is potentially more useful for valuing these types of derivatives than for some others..
