# 26.3 NONSTANDARD AMERICAN OPTIONS  

In a standard American option, exercise can take place at any time during the life of the. option and the exercise price is always the same. The American options that are traded in the over-the-counter market sometimes have nonstandard features. For example:.  

1. Early exercise may be restricted to certain dates. The instrument is then known as a Bermudan option. (Bermuda is between Europe and America!)   
2. Early exercise may be allowed during only part of the life of the option. For example, there may be an initial "lock out" period with no early exercise.   
3. The strike price may change during the life of the option.  

The warrants issued by corporations on their own stock often have some or all of these features. For example, in a 7-year warrant, exercise might be possible on particular dates during years 3 to 7, with the strike price being. $\$30$ during years 3 and 4, $\$32$ during the next 2 years, and $\$33$ during the final year.  

Nonstandard American options can usually be valued using a binomial tree. At each. node, the test (if any) for early exercise is adjusted to reflect the terms of the option.
