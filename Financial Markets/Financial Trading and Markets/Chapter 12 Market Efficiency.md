# Market Efficiency  

# 12.1 INTRODUCTION TO MARKET EFFICIENCY  

An efficient capital market is defined as a market where security prices reflect all available information. More formally, one can state that in an efficient market, the expected price  $E[\tilde{P}]$   of a tradable asset, given the information    $\phi$   available to the market and the information    $\phi_{k}$   available to any investor    $k,$   equals the expected price based on the information available to the market for all investors  $k$  :  

$$
E[\tilde{P}|\phi,\phi_{k}]=E[\tilde{P}|\phi]\ \forall k
$$  

Thus, the price of the asset reflects the consensus evaluation of the market based on the  $k$  information available to the market, regardless of private information held by investor .  $k^{\prime}\mathbf{s}$     $\phi_{k}$  This statement implies that a given individual  information set  not shared with the market does not improve his estimate of expected price in an efficient market; the market price already reflects all relevant information    $\phi$   including investor    $k^{\prime}$  ’s special information  $\phi_{k}$  . In a perfectly efficient market where security prices fully reflect all available information, all security transactions will have zero net present value.  

While we cannot realistically expect markets to be perfectly efficient, it is interesting to study the extent to which markets approach efficiency. For example, what type of information is reflected in security prices? What is the speed of information flow? How much time is required for a particular type of information to be reflected in security prices? Does market reaction to new information (or lack thereof) reflect rational self-serving behavior on the part of investors? If markets were perfectly efficient with regard to a given type of information, investors could not use this type of information to gain higher than normal returns; the information would already be reflected in security prices. Thus, investors might be able to earn abnormal returns if markets were slow to react to new information. Slow reactions to new information suggest that prices are predictable after new information is available.  

If markets are perfectly efficient, then, by definition, securities reflect all available information. One might argue that security prices will fluctuate only as new information is realized by the market. New information should be expected to occur randomly; otherwise, it is not really new. Thus, one should expect prices in an efficient market to fluctuate randomly.  Samuelson (1965)  formalizes this argument in his paper entitled “Proof that Properly Anticipated Prices Fluctuate Randomly.” This means that many tests of market efficiency are concerned with the extent to which security prices fluctuate randomly. Furthermore, since prices in an efficient market properly reflect all that investors know about securities, all transactions, on an ex-ante basis, will have zero net present value. Investors pay for securities exactly what they are worth.  
While one might argue that market efficiency is the necessary product of rationality and greed, and that market survival requires these characteristics of investors who determine price-setting, we already suggested (in Chapter 6, concerning the importance of noise traders) that perfect market efficiency would cause financial markets to fail. Furthermore, we will present arguments later that predictable prices might be perfectly consistent with market efficiency when investors are risk-averse and in certain other circumstances.  

# 12.2 WEAK FORM EFFICIENCY AND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS  

As discussed in the previous section, a capital market is efficient when security prices reflect all available information. One type of relevant information might be historical price sequences or trends.  Technical analysis  is concerned with finding situations where historical price sequences can be used to forecast price movements.  Weak form efficiency tests  are concerned with whether an investor might consistently earn higher than normal returns based on knowledge of historical price sequences and other trading information. One can never prove weak form efficiency because there are an infinite number of potential ways to forecast future returns from past returns. However, one might argue that certain tests imply efficiency (or inefficiency) with regard to a specific sequence or pattern of prices. An investor armed with the knowledge of a test indicating a market inefficiency might expect to earn a higher than normal return, or face a market impediment preventing him from doing so. On the other hand, any test of market inefficiency is actually a joint test for that particular inefficiency and of some model describing normal returns in an efficient market. Thus, market efficiency cannot be fully rejected unless one is certain that the correct model for normal returns has been selected for that market. The selected benchmark model might be some sort of risk-adjusted rate of return, perhaps based on CAPM, or might be as simple as the market return. Furthermore,  Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)  argue that the existence of costly information retrieval and processing must lead to abnormal return sequences to compensate analysts for bearing these costs. Thus, markets cannot be fully or perfectly efficient. In any case, some of the more significant weak form efficiency tests are described in the following paragraphs, following a brief introduction to technical analysis.  

# Technical Analysis: A Brief Introduction  

Technical analysis is concerned with historical market price and volume sequences to evaluate or time securities transactions. Technical analysis is based on the concept that all information regarding securities, including earnings, risk, products, etc. is reflected in market behavior. Market price sequences are of primary importance; many technical analysts focus on charting historical market prices of securities. Also important to many analysts are market volume and information specific to particular market segments.  
The theoretical foundation for technical analysis derives from the following set of assumptions:  

1.  Market value is determined by the interaction of supply and demand, which are functions of a variety of factors, both rational and irrational.

 2.  Security prices tend to move in trends that persist for an appreciable length of time, despite minor fluctuations in the market. Many of these trends will repeat over time in a rather consistent manner.

 3.  Changes in a trend are caused by the shifts in supply and demand.

 4.  Shifts in supply and demand, regardless of why they occur, can be detected sooner or later in charts or sequences of market transactions.  

Many technical analysts assume that security prices and market behavior are based on the “psychology” of the market. This psychology is revealed through historical price sequences and charts. A given sequence or pattern may be associated with a given market psychology, which will result in the same future price outcome as occurred when the same sequences or patterns occurred before. Thus, the market reacts the same way each time it encounters the same psychology as revealed by the price sequence. Much of the remainder of this section will be concerned with various technical rules and techniques and the extent to which markets efficiently capture historical price information.  

# Price Sequences, Momentum and Mean Reversion  

Statisticians and economists with an interest in statistics have long been fascinated by the tremendous amounts of financial data made available by the various data services. For example,  Cowles (1933) ,  Working (1934) , and  Kendall (1953)  studied weak form markets efficiency, or more specifically, the random movement of stock prices. Their results indicated that stock prices seemed to fluctuate randomly, without being influenced by their histories. Such processes are called random walks (see Chapter 7).  

Another of the earlier weak form efficiency tests ( Granger, 1968 ) found a very slight, but statistically significant relationship between historical and current prices:  $0.057\%$   of a given day’s variation in the log of the price relative is explained by the prior day’s in the log of the price relative:  

$$
\ln\!\left(\frac{P_{i,t}}{P_{i,t-1}}\right)=\hat{b}_{0}+\hat{b}_{1}\cdot\ln\!\left(\frac{P_{i,t-1}}{P_{i,t-2}}\right)+\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}
$$  

The r-square value from this regression was 0.00057, where    $P_{i,t}$   represents price of stock  $i$   on a given day  $t,P_{i,t-1}$   the price on the day immediately prior,  $\hat{b}_{0}$   and  $\hat{b}_{1}$   regression coefficients, and  $\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}$   the error terms in the regression. 1  $\mathrm{{Con}}$   the other hand,  Fama and MacBeth (1973) , after adjusting for risk, found no correlation in daily capital asset pricing model (CAPM) residuals.  
A typical testing format assumed that stock returns were produced by the CAPM (or single index model), but that residuals from such a model were uncorrelated with prior day residuals:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{r_{i,t}=r_{f}+\beta_{i}(r_{m,t}-r_{f})+\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}=\hat{a}+\hat{b}_{i}\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t-1}+\hat{\eta}_{i,t}}\end{array}
$$  

where  $r_{i,t}$   represents the return on stock  $i$   on a given day    $t,\,\,\beta_{i}$   its CAPM beta, and  $r_{f}$   the riskless return rate. Error terms (residuals or excess returns)  $\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}$   are then regressed against their prior day values  $\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t-1}$  . The sign of the  $\hat{b}_{i}$   coefficient here would be key. A negative value for  $\hat{b}_{i}$   suggests that sequential returns or price changes are inversely correlated, indicating that stock prices are more likely to drift towards their historical mean values than drift away. Positive values for    $\hat{b}_{i}$   suggest that directions of sequential price changes are likely to be sustained, indicating that price changes might carry momentum. Fama and MacBeth found no (or very little) evidence for either mean reversion or momentum in stock prices.  

Regardless of the analyst’s findings concerning evidence for mean reversion or momentum in stock prices, it is important to note that correlation coefficients can be unduly influenced by extreme observations. This is because returns (or logs of one plus returns) and residuals are not normally distributed as required by CAPM and OLS regression assumptions. One way to deal with such assumption violations is to construct a simple runs test. For example consider the following daily price sequence: 50, 51, 52, 53, 52, 50, 45, 49, 54, and 53. The price changes might be represented by the following:   $(++---++-),$  , indicating four price runs. That is, there were four series of positive or negative price change runs. The expected number of runs in a runs test if price changes are random is  $(\mathbf{M}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{M}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{N})/2,$  , where MAX is the largest number of possible runs (equals the number of prices in the series minus 1) and MIN is the minimum number (1). The number of runs consistent with random sequences in our example is   $5=(9\ +\ 1)/2$  . More runs than this number suggests price reversals (mean reversion), and a smaller number of runs suggests positive correlations between sequential price changes (momentum). Thus, our example might be consistent with slight evidence of momentum, but the sample set is too small to suggest significance. The actual levels of returns are unimportant; only the signs of returns are important, so that extreme observations will not unduly bias tests. In one test of daily price changes,  Fama (1965)  expected 760 runs based on the assumption that price changes were randomly generated, but only found 735 runs. This indicated a small positive correlation in daily stock price changes.  Granger and Morgenstern (1972)  found that high transactions costs seem to be related to runs—investors are unable to exploit a series because of brokerage commissions.  

Nei de rh offer and Osborne (1966)  found two to three times as many reversals of price trends as continuations based on transaction-to-transaction price data. This might be because of unexecuted limit orders—for them to be executed the price has to reverse itself. For example, suppose that a market purchase order has just been executed at an uptick. All of the limit sell orders at this most recent execution price have to be executed for the price to increase again. This means that a purchase is more likely to be followed by a downtick   $(-)$   or no change at all (0) than an uptick   $(+)$  .  
# Relative Strength  

Relative strength trading rules are concerned with the current price of a stock relative to a historical price or the prices of other securities or indices. For example, one relative strength rule compares the current price of a stock to its average price over a given period of time.  Levy (1967) , conducting a test of many such rules, found the following rule to be profitable:  

1.  Rank stocks based on the ratio   $(P_{t}/P_{a v g})$   where  $P_{t}$   is the current price and  $P_{a v g}$   is the average price over the prior 27 weeks.

 2.  Buy the stocks in the highest fifth percentile and sell the stocks in the lowest 70th percentile.  

This rule might suggest that the stocks with the strongest performance over the past 27 weeks will outperform the market. However, this rule might simply mean we buy the riskiest securities (high expected returns) and sell the lowest risk securities. Thus, perhaps, this rule simply means that investors purchasing higher risk stocks are merely compensated with higher returns for bearing this risk.  Jensen and Bennington (1970)  found that relative strength rules worked no better than random purchases of stocks after adjusting for transaction costs and even worse given risk adjustments. They suggest that the success of the rule suggested by Levy is due merely to selection bias, in that Levy had tested 68 different trading rules. That is, one of the 68 trading rules must surely work in his limited size sample of prices.  

# Filter Rules and Market Overreaction  

A filter rule states that a transaction for a security should occur when its price has changed by a given percentage over a specified period of time. For example,  Alexander (1961) , in a study of stock prices from 1897 to 1959, suggested that certain price increases of given proportions indicated upward trends, and should serve as purchase signals. He concluded that there were identifiable trends in security prices, but that these trends varied over time. Other early studies (e.g.,  Fama and Blume, 1966 ) found that when filter rules did seem to work (however slightly), they were not able to cover transactions costs. Profitability of these rules seems to be related to daily correlations. Such correlation and filter rules seemed to work slightly better in Norway, where stronger correlations tended to exist. However, these markets were less liquid and transactions costs were significantly higher in Norwegian markets than in American markets (See, for example,  Jennergren and Korsvold, 1975 .). None of the tested rules seemed to work well enough to cover the particularly high transactions costs. Regardless, the apparent profitability of the filter rules seem directly related to transactions costs, and failed to cover them.  

A few statistical studies suggest that market overreactions to information and abnormal returns can be realized by buying losers and selling winners.  DeBondt and Thaler (1985) argued that buying stocks that performed poorly in a prior three- to five-year period and selling those that performed well would have generated abnormally high returns in subsequent three- to five-year periods. Apparently, longer-term stock-price mean reversion seems due to market overreactions over these longer periods.  Richards (1997)  found similar results for market indices in various countries.  
On the other hand,  Jegadeesh and Titman (1993)  found results that conflicted with DeBondt and Thaler based on shorter holding periods (3 to 12 months). Their study suggested that the market is slow to react to firm-specific information.  Lo and MacKinlay (1988)  found that the level of short-term momentum effects displayed by stocks is inversely related to firm size. Apparently, smaller firms experience more momentum effects than do larger firms. If smaller firms have smaller investor followings and more restricted information availability, this apparent momentum might suggest that the market is relatively slow to react to information.  

The findings of both DeBondt and Thaler and Jegadeesh and Titman that seem to contradict weak form market efficiency are not universally accepted. For example,  Richardson and Stock (1988)  argued that these momentum results of DeBondt and Thaler were due largely to their statistical methodology, as did  Jegadeesh (1991) , who argued that these mean reversion effects seemed to hold only in January.  

# Moving Averages  

Moving average  techniques consolidate shorter series of observations into longer series, are commonly used for smoothing data variability, and are frequently used as a reference point to gauge daily fluctuations. A simple    $q$   period moving average is computed as follows:  

$$
M A_{q,t}={\frac{x_{t}+x_{t-1}+\dots+x_{t-q-1}}{q}}=\sum_{i=1}^{q}x_{t-i}/q
$$  

For example, daily stock prices are compared to a moving average of a specified number of historical prices. Trading strategies might be based on these moving averages. Perhaps, if current prices rise above a falling moving average, they might be expected to drop back towards the moving average; selling is suggested. The movement above the moving average might imply that the current high price is due to random error or noise. Buying is suggested when the moving average flattens out and the stock’s price falls below the moving average. There are numerous other moving average rules, and they can be thoroughly contradictory with one another.  

Moving averages can be computed for any number of price data points. For example, consider the following sequence of daily closing prices for a given stock over a period of time:  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f1a3c4840fba207affd4f4d6d344b16dd7548dc486e0425fc4b5f2ba229ecd8a.jpg)  

The following represents the sequence of simple three-day moving averages for the above price sequences:  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/0ba9e6cafc8f5a659e6f5bc4bc770f4e269983a91522c8e207443922f7dc907a.jpg)  
A study by  Brock, Lakonishok, and LeBaron (1992)  demonstrated evidence suggesting that certain moving average rules and other rules based on resistance levels produced higher than normal returns when applied to daily data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1897 to 1986. However,  Sullivan, Timmerman, and White (1997)  tested their findings on updated data and found “that the best technical trading rule does not provide superior performance when used to trade in the subsequent 10-year post-sample period.”  

# The January Effect  

Numerous studies including  Rozeff and Kinney (1976) ,  Roll (1981) ,  Keim (1983) , and Reinganum (1983)  have confirmed a “January effect.” This effect is that returns for the month of January tend quite consistently to exceed returns for any other of the eleven months. This January effect seems most pronounced during the first five trading days in January and the last trading day in December. However, the January effect continues to persist throughout the month. Additionally, this January effect seems to have a greater effect on the shares of smaller companies (which are frequently held by individual investors) than on the shares of larger firms (frequently held by institutional investors).  

Roll (1983),  Keim (1989) , and  Griffiths and White (1993)  argued that much of the January effect can be explained by the tendency for December transactions to be seller initiated and execute at bid prices, while January transactions are buyer initiated and execute at offer prices. However, the latter two papers argue that the January effect is large enough that it would exist even if all transactions executed at bid prices. None of these papers explains the full size of the January effect.  

# The January Effect and Tax-Driven Selling  

One explanation for this January effect is year-end tax selling—investors sell their “losers” at the end of the year to capture tax write-offs. This year-end tax selling forces down prices at the end of the year. They recover early in the following year, most significantly during the first five trading days in January (and the last trading day in December). Branch (1977)  finds evidence suggesting this explanation. He found that stocks selling at their annual low at year’s end outperformed the market in January by  $8\%$  . However, he concluded that this increase barely covered transaction costs for investors wishing to exploit this price increase (he assumed a high transaction cost). Nonetheless, an investor wishing to purchase securities in late December might benefit from this knowledge.  Dyl (1977)  supports the year-end selling hypothesis by reporting that abnormally high trading volume exists in December. Adding further credibility to the year-end tax selling hypothesis, other studies, including  Givoly and Ovadia (1983) , have also found that “losers” outperform “winners” in January of the subsequent year and that firm returns in January are directly related to losses in the prior year. Furthermore,  Chan, Chen, and Hsieh (1985)  and Chang and Pinegar (1986)  report January effects for low-grade corporate bonds and in shares of companies that issue these bonds. This effect does not seem to hold for highgrade corporate bonds or for the shares of the companies that issue these bonds. This, they argue, supports the tax-loss selling hypothesis for the January effect.  
Contrasting the tax explanations for the January effect are studies demonstrating that this effect exists in markets whose tax years differ from the calendar year. That is, if taxloss selling explains the January effect, the January effect should not hold in countries whose tax years differ from calendar years. Nonetheless, the January effect does appear in Australia and other countries where the fiscal and calendar years differ. Furthermore, the January effect in Canada existed before the introduction of a capital gains tax. Why should a country experience a tax-related January effect if there is no tax-driven selling?  

However, some observers have argued that U.S. markets are sufficiently influential in world markets that year-end tax selling in the U.S. might simply drive prices in other markets. On the other hand, studies have demonstrated a January effect in U.S. markets during the 1877  1916 period, prior to the introduction of U.S. income taxes—again, a January effect with no tax-driven selling. Furthermore,  Kihn (1996)  presents evidence that municipal bond issues, which are free from federal taxation, experience a significant January effect. Thus, despite the popularity of the tax explanation, there still remain serious doubts regarding its ability to explain the January effect.  

# The January Effect and Window Dressing  

Some market observers have also suggested that funds will “window dress” at yearend by buying winners (stocks that performed well earlier in the year) and by selling losers. These transactions occur at the end of the year so that their clientele can see from year-end financial statements that their funds held high-performing stocks and did not hold losers. The buy pressure on winners and sell pressure on losers might be expected to cause losers to under perform winners during the period of window dressing; in January after the period of window dressing losers will outperform winners. However, most institutions will report their holdings to their clients more than once per year and some will report based on fiscal years other than from January 1 to December 31. But, this effect does not appear in any other month. Furthermore, winners still realize higher January returns than in any other month, just not as high as losers. If the “window-dressing” hypothesis explains the January effect better than the tax-selling hypothesis, one should expect that shares held by institutions should outperform shares held by individuals during the month of January. First, we note that the January effect is more pronounced for smaller firms than for larger firms (smaller firms are more likely to be held by individual investors). Second, another study found that the January effect is far more pronounced for companies with significant numbers of individual shareholders than those companies with significant numbers of institutional investors. Thus, the tax-selling hypothesis seems to explain the January effect better than the “window-dressing” hypothesis. However, since there are still many holes in the tax-selling hypothesis, it appears that the January effect remains an anomaly.  

# The Small Firm and Price/Earnings Effects  

There also exists substantial evidence that smaller firms outperform larger firms (e.g.,  Banz, 1981 ). For example, if one were to rank all NYSE and Nasdaq firms by size, one is likely to find that those firms that are ranked as smaller will outperform those that are ranked larger. This effect holds after adjusting for risk as measured by beta. However, other measures of risk may be more appropriate for smaller firms that may not have wellestablished trading records due to market thinness or due to “newness” when compared to typical larger firms. Furthermore, transactions costs for many smaller firms may exceed those for larger firms, particularly when they are thinly traded. There is also evidence that these abnormally high returns for smaller firms are most pronounced in January. Although  Fama and French (1992)  find a significant size effect in their study of the CAPM over a 50-year period, they do not find a size effect during the period between 1981 and 1990. This  might  suggest that the size effect either no longer exists or was merely a statistical artifact prior to 1981. Two studies found that abnormal returns in January are more related to share price effects than to firm size; in fact, after controlling for share prices (and noting the higher proportional transactions costs on lower priced shares), the size effect disappears as a partial explanation of the January effect.  
Basu (1977)  and  Fama and French (1992)  find that firms with low   $\mathrm{P/E}$   ratios outperform firms with higher P/E ratios. Fama and French find that the   $\mathrm{P/E}$   ratio, combined with firm size, predicts security returns significantly better than the CAPM.  

# The Initial Public Offering Anomaly  

The initial public offering (IPO) anomaly refers to three unusual pricing patterns associated with IPOs of equities:  

1.  Short-term IPO returns are abnormally high.

 2.  IPOs seem to under perform the market in the long run.

 3.  Abnormal IPO return performance seems to be cyclical.  

IPOs have been shown to generate significant short-term returns. These returns are most substantial on the day of the new issue. The abnormal returns exist after adjusting for risk (see, for example,  Ibbotson and Jaffee, 1975 ;  McDonald and Fisher, 1972 ;  Ritter, 1984 ). Thus, it seems that unseasoned offerings with no trading histories do generate abnormally high short-term returns. However, the longer-term returns on IPOs do not seem nearly so high; in fact, several studies report IPO returns to be negative over the period 20 days to two years after the IPO (see, for example,  Ritter, 1991 ). Some evidence suggests that these IPO returns are due to the provision of useful price-setting information by IPO market participants and by price supports in the IPO after market. The third part of the IPO anomaly is that the first two are cyclical, being more pronounced during strong stock market periods.  

# Charting  

Thus far, we have considered rather simple trading rules that can be rather easily put to statistical tests. Generally speaking, and with a few possible exceptions, there is little empirical evidence that most of these simple technical rules can cover transactions costs necessary to produce profits in stock markets.  
Charting is the application of chart patterns in the analysis of security and other market prices. Charting allows the analyst to discern more complex trends than the simple rules we’ve discussed earlier in this chapter. While all chartists focus on prices and volume over time, they do make use of different types of charts. One of the most popular types of charts is the candlestick chart such as that in  Figure 12.1 . In most instances, a single candlestick figure will reflect the range of prices for a single stock, with the body of the candlestick in light green (gray in print version) (dark red (dark gray in print version)) depicting the security’s open price at the bottom (top) of the body when the market increases (decreases) during the day. The shadows (vertical lines) extending above and below the candlestick body reflect the prices extending to the daily high at the top and low trading prices of the security.  

The chartist will discern patterns depicted by the candlesticks. Such patterns might be relatively simple such as resistance levels or moving averages or might discern more complex patterns such as Elliott waves, head and shoulders, pennants or flags. Reading charts is often considered an art because their interpretation depends on the analyst’s judgment on how to fit a huge variety of possible patterns over an infinity of possible time frames.  

Two well-known charting patterns are the Head and Shoulders and the inverse (upside down) Head and Shoulders (see  Figure 12.1 ) formations. Volume increases when the price reaches the top (bottom) of the head in the (inverted) Head and Shoulders formation strengthen the sell (buy) signal. The completion of the right shoulder when the neckline is broken is a sell (buy) signal in the (inverse) Head and Shoulders formation (as in Figure 12.1 ).  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/cac086d55d7325391f34ec1fd0a211b12b4a26d5eaf726689ac977e33a2c575c.jpg)  
FIGURE 12.1 Candlestick chart, AAPL (Apple, Inc.), December 14, 2016. Inverse head and shoulders formation.  
One of the better-known charting tools is based on the  Dow Theory , first suggested by Charles Dow in the late 1800s, which examines trends in the market and classifies them into three basic types:  

1.  Primary Trends: Commonly called bear or bull markets, these trends represent the main component of the Dow Theory. They are long term, typically 4 years in duration.

 2.  Secondary Movements: Referred to as corrections, these movements last only a few months.

 3.  Tertiary Moves: Daily fluctuations that are considered random variations. Although these movements are not essential to the theory, they are plotted to delineate primary and secondary trends.  

A line chart may be plotted using each day’s closing (or opening, or high, or low) price, and connecting them with a line. Short-term trends may only represent a secondary movement, however a long term trend, with each secondary trend failing to reach a new bottom may be considered a bull market.  

There are a huge variety of such charting theories and formations. In some respects, charting is like astrology. Its validity is impossible to disprove, and many of its principles are difficult to justify. However, it is used by many traders and investors, particularly in currency and commodities markets, and particularly for short-term trading executions. Understanding how these traders and investors behave may be important to understanding and profiting from stock market behavior.  

# Sports Betting Markets  

Sports betting markets potentially have much in common with stock markets. Sports betting markets resemble financial markets in that both have large numbers of greedy participants who risk capital, have varying levels and types of knowledge and have strong financial incentives to quickly and rationally act on the best information in competitive settings. Thus, we might expect a reasonable amount of efficiency to new information in both markets. However, there is some evidence of persistent weak-form inefficiencies in sports betting markets. For example,  Thaler and Ziemba (1988)  and numerous other studies note that favorites in horse races outperform long shots, though Woodland and Woodland (1994)  find the opposite is true for baseball betting.  Brown and Sauer (1993)  find that several observable variables in addition to the spread can be used to improve the outcomes of professional basketball games and that teams with winning streaks systematically receive point spreads in subsequent games that are better than they actually experience.  Gray and Gray (1997) ,  Golec and Tamarkin (1991) , Sauer, Brajer, Ferris, and Marr (1988) , and  Gandar, Zuber, O’Brien, and Russo (1988) find evidence that certain strategies can be used to improve professional football betting. Consider these rhetorical question: Might observed inefficiencies and biases in sports betting markets be similar in frequency and nature (e.g., momentum and mean reversion) to those in financial markets? Do these inefficiencies reflect profit-making opportunities?  
# Summary  

Generally, statistical studies seem to indicate that stock markets are efficient with respect to historical price sequences. However, one must realize that a huge number of possible sequences can be identified with any series of prices. Clearly, many of these series must be associated with higher than normal future returns, but will the associations continue into the future? Statistical studies have certainly found evidence of predictability in stock prices, normally referring to such findings as anomalies. However, when research finds a sequence that leads to higher than normal returns, one must question whether the abnormal return result is merely a statistical artifact due to data mining. According to William Schwert (1983) :  

These [research] findings raise the possibility that anomalies are more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further investigate puzzling anomalies and later try to explain them. But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the market to become more efficient).  

Richard Roll (1992), in a blunt comment, stated:  

I have personally tried to invest money, my client’s and my own, in every single anomaly and predictive result that academics have dreamed up. That includes the strategy of DeBondt and Thaler (that is, sell short individual stocks immediately after one-day increases of more than   $5\%.$  ), the reverse of DeBondt and Thaler which is Jegadeesh and Titman (buy individual stocks after they have decreased by  $5\%$  ), etc. I have attempted to exploit the so-called year-end anomalies and a whole variety of strategies supposedly documented by academic research. And I have yet to make a nickel on any of these supposed market inefficiencies.  

Clearly, technical analysis has its share of critics. For example, Warren Buffet was quoted saying, “I realized technical analysis didn’t work when I turned the charts upside down and didn’t get a different answer.” In any case, most apparent incidences of mispricing seem eliminated by transactions costs. The primary exceptions to weak form market efficiency seem to be the IPO effects, probably the January effect, perhaps the small firm effect, and perhaps the   $\mathrm{P/E}$   effect. There seems to be little agreement as to why these effects persist or even whether the latter two even exist; they remain anomalies.  

# 12.3 TESTING MOMENTUM AND MEAN REVERSION STRATEGIES  

In this section, we provide an illustration of a momentum/mean reversion test. Essentially, this means that we will test whether the return for a stock on a given day can be used to predict the return on that stock for the subsequent day. (See the discussion on price sequences and relative strength in the previous section.) If returns seem to be positively correlated from one day to the next, this would evidence momentum in stock prices over time. A negative correlation would evidence mean reversion. Consider the sequence of daily closing prices in  Table 12.1  for a hypothetical stock   $\mathrm{Q},$   from which we compute  
TABLE 12.1 Stock Price and Return Data 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1ad6c6b1f3442dd216211b94f03484df7447c496606a6cefd2c86dd0fe454ce2.jpg)  

returns. The prices given in this table assume that the stock traded each day, including weekends. We will attempt our test illustration based on an extremely small sample to simplify our computations.  

Although there are many ways to determine the nature of the relationship between the return on a security and its prior day’s return, we will examine whether there exists a linear relationship based on a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of the form:  $\hat{r}_{i,t}=\hat{a}+\hat{b}_{i}\hat{r}_{i,t-1}\overset{\cdot}{+}\hat{\varepsilon}_{i,t}$  . We report regression results as follows:  

$$
\hat{r}_{i,t}=-0.0020142+0.7717758\cdot\hat{r}_{i,t-1}\qquad\qquad r^{2}=0.57
$$
 '  

$$
(-0.25959)\,(3.259325)
$$  

$$
\mathrm{MSE}=0.00450311
$$  

$$
n=10\;\;\;d.f.=8
$$  

Note that    $t.$  -statistics are given in parentheses. The slope term  $\hat{b}_{i}$   is 0.7717758, positive and statistically significant at the  $5\%$   level. We will return shortly to explain and interpret these results. However, we will first work through the details on obtaining the results of our simple OLS regression. First, our  $\hat{a}_{i}$   and  $\hat{b}_{i}$   coefficients are determined following the simple OLS method as follows:  

$$
{\hat{b}}_{i}={\frac{\sum{({r}_{t}-{\bar{r}}_{t})({r}_{t-1}-{\bar{r}}_{t-1})}}{\sum{({r}_{t-1}-{\bar{r}}_{t-1})^{2}}}}={\frac{0.000775}{0.001004}}=0.7717758
$$  

$$
\hat{a}_{i}=\overline{{r}}_{t}-\hat{b}_{i}\overline{{r}}_{i,t-1}=-0.0020142
$$  

To obtain regression diagnostics, we compute squared error-term values as in  Table 12.2 .  
TABLE 12.2 Stock Price Data 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/106d243c6eb10e7da63573f4514fc0eeaf1643f9f98354fe28a7fe71eec5cae0.jpg)  

We are able to compute regression standard errors from calculations in  Table 12.2 :  

$$
s e(\hat{b_{i}})=\sqrt{\frac{\frac{S S E}{n-2}}{\sum(r_{t}-\bar{r}_{t})^{2}}}=\sqrt{\frac{0.000562888}{0.01003}}=\sqrt{0.056069}=0.23679
$$  

$$
\nu({\hat{a}}_{i})={\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\varepsilon_{i}^{2}}{n-2}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{2}}}={\sqrt{\frac{0.000562888\cdot0.0107417}{10\cdot0.01003911}}}={\sqrt{0.000060228}}=0.0
$$  

Give  our standard error estimates    $s e({\hat{a}}_{i})=0.007760684$  760684 and    $s e(\hat{b_{i}})=0.05606069533,$   we find our  t -statistics to be    $t(\hat{a}_{i})=-0.25959$   and  t  $t(\hat{b}_{i})$  ð Þ  to be 3.2593. Suppose our tests were expressed formally as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{H}_{0}\colon\hat{a}_{i}=0}&{{}\mathrm{H}_{0}\colon\hat{b}_{i}=0}\\ {\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{A}}\colon\hat{a}_{i}\neq0}&{{}\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{A}}\colon\hat{b}_{i}\neq0}\end{array}
$$  

Since we will assume that  $a$   and    $b$   follow student    $t.$  -distributions, we will compare our    $t.$  - statistic to critical values found in the    $t.$  -distribution table (See Table A.2 in the Text Appendix.), given the appropriate level of confidence and degrees of freedom. We are performing two-tail tests for significance. Suppose we test for significance at a level of 0.95 (0.025 on each side of the tail). In this case, the significance of our test is    $\upalpha=0.025$   and the number of degrees of freedom    $k$   equals   $10\mathrm{~-~}2=8$  . Our critical value for the test is found:  

$$
t_{0.025}^{8}=2.306
$$  
While we fail to reject our first null hypothesis that  $\hat{a}_{i}=0$   (not an important finding here), we reject our second null hypothesis that  $\hat{b}_{i}=0$  . Thus, our test does provide evidence that the returns for this security are linearly related to returns on prior days, and for a momentum effect in stock prices.  

# 12.4 SEMISTRONG FORM EFFICIENCY  

Investors acquire information for input to their valuation models and for security selections. If markets are efficient, their valuation results will reflect all available information. Semistrong form efficiency  tests are concerned with whether security prices reflect all publicly available information. For example, how much time is required for a given type of information to be reflected in security prices? What types of publicly available information might an investor use to generate higher than normal returns? The majority of studies of semistrong form market efficiency suggest that the tested publicly available information and announcements cannot be used by the typical investor to secure significantly higher than normal returns. A few of the exceptions to this rule are included in the following paragraphs. In addition, investors able to react within a few minutes to event news may be able to secure higher than normal returns.  

# Early Tests  

Garfield Cox (1930) found no evidence that professional stock analysts could outperform the market. Similarly, and more rigorously,  Cowles (1933)  performed several tests of what was later to be known as the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). He examined the forecasting abilities of 45 professional securities analysis agencies (including fire insurance companies, financial services companies, and financial publications). He compared the returns that might have been generated by professionals’ recommendations to actual returns on the market over the same period. He found that the average returns generated by professionals were less than those generated by the market over the same periods. He found that the best performing fund was not an outlier; that is, it did not exhibit unusually high performance at a statistically significant level. Cowles also tested whether analyst recommendations were correct an unusually high number of times; that is, he tested whether analyst picks were profitable relative to the market more frequently than might be expected with random picks. Analyst picks were not more profitable.  

Cowles also examined the abilities of analysts to predict the direction of the market as opposed to selecting individual stocks. He found that a buy and hold strategy was at least as profitable as following “average” advice of professionals as to when to be long or short in the market. He performed a simulation study using a deck of cards (since there were no computers capable of generating random numbers at the time). Based on reports of analyst recommendations, he computed the average number of times analysts change their recommendations over a year (33 times). He then randomly selected 33 dates, using cards numbered 1 to 229 (the number of weeks the study covered) to make simulated random recommendations. Draws were taken from a second set of randomly selected cards numbered 1 to 9, each with a certain recommendation (long, short, half stock, and half cash, etc.) for a given date. Cowles then compared the results distribution of the 33 recommendations based on randomly generated advice to the advice provided by the actual advisors. He found that the professionals generated the same return distributions as did the random recommendations. Thus, he concluded that the best-informed analysts would perform no better than the uninformed investor making random investing decisions. Cowles also examined 255 editorials by William Peter Hamilton, the fourth editor of the Wall Street Journal , who had gained a reputation for successful forecasting. Between 1902 until his death in 1929, Hamilton forecast 90 changes in the market; 45 were correct and 45 were incorrect.  
If experts are unable to distinguish between strong and weak stock market performers, and investors are well aware of this lack of ability, why do market forecasters still exist and investors still purchase and follow their advice? One possible explanation for reliance on unreliable “expert” forecasters is that investors are less interested in accuracy than in avoiding responsibility for their selections. Investors who rely on advice from experts seek to avoid blame when the forecasts are inaccurate. Avoidance of responsibility in another field is illustrated by  Steadman and Cocozza (1978)  in their study of New York psychiatrists who were asked to predict whether mental patients were dangerous and required involuntary confinement. Although numerous studies have consistently shown that psychiatrists cannot predict which patients are dangerous, the expert diagnoses were accepted by  $87\%$   of the courts in their study. Such “expert” advice seemed to relieve courts of further responsibility for the patients.  

# Stock Splits  

In a particularly important seminal test of semistrong form market efficiency,  Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll (1969)  examined the effects of stock splits on stock prices. Because it seems logical that stock splits should be cosmetic in nature, and that Fama et al. generally reached this empirical conclusion, the results of this paper are somewhat less important than the methodology used in the study. This paper was the first to use the now classic event study methodology. Although stock prices did change significantly before announcements of stock splits (and afterwards as well), Fama et al. argued that splits were related to more fundamental factors (such as dividends), and that it was actually these fundamental factors that affected stock prices. The splits themselves were unimportant with respect to subsequent returns.  

Fama et al. identified the month in which a particular stock split occurred, calling that event month time zero for that stock. Thus, each stock had associated with it a particular month zero   $(t=0)$  , and months subsequent to the split were assigned positive values. They then estimated expected returns for each month  $t$   for the stocks in their sample with single index model:    $\boldsymbol{r}_{i,t}=\boldsymbol{a}+b_{i}\boldsymbol{r}_{m,t}+e_{i,t}$   where the expected residual   $(e_{i,t})$   value was zero. Fama et al. tested 940 splits occurring between from 1956 to 1960, excluding from their beta computations returns data 15 months before and after splits. They then examined residuals  $(e_{i,t})$   for each security  $i$   for each month    $t$   then averaged the residuals   $(A R_{t})$   for each month across securities. Afterwards, they calculated cumulative average residuals   $(C A R_{t})$   starting 30 months before splits   $\left(t=\mathrm{~-~}30\right)$  ). Cumulative average residuals increased dramatically starting 30 months before split. Fama et al. regarded it unlikely for this increase to occur because a split was anticipated, but reasoned that splits occur after significant price growth. They found that after splits, residuals   $(A R_{t})$   again average zero. Finally, Fama et al. split their sample of companies into those increasing dividends after a split versus companies not increasing dividends. Companies splitting stock and then increasing dividends had continued increasing CARs after the split announcement date; those splitting stock then decreasing dividends experienced decreasing CARs. Thus, dividends might indicate fundamental strengths; splits do not appear to be relevant. On average, once the split is announced, positive residuals (CARs) no longer exceed zero.  
Subsequent tests on stock splits have not been entirely consistent with the results of Fama et al. For example, it has been argued that splits increase the proportional trading costs of stocks. Investors should require higher returns to compensate for these higher trading costs. Later studies have documented positive residuals on split announcements.  

Nonetheless, the Fama et al. study provided the framework for future event studies and semistrong efficiency tests. Consider the following general notes regarding testing the semistrong form efficiency hypothesis:  

1.  Use daily price and returns data since information is incorporated into prices within days (or much shorter periods).

 2.  Announcements are usually more important than events themselves.

 3.  Base security performance on estimated expected returns.

 4.  When using the market model (standard single index model), we estimate slopes from historical data. Normally, we find them biased forecasters for future values, so we may adjust them towards one.

 5.  One way to deal with slope measurement error is to use moving windows for the period whose excess return is being determined, estimate slope based on time periods preceding and following the testing period, excluding the testing period itself.

 6.  An alternative to adding to determine cumulative excess returns is adding them to 1, then multiplying them to compute  buy and hold abnormal residuals  as follows:  $B H A R_{T}=\Pi(1\,+\,e_{t})\,-\,1$  .  

# Corporate Merger Announcements, Annual Reports, and Other Financial Statements  

Thousands of other tests of semistrong form efficiency have been reported in the academic literature, covering wide varieties of events. For example,  Firth (1976)  considered market efficiency when an announcement is made for purchase of more than   $10\%$   of a firm. Presumably, an announcement indicates a potential merger. Firth calculated CAR starting 30 days prior to announcements; the bulk of CAR is realized between last trade before and first trade after announcements, though it still increases slightly after an announcement. Thus, a large block purchaser can still make excess returns. An insider obviously can make excess returns; one without inside information cannot (except very shortly after the announcement). Since returns change almost immediately, Firth suggested that there is semistrong efficiency with respect to merger announcements.  
Ball and Brown (1968)  study the usefulness of the information content of annual reports. With a primary focus on EPS, they find that security prices already reflect   $85\%$   to  $90\%$   of information contained in annual reports; security prices show no consistent reactions to annual report releases. They conclude that analysts obtain more timely information from other sources.  

# Information Contained in Publications and Analyst Reports  

Davies and Canes (1978)  considered information analysts sell to clients then publish in the “Heard on the Street” column in  The Wall Street Journal . They used the market model to measure the relationship among the market, risk, and the security. Information in this column was frequently sold by investment firms to clients before publication in the journal. Prices seemed to rise significantly after information was sold to clients, then even more when it was published in the  Wall Street Journal . Davies and Canes tested to see whether these large residuals on the  Wall Street Journal  publication day were significant by standardizing each day’s return and then checking to see how many standard deviations from zero the excess or abnormal return lies.  

Other studies (e.g.,  Black, 1973 ;  Holloway, 1981 ;  Huberman & Kandel, 1987 ) have been performed on the ability to use rankings and other information provided by  Value Line Investment Surveys  to generate profits. Although they are not consistent, many studies, particularly those before 1990, seem to suggest that  Value Line  reports can be used to generate higher than normal returns. However, several later studies suggest that the excess returns based on  Value Line  analyses may not have been sufficient to cover trading costs or may have been due to systematic risk, momentum effects, and other factors (e.g.,  Nayar, Singh, and Yu, 2011 ).  

More general studies on the value of analyst reports are somewhat mixed. The earlier study by  Cowles (1933)  found no evidence of value in analyst reports. On the other hand, Green (2006)  found in his study of 7000 recommendation changes from 16 brokerage firms from 1999 to 2002 that, after controlling for transaction costs, purchasing (selling) quickly following upgrades (downgrades) resulted in average two-day returns of   $1.02\%$     $(1.50\%)$  . He found that short-term profit opportunities persisted for two hours following the premarket release of new recommendations.  

Womack (1996)  found that analysts’ mean postevent drift averages  $2.4\%$   on buy recommendations and is short-lived. However, sell recommendations result in average losses of  $9.1\%$   that are longer lived. These price reactions seem more significant for smallcapitalization firms than for larger capitalization firms. Also, consider that sell recommendations may be particularly costly to brokerage firms, potentially damaging investment banking relationships and curtailing access to information in the future. Clearly, buy recommendations far outnumber sell recommendations and an incorrect sell recommendation may be particularly damaging to an analyst’s reputation.  

# Analyst Reports and Conflicts of Interest  

Michaely and Womack (1999)  studied after-market returns of 391 firms going public in 1990 and 1991, attempting to discern whether analysts working for firms underwriting the IPOs provided buy recommendations that were superior to those of investment institutions not participating in the underwriting efforts. Results suggest that if the analysts worked for an institution that did not participate in the underwriting, they were more likely to recommend a stock that had performed well in the recent past and would continue its strong performance. However, if the analysts worked for a firm that participated in bringing the IPO to the market, it was more likely to have recorded poor performance both before and after the analysts’ recommendation. This evidence suggests that analysts working for investment banks are likely to attempt to prop up the prices of their underwritten securities with their recommendations.  
In response to these apparently biased and unethical analyst recommendations, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced in 2003 the  Global Research Analyst Settlement  with 10 of the industry’s largest investment banks. This settlement resulted from investigations by Congress, the Office of New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer, the SEC, and other regulators into apparent conflicts of interest among security analysts working for investment banks. The settlement required the 10 investment banks to pay  $\S875$   million in penalties and profit disgorge ment,   $\S80$   million for investor education, and   $\S432.5$  million to fund independent research. In addition to these payments, the investment banks were required to separate their investment banking and research departments and add certain disclosures to their research reports. Nevertheless,  Barber, Lehavy, and Truman (2007) found that between February 1996 and June 2003, buy recommendations of independent research firms outperformed those of investment banks by an average of 3.1 basis points per day. Investment bank hold/sell recommendations, in contrast, outperformed those of the independent research firms by an average of 1.8 basis points daily. Thus, investment bank buy opinions still under perform those of independent analysts, despite their other recommendations outperforming those of their independent competitors.  

# Discounted Cash Flow Analysis and Price Multiples  

In their study of 51 highly leveraged transactions (management buyouts and leveraged recapitalization s),  Kaplan and Ruback (1995)  found that discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis provided better estimates of value than did price-based multiples. The free cash flow estimates used by Kaplan and Ruback were provided by management to the public as required by SEC regulation in going private transactions. Discount rates were estimated with CAPM (and other methods were used as well). Kaplan and Ruback found that between   $95\%$   and   $97\%$   of firm value was explained by (as indicated by r-square) DCF and slightly less was explained by price-based multiples. The price-based multiples did add useful information to the valuation process. In addition, analysts may be able to improve on DCF estimates by refining those provided by management. Regardless, the high r-squares do suggest that reasonably reliable information and analytical techniques are available in the marketplace for analysts and investors to use in company valuations.  

# Political Intelligence Units  

Investors with money at stake have obvious incentives to access and quickly exploit information. Many investors and institutions are able to access and exploit important information before it can be gathered and disseminated by the news agencies. Consider the case of USG Corporation, whose shares increased by   $5.4\%$   over two days prior to November 16, 2005 when Senate Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist announced that there would be a full Senate vote on a bill to create a  $\S140$   billion public trust for asbestos liability claims (see Mullins and Scannell, 2006). This fund would pay medical expenses and resolve lawsuits involving thousands of cancer victims who blamed USG, W.R. Grace, and Crown for their illnesses. Share prices of all these firms increased over the two days prior to November 16. However, the price increases clearly preceded the trust fund announcement. Returns for these firms over the two-day period exceeded those of the market. In addition, returns experienced by these particular firms far exceeded returns of their peer firms that were not involved in asbestos litigation. On the date that the actual announcement was finally made, these three firms showed no substantial reaction.  
The SEC initiated an informal investigation to determine whether and how information might have been leaked to investors prior to its announcement. While staff members for Senator Frist claim to have been careful not to leak information prior to the announcement, the bill’s authors, Senators Spector and Leahy, had held extensive discussions with lobbyists. Several law firms, including Son nen sche in Nath & Rosenthal, LLP and DLA Piper, have operated “political intelligence” units enabling their clients to obtain public policy information from lobbyists operating in Washington. These firms and political intelligence units include hedge funds as clients. Several hedge funds holding substantial stakes in affected companies belonged to the Financial Institutions for Asbestos Reform, an industry advocacy group, giving them additional opportunities to access information provided by lobbyists.  

While it is not always clear whether any laws have been broken by such activity, it does appear that hedge funds may have successfully gained an information edge in their trading. Nevertheless, the 2012 passage of the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act restricted the insider trading activity and “tippee” potential of members of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government along with their staffs.  Gao and Huang (2016)  found that hedge funds with strong connections to lobbyists significantly outperformed index benchmarks prior to 2012, and that this out-performance was diminished after 2012.  

# Market Volatility  

If security price changes are purely a function of information arrival, then security price volatility should be the same when markets are closed as when they are open. For example, stock return variances should be three times as high over a weekend as over a 24- hour period during weekdays. However,  Fama (1965)  and  French (1980)  found that return variances were only around  $20\%$   higher during weekends. On the other hand, one might argue that the arrival of new information over weekends is slower. But another study by French and Roll (1986)  found that agricultural commodity futures prices (orange juice concentrate) were substantially more volatile during trading days than during weekends. Agricultural commodity futures prices are primarily a function of weather, news about which occurs over the weekend just as efficiently as during trading days. This suggests that volatility, to some extent, is caused by trading itself. More generally,  Shiller (1981) found that the volatility of stock prices significantly exceeded the level that might be explained by the volatility of dividends.  
# 12.5 THE EVENT STUDY METHODOLOGY  

An event study is concerned with the impact of a given firm-specific corporate event on the prices of the company’s securities. For example, an event study might be conducted for the purpose of determining the impact of corporate earnings announcements on the stock price of the company. Event studies are used to measure market efficiency and to determine the impact of a given event on security prices. More important, from a trading perspective, event studies are used to back-test price data to determine the usefulness and reliability of trading strategies.  

A number of studies have suggested a relatively high degree of efficiency in capital markets. If this suggestion is true, then one would expect that security prices would continuously reflect all available information. If security prices are a function of all available information, and new information occurs randomly (otherwise, it would not be new information), then one would expect that security prices would fluctuate randomly as randomly generated news is impounded in security prices. Thus, the “purchase or sale of any security at the prevailing market price represents a zero NPV transaction” ( Brown & Warner, 1980 ). In a perfectly efficient market, any piece of relevant new information would be immediately reflected in security prices. One should be able to determine the relevance of a given type of information by examining the effect of its occurrence on security prices. Thus, nonrandom performance of security prices immediately after a given event suggests that news of the event has a significant effect on security values. The degree of efficiency in a market to a given type of information may be reflected in the speed that the market reacts to the new information.  

At any given point in time, security prices might be affected by a large number of randomly generated pieces of new information or events. An event study is concerned with the impact of a specific type of new information of a security’s price. Given that more than one piece of news may be affecting the security’s price at any point in time, one will probably need to study more than one firm to determine how the given type of information will affect securities. Thus, a population or sampling of firms experiencing the given event will be gathered; the impact of the event on each of the firms’ securities will be studied simultaneously. Thus, the first step in conducting an event study is to gather an appropriate sample of firms experiencing the event.  

The impact of the event on security prices is typically measured as a function of the amount of time that elapses between event occurrence and stock price change. In a relatively efficient market, one might expect that the effect of the event on security prices will occur very quickly after the first investors learn of the event. Event studies are usually based on daily, hourly, or even trade-to-trade stock price fluctuations. However, we frequently are forced to study only daily security price reactions when more frequent data are not readily available.  
In addition, if markets are relatively efficient, one should obtain security price information as soon as possible after the event is known, although determining when the information is known may be problematic. For example, analysts are often able to predict with a reasonably high degree of accuracy the earnings of firms and trade securities on the basis of their predictions (See, for example,  Firth, 1976 ;  Jaffee, Keim, & Westerfield, 1989 .). Thus, the impact of corporate earnings changes may be realized in security prices long before earnings reports are officially released. Consequently, one may need to study the impact of a given event, news item, or announcement by considering security price reactions even before the event occurs. One should also take care in deciding on the precise nature of the event. For example, a dividend announcement may be of much greater interest than actual payment of the dividend.  

Event studies typically standardize security price reactions by measuring the timing of security price reactions relative to the date of the event. For example, suppose that Company X announced its earnings on January 15 and Company Y announced its earnings on February 15. Let the base period time   $(t=0)$  ) for Company X be January 15 and the base period time   $(t=0)$  ) for Company Y be February 15. January 16 and February 16 (one day after the events) will be denoted as   $(t=1)$  ) for the respective companies. Thus, the timing of the corporate events are standardized and we are able to measure average security price reactions 1, 2, etc., days after (and before) the event occurs.  

Although stock return generating processes might be modeled as a random walk if capital markets are efficient, one should expect a long-term general drift in returns; that is, one might expect that investors will earn a “normal” return on their securities. Thus, excess or abnormal return randomness is observed when markets are efficient, except for a very short period after relevant new information is available. The abnormal return or residual in a given period for security  $i,\,\varepsilon_{i,t},$   is the difference between its total, actual, or ex-post return  $r_{i,t}$  and its expected, normal, or ex-ante return    $E[r_{i,t}]$  :    $\varepsilon_{i,t}=r_{i,t}-\,E[r_{i,t}].$  . To measure the impact of an event on security returns, one must have a consistent means of measuring normal returns.  Brown and Warner (1980, 1985) , in their classic studies of event study methodologies, suggest three models of normal returns:  

1.  Mean Adjusted Returns : The normal return for a security  $i$   equals a constant  $K_{i}$  . Typically, the mean return for the security over a sampling of time periods outside of the testing period serves as the constant    $K_{i}$  . The expected return for the security is assumed to be constant over time, though ex-ante returns will vary among securities. Thus, the abnormal return for the security is found:    $\varepsilon_{i,t}=r_{i,t}-\,K_{i}$  .

 2.  Market Adjusted Returns : The normal return for a security at a given point in time equals the market return for that period. The expected returns for all securities are assumed to be the same during a given period, though they vary over time. Abnormal returns are found:    $\varepsilon_{i,t}=R_{i,t}-\,R_{m,t}$  .

 3.  Market and Risk Adjusted Returns : Here, normal returns are assumed to be generated by a single index model. Typically, security returns are linearly related to market returns through stock betas. These risk-adjusted returns vary across securities and over time. Abnormal returns can be determined:    $\varepsilon_{i,t}=R_{i,t}-\beta_{i}(R_{m,t}-r_{f,t})$  .  

One might test the significance of an event by averaging the abnormal performance for the sampling of securities around the event dates. If abnormal returns are not statistically significantly different from zero during the relevant testing period, one may conclude that the test did not provide evidence indicating the significance of the event. If either no abnormal performance is detected around the event date or abnormal performance rapidly disappears, we have evidence of market efficiency with respect to that type of information.  
# Illustration: Event Studies and Takeovers  

Numerous firms have been targets of takeover attempts in recent years. There is good reason to expect that targets of takeover attempts experience significant positive abnormal returns. This suggests that investors with prior knowledge (or strong suspicion) of an impending takeover can realize abnormal returns by purchasing shares of the target firm prior to the takeover announcement. Is this true? We will conduct our own event study to test the following hypotheses:  

1.  Takeover targets experience positive stock price reactions to takeover announcements.

 2.  Markets react efficiently to takeover announcements.  

The event that we will study is takeover announcements. We need to locate an appropriate sampling of companies to study. Suppose we wish to base our study on the three targets of takeover attempts listed in  Table 12.3 .  

Obviously, an actual statistical study would certainly require a much larger sampling of firms, but for sake of computational ease, we will focus on only three firms here. Suppose that we establish a 21-day testing period (event window) for returns around the event dates, the event date plus 10 days before and 10 days after.  Table 12.4  provides our three target firm stock prices during 21-day periods around merger announcement dates. We standardize event dates (merger announcements occur on the 11th date, standardized at day 0) and compute returns for each stock during each of the days in the testing period as in  Table 12.5 . The return for a particular day is simply the closing price for that day divided by the closing price for the prior day minus one:   $\mathit{\bar{(P_{t}/P_{t-1})}}-\mathit{\bar{1}}$  .  

The next step in this study is to determine normal or expected returns for each of the securities for each date. We could use any of the three adjustment methods discussed above (with more information). Suppose that we have decided to use the Market Adjusted Return method. In this case, we compute daily returns for the market index for each day in our 21-day testing period for each stock.  Table 12.6  lists adjusted   $\mathrm{S}\&\mathrm{P}$   index values for each of the 21 dates affecting each of the three stocks along with returns for the index for each of those dates.  

Next, based on actual returns computed in  Table 12.5  and normal returns from the S&P 500 Index from  Table 12.6 , we compute periodic residuals  $\varepsilon_{i,t}$   (abnormal returns) for each stock during each date in the testing period along with the average residual over the sample for each date as in  Table 12.7 .  

One of our objectives is to determine whether any daily residual is statistically significantly different from zero. Following standard hypotheses testing techniques reviewed in

Note:  The successful takeover of Fleet Boston by Bank of America was consummated in 2004. Comcast’s bid for Disney failed. AT&T Wireless, the target of competing offers from Vodafone and Cingular, was acquired by Cingular in 2004.

the text Appendix A.1.a, standard deviations for each of the average daily residuals are computed along with normal deviates or test statistics   $([\varepsilon_{t}-\,0]\,\div\,\sigma_{\varepsilon i})$   as in  Table 12.8 .  

Our test for each daily average residual   $(A R_{t})$   is structured more formally as follows:  

$$
\mathrm{H_{0}}{\colon}A R_{t}\,{\le}\,0\quad\mathrm{H_{A}}{\colon}A R_{t}>0
$$  

We shall assume the residuals follow a t-distribution and we will perform a one-tailed test with a   $95\%$   level of significance. Given a sample size of three firms such that we work with   $1=3\mathrm{~-~}2$   degrees of freedom, the critical value for each test will be 6.314. Based on our computations above, we find that none of the residual    $t.$  -statistics (normal deviates or

test statistics) exceed 6.314. Thus, we may not conclude with a   $95\%$   level of confidence that any residual differs from zero. Based on the confines of the test that we established here, we may not conclude that markets appear inefficient with respect to merger announcements. Perhaps, in part due to our small sample with such a small number of degrees of freedom, we cannot conclude that merger announcements have any effect on security returns. Note that this example was structured so as to facilitate computations; it is unlikely that a realistic test would be structured with a sample set of only three firms.  

The tests performed above were concerned with whether merger announcements significantly affected stock prices in any given date around the time of the announcement. We found no significant effect for any single-day returns. In some other instances, we might  
TABLE 12.8 Target Firm Average Residuals and Standard Deviations 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/d9ba98dff4e6a221aa89140934b2eacc0b4a9b3777613131c1be703e78516e94.jpg)  

find that while no effect is found on the residual for any particular date, the effect might be realized over a period of days. This might be expected if market reactions are slow, that is, if the market is somewhat inefficient. Perhaps, we may even wish to broaden our test to determine whether some of the effect might be realized over a period of time before the date of the announcement. We can compute cumulative average residuals to determine cumulative effects over time:  

$$
C A R_{t}=\sum_{i}^{t}A R_{i}
$$  

Cumulative average residuals are computed in  Table 12.9  from average residuals taken from  Table 12.8 . Cumulative average residuals can also be computed by summing individual firm residuals and dividing by the number of firms in the sample as in  Table 12.10 .  
TABLE 12.9 Target Firm Cumulative Average Residuals 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/bed96a0b8484ce12ff697dd5df09223ab6915c8bd9e515a958caacf32ed2700a.jpg)  

Do any of the CARs in  Table 12.9  or  Table 12.10  exceed zero? A quick glance reveals that all do. Do any CARs exceed zero at a statistically significant level? We need a little more analysis to examine this second question. We begin to test for the statistical significance of cumulative average residuals by computing standard deviations of the cumulative residuals of the firms for each day and computing normal deviates. For example, the sample standard deviation of cumulative residuals for day    $^{-5}$   is computed based on the following:  

$$
\sigma={\sqrt{\frac{(0.010039-0.00024)^{2}+(-0.0178-0.00024)^{2}+(0.008485-0.00024)^{2}}{3-1}}}=0.0747
$$  
TABLE 12.10 Target Firm Cumulative Average Residuals 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/4d2c21269fcf92c94d24e4f4ca2fd58339f434ed1964a46fbe1d52d68f71bd26.jpg)  

These one-day standard deviations measure the spread or variability of residuals for that day. In  Table 12.9 , the normal deviate for a given date is simply the cumulative average residual for that date divided by the standard deviation applicable to that date. Daily standard deviations of cumulative residuals along with their normal deviates are given in  Table 12.10 . Larger normal deviates are consistent with larger positive and statistically significant stock price reactions.  

The largest normal deviate is for day zero, the merger announcement date. In a realistic scenario, this would not be a surprise if prices rapidly adjusted to new information. However, we need a benchmark for statistical significance for these normal deviates. Because our s le set numbers only 3, we have   $3\mathrm{~-~}2=1$   degrees of freedom. For a one-tail test with 95% certainty, we find from a  t -table that our benchmark for statistical significance is 6.314. Note that none of our normal deviates exceed this critical value of 6.314. Thus, if our hypotheses concerning each date    $t$   in our testing period were given as follows:  
$$
\mathrm{H_{0}}{\colon}C A R_{t}\,{\le}\,0\quad\mathrm{H_{A}}{\colon}C A R_{t}\,{>}\,0
$$  

we would not be able to reject the null hypothesis that    $C A R_{t}\,\leq\,0$   with  $95\%$   confidence for any date in our event period. However, we note that the sample set for our illustration was particularly small.  

# 12.6 STRONG FORM EFFICIENCY AND INSIDER TRADING  

Strong form market efficiency tests are concerned with whether any information, publicly available or private, can be used to generate abnormal returns. We generally take it for granted that insiders are capable of generating higher than normal returns on their illegal insider transactions. There have been many well-publicized cases of insiders generating abnormal returns—and being prosecuted for their trading. There is even some evidence that insiders are able to generate abnormal returns on apparently legal transactions that are duly registered with the SEC (see  Jaffee, 1974 ). Jaffee examined SEC insider transaction filings and determined that stock performance relative to market performance after months when insider purchases exceed insider sales. When insiders sell, shares that they sold are outperformed by the market.  

Why do insiders appear to outperform the market on their duly registered insider transactions? Are insiders trading on the basis of their private information or do they actually have superior trading ability? A study by  Givoly and Palmon (1985)  suggests that transactions generating these superior returns are not related to subsequent corporate events or announcements. Givoly and Palmon examined insider transactions and then searched for subsequent announcements in the business press for that might have explained the superior returns on their investments. They found that insider superior returns were not explained by the published announcements. This may suggest that these insiders may either simply have superior investing ability or may generate higher returns for themselves on the basis of information that is not later announced.  

On the other hand, perhaps insiders are trading on the basis of insider information that is not subsequently released on a specific date. Furthermore, managers are not obliged to announce most types of inside information according to any particular schedule. In addition, many insiders participate in plans to regularly buy (without liability, as per SEC Rule 10b5-1) or sell shares. Managers can obtain 10b5-1 protection for trades if they create the plan at a time when they don’t have nonpublic information and they announce their transactions schedule in advance. For example, Kenneth Lay was said to have protected  $\S100$  million in his own wealth by selling shares of Enron stock through a 10b5-1 plan. In addition, insiders always have the right to abstain from trading on the basis of inside information. Thus, it is not illegal to  not buy  shares on the basis of adverse inside information.  
How would investigators determine whether one declined to trade solely on the basis of inside information? Regardless,  Jagolinzer (2009)  found that insider trading within the 10b5-1 plans outperforms the market by  $5.6\%$   over six-month periods.  

Consider securities trading by underage investors, which, based on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki exchange data, has been demonstrated to produce higher than normal returns ( Berkman, Koch, & Westerholm, 2014 ). While all of us raise children who are smarter than average, Berkman et al. argue that such trades are initiated by guardians, that they are more likely to be profitable than trades initiated by other adult traders and that such trades are particularly profitable, as high as   $12\%$   per day when executed before major earnings and takeover announcements or large share price changes. Guardians executing these trades, Berkman et al. suggest, are “likely to be above-average investors,” and have “superior cognitive skills or comparative advantages in obtaining value-relevant information.” In addition, guardians’ trades on children’s accounts outperform trades on their own accounts, and might camouflage illegal trading or reduce the information-related price impact of their trade executions.  

Children aren’t the only investors that might benefit systematically from non-public information.  Schweizer (2011)  details numerous cases of members of the U.S. House of Representatives profiting from trades while holding non-public information concerning issues pending before Congress. For example, former House Speaker John Boehner reportedly purchased stock in health insurance companies just prior to the failure of the “Obamacare public option,” which served to increase health insurance stock prices. Ziobrowski, Boyd, Cheng, and Ziobrowski (2004, 2011)  found that a U.S. stock portfolio imitating transactions of members of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate during the mid- and late-1990s produced annual abnormal returns of approximately   $10\%$  .   As a result of these and other similar findings, Congress passed its 2012 STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge), which prohibits Congressmen, their families and their staffs from trading on the basis of non-public privileged information obtained through their Congressional service.  

Even U.S. securities regulators seem able to produce higher than normal returns on apparent non-public information. For example,  Rajgopal and White (2017)  found that a hypothetical U.S. stock portfolio imitating transactions of S.E.C. employees produce positive annual abnormal returns of approximately   $8.5\%$  . These returns are driven entirely by avoiding losses on the sell-side before significant price declines. Perhaps these abnormal returns are due to good fortune or a statistical artifact. Perhaps they are due to superior stock-picking skills of S.E.C. employees. However, S.E.C. employees are often instructed to sell from their portfolios shares in firms when they are assigned to secret investigations. Oddly, the S.E.C. might require that their employees sell stock on the basis of non-public adverse information, aiding employees in their efforts to avoid trading losses.  
# 12.7 ANOMALOUS EFFICIENCY AND PREDICTION MARKETS  

Sometimes markets seem so efficient that prices can be used to predict non financial events. For example,  French and Roll (1986)  found that prices of orange juice concentrate futures can be used to forecast temperature conditions in central Florida better than the National Weather Service forecasts. In other instances, the market incorporates relevant information so efficiently that it is difficult to understand how the process worked.  

# The  Challenger  Space Shuttle Disaster  

On January 28, 1986, at 11:38 AM Eastern Standard Time, the space shuttle  Challenger  was launched in Florida and exploded 74 seconds later ten miles above ground on national television. The stock market reacted within minutes of the event, with investors dumping shares of the four major contractors contributing to building and launching the  Challenger . The four primary contractors, Rockwell International, builder of the shuttle and its main engines, Lockheed, manager of the ground support, Martin Marietta, manufacturer of the vessel’s external fuel tank, and Morton Thiokol, builder of the solid-fuel booster rocket. Less than a half-hour after the disaster, Rockwell’s stock price had declined   $6\%.$  , Lockheed   $5\%$  , Martin Marietta  $3\%$  , and Morton Thiokol had stopped trading because of the flood of sell orders. By the end of trading for the day, the first three companies’ share prices closed down   $3\%$   from their open prices, representing a slight recovery from their initial reactions. However, Morton Thiokol stock resumed trading and continued to decline, finishing the day almost  $12\%$   down from its open price. These reactions suggested that the market believed that Morton Thiokol would suffer the greatest losses from the disaster, despite the fact that no reports surfaced in the public media identifying Morton Thiokol as the cause of the disaster. Even news reports of rumors in the media failed to single out the firm as the cause of the disaster.  

However, many months after the disaster, Richard Feynman, the charismatic and brilliant physicist, in dramatic testimony to a congressional hearing on the explosion, dropped O-rings into ice water, causing them to become brittle and easily break, thereby demonstrating that they were the cause of the explosion. Morton had used the O-rings in its construction of the booster rockets, which failed in the uncharacteristically cold weather that morning and leaked explosive fumes when the launch temperatures were less than could be tolerated by the O-rings. Yet, there were no announcements of such failures on the dates of the disaster or even within weeks of the explosion. Nonetheless, the market had reacted within minutes of the disaster as though Morton Thiokol would be held responsible.  

In their study of this event,  Maloney and Mulherin (2003)  found no evidence that Morton Thiokol corporate officers and other insiders sold shares on the date of the disaster. How is it that no individual seemed to know that Morton Thiokol would ultimately be held responsible for the disaster, yet the market would react as though everyone knew? It may be useful to note that Morton Thiokol engineers were aware of the potential for failure of the O-rings in cold weather, but were overruled by company managers concerning their use. But, again, Maloney and Mulherin found no evidence of unusual insider trading activity. This scenario suggests that the information marketplace does quickly sift through and identify relevant information used for the valuation of company shares.  
# Prediction Markets  

Price discovery is one of the most important functions of trading, particularly in more transparent markets such as the NYSE. This price discovery is of vital importance to investors and business decision making. What is the essence of trading that produces this information? Several of the models that we have discussed in this chapter allow for market frameworks where informed traders communicate information (perhaps reluctantly) through their trading activities. Might gambling serve the same essential purpose as trading in the price discovery and information production processes? Similarly, what might gambling be able to teach us about information dissemination in financial markets? Bear in mind that prediction markets encourage and reward participation by more knowledgeable traders and punish noise traders.  

Consider the recent presidential elections, where an increasing number of online betting markets offered tradable securities on election outcomes.   Among the most visible of these markets have been PredictIt and the Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM) at the Tippie School of Business, University of Iowa. Both have created “futures” contracts that can be purchased and sold by “investors,” whose values fluctuated as perceived election chances of various candidates and referendums varied. Thus, a contract that pays   $\S1$   if a given candidate is elected might sell for a price less than  $\S1$  . For example, if a contract sells for   $\S0.50_{.}$  , one might roughly infer that the market believes that the candidate has a  $50\%$   chance (ignoring discount factors and other complications) of getting elected. In effect, futures contract prices might have been interpreted as the market’s assessment of the probability that a given candidate would be elected. Hence, such a site might serve as a  prediction market . Prediction markets are markets created for the purpose of making predictions or benefiting from correct predictions. The Iowa Electronic Markets, PredictIt and Intrade (defunct as of early 2013 following a CFTC lawsuit) have been more successful at predicting election outcomes than many opinion polls. Consider, for example, the report by  Time Magazine  ( Saporito, 2005 ) of Intrade’s contract making payment contingent on the capture of Saddam Hussein suddenly moving two days before he was captured on December 13, 2003. Other prediction markets such as Betfair, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Hollywood Stock Exchange, Centrebet (now, William Hill), Goldman Sach’s, and Deutsche Bank’s Economic Derivatives and Trade Sports (which became InTrade) have served as useful prediction devices in other arenas, and have been very useful in making non financial predictions. On the other hand, prices on some particularly high-volume prediction markets seemed inconsistent with actual outcomes. The 2016 Brexit (Britain’s exit from the European Union) and the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in the Republican primaries and the general election, both ended in results contrary to  apparent  market predictions on PredictIt and IEM. At a minimum, we need to remember that these were not the only prediction markets operating at the time, markets produce implied-probabilities rather than actual forecasts and that both actual voting contests were quite close. A number of research papers have discussed use of prediction markets for a variety of types of predictions (e.g.,  Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004, 2007 ).  
Security markets are excellent aggregator s of information. Security prices have been used for many years to estimate a variety of types of probability distributions. For example, currency traders have for many years used futures prices to estimate future currency exchange rates. Similarly, commodity traders have used commodity futures prices to predict commodity prices.  Latane and Rendleman (1976)  proposed used market prices of put and call options to estimate implied vol at ili ties (return standard deviations) for underlying stocks (discussed in Chapter 7).  Bodurtha and Shen (1995)  and  Campa and Chang (1998) used similar statistical methods to estimate implied correlations between two underlying variables such as exchange rates using derivative contracts written on each underlying currency as well as contracts written on both currencies.  

Prediction markets, even with respect to political wagering, did not originate with Intrade and the Iowa Electronic Markets. The Curb Exchange (the precursor to the American Stock Exchange) operated wagering markets for presidential markets during much of the late 19th century. Major newspapers, including The New York Times regularly printed gambling odds on elections. Political wagering frequently involved large sums of money, with daily volume that often exceeded presidential campaign budgets. More recent prediction markets have been quite successful, including the North American Derivatives Exchange (Nadex), a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-registered futures exchange that got its start as Hedge Street prediction market.  

We will focus here on several questions. Is the information provided by markets of use to traders? Clearly, derivative markets do provide useful information for forecasting risk, futures rates, and so on. Is the information provided by markets of use to decision-making entities in business and government? Consider an example from the 1990s where CERN, the European laboratory for particle physics, needed to estimate whether the probability of discovering the Higgs boson was sufficiently high to justify extending the operation of its collider.   Traders at the Foresight Exchange website ( http://www.ideosphere.com/ ) took positions on whether the Higgs boson would be discovered by 2005, setting a contract price of 0.77 as of 2001. We close this section with a few rhetorical questions: Should markets provide information aggregation services to the public? If so, at what cost to traders? 8 Consider the following excerpt from  Looney (2003) :  

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) was born in the uncertain days after the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1958. Its mission was to become an engine of technological change that would bridge the gap between fundamental discoveries and their military use ( Bray, 2003 ). Over the last five decades, the Agency has efficiently gone about its business in relative obscurity, in many cases not getting as much credit as it deserved. The Agency first developed the model for the internet as well as stealth  

# 6 Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004)  was the source for some of the information in this section.  

7 The boson is a subatomic particle (such as a quark or leptons) that seems to impart mass on other bosons, quarks, and leptons. While there was strong theoretical and some empirical evidence for the existence for the Higgs boson as of June 2010, its existence had not been empirically confirmed at that time.  

8 Excerpted from  http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nps/pam/si_pam.pdf  on April 12, 2012.  
technology. More recently, DARPA innovations have spanned a wide array of technologies. To name a couple: computers that correct a user’s mistakes or fix themselves when they malfunction and new stimulants to keep soldiers awake and alert for seven consecutive days.  

Because DARPA is mandated to take on risky projects, failures have occurred. For the most part, however, the Agency’s low profile has protected it from inaccurate scare stories cropping up in the popular press. However, in 2003 DARPA has managed to make the front pages twice, both times with disastrous results. Earlier in the year Congress moved to scale back the agency’s Terrorism Information Awareness Program (TIA). In an effort to spot patterns of terrorist activity, this program proposed the development of advanced computer systems capable of scanning commercial databases containing information on millions of Americans.  

Then, in late July, the Agency backed off a plan to set up a kind of futures market (Policy Analysis Market or PAM) that would allow investors to earn profits by betting on the likelihood of such events as regime changes in the Middle East. Critics, mainly politicians and op-ed writers, attacked the futures project on the grounds that it was unethical and in bad taste to accept wagers on the fate of foreign leaders and the likelihood of terrorist attacks. The project was canceled a day after it was announced. Its head, retired Admiral John Poindexter, has resigned.  

One addition to this excerpt: Poindexter’s resignation followed the creation of a contract by Trade sports.com that would pay  $\S100$   if he resigned. In any case, can markets trading terrorism-based contracts aid in the prediction of terrorist strikes and dealing with the effects of such strikes? If so, should such contracts be traded? For example, might the risk associated with investment in military or private security companies be managed with contracts on specific terrorist actions? Should such contracts be traded even in the light of potential moral hazard consequences?  

# 12.8 EPILOGUE  

In his presidential address to the American Finance Association, Richard  Roll (1988)  discussed the ability of academics to explain financial phenomena:  

The maturity of a science is often gauged by its success in predicting important phenomena. Astronomy, the oldest science, is able to predict the positions of planets and the reappearance of comets with a high degree of accuracy . . . . The immaturity of our science [finance] is illustrated by the conspicuous lack of predictive content about some of its most intensely interesting phenomena, particularly changes in asset prices. General stock price movements are notoriously unpredictable and financial economists have even developed a coherent theory (the theory of efficient markets) to explain why they should be unpredictable.  

The theories of capital market efficiency are quite powerful in that they are quite simple and do explain much of the behavior that is observed in capital markets. However, much empirical evidence exists that refutes capital markets efficiency. It should be noted that much of this evidence is contradictory and often reflects investors’ desire to discover money-making strategies, investment advisors’ needs to sell their services, and academicians’ needs for publications. Furthermore, some evidence of market inefficiencies may simply be the result of data mining; one can always find or “demonstrate” an interesting pattern or relationship given enough data. An even greater difficulty for the opponents of capital market efficiency is that they are not able to offer a reasonably coherent and robust set of competing theories of capital markets behavior. However, a good start to making this argument might be to consider the scenario of  Grossman and Stiglitz (1980)  who argue that markets cannot be fully information ally efficient because no one in such markets could earn abnormal returns or would have incentives to obtain and analyze information. Hence, there would be no mechanism to create information ally efficient markets to begin with. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude based on prevailing theoretical and empirical research that the verdict is still out on the extent to which capital markets are efficient.  
# Additional Reading  

Perhaps the single most important book for any investor or trader to read is Burton Malkiel’s still-relevant classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street  ( 2012 ). It is a nontechnical easy read and provides a rather skeptical discussion of a wide variety of trading strategies, and has been a financial best-seller since the early 1070s.  Lo and MacKinlay’s (1999)  more technical response,  A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street , is a more academic collection of essays depicting the nonrandom nature of stock prices. Two books concerning technical analysis are particularly good reads. The first,  Edwards, Magee, and Bassetti (2012) , or an earlier edition thereof, offers a basic how-to guide for charting and technical analysis. The second, a collection of essays edited by  Acar and Satchell (2002)  discuss more quantitative and algorithmic approaches to technical analysis. One essay, by  Lo, Mamaysky, and Wang (2000) , reprinted from the  Journal of Finance , discusses their empirical results on several technical tools and their approaches to designing algorithms for finding and testing transactions opportunities. Chapter 17 of  Elton, Gruber, Brown, and Goetzman (2010)  provides a nice review of the market efficiency literature and discusses the methodology of event studies. Chapters 2 and 4 of  Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997)  discuss the econometrics of testing stock return randomness and event studies.  Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2004, 2007)  offer very useful and readable introductions to prediction markets.  Surowiecki’s 2004  well-written book on crowd wisdom provides good insight on how divergent and largely uninformed individual opinions are aggregated into a highly efficient market.  Boudoukh, Richardson, and Whitelaw (1994)  offer an interesting synthesis of the literature on mean reversion and momentum trading rules.

# 12.9 EXERCISES  

1.  If price changes reflect new information, why should returns fluctuate randomly?

 2.  Consider the following stock price sequence:  

Compute three-day moving averages for days 3, 4, and 5. If one assumes that the three-day moving average price represents the true value of the stock because of the elimination of noise, should the investor buy or sell shares on days 3, 4, and 5?  

3.  Compute five-day moving averages for each date of the following series, assuming that 5 is the price for day 1 and 18 is the price for day 12:

4.  Toy stores have very clear seasonal patterns in their revenue flows. Should toy store company share prices exhibit similar seasonality?  

5.  An analyst has tested the effect of spin-off announcements on share prices using event study methodology. The analyst’s procedure proceeded as follows:  

a.  Ten spin-offs were obtained from the most recent year. b.  Announcement dates were standardized with 30 days of prices collected from both before and announcement dates. c.  Returns were computed and averaged for each company in the spin-off sample. Standard deviations and normal deviates were computed for the sample for each date. Appropriate tests for statistical significance were conducted. d.  Cumulative average residuals were computed for each date and tested for statistical significance. Test results suggested that spin-offs were associated with 30-day returns of  $8\%$  . Why might an investor be skeptical of this test? How can the test be improved?  
6.  Which is worth more?  

a.  A market forecasting service that correctly predicts the direction of the market portfolio with  $100\%$   consistency every month for extended periods of time and can be expected to continue to do so in the future. b.  A market forecasting service that incorrectly predicts the direction of the market portfolio with  $100\%$   consistency every month for extended periods of time and can be expected to continue to do so in the future.  

7.  Suppose that we wished to conduct an event study on whether acquiring firms experience share price reactions to takeover announcements. For our event study, we will use for our sample the following three acquiring firms:  

Company X: Merger announcement date January 15, 2012 Company Y: Merger announcement date February 15, 2012 Company Z: Merger announcement date April 10, 2012  

Suppose we establish an 11-day testing period for returns around the event dates, the event date plus five days before and five days after. The following table provides our three acquiring firm stock prices during 12-day periods around merger announcement dates:  

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5df503233581c4cbbfc403b785197416da3d5196e42a5a48ab8ed5af37182831.jpg)  

a.  Compute one-day returns for each of 11 days for each of the three stocks. b.  Suppose that we have decided to use the mean adjusted return method to compute excess or abnormal stock returns. Here, we will compute mean daily returns for each security for a period outside of our 11-day testing period. Suppose we compute average daily returns and standard deviations for each of the stocks for 180-day periods prior to the testing periods (the raw returns data are not given here). Suppose that we have found normal or expected daily returns along with standard deviations as follows:  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1b2508f1e8298a732f6e69deb12b06344c56f35e8880c1673613c479e6a6559b.jpg)  

Compute excess returns for each stock for each of the 11 days.  

c.  For each of the 11 days in the analysis, compute average residuals for the three stocks. Then, for each day, compute a standard deviation of residuals for the three stocks. Finally, compute normal deviates for each of the 11 dates based on the averages and standard deviations for the three stocks. d.  Are average residuals for any of the dates statistically significant at the  $95\%$   level? e.  Compute cumulative average residuals for each of the 11 dates. f.  Compute standard deviations and normal deviates for each of the 11 dates. g.  Does there appear to be statistically significant evidence of abnormal acquiring firm returns around announcement dates?  

8.  The following table reflects abnormal returns for each of 10 stocks over a seven-day period about day zero, which is the standardized date of the sudden death of the CEO for each of the 10 firms. An analyst wants to determine whether the death announcement date represents a significant event and make appropriate portfolio adjustments when CEOs suddenly die in the future.

a.  What are the average residuals, their standard deviations, and normal deviates for  

each of the seven dates? b.  What are the cumulative average residuals, their standard deviations, and normal deviates for each of the seven dates? c.  On which days are average residuals statistically significant at the  $1\%$   level? On which days are cumulative average residuals statistically significant at the   $1\%$  level?  
9.  The Hollywood Stock Exchange ( www.hsx.com ) has described itself as “the world’s leading entertainment stock market.” The site has been owned by Cantor Fitzgerald, one of the world’s leading trading firms. “Investors” at the HSX.trade virtual shares of celebrities and movies with virtual money called the Hollywood Dollar. For example, “investors” can trade “stock” on a new major movie release. Although the site is still considered an entertainment website, how might information concerning the price of this “stock” be of use to investors in the actual stock market? Similarly, how might information concerning the price of this “stock” be of use to managers of firms that produce and distribute films?  

10.  In Chapter 6, we discussed a simple dual market setting involving trading of English securities in 18th-century London markets and simultaneously in Amsterdam markets. Information would be revealed on these English securities in London markets, and this information would be delivered in Amsterdam via mail ships that departed London twice per week and required three days under the most favorable sailing conditions to reach Amsterdam. However, sometimes adverse weather would delay the arrival of these ships, and  Koudijs (2015, 2016)  was able to identify the impact of the delayed arrival of news, both public in newspapers and private in private letters, on Amsterdam markets. He further argued that news from England was the only information relevant to the pricing of English securities, and that the mail packets on ships were the only source of this news.  

a.  When mail ship arrivals were timely, how would you expect English security prices in Amsterdam to have changed relative to prices in London markets? b.  When mail ship arrivals were delayed—for example, by four days—how would you expect English security prices in Amsterdam to have changed relative to prices in London markets?
