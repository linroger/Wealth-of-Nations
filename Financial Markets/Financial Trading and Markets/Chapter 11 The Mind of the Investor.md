# The Mind of the Investor  

# 11.1 RATIONAL INVESTOR PARADIGMS  

As we will discuss later in Chapter 12, institutional buy-side investors such as mutual funds generally fail to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis. Many individual investors such as day traders tend to perform very poorly as well, perhaps even worse than their institutional buy-side counterparts.  Barber et al. (2020)  note that less than  $3\%$   of active day traders can produce predictably positive net returns. Nevertheless, the authors point out that the most experienced unprofitable day traders continue to trade and continue to lose. In fact, their study suggests that nearly three-fourths of day trading can be traced to traders with histories of trading losses.  

So, are most day traders just plain stupid?  Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainma (2011) , based on a sample of nearly 160,000 Finnish Armed Forces intelligence tests taken between 1982 and 2000 along with tax returns data, found that stock market participants had higher IQs than their non investing counterparts, even after adjusting for income and wealth differences. They also found that investors who had a higher IQ and were more successful produced higher Sharpe ratios, traded less frequently, held shares for longer periods of time, and maintained portfolios with larger numbers of different shares (implying greater portfolio diversification).  

Perhaps some individual investors—for example, the buy-and-hold types with diverse portfolios composed of “value stocks”—are more rational than others such as the typical day trader. Is the seemingly persistent self-defeating behavior of the typical day trader consistent with rational investing? Why should we discuss rational investors? Might rationality or lack thereof explain why some investors outperform others?  

Many financial models assume that all investors and all corporate managers are rational individuals who prefer more money to less and seek to maximize their wealth. Rational investors process information efficiently and use it to maximize their wealth. But, do investors really behave this way? Should they? The theories and models of efficient capital markets all draw from the assumption that investors are greedy, rational, and can access and exploit new information efficiently. By greedy, we mean that investors will strive to maximize their wealth. By rational, we mean that investors efficiently process and use all available information to maximize their wealth. Such assumptions might be quite reasonable—at least to an extent, and allow for simpler and more straightforward model building. The efficient market theories are attractive, in part, because they facilitate financial model building. Financial model-builders can treat investors as participants in a mathematical game if investors’ behavior is rational. Models based on rational behavior are usually less contrived, easier to create, and more believable than theories based on irrational behavior. Rational investors should maintain better survival rates in the marketplace, control more dominant wealth levels, and be more influential in price setting.  
On the other hand, ask yourself how many investors you know that are truly rational. As reasonable as the rationality assumption might seem, and as compelling as the models that it leads to can be, does the rationality assumption really reflect the mind of the investor? This chapter explores the extent to which investors might or might not be rational and how such deviations from rationality might affect financial markets. Experiments by psychologists and perhaps our own observations of market behavior suggest that the “rational man” assumption is not fully justified. Behavioral finance is concerned with the actual behavior and thinking of individuals who make financial decisions.  

# The St. Petersburg Paradox and the Expected Utility Paradigm  

In 1713, the mathematician Nicholas Bernoulli reasoned that a rational gambler should be willing to buy a gamble for its expected value. For example, it seemed rational for a gambler to invest up to  $\S1$   for a gamble that paid either   $\S2$   or zero based on the toss of a coin. He extended his reasoning to a series of coin tosses, continuing to reason that the ultimate value of the more complex gamble should still be its expected value. His cousin, Daniel Bernoulli, presented his paradigm in 1738 at a conference of mathematicians in St. Petersburg.   His extended problem, commonly referred to as the St. Petersburg Paradox, was concerned with why gamblers would pay only a finite sum for a gamble with an infinite expected value. Suppose, in Bernoulli’s paradigm, the coin lands on its head on the first toss, the gamble payoff is  $\S2$  . If the coin lands tails, it is tossed again. If the coin lands heads on this second toss, the payoff is  $\S4_{i}$  ; otherwise, it is tossed a third time. If the coin lands heads on the third toss, the payoff doubles again to  $\S8;$  ; otherwise, it is tossed again for a potential payoff of   $\S16$  . The process continues until the payoff is determined by the coin finally landing heads. Where    $n$   equals infinity, the expected value of this gamble is determined by the following equation:  

$$
E[V]=(0.5^{1}\times2^{1})+(0.5^{2}\times2^{2})+(0.5^{3}\times2^{3})+\,\cdots+(0.5^{\infty}\times2^{\infty})
$$  

This equation is based on the expectation that the probability of the coin landing heads on the first (or any) toss equals 0.5. If the coin lands heads on the first toss, the payoff equals  $\S2=2^{1}$  . Since there is a  $50\%$   chance that the coin will land tails on the first toss and a  $50\%$  chance the coin will land heads on the second toss, the probability of achieving a payoff of  $\S4=2^{2}$    on the second toss is   $0.5\times0.5=0.5^{2}$  . Thus, the payoff  $2^{n}$    is realized with probability equal to   $0.5^{n}$  . The expected value of the gamble equals the sum of all potential payoffs times their associated probabilities. So, exactly what is the expected value of this gamble? We simplify the equation above as follows:  
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{E[V]=(0.5^{1}\times2^{1})+(0.5^{2}\times2^{2})+(0.5^{3}\times2^{3})+\dots+(0.5^{n}\times2^{n})}\\ &{E[V]=(0.5\times2)+(0.5\times2)+(0.5\times2)+\dots+(0.5\times2)}\\ &{E[V]=(1)+(1)+(1)+\dots+(1)}\end{array}
$$  

It appears, since there is some possibility that the coin is tossed tails an infinity of times  $(n=\infty$  ), the expected or actuarial value of this gamble is infinite. This seems quite obvious from a mathematics perspective. Paradoxically, Bernoulli found that none of the esteemed mathematicians at the conference would be willing to pay an infinite sum (or, in most cases, even a large sum) of money for the gamble with infinite actuarial value. Were the mathematicians simply irrational? Or, should the worth or market value of a gamble or investment be less than its actuarial or expected value?  

Bernoulli opined that the resolution to this paradox is the now commonly accepted notion of “diminishing marginal utility,” which holds that as a person’s wealth increases, the satisfaction that she derives increases, but at a lesser rate (see  Figure 11.1 ). More money produces more satisfaction, but the rates of increase in satisfaction are less than the rates of increase in wealth. So the worth of a gamble to an investor is less than its expected value because the utility derived from each dollar of potential gains is less than the utility of each dollar potentially lost. Bernoulli proposed a log-utility function where an individual’s level of satisfaction derived from wealth is related to the log of her wealth level. The key to this utility function is that satisfaction increases as wealth increases, but at decreasing rates. This means that an investor stands to lose more satisfaction in an actuarially fair gamble than she stands to gain. The potential loss in a “double-or-nothing” bet is

FIGURE 11.1 Utility of wealth  $U=l n(w)$  .  
more significant than the potential gain. Thus, investors will reject actuarial ly fair gambles because, on average, they lose satisfaction or utility.  

The implication of the utility function is that rational investors should seek to maximize the expected utility of their wealth, not expected wealth itself. Furthermore, this theory of utility can serve as the theoretical foundation for risk aversion. Thus, rational investors can be motivated not only by greed, but by fear as well.  

# Von Neuman and Morgenstern: Axioms of Choice  

In their seminal treatise on game theory,  von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947)  present a set of behavioral assumptions (axioms) that we will adapt and use to derive the expected utility hypothesis. We shall start by assuming that investors make investment selection    $x_{i}$   from a convex subset    $\mathbf{x}$   of the    $n$  -dimensional Euclidean space    $\textstyle\mathbb{R}^{n}$  . The element  $x_{i}$   represents the number of units of investment    $i$   that can be selected by the investor from the    $n$   elements (investment combinations) of vector    ${\bf x}=[x_{1},\,\,\,\dot{x_{2}},\,\,\,\cdot\cdot\cdot\,\,\,x_{n}]^{T}$  . Convexity of this subset means that the investor can form linear combinations any elements in  $\mathbf{x}$   to obtain new elements in    $\mathbf{x};$   that is, for any    $\upalpha\ \in\ [0,\!1],$  ,    ${\upalpha}x_{j}\;+\;(1\;-\;{\upalpha})x_{k}\;\in\;{\bf x}.$  . The first three axioms ensure investor rationality:  

1.  Reflexivity : For an entire set    $\mathbf{x}$   of investment alternatives  $x_{i},x_{j}\!\gtrsim\!x_{j}$     $(x_{j}$   is at least as desirable as  $x_{j})$  . This axiom might be regarded as merely a mathematical necessity. This formal axiom is of little intuitive importance for our purposes.

 2.  Completeness (or Comparability) : For an entire set of investment alternatives  $x_{i},$   either  $x_{j}\succ x_{k}$     $(x_{j}$   is preferred to  $x_{k})$  ,  $x_{j}\prec x_{k}$     $(x_{j}$   is less desirable than  $x_{k})$   or  $x_{j}\,\sim\,x_{k}\,(x_{j}$  equally desirable to    $x_{k})$  ) for all  $j$   and  $k$  . Thus, the investor can fully specify his preferences over the entire set of investments.

 3.  Transitivity : For any  $x_{i},\,x_{j},\,x_{k},$   if    $x_{i}\succ x_{j}$   and  $x_{j}\,\succ\,x_{k},$   then    $x_{i}\succ x_{k}$  . This a x iom ensures consistency among choices.  

While the three axioms listed above are sufficient to ensure investor rationality, working with such preference relations is difficult at best when    $n$   is very large. Hence, it is useful to develop and apply a rule that assigns values to choices. Such a rule is known as a cardinal utility function. A cardinal utility function assigns a unique number (utility level) to each and every choice (e.g., wealth level, risk/return combination, etc.). Three more axioms are needed to establish a cardinal utility function:  

1.  Strong Independence : If  $\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\!\sim\!\boldsymbol{x}_{k},$   then for any    $\upalpha\,\in\,[0,1],\,\upalpha x_{i}+\,(1-\,\upalpha)x_{j}\!\sim\upalpha x_{k}+\,(1-\upalpha)x_{j}.$  It may be useful to interpret    $\upalpha$   as a probability. This axiom implies that preference rankings are not affected by inclusion in more complicated arrangements.

 2.  Me a sur ability (or Intermediate Value) : If    $x_{i}\succ x_{j}\succ x_{k},$   then there exists some  $\upalpha$   such that  $\begin{array}{r}{\propto x_{i}+\,(1-\,\mathrm{o})x_{k}\!\sim\!x_{j}.}\end{array}$  . This implies none x istence of le xico graphic (dictionary) orderings. Le xico graphic orderings imply discontinuities in utility functions.

 3.  Ranking : Assume that    $x_{i}\succ x_{j}\succ x_{k}$   and  $x_{i}\succ x_{m}\succ x_{k},$   and  $x_{j}\!\sim\!\upalpha x_{i}+\,(1-\,\upalpha)x_{k}$   and  $x_{m}\!\sim\!\gamma\,x_{i}+\,(1-\,\gamma)x_{k}$   where  $\upgamma\,\in\,[0,1]$  . Then it follows that if    $\upalpha\,\succ\,\upgamma,\,x_{j}\,\succ\,x_{m}$   or if    $\upalpha=\upgamma,$   $x_{j}\!\sim\!x_{m}$  . These six axioms are sufficient to construct a cardinal utility function where utility can  
be represented with numbers. We shall usually add two more assumptions to this list:  

1.  Greed: Investors prefer more to less wealth.

 2.  Risk aversion: Investors prefer certainty to uncertainty. (This assumption need not always apply, but it does seem realistic.)  

While seemingly complicated, these axioms of choice are the basis for the micro eco nomics of investment theory. Positive economics is typically based on the assumption that investors behave consistently with these axioms so as to maximize the utility associated with expected wealth. Perhaps more importantly, these axioms illustrate the mindset of economists analyzing the behavior of investors. The question we pose in the next section is whether and the actual extent to which investor behavior is consistent with these axioms.  

# 11.2 PROSPECT THEORY  

In the late 1960s, a cognitive psychologist named Amos Tversky began to find evidence that investors and gamblers might not behave in a manner consistent with maximizing utility. Tversky, in collaboration with others, including Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner for this body of work), had conducted numerous experiments on subjects testing decisionmaking characteristics. Generally, these experiments suggest that most subjects are quite irrational and inconsistent in their decision making. They have also written on applications of their results to financial decision making, suggesting that investors may actually be quite different from the theoretical “rational economic man.”  Kahneman and Tversky (1979) were particularly interested in how people made decisions when faced with uncertainty calling their new perspective  prospect theory  (with no particularly good reason). While expected utility maximization focuses on levels of wealth, prospect theory focuses on changes in wealth. Consider, for example, the following very simple illustration. Investor A has  $\mathbb{S}1\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{,}000$   right now, having doubled his money over the past 24 hours. Investor B has  $\mathbb{S}1{,}500{,}000$   right now, having lost  $50\%$   of his wealth over the past 24 hours. Which investor is happier now? Is more wealth always preferred to less? Do people make decisions as though this is true? Now, consider some slightly more complex scenarios.  

# Losses and Inconsistency  

Consider the following example choice of gambles:  

Gamble A:  0.33 probability of receiving 2500, 0.66 of receiving 2400, and 0.01 of receiving 0 Gamble B:    $100\%$   probability of receiving 2400  

Kahneman and Tversky found that   $82\%$   of their experiment participants preferred Gamble B to Gamble A. However, they offered the same set of participants the following second set of gambles:  

Gamble   $\mathbf{A}^{*}\colon0.33$   probability of receiving 2500, 0.67 of receiving 0 Gamble   $\mathbf{B}^{\ast}$  :  0.34 probability of receiving 2400 and 0.66 of receiving 0  
In the second part of this experiment,   $83\%$   of participants preferred Gamble   $\mathrm{A^{*}}$   to   $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$  . The same change was made to both gambles in moving from the first to second sets; 0.66 probability was shifted from Gambles A and B to  $\mathrm{A^{*}}$   and  $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$   from winnings of 2400 to zero. The gamble shifts were identical, but many participants reversed their preferences. Yet from the first to second sets of choices, the changes to both gambles were identical; losses of 2400 were imposed on both gambles from the first set to the second set with probability   $0.34.^{2}$    Since the losses were identical, participants should not have reversed their decisions, but, clearly, the majority did. Kahneman and Tversky surmised that people are risk averse when evaluating positive outcomes (winnings), but risk-seeking when evaluating losses. Hence, people have diminishing utility of wealth functions with respect to winnings, but increasing marginal utility when faced with wealth decreases. Investors seem to exhibit similar reactions to reductions in wealth.  

Consider a very simple variation on this problem. One group of subjects was presented with this problem:  

1.  In addition to whatever you own, you have been given  $\mathbb{S}1000$  . You are now asked to choose between:  

A: A sure gain of  $\S500$  B: A  $50\%$   chance to gain  $\mathbb{S}1000$   and a   $50\%$   chance to gain nothing A second group of subjects was presented with another problem.  

2.  In addition to whatever you own, you have been given  $\S2000$  . You are now asked to choose between:  $\mathrm{A^{*}}$  : A sure loss of  $\S500$  .  $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$  : A  $50\%$   chance to lose  $\mathbb{S}1000$   and a   $50\%$   chance to lose nothing.  

In the first group   $84\%$   chose A. In the second group   $69\%$   chose   $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$  . The two problems are identical in terms of terminal wealth to the subject; each offers either   $\S1500$   with certainty or a 50-50 chance at  $\mathbb{S}1000$   or  $\S2000$  . However, the phrasing of the question causes the problems that invoke different emotional responses. This leads to the following framing versus substance problem.  

# Frames versus Substance  

Determining the preferences of individuals is complicated by their apparently inconsistent responses to questions that are presented to them. These inconsistencies not only make it more difficult to study investor behavior, they make the problem of offering financial advice rather problematic. For example,  Kahneman and Tversky (1981)  and  Tversky and Kahneman (1986)  describe how various individuals form decisions when identical questions are phrased differently. In particular, consider the following example when individuals are asked from two different perspectives to select from radiation or surgery for cancer treatment:  

Survival Frame  

Surgery: Of 100 people having surgery, 90 live through the postoperative period, 68 are alive at the end of the first year, and 34 are alive at the end of five years.  
Radiation: Of 100 people having radiation therapy, all live through the treatment, 77 are alive at the end of the first year, and 22 are alive at the end of five years.  

Mortality Frame  

Surgery: Of 100 people having surgery, 10 die during surgery or the postoperative period, 32 die by the end of the first year, and 66 die by the end of five years. Radiation: Of 100 people having radiation therapy, none die during treatment, 23 die by the end of one year, and 78 die by the end of five years.  

Although the information presented in the “survival frame” is identical to that presented in the “mortality frame,”   $18\%$   of respondents preferred radiation therapy when presented with the “survival frame,” compared with   $44\%$   when presented with the “mortality frame.” Interestingly, physicians and statistically trained business students did not react differently from other respondents when surveyed.  

Consider an even simpler example suggested by  Ritter (2003) . How would you feel about paying a “peak-period surcharge” to dine in a restaurant? Next, consider how this surcharge pricing scheme differs from an “early bird” or “after-theater” discount. Presentation does matter. In any case, not only do we have evidence that individual decision making is inconsistent, but preferences may be inconsistent and individuals irrational as well. Consider this problem in an investments context. How can an investment advisor assess her client’s level of risk aversion when the framing of the question affects the investor’s response? Can we really expect investors to behave consistently when their risk attitudes change depending how their situations are addressed?  

The framing issue presents itself regularly in promotional literature distributed by investment advisors, mutual funds, and other financial institutions, who regularly exploit investors’ inability to contend with fallacious arguments. Consider the following description concerning corporate annual reports by  Beattie and Jones (2000) , “measurement distortion can occur through graphical devices such as a nonzero axis or a broken axis, which cause the rate of change in trend lines to appear greater than is actually warranted.” Their paper argues that graphs are frequently used selectively and graph formats exploit measurement distortions, implying inaccurate depictions of financial performance.  Diacon and Hasseldine (2007)  find evidence that investors are regularly misled by such distorted displays when selecting investment funds.  

There are a number of ways that the framing effect can surface in the investment decision-making process. Consider, for example, the return and risk effects of a decision to add a single stock to a portfolio. Investors often make decisions on a single stock based on its return/risk characteristics rather than how the stock’s purchase will affect the return/risk characteristics of the investor’s overall portfolio. This difference has the potential to be crucial, particularly if the investor’s portfolio is or will become poorly diversified. A high-risk stock can be a very good contribution to a poorly diversified portfolio if the stock serves to decrease the risk of the portfolio. In related decisionmaking arenas, pension, insurance, lump sums, and annuity decisions can be very confusing to consumers and investors who easily fall victim to framing effects (e.g.,  Brown, Kapteyn, Erzo, Luttmer, & Mitchell, 2017 ).  
# Maintaining the Status Quo: Joe and His Opera Tickets  

3 The following story was taken from the  Wall Street Journal :  

On the way to the opera, Joe loses his pair of  $\S50$   tickets. Most likely, he will not buy another pair— spending [a total of]   $\S200$   [including  $\S100$   on the lost tickets] to hear “La Boheme” seems a bit much. But suppose, instead, he arrives at the theater tickets-in-hand, but discovers he has lost a   $\mathbb{S}100$   bill. He could sell his tickets, which would net him the same result as in the first case—out  $\mathbb{S}100$   and out the tickets. But he probably won’t sell . . . . Joe may think he is entirely rational, but he leans consistently toward the status quo.  

This particular type of bias to maintain the status quo is sometimes referred to as the endowment effect . This effect causes losses or what is given up to weigh more heavily in the decision-making process than gains or what is acquired. This effect seems to manifest itself in investing through a seeming reluctance to sell stocks, particularly stocks that have lost value. Numerous studies (e.g.,  Shefrin & Statman, 1985 ) have documented investors’ reluctance to sell their “losers” to capture tax write-offs. The tax write-off implications of selling a stock that has lost value are enhanced when “losers” are sold before year’s end. Tax loss write-offs captured on that year’s return filings have more value than delayed loss write-offs. However, most investors demonstrate a pronounced reluctance to sell their losers to capture their write-offs. Investors seem intent on maintaining their status quo even when changing their portfolios would result in increased wealth. Some observers refer to this phenomenon as “fear of regret.” More generally, studies have suggested that this endowment effect or disposition effect might lead stock markets to underreact to news ( Frazzini, 2006 ) and exacerbate momentum effects in stock prices ( Grinblatt & Han, 2005 ).  

# Anchoring  

A similar sort of problem exists with “anchoring,” where the decision maker places undue emphasis on some factor, number, or measure. For example, Kahneman and Tversky asked participants in an experiment to spin a roulette wheel with numbers from 1 to 100 and then estimate the number of countries in Africa. They found that participants’ estimates were unduly influenced by the result of the roulette wheel spin result. Low roulette wheel outcomes were followed by lower estimates of the numbers of African countries. Similarly,  Genesove and Mayer (2001)  found that sellers of houses and apartments tend to be unduly influenced by purchase prices of their homes. There is similar evidence suggesting that investors may be unduly biased by purchase prices of their securities, and that such anchoring can lead to price momentum effects (e.g., Liao, Chou, & Chiu, 2013 ). Several studies such as  Beattie and Jones (2000)  have found that amateur traders are more affected by endowment and anchoring effects than professionals.  
# 11.3 BEHAVIORAL FINANCE  

Behavioral finance, largely rooted in prospect theory, is concerned with the impact of human emotions and cognitive impairments on investment decision making. Economists have used expected utility maximization for over two centuries as the presumed objective of the rational investor. Expected utility maximization has served and still serves as the “industry standard” for modeling investor behavior. In this section, we review a number of studies concerning individual and investor rationality. Many of these studies were conducted by experimental psychologists while most of the remainder are based on statistical analyses of financial data.  

The case for assuming capital markets efficiency when developing financial models is strong. Models based on rationality tend to be simple and one can argue that rational investors produce most market prices despite a large contingent of irrational investors. However, regardless of their intuitive appeal, theoretical models should not be accepted without consideration for empirical evidence. There exists much controversy in academia and in the profession regarding the extent to which models of market efficiency reflect reality. The following sections and the next chapter represent a sampling of this literature.  

# The Monty Hall Judgment Error  

One very interesting experimental study of investor irrationality, failure to learn, and market rationality is presented in  Kluger and Wyatt (2004) . This problem is adapted from the well-known Monty Hall problem, based on the late 1960s game show “Let’s Make a 4   Deal.” In the show, Monty Hall, its host, would offer contestants an opportunity to choose one prize hidden behind one of three identical doors. Prizes hidden behind two of three doors were worthless (if the contestant selected either of these doors, she was “zonked”) but the prize hidden behind the third was valuable. The contestant would attempt to choose the door behind which the valuable prize was to be hidden. At this stage in the game, the contestant had a one-third probability of winning the valuable prize. Before allowing the contestant to see whether she had won the valuable prize, and with increasing audience anticipation, Mr. Hall, who knows what is behind the doors, would then typically show the contestant the worthless prize behind one of the two doors that the contestant did not select. He would then offer the contestant an opportunity to switch her selection to the prize behind the third door. Thus, the contestant’s problem is whether to stick with her original selection or to switch her selection to the prize hidden behind the third door.  

To summarize, the valuable prize is behind one of the three doors. The probability of the contestant having selected the door with the valuable prize was initially 1/3. But, once one of the two worthless prizes is revealed behind a second door, can the contestant improve his odds of obtaining a valuable prize by switching his decision to select the other unopened door? Think about this question before reading on.  
Regardless of what prize remains behind the first door selected by the contestant, Mr. Hall will reveal the worthless prize behind a second door. Hence, the probability of a valuable prize behind the first door remains 1/3. We know that Mr. Hall will not reveal the prize behind the originally selected door, so its probability of being the desirable prize is unchanged. The door that Mr. Hall will select to open will have a worthless prize with probability one. This door will not have a valuable prize behind it. What is the probability that the valuable prize is behind the third door? This probability must be   $1-1/3-0=2/3.$  . Why? Remember that Mr. Hall will not open a second door with a valuable prize behind it. This doubles the probability that the valuable prize is behind the third door. Hence, the contestant should always switch his selection to maximize his probability of obtaining the valuable prize.   Most contestants did not. In fact, most experimental subjects, when provided a description of this problem announce that they would not switch ( Friedman, 1998 ). When asked to calculate probabilities, many people will say that the valuable prize is equally likely to be behind the first and third doors, despite the additional information realized when Mr. Hall reveals the prize behind the second door.  

Most people have no difficulty estimating that the initial probability of  $1/3$   for the prize behind any one of the three doors. This heuristic has served most people well for years. However, people tend to use the same heuristic when a “zonk” is revealed behind one of the doors, leading them to conclude that there is a 50/50 probability that the prize is behind one of them. This heuristic is difficult to abandon when the nature of the problem changed, as the problem solution shifts from an unconditional probability regime to a less intuitive conditional probability. Most people refuse to accept this shift.  

Perhaps, more interestingly, most subjects refuse to accept the validity of mathematical proofs offered to demonstrate the wisdom of switching doors. Furthermore, most subjects continue to refuse to switch doors after being permitted to watch repeated trials of this experiment where the third door leads to the valuable prize with a frequency of approximately 2/3. Hence, subjects seem to either never learn from their errors or learn very slowly.  

Kluger and Wyatt (2004)  conducted experiments to determine how a market might behave in such a scenario. Kluger and Wyatt gathered subjects in a laboratory setting and had them compete to select investments whose payoffs were “behind doors.” “Investors” participated in repeated trials, were offered opportunities to select doors, and then  

$^5\mathrm{If}$   you are not convinced that this solution to the Monty Hall problem is correct, consider the following table. The contestant has three choices to start with, followed by two choices after each of the first three. Thus, there are six possible outcomes, including three that result from switching doors. In two of the three switching outcomes, the contestant gets the car, compared to only one out of the three if the contestant keeps his original door selection. 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/99f538f30e0de355a290039ac17be3643b9660065501f851a4960356e1f49f12.jpg)  
compete to pay to either retain or switch their selections. If investors were rational and understood the nature of the Monty Hall problem, market prices to switch should be twice the levels of prices to retain original selections. Kluger and Wyatt found that when all investors mispriced the selections, prices of original selections remained roughly comparable to prices to switch. Hence, misinformed or irrational investors consistently mispriced the investments. However, when as few as two “rational investors” who correctly estimated the probabilities were included in the trials, prices to switch were roughly double the prices to retain original selections. Hence, it seemed that competition between only two rational investors out of many were necessary for market prices to reflect rational probabilities. This experiment raises an interesting question: Can as few as two competing rational investors offset irrationality in prices in an otherwise irrational securities market?  

Similarly, traders all have good reason to question their abilities to beat the market. First, at least   $50\%$   of traders are likely to be “below average,” and under perform the market, even without transaction costs. Transaction costs worsen traders’ abilities to outperform random “buy-and-hold” strategies. The market efficiency hypotheses provide ample rationale to avoid the attempt to “out trade” the market. Statistical evidence demonstrating the general inability to outperform the market is overwhelming.  

# Dumb, Dumber, and Dead  

The Monty Hall illustration result is quite counter intuitive and has caused confusion even among trained mathematicians. However, investors are susceptible to even more basic errors. For example,  Rashes (2001)  documents numerous cases of strong correlations between stocks with similar ticker symbols. For example, shares of stock for Massmutual Corporate Investors (ticker: MCI), an NYSE listed fund that did not hold shares of any major telecommunications companies, were strongly correlated with those of MCI Communications (ticker: MCIC), realizing particularly high volume and price during the period of merger discussions and activity involving the telecommunications firm. Massmutual’s returns were far more correlated with MCI’s than with AT&T or any of the other telecommunications firms. In fact, there is evidence that investors bought shares of Massmutual and held them for long periods of time, believing that they had invested in MCI. Similarly, the most volatile trading day for the Castle Convertible Fund (ticker: CVF) was April 15, 1997, after an article appeared in the  Financial Times  about investments in fraudulent companies by the Czech Value Fund (abbreviated as CVF in the article). In a 22-minute span, the stock price dropped from 24.75 to 16.75 before closing the day’s session at 23. On June 24, 1998, an AT&T bid for shares of Tele-Communications Inc. led to a  $4.3\%$   increase in the price of Transcontinental Reality Investors Inc. (ticker: TCI). In fact, the highest trading volume ever experienced by Transcontinental Reality shares to that date was on October 13, 1993, when Bell Atlantic announced its intent to purchase TeleCommunications.  

Kadapakkam and Zhang (2014)  examine shares of bankrupt firms after courts confirm that shareholders will receive nothing, finding that some have substantial trading volume at positive prices despite being intrinsically worthless. For example, Motors Liquidation Company (the former pre-bankruptcy GM) had daily trading volume peaking at over  $\S250$   million and BB Liquidation (formerly Blockbuster) averaged 1.7 million shares while awaiting their cancellation. Covering short sales did not explain this trading volume, though short-selling did help mitigate irrational price increases. “Fake news” on various Internet sites seemed to help prop up share prices and perhaps support “pump and dump” schemes.  
Even options markets exhibit evidence of uninformed or perhaps even irrational behavior. Studies have found that more than half of outstanding long-call-option positions that should have been exercised on the day before the ex-dividend date went un exercised, and many deep in-the-money puts that should have been exercised early were not.   While approximately half of this failure to exercise can be attributed to transaction costs, the remainder seems to be due to lack of awareness of the early exercise decision, inability to monitor their option positions, or irrationality. Furthermore, certain early exercises of CBOE call options seem to be irrational, where customers of both full-service and discount brokers seem to exhibit irrational exercise behavior, while traders in large investment houses did not.  

Perhaps the most notorious of under performing funds during the 1990s bull market was the Steadman Technology & Growth Fund. Its returns during part of this decade were

  $-5\%$   in 1992,    $-8\%$   in 1993,    $-37\%$   in 1994,    $-28\%$   in 1995,    $-30\%$   in 1996, and    $-28\%$   in

 1997. Market returns were positive in each of these years. Only one of the four Steadman funds had a positive long-term return, although it was quite small. Why were returns so dismal? Portfolio turnover rates and transaction costs were extremely high, expense ratios were frequently in the   $6\%$   to  $7\%$   range, and Steadman seemed not to have a coherent investment strategy, indiscriminately investing in stocks and other securities. The SEC forced the fund to stop accepting money from new investors in 1989. Why did other investors keep money invested throughout the dismal performance of the early 1990s? When the Technology & Growth Fund was finally shut down, about   $30\%$   of the redemption checks were returned, presumably because the shareholders were dead.  

# Myopia and Overreaction  

Several studies have suggested that investors overreact to the most recent information (e.g.,  Thaler, Tversky, Kahneman, & Schwartz, 1997 ), and that they are too influenced by short-term price swings than they should be. In addition,  Griffin and Tversky (1992)  and Sorescu and Subramanya m (2006)  find that investors tend to overreact to dramatic upgrade recommendations of less experienced and less reputable analysts while they under-react to less dramatic upgrade recommendations of more experienced and more reputable analysts. Furthermore, there is some empirical evidence (to be detailed later) that stocks experiencing wide short-term price swings reverse those swings in the intermediate term. This behavior suggests that investors may overreact to information. In addition, there is much evidence in the psychology and investments literature that people tend to be overconfident in their own judgments, perhaps, oddly enough, even enabling certain overconfident traders to generate higher profits than their more rational competitors under limited conditions. While, in general, overconfident investors seem to trade more frequently and realize reduced returns, in more professional trading settings, more confident traders may realize higher profits by more frequently exploiting bid ' offer spreads. There is also evidence that experts tend to be more prone to over confidence than novices. Overconfident professional traders also tend to be more aggressive in their trading strategies, and in some instances, improving their returns.  
# Myopia  

Consider a paper by  Benartzi and Thaler (1995)  that examines the widespread large differences between bond and stock returns. From 1925 to 1997, intermediate term government bond returns have averaged approximately   $5.2\%$   while stock returns have averaged approximately   $10.7\%$  . This spread indicates reluctance on the part of investors to buy stock, even though for practically every intermediate- to long-term period over the 75 years prior to 1997, investors could have expected to earn more in stock markets.   Benartzi and Thaler argue that even long-term investors have a myopic outlook, causing them to make every effort to avoid short-term losses and risks. This aversion to losses is often referred to as  myopic loss aversion  and is frequently offered as the cause for the equity return premium relative to bonds. For example, their experiments conducted on university employees indicated that when shown only the 30-year returns on stocks and bonds, employees preferred to hold more stock in their pension accounts. Thus, when employees see how much money will be available in their retirement accounts in 30 years, they prefer the higher returns associated with stocks. However, when shown additional information reflecting the entire year-by-year return path over the 30-year period, employees preferred less stock in their accounts, even though they still would have more money at the end of the period with stock investment. Thus, investors with a long-run orientation to investment still maintain a myopic aversion to risk because they care not only about how much money they will have available when they retire, but their gains and losses en route to their retirements. A number of financial institutions, such as Bank Hapoalim, the largest manager of mutual funds in Israel, reduced the frequency with which they issue financial statements to their investors, citing investors’ myopic risk aversion as their rationale (see Gneezy, Kapteyn, & Potters, 2003 ). They expected that their investor-clients would be less likely to move money out of their funds if they received reports of balances less frequently.  

Jeremy Siegel, in his book titled  Stocks for the Long Run  (1994), lends support for this myopic loss aversion argument, arguing that, “It is widely known that stock returns on average, exceed bond returns in the long run. But it is little known that in the long run, the risks in stocks are less than those found in bonds or even bills!” While this statement might overstate the risk/return point, it does seem that most investors overemphasize short-term risk at the expense of long-term returns. On the other hand, Dimson, Marsh, and Staunton (2002)  note that the long run can be very long. For example, the Italian stock market failed to keep pace with inflation from 1915 to 1978 and communist takeovers closed down Russian and Chinese stock markets in the 20th century.  
Numerous experiments reported in the psychology literature have indicated that individuals in their decision making tend to overemphasize recent information and trends and under emphasize prior information. For example,  Shiller, Kon $\mathrm{\nabla{Ya},}$   and Tsutsui (1996)  found that at the peak of the Japanese market,   $14\%$   of Japanese investors expected a crash. However, just after the market did crash,   $32\%$   expected another crash. Even professional analysts tend to overreact to new information. Excessive dependence on recent information may lead the market to overreact to new information, and may even explain the socalled price-to-earnings ratio anomaly (discussed in Chapter 11). In an important paper, Shiller (1981)  examines empirical data and argues that the volatility in stock markets cannot be explained by the volatility of cash flows (dividends) associated with stocks, suggesting that investors may overreact to risk. Market prices are extremely sensitive to potential future earnings anticipation, and in fact, are too sensitive, so that they vary far more than the actual dividends.  

# Hyperbolic Discounting  

Suppose that you just won the lottery. Would you rather be paid   $\S500{,}000$   in five years or   $\mathbb{S}1{,}000{,}000$   in ten years? Many, but not all people would opt for the larger sum delayed by an additional five years. Now, change the payout dates. Would you rather have   $\S500{,}000$   now or   $\mathbb{1}{,}000{,}000$   in five years? Many more people would opt for the smaller sum now. That is, at least a few people would reverse their preferences by advancing the payoff dates by five years. Similarly, as cash flow dates approach, some investors will reverse their preferences toward preferring smaller cash flows sooner.  

The time value principle holds that preferences should not depend on the decision date. That is, if an investor prefers Investment A to  $\mathrm{B}$   today based on its current time value of  $\mathrm{B}$  money, she would still prefer A to   at a later date given that the cash flow dates do not change. For example, suppose that an investor (consumer) prefers alternative A to alternative B   $(\mathrm{A}>\mathrm{B},$   or    $\mathbf{\hat{\calC}}F_{A}\mathbf{e}^{-r\hat{T}_{A}}\,{>}\,C F_{B}\mathbf{e}^{-r T_{B}}$  with  $r>0.$  , where alternative A has a higher nominal value or cash flow   $(C F_{A}>C F_{B})$  , but is delayed longer   $(T_{A}>T_{B})$  . Thus, the investor (consumer) decides now that she prefers to consume the larger amount    $C F_{A}$   at the later date  $T_{A}$   to the smaller    $C F_{B}$   sooner at date    $T_{B}$  . However, if both alternative investment payoff levels were advanced by the same increments in time    $T_{B}$   (e.g., alternative A now pays at time   $(T_{A}\mathrm{~-~}T_{B})$   and   $\mathrm{B}$   now pays at time    $T_{B}\mathrm{~-~}T_{B}$   or time zero  '  now), many decision makers would reverse their preferences. That is, even though they might initially prefer the larger awards even if delayed longer, if the smaller reward were offered now, they would prefer it to the larger reward with a shorter delay. That is:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{C F_{A}{\bf e}^{-r T_{A}}>C F_{B}{\bf e}^{-r T_{B}}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{C F_{A}{\bf e}^{-r(T_{A}-T_{B})}<C F_{B}{\bf e}^{-r(T_{B}-T_{B})}}}\end{array}
$$  

These two statements are mutually inconsistent, and illustrate temporal myopia. Consider the following example, with cash flow present values set forth in  Table 11.1 . An investor has the opportunity to decide between receiving  $\S50$   five years from now and  $\S100$   ten years  
TABLE 11.1 Hyperbolic Discounting 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/2cb9b95ef031e9fd905474ece4946a6c072399e24953ea179c8110d950711cf5.jpg)  

from now. If she discounted cash flows at an annual rate of   $10\%$     $(P V=C F\mathrm{e}^{-0.10}T)$  , she would prefer to have  $\S100$   ten years from now. Suppose that the investor had “impulse issues,”  $50\%$  and that her discount rate were   for one year immediately prior to consumption and  $5.556\%$   for all other years:    $P V=C F\mathrm{e}^{-(0.05556+\cdots+0.05556+0.5)}$  . Still, the investor would prefer to receive   $\S100$   in 10 years to receiving   $\S50$   in five years. However, if the investor were permitted to make her decision in the fifth year, her preference ranking would reverse:  $\bar{P}V_{A}=48.47<P V_{B}=50$  .  

This investor uses a form of hyperbolic discounting to discount her cash flows. The discounting functions are based on a constant discount rate    $r=0.10$   from above and can be easily generalized to accommodate time-varying discount rates:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{F_{A}{\bf e}^{-(r_{1}+r_{2}+\cdots+r T_{B}+\cdots+r T_{A})}>C F_{B}{\bf e}^{-(r_{1}+r_{2}+\cdots+r T_{B}}}}\\ {{C F_{A}{\bf e}^{-(r_{1}+\cdots+r_{(T_{A}-T_{B})})}<C F_{B}{\bf e}^{-(r_{(T_{B}-T_{B})})}=C F_{B}}}\end{array}
$$  

which is still inconsistent unless  $r_{1}$   (along with, perhaps other  $r_{t}<r_{T B})$  ) is sufficiently high. This type of hyperbolic discounting was proposed by  Strotz (1956)  and  Laibson (1997) .  

Thus,  Table 11.1  suggests that the consumer will prefer option A in every period except when the consumption of option B is imminent. The preference ranking changes because immediate consumption is considered (discounted) differently from deferred consumption. However, this impulse typically applies only when one of the options is immediate.  

Neuro economics might offer an explanation for this effect.   Consider a scenario where experimental subjects in a laboratory experiment are offered a choice between  $\S10$   now and   $\S15$   in one month. MRI analysis shows that both the separate limbic (which governs intuitive, affective, and emotional cognition) and analytic (which govern analytical, computational, and strategic cognition) systems show blood flow activity. Next, change the offer terms such that only two future award alternatives exist:   $\S10$   two weeks from now and  $\S15$   in one month. The MRI imaging changes such that only the analytic system shows activity. Subjects are more willing to accept the delayed, but larger rewards. Thus, when the choices include a current reward, the limbic system seems to allow the temptation of immediate gratification to dominate the otherwise apparently more rational decision (Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow, we may die). Hence, pre commitment (policy, monetary deposits, contracts, etc.) to more rational decisions might help overcome this effect. Similarly, reliance on others for decision making may also be useful when their analytical systems are more involved in this process.  
Consider, for example, that Dr. Edward Miller, dean of the Johns Hopkins University Medical School and chief executive officer of its hospital, claims that over half a million people undergo coronary-artery bypass graft surgery every year in the United States, but only about   $10\%$   of these patients make lifestyle changes needed to prevent future surgeries, chest pains, and premature death. It is well known that employees regularly opt not to participate in employer retirement savings plans, even when employers match their contributions. One might argue that contractual pre commitment or government intervention might play a role in regulating human behavior. For example,  O’Donoghue and Rabin (2006)  suggest that willpower weaknesses might be remedied by taxing potato chips and subsidizing carrots. The U.S. federal government provides for tax deferral subsidies to encourage employer-sponsored retirement accounts.  

# Overreaction  

Stocks that experience wide short-term price swings may have a tendency to reverse those swings in the intermediate term. This behavior suggests that investors may overreact to information. As we will discuss later,  DeBondt and Thaler (1985)  argue that the market overreacts to information and that abnormal returns can be realized by buying losers and selling winners. Their study indicated that buying stocks that performed poorly in a prior three- to five-year period and selling those that performed well would have generated higher than normal returns in subsequent three- to five-year periods. Most significant mean reversion tendencies seem to hold for the month of January.  

# Investor Moods, the Weather, and Investment Returns  

There is some evidence that investor moods might significantly affect market performance. For example,  Kamstra, Kramer, and Levi (2003)  found that seasonal disorder, a medical condition where the shorter days in fall and winter lead to depression for many people, is associated with reduced stock market returns after adjusting for a variety of other factors. They found that stock market returns are higher during the spring quarter than in the fall quarter. Seasonally related factors can be captured by examining cyclical ties in markets with varying latitudes, paying attention to variations in behavior near solstices and equinoxes. Northern and southern hemisphere returns seem six months out of phase.  
Several studies have found that weather might affect market returns. For example, Hirsh leif er and Shumway (2003)  found that cloud cover in the city of a country’s major stock exchange is negatively correlated with daily stock index returns in 18 of 26 national exchanges for the period of 1982 to 1997. Stock market performance was simply worse on cloudy days. In New York City, there was a  $24.8\%$   annualized return for all days forecast to be perfectly sunny, and an   $8.7\%$   average return occurred on cloudy days. There seems to be evidence in the psychology literature indicating that sunshine improves investor moods, and may collectively increase investor willingness to accept risk.  Limp a pha yom, Locke, and Sarajoti (2007)  obtained consistent results using wind and the traders on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with windy days seeming to increase bid-ask spreads.  

However, despite these dramatic return differences, the evidence on the relationship between investor behavior and weather is not entirely clear. For example,  Goetzmann and Zhu (2005)  analyzed trading accounts of 79,995 investors from 1991 to 1996, finding that individual investors’ trading behavior is no different on sunny days than on cloudy days. Nevertheless, market-maker behavior was significantly affected by cloud cover in one important respect: cloudy days were associated with wider bid-ask spreads, suggesting that investors (or market makers) were more risk averse on these days.  

Edmans, Garcı´a, and Norli (2007)  find evidence of a strong link between soccer outcomes and mood, using international soccer results as their primary mood variable. They found that markets experienced significant decline after soccer losses, such as losses in the World Cup elimination stage leading to next-day abnormal stock returns of   $0.49\%$  . These loss effects were stronger in small stocks (more likely to be traded by individual investors) and for more important games. They also documented loss effects after international cricket, rugby, and basketball games. They controlled for effects of related business revenues resulting from contest outcomes. While sports losses were clearly related to stock returns, they did not find that sports wins had any significant effects on returns.  

Scientific evidence is clear that lunar cycles are related to tides, animal behavior, and other natural phenomena. In related research drawing on inconsistent research results indicating that homicide rates, hospital admissions, and crisis incidents all peak in the days around full moons,  Dichev and Janes (2001)  find evidence that stock returns around new moons nearly double those around full moons. The effects arise in U.S. stock markets over 100 years and in other markets over the past 30 years. Are there good explanations for this? Should we suspect that eventually anything can be proved or disproved with careful statistical analysis?  Kim (2016) , with a particular focus on the methodologies conducted in the cloud cover studies by  Hirsh leif er and Shumway (2003) , argues that many such results are spurious, the product of mining large data sets with faulty statistical methods.  

# Simplifying the Decision Process  

Even if investors were able to efficiently and rationally process small information sets for simple decisions, are they capable of processing larger sets of information for more complex decisions? Consider the following case illustrated by W. Bentley MacLeod and presented by Andrew Lo in TIAA-CREF’s Investment Forum:  
[C]onsider the simple task of getting dressed in the morning: For a typical male wardrobe of 5 jackets, 10 pants, 20 ties, 10 shirts, 10 pairs of socks, 4 pairs of shoes and 5 belts, there are two million different combinations to evaluate, and if we allow one second to evaluate each outfit, it would take about 23 days to select the “best” outfit. . . .  Yet we all seem to get dressed in just a few minutes—how?  

Even fairly simple problems such as getting dressed require heuristics or rules of thumb. However, all too often, these rules of thumb simply do not work for more complex problems such as selecting stocks. In his paper on stock market noise,  Black (1986)  wrote:  

Because there is so much noise in the world, people adopt rules of thumb. They share their rules of thumb with each other, and very few people have enough experience with interpreting noisy evidence to see that the rules are too simple.  

Nevertheless, rules of thumb are important. Without them, many people would be simply unable to invest (or, even get dressed in the morning).  

# Rational Investors and Diversification  

Perhaps the single most important lesson from modern finance is the importance of diversification and its role in the management of risk. Investors can create more efficient portfolios by investing in broader arrays of investments. However, many studies including Goetzmann and Kumar (2008)  suggest that investors do not diversify efficiently. For example, investors tend to concentrate their holdings in shares of their employers, in domestic shares, and even in the shares of companies located near their residences. While many investors certainly have lost substantial portfolio efficiency due to this sort of myopia, a smaller number of investors have been able to outperform the market by under diversifying. For example,  Coval, Hirsh leif er, and Shumway (2005)  document strong persistence in the performance of trades made by skillful individual investors who seem able to exploit market inefficiencies and information advantages to earn abnormal profits.  Ivkovi´c and Weisbenner (2008)  corroborate this result, finding that households exhibit a strong preference for local investments. Ivkovi´c and Weisbenner demonstrate that individuals’ investments in local stocks outperform their investments in nonlocal stocks. They find that this effect is more pronounced for their investments in smaller companies outside of the S&P 500. Similarly,  Massa and Simonov (2006)  found that Swedish investors also exhibited strong preferences for holding stocks to which they are geographically or professionally close. They also found that such apparent information advantages enabled these investors to earn excess returns on their more “familiar” investments. In fact,  Ivkovi´c, Sialm, and Weisbenner (2005)  found that investors holding smaller, less diverse portfolios and concentrating their holdings in local companies actually outperformed their more “efficient” counterparts who held more diverse portfolios.  Coval and Moskowitz (1999, 2001)  found similar results for professional fund managers: professionals tend to invest more heavily in shares of companies located nearby and earn higher returns on the holdings of these local companies.  
# 11.4 BODY AND MIND OF THE TRADER  

# Over confidence  

How many investors believe that they are better than average traders? How many dri9   vers think that they are better than average? How many people think that they are dumb (less intelligent than average)? Half? Certainly, no one begins trading stocks thinking that he will perform worse than the market or the average trader.   Yet, it is likely that half of all traders are below average. But, how do typical investors actually fare? And how do they fare relative to professionals?  Russo and Schoemaker (1992)  wrote:  

Good decision-making requires more than knowledge of facts, concepts and relationships, it also requires meta knowledge—an understanding of the limits of our knowledge. Unfortunately, we tend to have a deeply rooted over confidence in our beliefs and judgments.  

To test for over confidence and compare results across professions, Russo and Schoemaker created and administered a 10-question test similar to the Trivia Quiz provided in Table 11.2 .   Before discussing the results of their study, take the test yourself. Since you will probably not know the exact answers for each of these questions, your objective is to guess by setting minimum and maximum bounds for each of the questions such that you are   $80\%$  confident that the actual answer will be within the   $80\%$   confidence interval that you set. Obviously, if your range is from 0 to infinity for each question, the correct answers will all fall within your confidence intervals. But, again, your goal is to answer only with   $80\%$   certainty, so narrow your ranges accordingly. Take this test before reading further.  

The answers to this test are provided in  Table 11.3 . Since takers of this test were to establish   $80\%$   confidence intervals for each of the question estimates, each person taking this test should have gotten eight questions correct—at least on average. Answering a question correctly simply means that the actual answer will fall within the  $80\%$   confidence interval. Thus, correctly answering eight questions indicates correct “calibration” of the confidence ranges. More than eight correct may indicate under confidence and excess conservatism; less than   $80\%$   correct indicates over confidence. Thus, the real purpose of this test is to examine the test-taker’s ability to calibrate her confidence range. The vast majority of test takers find that their answers fall within   $80\%$   confidence intervals far less than  $80\%$   of the time; in fact  $20\%$   to  $50\%$   scores are typical. Russo and Schoemaker administered a test similar to this to members of many professions, finding that most members of most professions exhibit significant over confidence. In fact, securities analysts performed poorly relative to members of other professions, receiving scores of only  $36\%$   when asked to set TABLE 11.2 Trivia Quiz: Enter the Range (Minimum and Maximum) for Which You Are  $80\%$   Certain the Answer Lies Within

$90\%$   confidence intervals. Test subjects in most professions simply fail consistently to calibrate their certainty levels.  

To test whether experiment subjects function better with respect to their areas of expertise, they were administered similar types of tests focusing on issues more relevant to their professions. The majority of professionals in most fields failed to perform much better. Interestingly, only two of the tested professions exhibited calibration skills failing to exhibit over confidence: accountants on tests related to auditing and climatologists when forecasting weather.  
What does this mean for stock market behavior? First, trading activity increases when traders are overconfident. Overconfident traders tend to be more aggressive in their trading strategies. Overconfident traders underreact to the information content of trades by rational traders, causing positive serial correlation in returns.  Odean (1998a, 1998b)  and Barber and Odean (2000, 2001a, 2001b) , in studies of trading in 10,000 and over 60,000 discount-brokerage accounts from 1987 to 1993 and from 1991 to 1996, found that trading by investors reduced their levels of wealth below what they would have realized with simple buy-and-hold strategies. For example, they found that stocks these investors sold beat the market while those they bought did worse than the market. By one year after the trades, the average investor ended up over  $9\%$   worse off than if had he done nothing. In another study of 1607 investors,  Barber and Odean (2001a, 2001b)  found that investors that had switched from phone-based trading to internet systems increased their portfolio turnover rates from  $70\%$   per year to   $120\%$  . They outperformed the market on average by   $2.35\%$  before switching and were outperformed by the market by   $3.5\%$   after switching. Amateur traders clearly under performed the market and the most active traders experienced the worst performance. While commissions certainly hurt these traders, the data suggested that bid-ask spreads hurt them even more. However, their trading activity would have reduced their wealth levels even if trading costs had been zero. Interestingly, investors who traded the least actually beat market indices.  

Over confidence extends beyond the individual investor. For example,  Hilary and Menzly (2006)  argue that professional stock analysts who have outperformed their peers in the recent past tend to become overconfident and under perform their peers in subsequent periods. In another line of inquiry,  Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, and Phillips (1982)  argue that people tend to be overconfident in their own judgments.  Griffin and Tversky (1992) argue that experts tend to be more prone to over confidence than novices.  Taylor and Brown (1988)  argue that over confidence leads “to higher motivation, greater persistence, more effective performance and ultimately more success.” Perhaps, according to  Kyle and Wang (1997) , more aggressive trading behavior of overconfident professional traders enables them to generate higher profits than their more rational competitors.  

# Over confidence and Gender  

The relationship between over confidence and performance is rather complicated. First, experimental evidence presented by  Deaves, Lu¨ders, and Luo (2009)  suggest that overconfidence, as measured by degree of mis calibration (perhaps indicated by performance on the trivia quiz above) leads to increased trading activity. However, they did not find a correlation between gender and degree of mis calibration. Nonetheless, other studies such as Barber and Odean (2001a,b)  have suggested that men are more prone to over confidence than women, particularly in male-dominated realms such as finance.  Dorn and Huberman (2005)  found that investors who believe that they are better than average trade more frequently. Using account data from over 35,000 accounts from a discount brokerage firm, Barber and Odean (2001a,b)  find that men trade  $45\%$   more frequently than women, reducing their returns relative to market indices by   $2.65\%$   compared to   $1.72\%$   for women. Differences between men and women in the trading realm are so striking that one might ask whether people trade for entertainment in addition to wealth creation.  
Evolutionary biologists have argued that males of many species tend to take more risks than their female counterparts (e.g.,  Gat, 2000 ). Gat suggests that males take increased risks to enhance their status in order to create more opportunities to reproduce, knowing that prospective mates prefer higher-status males.  

If individual traders, particularly aggressive individual traders, lose money relative to the market, who makes money? Consider a study by  Barber, Lee, and Liu (2009)  covering the entire Taiwanese stock market from 1995 to 1999. They documented that individual investor trading results in consistently large losses averaging approximately   $3.8\%$  . These individual investor losses amount to   $2.2\%$   of Taiwan’s GDP, almost as much as the country’s total private expenditures on clothing and footwear ( Barber et al., 2008 ). These losses are attributable to aggressive trading behavior. On the other hand, Barber et al. found that institutional investors outperform the market by   $1.5\%$   (after commissions and taxes, but before other costs passed on to their retail investors). Both aggressive and passive trades of institutions are profitable.  Barber et al. (2008)  conclude that “the trading and markettiming losses of individual investors represent gains for institutional investors.”  

# Entertainment and Sensation-Seeking  

Aggressive trading behavior does seem related to over confidence, but there is also good reason to think that it can be related to sensation or thrill seeking, just as gambling might be. For example,  Barber et al. (2008)  argued that “the introduction of a national lottery in Taiwan reduced trading on the Taiwan Stock Exchange by about one fourth.”  Dorn, Dorn, and Seng mueller (2015)  made a similar argument based on evidence arising from California, multistate U.S., and German lotteries, showing that individual traders reduced trading participation during weeks when lotteries such as Powerball and Mega Millions advertised increased jackpots. Based on survey data and actual trading records,  Dorn and Seng mueller (2009)  found, based on a survey of 1000 German brokerage clients, that respondents who professed to enjoy trading or gambling turn over their portfolios 1.5 times as often as respondents who profess no such enjoyment.  

In a paper linking thrill-seeking behavior with aggressive trading,  Grinblatt and Keloharju (2009)  demonstrate that aggressive trading is directly related to the number of speeding tickets that traders receive. In earlier research,  Zuckerman (1994)  and  Jonah, Thiessen, and Au-Yeung (2001)  suggested that driving behavior is an excellent observable behavior for assessing thrill seeking. Furthermore, the finding that men trade more aggressively may be rooted in the same quality that leads them to more frequently violate speed limits. Men may simply enjoy the thrill of trading and the thrill of speeding more than women appear to.  

Sensation-seeking motivations and behavior appear to extend beyond individual traders into institutional investor realms, including hedge funds.  Brown et al. (2018)  compiled data that enabled them to match 1774 personal vehicles, of which 163 vehicles were sports cars, to 1144 U.S.-based hedge fund managers. Their tests indicated that sports car ' owning hedge fund managers took on greater investment risk than other hedge fund managers. However, these apparently sensation-seeking managers failed to provide commensurate returns, leading to reduced Sharpe ratios and reduced fund alphas (see Chapter 10 of this book). Sensation-seeking managers traded more frequently and purchased higher-risk shares. Furthermore, sports car ' owning managers were more likely to terminate their funds and report regulatory, civil, and criminal violations on their Forms ADV (Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration and Report). Brown et al. suggest that while some sensation-seeking investors may actually have sought such sensationseeking managers, their tests were unable to link sports car purchases with ability to attract higher levels of capital.  
# Professional Traders and Hormones  

It is well-known that testosterone and cortisol, hormones more abundant in the male body than in the female, have clear cognitive and behavioral effects. For example, testosterone is more prevalent in the bodies of winning male athletes than in losing athletes, and cortisol is known to increase in situations characterized by un control l ability, novelty, and uncertainty. But, what is the relationship between these hormones and trading behavior?  Coates and Herbert (2008)  sampled, under actual working conditions, endogenous steroids from a group of male London traders in the City of London. They found that a trader’s morning testosterone level predicts his day’s trading profitability. More specifically, they found that on mornings when testosterone levels were high, 14 of the 17 traders in their study realized higher trading profits. They also found that a trader’s cortisol rises with both the variance of his trading results and the volatility of the market. Thus, Coates and Herbert found that that higher testosterone levels seem to contribute to trading returns while cortisol levels increased as risk and risk-taking increase.  

Coates and Herbert expressed concern that chronically elevated testosterone levels could have negative effects on returns, because testosterone has also been found to lead to imp ul siv it y and sensation seeking along with harmful risk taking. For example, in one study, testosterone administered to players of a gambling game led to their accepting irrational risk/reward tradeoffs.  

It is clear that women and men show differences in their investment decision-making. Neyse et al. (2016) , in their experimental studies, and studies that we have already discussed find that male subjects are more over optimistic than females in their prediction abilities. Women are more risk averse and men trade more aggressively. In large-sample studies of brokerage firm clienteles (amateur traders), women outperform men. Here, we examine more closely certain physical differences between men and women along with their trading behavior in more professional trading settings. Hormonal influences in particular might have important effects on market behavior.  

In their study of experimental computerized double-auction asset markets involving 142 “traders,”  Cueva et al. (2015)  show that both cortisol, which elevates in response to physical or psychological stress (risk), and testosterone levels, which are predictive of confidence and success in a variety of competitive circumstances, shifted the asset selection of young males towards riskier instruments. They argued that the presence of these hormones at elevated levels could play de stabilizing roles in financial markets. In their experiments, relevant hormones were either externally induced (elevated by pills or injection) or natural levels were simply measured in saliva. Nevertheless, higher levels of these hormones were clearly related to risk-taking in males.  
While androgenic hormone levels are relevant to our competitive performance, even exposure in utero to these hormones seems to be relevant. Consider, for example, the ratio 2D/4D of index finger (2D) length to ring finger (4D) length, which numerous studies have suggested to be inversely correlated with prenatal testosterone exposure (e.g., Williams et al., 2000 ).   The index to ring finger length ratio is inversely correlated to both improved confidence and improved performance in a variety of competitive activities ranging from sports to trading (e.g.,  Coates, Gurnell, & Rustichini, 2009 ;  Manning, 2002 ). That is, first, males tend to have lower index to ring finger (2D/4D) ratios than females, and lower 2D to 4D ratios are associated with both higher testosterone exposure in utero and later levels of confidence and performance in competitive situations. In addition to realizing superior trading performance, males with lower digit ratios remain in the market longer.  

Coates, Gurnell, and Sarnyai (2010)  suggest that, while markets might, in general reflect all available information (be efficient), traders’ interpretation of this information might not be stable, in part, due to fluctuating hormone levels. High levels of testosterone tend to increase trading confidence while increasing levels of cortisol may decrease risk-taking. If such hormone levels vary systematically across traders, market stability might be affected. Diversity, particularly gender diversity on trading floors has the potential to mitigate the influence of systematic hormonal effects on market behavior.  

# 11.5 NEURO FINANCE: GETTING INTO THE INVESTOR’S HEAD  

While neoclassical economics has given us excellent tools to understand market behavior, behavioral finance has enabled us to better understand how financial markets might behave when its participants are irrational. Behavioral finance uses methods and results from cognitive psychology to better understand financial decision making.  Neuro finance , in its infancy stages, is concerned with understanding the neurological processes in the investor’s brain as she or he makes financial decisions. We already discussed studies concerning potential physiological causes of hyperbolic discounting and concerning the effects of testosterone on trading. In another well-publicized paper,  Shiv, Lowenstein, Bechara, Damasio, and Damasio (2005)  studied the relative abilities of brain-damaged study participants to make gambling decisions. This study gathered 19 subjects who had incurred damage (stable focal lesions) to parts of their brains impairing their abilities to process emotions. The subjects were asked to participate in a series of gambles along with two control groups, one that had experienced no brain damage and a second group that had experienced some other type of brain damage. Each study participant was asked to participate in a sequential series of 20 gambles, betting

  $\S1$   against a 50/50 chance at either 0 or  $\S2.50$  . The expected value of each gamble was  $\S1.25,$   $\S0.25$   higher than its cost. The subjects experiencing damage to their emotional circuitry bet more consistently than their “normal” counterparts and earned more money. The performance differences were more pronounced after non impaired subjects experienced losses, making them even more reluctant to take advantage of expected wealth-increasing gambles. The performance of the emotionally damaged group compared favorably to the control group of participants who had experienced no brain damage and to the second control group who had experienced unrelated types of brain damage.  
A contrasting study by  Naqvi, Shiv, and Bechara (2006)  found that subjects with similar brain damage (in the vent rome dial prefrontal cortex) impairing their abilities to experience emotion seem unable to learn from mistakes in everyday life decisions, leading to repeated impairment of their well-being. Similarly, when faced with repeated losses in “rigged” gambling scenarios, subjects with impaired ability to experience emotions seemed unable to learn from negative experiences. Perhaps, in sum, this and the previous studies suggest that emotions are useful in reacting to negative experiences but can lead to irrational overreactions.  

Other neuro finance studies have focused on brain imaging tools, including Electroencephalograph y (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET) scans and, most importantly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is used to localize the presence of oxygen-rich blood. These imaging techniques allow researchers to examine the activity in the subject’s brain as the subject experiences various stimuli, such as facing risk. For example,  Knutson and Peterson (2005)  discuss the application of fMRI technology to map expected utility while  Kuhnen and Knutson (2005)  focus directly on financial risk taking. In one study of professional foreign exchange traders, Lo and Repin (2002)  used fMRI to find that more experienced traders experienced significantly less emotional reaction to dramatic market changes than did their less experienced counterparts. Essentially, they “wired” traders to examine their physiological reactions to changes in market conditions.   Other studies have made use of intra- and extra-cellular recording of electrical activity, which involves inserting electrodes into the cell bodies of neurons.  

Neuro finance seems to be a very promising approach to understanding the way investors make decisions. Most financial research is based on the methodologies from classical economics where economists model how investors ought to behave in order to maximize their wealth, and then examine statistical and case data to determine whether they do behave in the manners that the models predict. While this study methodology has proven to be very successful in most respects, it leaves many important questions unanswered. Behavioral finance research often examines how investors make decisions in experimental or laboratory settings. Neuro finance pursues the same questions by examining the physical biological reactions of subjects to stimuli.  
# 11.6 THE CONSENSUS OPINION: STUPID INVESTORS, SMART MARKETS?  

Is it possible for a market comprised of irrational investors to actually, in sum, behave rationally? Is it likely that rational or educated investors play a greater role in the pricesetting process than less rational or poorly educated investors? Could poorly educated or irrational investors be driven out of the price-setting process as their wealthier investors gain more power as they accumulate more wealth at the expense of their irrational counterparts? Consider a hypothetical market where professional analysts and competing investors are attempting to secure and employ all information that would enable them to evaluate stocks more accurately. However, none of the analysts have perfect information, and cannot know with certainty what stock values are. Further assume that each analyst may have some information (or method for analyzing this information) not available to other analysts. However, each analyst may be lacking some information or technique known to his competitors. Thus, information sets available to different analysts are not perfectly correlated. Given a reasonably large number of analysts, one might expect their errors to offset or cancel to some extent and that their “average” or consensus projections to outperform any given analyst’s forecasts. In this scenario, the market prices generated by the large number of analysts and investors may be closer to the true security prices estimated by any individual analyst or investor. It would be very difficult for the individual investor to beat the market in this scenario.  

Surowiecki (2004)  described the popular TV show  Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?  to demonstrate the “wisdom of crowds” relative to individual decision makers. In this show, a contestant was asked multiple-choice questions, which, if answered correctly, could result in winnings of as much as   $\S1$   million. The contestant had the option (“lifeline”) of seeking each of three types of assistance should he require it. The contestant could request to have two of three incorrect answers eliminated from the answer set, call a friend or relative to ask for help, or poll the studio audience to vote on the correct answer. Eliminating incorrect answers should produce correct answers at least  $50\%$   of the time. Phone calls to friends or relatives produced the correct answer almost  $65\%$   of the time. However, the studio polls produced the correct answers  $91\%$   of the time, suggesting that crowd wisdom did seem superior to individual opinions, even the potentially expert opinions offered by the phone calls.  

Surowiecki proposed conditions under which collective wisdom works well, including diversity, independence, and aggregation. For example, investors have diverse decision rules and may well make investment decisions independently of one another. They absorb information from their environments, combine it with their own interactions with their environments, and then formulate decision rules. Their effective decision rules survive, adapt, and are maintained. Securities markets provide the mechanism for aggregating the diverse rules and opinions of investors.  De Figueiredo and de Figueiredo (2002)  demonstrated with experimental evidence that while individual managers are able to effectively resolve less complicated problems, markets provide better settings for the resolution of more complex issues.  

Numerous experiments have demonstrated that averages of classroom estimates of temperatures are more accurate than individual student estimates. Similarly, average estimates provided by surveys produce better estimates of numbers of jellybeans in jars than individual estimates. Such experiments do suggest that the crowd may compile information to produce better estimates than individuals acting alone.  
# The Football Pool  

Sports forecasting and betting provide excellent opportunities for testing market efficiency in that true outcomes are revealed after games are played. Consider data in Table 11.4  based on a paper by  Beaver (1981)  to describe how football reporters might find it difficult to outperform consensus forecasts made by a group of their colleagues.   The Chicago Daily News  recorded the college football predictions of its sports staff for the last weekend of November during the 1966 to 1968 seasons. While the results of this “study” are not intended to be suitable for scientific purposes, they do illustrate the difficulty faced by forecasters attempting to outperform their peers.  

While results reported in  Table 11.4  do suggest that a consensus generates better football predictions than a single analyst, to what extent might this result hold in the stock market? An individual analyst might be regarded as able to generate superior forecasts if his returns consistently outperform those of the market on a risk-adjusted basis. While it is certain that at least a small number of investors consistently outperform the market, it is likely that a much larger number simply claim to do so. Furthermore, in a market with millions of investors, many would consistently outperform the market even if all selected their investments randomly. Perhaps, one should be somewhat skeptical when reviewing reports of superior investment performance.

# Analyst Estimates  

Because earnings forecasts are such an integral part of the typical analyst’s stock valuation process, a number of studies have been performed to determine analysts’ abilities to forecast earnings per share (EPS). Studies have indicated that consensus forecasts for EPS are superior to those of a randomly selected analyst (e.g.,  Fried and Givoly, 1982 ). By combining a large number of forecasts, individual analyst idiosyncratic errors will tend to offset one another. Several firms make consensus forecasts available to the public, including Lynch, Jones & Ryan’s Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES), First Call (a subsidiary of Thomson Corporation), and Zacks Investment Research, Inc. Furthermore, as one might expect, studies suggest that EPS forecasts become more accurate as announcement dates approach (e.g.,  Brown & Chen, 1990 ). However, a number of studies have demonstrated that analysts’ EPS forecasts tend to be overly optimistic (e.g.,  Barber, Lehavy, McNichols, & Trueman, 2006 ), perhaps by as much as   $20\%$  . A number of hypotheses have been offered to explain this phenomenon, including interests of the underwriting divisions of investment banks. Nonetheless, there is evidence that investors account for this bias and are able to sift through a huge volume of other information (and misinformation) to price securities. The extent to which investors and the market are able to price securities appropriately represents the extent to which the market is efficient.  

# Rational Investors and Price Setting  

Consider again our earlier example with a minimum of two rational traders and many other irrational investors (as in  Kluger & Wyatt, 2004 ). The two rational traders competing against others can force prices up to rational levels as they compete to buy. They will force prices down to rational levels as they compete to sell. As irrational buyers buy at high prices, rational sellers will sell, competing to keep prices down to rational levels. As irrational buyers sell at low prices, rational sellers will compete to buy, competing to keep prices up to rational levels. A somewhat similar finding by  Schwartz (2008)  that firms forced to compete for the business of both sophisticated and naı¨ve customers are less likely to exploit less sophisticated customers than firms that don’t compete. In addition, List (2003)  found that, in markets for sports memorabilia, the “endowment effect” (such as those experienced by “Joe and his opera tickets” or the roulette wheel experiments) disappears as dealers’ levels experience increase.  

Observations of the behavior of individuals and a variety of experiments have indicated that apparently irrational decision making frequently governs actions of consumers and investors, particularly in cases that involve potential losses. Nonetheless, might one expect that rational investors will outperform irrational investors in the market? Might rational investors tend to better preserve their capital, and even that of other investors (e.g., as professional money managers)? Perhaps, the market will tend to drive out (or bankrupt) irrational investors or at least, in time, reduce their impact on the market? Perhaps the rational investors, always driving to exploit an opportunity at the expense of irrational investors, will force market prices to properly reflect information whenever a deviation occurs? That is, might rational investors through their own efforts to secure profits, dominate the market and force prices to fully and rationally reflect available information?  
Furthermore, people observing the actions of others may be all too eager to note apparent irrational behavior. One is usually not able to observe the actual rationale or basis for the actions of others, and hence, may not be in a strong position to determine whether the resulting behavior truly is rational.  

# Herds and Swarms  

Stock markets are key mechanisms for planning and allocating economic resources for society. However, unlike governments, military organizations, and corporations, they function without formal leadership or hierarchies. No one is in charge of price setting in stock markets and determining who owns what securities in the investment arena. In fact, some observers have compared stock markets to swarms of bees and ant colonies.  Miller (2007, 130)  wrote that “Ants aren’t clever little engineers, architects, or warriors after all— at least not as individuals.” He quotes the biologist Deborah Gordan, “If you watch an ant try to accomplish something, you’ll be impressed by how inept it is. Ants aren’t smart. Ant colonies are.” Ants collectively decide how, when, and where to forage for food. As Miller writes, they are “simple creatures following simple rules, each one acting on local information. No ant tells any other ant what to do. . . .  No leadership is required. Even complex behavior may be coordinated by relatively simple interactions.” Each ant has a tiny sliver of information that is communicated in a very rudimentary fashion to other ants, but no ant comes close to understanding the “big picture” and no ant can direct the activities of the colony as a whole. Nevertheless, a huge ant colony with hundreds of thousands of ants can thrive, feed itself, reproduce, take care of its young, fight, and even enslave other species.  

The stock market may function quite similarly. Individual traders, each with a tiny subset of relevant information communicates bids and offers. Most traders do not reveal their rationale for their quotations, only their quotes. Through this process, the market collectively sets prices and allocates productive resources throughout the economy. All of this is accomplished without formal leadership or without anyone really understanding exactly why stock prices behave as they do.  Ivkovi´c and Weisbenner (2007)  find evidence of herding in an examination of 35,000 brokerage accounts detailing investor zip codes. They found that investors were substantially more likely to invest in securities if their neighbors had already done so. The likelihood of investing in a given stock dropped substantially as the distance to other investors who had already done so increased. To deal with the potential problem of investors simply buying stocks or in industries important to the local economy, Ivkovi´c and Weisbenner used a “social interaction barometer” developed by  Putnam (2000)  and found that the herding tendency was greatest in states with higher levels of social interaction. However, markets (and ant colonies as well) may be capable of committing enormous collective blunders, which might be termed bubbles and crashes.  

An  information cascade  might be characterized as a sequential decision process in which each decision maker bases his decision on those made by previous decision makers and then follow what their predecessors did in the decision-making queue did rather than use his own information. This information cascading may form the basis for herd behavior , where decision makers pursue the same action without collaborative planning. In an information cascade, decision makers earlier in the queue have information relevant to subsequent decision makers, so this herding might be rational. The sequential nature of this decision making and its information flow is what characterizes information cascading. But, herd behavior need not be the result of sequential decision making. Members of a herd merely need to exhibit the same behavior without collaborative planning. In fact, herding behavior may seem consistent with collective irrationality. Herding behavior has been blamed for stock market bubbles and crashes as well as bank runs.  
# Additional Reading  

Nofsinger’s 2014  book on the psychology of investing is interesting reading and very accessible to a beginner. Kahneman and Tversky (1982)  contains a collection of their classic essays (other authors contributed as well) that serve as foundation classic reading for this field.  Lewis (2016) , in a highly readable book, chronicles the long friendship and collaboration between Kahneman and Tversky and provides numerous detailed illustrations of their findings.  Shiv et al.’s 2005  scientific article on the role of emotion in investment decision making drew substantial coverage in the popular and financial press, and  Zak (2004)  provides a review of academic literature in the neuro finance field.  Hirsh leif er and Teoh (2003)  provide an excellent review of the herding literature, including discussions of herding in stock markets, bank runs, creditor runs, analyst herding, and herding in accounting reports. More generally,  Surowiecki’s 2004  book is highly readable, very entertaining, and offers striking examples concerning crowd wisdom, both in and outside the finance field.  Statman (1997) and  Ritter (2003)  provide good overviews of the academic literature in behavioral finance, while  Shefrin’s 2002 book is an excellent and very readable introduction to the field.  Miller’s 2007  article is a highly readable and thoroughly entertaining discussion of swarm behavior in the insect kingdom, and describes parallels between swarm behavior in the insect kingdom and the stock market.

# 11.7 EXERCISES  

1.  Suppose that an investor with  $\S2$   in capital has a logarithmic utility of wealth function:  $U\!=\!\ln(w)$  . The investor has the opportunity to buy into the gamble described in the St. Petersburg paradox. Assume that the investor can borrow without interest and that the gamble payoff is  $2^{i}$    where  $i$   is the number of tosses or outcomes realized before the first head is realized.  

a.  What is the investor’s current utility of wealth level? b.  How much would the investor be willing to pay for the gamble described in the St. Petersburg paradox? c.  How much would the investor be willing to pay for the gamble described in the St. Petersburg Paradox if his initial wealth level were  $\mathbb{S}1000$   rather than  $\S2?$  d.  What would be your answer to part b if the gamble payoff were to change to  $2^{2i-1}$    where    $i$   is the number of tosses or outcomes realized before the first head is realized?  

2.  Three traders are at lunch and must decide on a dessert that they will share. Consider the following table, which compares trader preferences for three types of desserts, all ranked according to preferences one through three for each trader. Individual trader preferences are rational. There are three possible desserts, and thus three possible preference rankings. The traders have determined that if they vote on which dessert they will order, each of the three desserts will receive one vote, resulting in a tie. Thus, the traders decided to hold pairwise votes on combinations of two desserts. That is, they will eliminate desserts one at a time in three votes, with the winning dessert being matched against the next dessert. Thus, ice cream will be matched against cake, and then against cookies and then cookies against cake. Demonstrate that a pairwise vote (one dessert option against another) on any combination of two desserts would ultimately result in a “social” selection that will violate the principle of transitivity.  
3.  A car with a replacement value of  $\S20{,}000$   can be insured against a total loss with an insurance policy sold for a premium of   $\mathbb{S}1200$  . The insurance company selling the policy and the consumer purchasing the policy agree that there is a  $5\%$   probability that the car will be destroyed.  

a.  What is the actuarial (fair or expected) value of the policy? b.  If the insurance maintains a large, well-diversified portfolio of such policies, what is its expected profit from the sale of this policy? c.  What is the expected profit (or gain or loss) to the consumer from the purchase of this policy? d.  Under what circumstances is the sale of this policy a rational transaction for the insurance company? e.  Under what circumstances is the purchase of this policy a rational transaction for the consumer?  

4.  Suppose that you are presented with the following choice: I.  In addition to whatever you own, you have been given  $\mathbb{S}1000$  . You are now asked to choose between: A: A sure gain of  $\S500$  B: A  $50\%$   change to gain  $\mathbb{S}1000$   and a  $50\%$   chance to gain nothing. Which do you prefer: Gamble A or Gamble B? Now, suppose that you are presented with the following choice. II.  In addition to whatever you own, you have been given  $\S2000$  . You are now asked to choose between:  $\mathrm{A^{*}}$  : A sure loss of  $\S500$   $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$  : A  $50\%$   chance to lose  $\mathbb{S}1000$   and a   $50\%$   chance to lose nothing. In experimental studies involving both of these sets of gambles,   $84\%$   of study  

participants chose A over B, however,  $69\%$   chose  $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$   over   $\mathrm{A^{*}}$  . With which of the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms would the results of this study seem inconsistent?  

5.  Suppose that you were to perform an experiment on subjects to determine whether they prefer to have coffee mugs or money. You plan to use a large representative sampling of individuals and endow half of the participants in your experiment with coffee mugs and then ask those to whom mugs were given what would be the lowest price at which they would sell. Those subjects who were not given mugs were asked how much they would pay for a mug.  

a.  If participants are rational and consistent in their preferences, how should purchase prices differ from selling prices? b.  Assume that the endowment effect described by Kahneman and Tversky is true for individuals. How should purchase prices differ from selling prices? c.  What would be the relevance of this type of experiment to stock markets?  

6.  For each of the following three scenarios, would you rather: a.  Receive  $\S100$   in one month or  $\S100$   in two months (most people prefer the former)?  
b.  Be given an excellent meal at a nice restaurant in one month or in two months (most people prefer the former)? c.  Be given a mediocre meal at a mediocre restaurant in one month and then an excellent meal at a nice restaurant in two months or an excellent meal at a nice restaurant in one month followed by mediocre meal at a mediocre restaurant in two months (most people prefer the former)? Assume that you respond as do most people. Explain any inconsistency in your preferences.  

7.  Churches, schools, and other nonprofit institutions have held jelly bean counting contests where contestants compete for a prize by estimating the number of jelly beans in a large jar. There is evidence suggesting that averages of contestant estimates tend to be superior to specific individual estimates. Why might this be true?  

8.  In our discussion of prospect theory, we considered the following choice of gambles: Gamble A: 0.33 probability of receiving 2500, 0.66 of receiving 2400, and 0.01 of receiving 0 Gamble B:  $100\%$   probability of receiving 2400 and Gamble   $\mathrm{A^{*}}$  : 0.33 probability of receiving 2500, 0.67 of receiving 0 Gamble   $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$  : 0.34 probability of receiving 2400 and 0.66 of receiving 0 Demonstrate that if an investor is in different between Gambles A and B, he must be in different to   $\mathrm{A^{*}}$   and  $\mathrm{B}^{\ast}$   in order to fulfill the strong independence axiom identified by von Neumann and Morgenstern.  

9.  Suppose that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an Asian viral disease, which, if a vaccine is not developed, is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative vaccination programs have been proposed. The benefits of the two vaccination programs are described as follows: Program A: 200 lives are saved Program B: 1/3 probability that 600 lives are saved Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1986)  find that most people prefer Program A. Now, consider the following descriptions: Program A: 400 die Program B: 2/3 probability that 600 die Kahneman and Tversky find that most people prefer Program B. (See also  Baron, 2000 .) Since the first set of descriptions is identical to the second, choices seem to be inconsistent. a.  How does this example relate to the framing problem discussed by Kahneman and Tversky? b.  How do the descriptions presented here pertain to risk-aversion and risk-seeking preferences?  

10.  Suppose that an investor has the opportunity (and funding ability) to pay   $\mathbb{\S}100{,}000$   for a  $50\%$   chance to win   $\mathbb{\S300,000}$   and a   $50\%$   chance of winning nothing.  

a.  What is the expected value of the gamble? b.  What is the standard deviation of payoffs for this gamble? c.  Suppose that you have the opportunity (and funding ability) to repeat participation in this gamble for a total of five gambles. Each wager’s outcome is independent of the outcomes of all other wagers (the correlation coefficient between wager payoffs is zero). What is the expected value of this set of five wagers?  
d.  What is the standard deviation for this set of five wagers? e.  Which set of wagers has a higher expected payoff—that described in parts a and b of this question or that described in parts c and d of this question? f.  Which set of wagers has a lower risk as measured by standard deviation—that described in parts a and b of this question or that described in parts c and d of this question? g.  Which set of wagers seems to be preferable based on your answers to parts a through f—the single wager or the set of five wagers? h.  Devise an argument that if an individual finds the gamble described in parts a and b unacceptable, he will also find the gambles described in parts c and d unacceptable.
