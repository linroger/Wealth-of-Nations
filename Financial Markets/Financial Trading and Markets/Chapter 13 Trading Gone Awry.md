# Trading Gone Awry  

# 13.1 THE DARK SIDE OF FINANCE  

When unfair or dysfunctional markets fail to draw traders, they cannot draw capital. The mere perception of dysfunction or unfairness is disruptive and can break down markets ( Guiso, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2008 ). In Section 1.8, we discussed the importance and scale of financial trading to national and global economies. Trading does matter, and when trading goes awry, the ill effects can be far-reaching and devastating. In this chapter, we review a number of types of failures in trading along with their adverse effects on a variety of stakeholders, including traders, their employers, the financial services industry, and to society itself.  

Securities fraud is expensive to securities firms, very difficult to detect, and more difficult still to evaluate, especially on an economy-wide basis. Consider the   $\S139$   billion in fines paid by the finance industry (these fines were not all connected to securities fraud) to U.S. enforcement agencies during the two-year period 2012  2014 and the many more fines that would have been assessed if not for failures of the affected firms or success in avoiding detection ( Zingales, 2015 ). Dyck, Morse and Zingales (2014) note that the “main challenge in assessing the cost of fraud is that we only observe detected fraud: we do not know whether the observed fraud is the whole iceberg or just its visible tip.”Based on a study of firms switching auditors after the demise of Arthur Anderson, the major accounting firm that failed in the wake of the Enron scandal,  Dyck, et al.  were able to estimate that only about a quarter of frauds are detected. Essentially, this study determined that Arthur Anderson detected only about a quarter of the financial frauds committed by their clients. The successor auditors to Arthur Anderson, who presumably had fewer disincentives to catch frauds, unveiled about three times as many frauds actually committed by their auditing clients. They extrapolated this “detection failure” rate to the economy. While most of the frauds relevant to this study were not trading frauds, the study might be suggestive of detection rates for various types of financial fraud.  
The costs of securities fraud affect everyone. First, the difficult to observe indirect costs of securities fraud almost certainly exceed the direct costs. For example, securities fraud distorts investor capital allocation decisions.  Gurun, Stoffman, and Yonker (2018)  argue that investors significantly change their investment behavior as a result of a failure of trust in the financial services industry. In particular, they found that residents of communities with zip codes that were more exposed to the Madoff Ponzi fraud “withdrew assets from investment advisers and increased deposits at banks.” The magnitude of this study’s results (over   $\S363$   billion moved, 20 times the direct effect of the fraud itself) are large enough to imply that, overall, securities fraud has a significant impact on how investors allocate their capital. More generally, based on several extrapolations,  Dyck et al. (2014) estimated the net annual costs of financial fraud at  $\S380$   billion, roughly a fifth of the market value of directly affected firms, and consistent with the proportional losses estimated by  Karpoff, Lee, and Martin (2008) . Dyck et al. further estimated that roughly one in seven firms engaged in fraud. Again, these frauds are not necessarily specific to trading, but trading fraud rates, extremely difficult to estimate, might be similar.  

# 13.2 ILLEGAL INSIDER TRADING  

Not all insider trading is illegal, either in earlier times or now. It will always be the case that some investors have better access to information than others. For example, sophisticated 19th-century English investors knew that the stock market tycoon Nathan Rothschild had pigeons and used them effectively to relay information. Then, as now, timely and accurate information was crucial to outperforming the market. In the early part of the 19th century, messenger pigeons were the fastest way to transmit news. For example, after the Battle of Waterloo, but before its outcome was publicly known in Britain, Rothschild’s quiet and judicious (low-volume) selling activity was discovered by his countrymen who panicked and sold everything. However, Rothschild was merely manipulating the market. With prices down, and with a British victory over Napoleon at Waterloo, Rothschild actually bought huge quantities of stock at prices that his manipulative selling activity depressed. He then sold these shares at substantial profits when the news of the British victory finally reached England by more conventional news transmission.   Efficient acquisition and effective use of information along with appropriate manipulation of security prices were the trick to making stock market profits in the regulation-free 19th century. This case illustrates the importance of having better information than competing traders and acquiring the information sooner.  

Illegal insider trading is traditionally defined as the execution of transactions on the basis of material nonpublic information in breach of a relationship of trust and confidence. We discussed this issue in Section 5.4. Further recall that there is no comprehensive statutory definition as to precisely what constitutes impermissible insider trading. Several statutes are generally relied upon to enforce prohibitions on insider trading including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. These rules are extended by  United States v. O’Hagan  to identify elements of a Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 2 insider trading claim, with elements of illegal insider trading summarized as follows:  
a.  Possession of material nonpublic information b.  Trading while in possession of that non-public information c.  Violation of a relationship of trust and confidence ( Flannery, 1998 : 1  2)  

In addition, Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule 14e-3 impose a “disclose or abstain from trading” obligation on any person who trades in securities that will be sought or are being sought in a tender offer, while that person is in possession of material nonpublic information that he knows or has reason to know has been acquired directly or indirectly from the offeror, the subject corporation, any of their affiliated persons (including officers, directors, partners, or employees or any person acting on behalf of either company). Thus, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Section 14e) provided for the initial federal statutory insider trading restrictions, although a  1909  Supreme Court decision in Strong v. Repide  (discussed earlier in Sections 5.1 and 5.4) interpreted inside trading by a corporate director under special circumstances and with special information without appropriately revealing that information to be a form of fraud. Recall from Section 5.4 that Chiarella v. United States  defined an insider as one who maintains a “relationship of trust 3   and confidence with shareholders.” However, this definition can be rather broadly interpreted. As discussed in Section 5.4, the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 authorized penalties for illegal insider trading and the Insider Trading and Fraud Act of 1988 was intended to help define exactly what constitutes an insider and to extend penalties for illegal insider trading activity.  

# Notorious Insider Trading Cases  

A casual web search for “insider tips” will lead to many sites selling information for sports betting, where, like the stock market, the best information is the key to success. However, selling and acting on insider trading tips in securities markets are illegal. Nevertheless, investors require the best possible information for their investment decisions, and at least a few cross the line into illegal trading. The following represent just of a few of the high profile insider trading cases pursued by the SEC and other regulatory authorities (plus one that predates the SEC and insider regulations). There are many more such cases pursued by authorities, and we can only guess as to how many that have not been pursued or even suspected (though, recall from Section 13.1 above efforts made by Dyck et al., 2014  to estimate financial fraud rates). One interesting aspect common to all of the individuals named in the cases that follow is that they were very successful in their businesses, and in most cases, quite wealthy—at least prior to the resolution of their cases.  
# William Duer  

William Duer was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in 1789 under Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton’s and Duer’s wives were cousins. Duer used information and connections obtained in his official position along with substantial leverage to speculate in new U.S. debt and various bank stock issues. He resigned his position in 1791 after learning that Treasury officials were to be prohibited from speculating in Treasury securities, but continued to use his inside connections for speculative purposes. His speculation and subsequent failure was a major cause of the Panic of 1792.   Geisst (2004)  wrote that “[t]he New York City economy crashed along with him, and Duer was nearly disemboweled by an enraged mob that chased him through the streets. He died in debtors’ prison a few years later.”  

# Albert H. Wiggin  

Albert H. Wiggin became chairman of Chase Bank in 1917, and engaged in M&A activities over the next 15 years, growing the bank to become the second largest in the U.S. Through 6 of his own corporations, including three in Canada to avoid reporting taxes on capital gains, Wiggin regularly traded Chase stock. During the Fall of 1929, he began short selling shares of stock of the company he ran, producing millions in profits for himself, a tidy sum of money at the time. The short selling of shares of his employer’s stock broke no laws at the time, but the public certainly reacted badly to the clear conflict of interest, and his actions served as a rationale for the ban on insider trading provision of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  

# Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, and Michael Milken  

In 1985, Dennis Levine, a mergers and acquisitions specialist, was earning significant profits trading illegally on inside information through secret off shore accounts. He was a highly regarded managing director at Drexel, Burnham Lambert, once the fifth largest U.S. investment bank. Unfortunately for Levine, one of his trading account brokers, a Bahamian subsidiary of a Swiss bank, began “piggy backing” off his trades as did the bank’s account executive at Merrill Lynch. Merrill Lynch became suspicious of these trades and notified the SEC. The SEC trail led back to Levine, who pled guilty in 1986 to securities fraud, tax evasion, and perjury. As part of his plea arrangement, he implicated fellow specialist Martin Siegel and famed arb it rage ur Ivan Boesky, to whom he had passed illegal trading tips.  

Boesky, considered the leading expert on merger arbitrage, had been paying Levine a percentage of his trading profits gained from Levine’s tips.   Boesky agreed to a plea, whereby he would cooperate with authorities and secretly tape record conversations with his alleged confederates. Boesky, under the terms of his plea arrangement, implicated Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham, then a major U.S. investment bank, along with Boesky’s longtime friend, John A. Mulheren Jr., the former head of Jamie Securities. This led to the SEC launching an investigation into all of them.  
Following up on his master’s thesis at Wharton, Milken had innovated the 1980s junk bond market at Drexel. This led to extraordinary success for the firm, for which Milken was paid   $\S550$   million in 1987 alone. However, the investigation into the relationship between Boesky and Milken uncovered a   $\S5.3$   million payment in 1986 to Drexel that Boesky had characterized as a consulting fee. A significant amount of other evidence of insider trading was uncovered, but the bulk of the SEC’s weak case against Milken and Drexel would be based on the testimony of Levine, Boesky, and other convicted felons. The SEC began to focus on Milken’s brother Lloyd, who might have played a minor role in the insider trading activities (or at least would be subpoenaed to testify against his brother) and other relatives, including their 92-year-old grandfather. Milken agreed to a plea arrangement after the Department of Justice agreed not to pursue his brother. A codefendant of Milken, Alan Rosenthal, took his case to trial, whereby it was tossed by the judge before going to jury, lending significant credibility to the argument that the case against Milken was rather weak.  

U.S. District Attorney Rudolph Giuliani threatened Drexel with an indictment under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), which would have required Drexel post bond of   $\S1$   billion, a hefty amount for the heavily debt-financed firm. Even though company executives believed that the case against Drexel was weak, they decided that it would not be able to survive the costs and loss of reputation of a trial and agreed to pay a  $\S650$  -million fine.  

Levine received a two-year sentence, was fined  $\mathbb{\S362,000,}$  , was disgorged of  $\S11.5$   million in illegal trading profits, and paid an additional  $\S2$   million in back taxes. Boesky served two years in Southern California’s Lompoc Federal Prison, paid   $\S100$   million in fines, and was barred from the securities business for life. Milken received a 10-year sentence for fraud and illegal market manipulation, which was later reduced to 24 months; fined  $\S600$  million; and made restitution payments. Shortly after his release, he was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer (but seemed much healthier 20 years later). Milken and other Drexel employees paid   $\S1.3$   billion into a pool to settle hundreds of lawsuits. Drexel was ultimately bankrupted in the aftermath of the scandal, fines, loss of reputation, and the collapse of the junk bond market.  

# Martha Stewart  

Martha Stewart is a well-known television talk show personality and majority shareholder of NYSE-listed Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. and of other companies. In 2001, she sold approximately 3928 shares of ImClone, which had just learned that its new prescription drug would not obtain Food and Drug Administration approval. After learning about the drug’s setback, Sam Waskal, CEO of ImClone, quickly sold shares of his ImClone stock. His broker, Peter Bacanovic, who also served as Martha Stewart’s broker, apparently notified her that Waskal was selling shares of his company’s stock. The SEC investigated Bacanovic and Waskal, who were ultimately imprisoned. The SEC also began an investigation as to whether Stewart’s selling was related to that of Waskal. Whether Stewart had engaged in illegal insider trading was not known at this point, and still is not clear. Even if Stewart had been completely forthright about the information that she had received and why she sold, the SEC’s case against her would have been weak at best. Unfortunately for Stewart, she conspired with Bacanovic to fabricate a story about a stop order at   $\S60$  . That is, Stewart falsely claimed to have placed a standing order to sell ImClone shares once its shares dropped to   $\S60$  . This fabrication led to charges of conspiracy, obstruction of an agency proceeding, and making false statements to federal investigators. She was convicted and sentenced in 2004 to serve five months in federal prison followed by five months of incarceration in her Bedford home (she was allowed to depart for up to 48 hours with an electronic monitor) and a two-year period of supervised release. She also paid a fine and disgorged the reduction in short-term trading losses that she avoided.  
After she was charged in the alleged insider trading incident involving ImClone, but before the general public knew of the investigation, Stewart sold shares of her own company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc. This exposed her to additional insider trading charges, based on the negative impact that her legal problems might be expected to have on her company. She was charged for manipulating the price of her company’s stock. These charges did not result in convictions.  

Stewart’s case is perplexing. First, she was a billionaire, and the stock sale saved her only  $\mathbb{S}45{,}673$   in losses. So, if she did sell illegally, her forgone losses were only a tiny fraction of her wealth. Worse, she almost certainly was no better off lying to the SEC than she might have been had she honestly admitted to the circumstances of her trade rather than concoct the story about the stop order. Better yet, she could easily have invoked her Fifth Amendment right to silence. The SEC’s insider trading case against her probably would not have merited further action or at least not merited a conviction. In fact, she was not even indicted on insider trading charges in the ImClone case. Lying to authorities about the preexisting order to sell at   $\S60$   essentially exposed her to all of the charges on which she was convicted. Finally, Stewart did possess a reasonable degree of financial sophistication, having been a billionaire, a CEO, and a stock broker early in her career. She should have known better than to respond to investigators as she did. Perhaps she fell victim to a level of hubris that seems to affect some particularly successful people. Nonetheless, it is likely that neither her trading crimes nor the strength of evidence thereof seemed to warrant the sanctions that she suffered. On the other hand, the SEC and its crackdown efforts against illegal insider trading did receive substantial attention, a clear win for the SEC.  

# Raj Rajaratnam  

In December 2011, Raj Rajaratnam, billionaire and founder of the defunct hedge fund, the Galleon Group, began serving an 11-year sentence in the federal prison system after being convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and fraud. This was the longest sentence ever imposed for illegal insider trading, although less than half of the term requested by prosecutors. Rajaratnam was also fined   $\S92.8$   million and faced civil and other actions. Rajaratnam had been accused of having taken more than   $\S50$   million in insider trading gains based on tips provided by fellow conspirators at Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Co., Intel, and Google, among others. Among those implicated in the investigations were Roomy Khan (Intel), Anil Kumar (McKinsey), Danielle Chiesi (Bear Stearns), Zvi Goffer (Galleon), Rajat Gupta (McKinsey and Goldman Sachs), Robert Moffatt (IBM), and the extensive list continues. Many of these individuals have been charged, convicted, and served time in prison. Two interesting facets of this case were the large number of coconspirators (over 60) and the use by authorities of wire and tapes to record conversations, including more than 40 wiretapped phone conversations between Rajaratnam and his accomplices.   Although pursuing illegal insider trading activities remains very difficult for authorities, its level of sophistication in the pursuit has improved. Furthermore, it seems interesting that such conspirator networks can be so large, given the conspirators’ need to maintain secrecy.  
# SAC Capital  

Perhaps due to the overlap of names that came up in the SEC’s investigation of Galleon and Raj Rajaratnam, the SEC began a pursuit of SAC Capital Advisors, LP, a   $\S15$   billion hedge fund, and its founder, Steven A. Cohen, who had a personal wealth of approximately   $\S9$   billion. SAC was noted for imposing among the highest fees in the hedge fund industry, up to  $50\%$   of annual profits and  $3\%$   management fee versus the industry norm of   $20\%$   and   $2\%$  . Nevertheless, SAC averaged annual returns over 18 years of approximately  $25\%$   ( United States v. S.A.C. Capital Advisors, L.P., 2013 ).  

In August 2008, technology sector research analyst Jon Horvath, who pled guilty in 2012 to charges related to insider trading, sent his boss at SAC Michael Steinberg an email indicating that he had learned from someone at Dell that its upcoming earnings report would be below market expectations. Steinberg shorted shares in his portfolio and the email was forwarded to Cohen who, within 10 minutes of receiving it, closed his  $\S12.5$   million share position in Dell stock, thereby avoiding losses of approximately   $\S1.7$   million. Later in the month, Cohen complimented Steinberg, Horvath, and others in their group “Nice job on Dell.” Cohen’s defense on the insider trading charge was that he never read the email that he was forwarded prior to his sale of Dell.  

According to the Department of Justice, Matthew Martoma, a portfolio manager at SAC had ongoing communications with Dr. Sidney Gilman, a neurology professor at the University of Michigan concerning an Alzeimer’s drug, Bap in eu zuma b, under development at Elan and Wyeth. Gilman, who received   $\mathbb{\S}108{,}000$   as consulting fees from SAC, and in violation of his duty to hold in strict confidence all information related to his participation in the clinical drug trial, provided Martoma with a summary of the drug’s failing trial results prior to their public announcement. The day after a 20-minute telephone call between Martoma and Cohen, SAC sold approximately   $\S700$   million (including   $\S400$   million from Cohen’s personal account) of Wyeth shares and Elan ADR shares and short sold an additional   $\S260$   million in shares just prior to the public announcement of the trial results, producing   $\S276$   million in profits and avoided losses—the largest insider trade series in history (as far as we know from the enforcement authorities). Gilman testified in exchange for avoiding prosecution. Martoma was rewarded with a   $\S9$   million bonus, but was ultimately convicted of conspiracy and securities fraud and sentenced to 9 years imprisonment.  
More generally, the Department of Justice argued that SAC was a hotbed of action for insider trading. It argued that traders were compensated on the basis of the quality of information provided to Cohen for his personal trading and were hired on the basis of their “edge,” a presumed SAC euphemism for being able to produce inside information.  

The SEC filed a civil action for insider trading against SAC in November 2012. In March 2013, SAC agreed to pay   $\S616$   million to settle charges of trading Dell, Elan and Wyeth. In July 2013, the S.E.C. instituted administrative proceedings against Cohen for failing to reasonably supervise Martoma and Steinberg. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice filed criminal charges against SAC for wire fraud (one count) and securities fraud (4 counts), and against 8 former employees for insider trading. SAC pled guilty to all counts, agreed to stop managing funds on behalf of outside investors and pay an additional   $\S1.2$   billion,  $\S900$   million of which was a criminal penalty and the remainder as profit forfeiture. Five employees pled guilty to insider trading charges. Cohen, who was never personally criminally charged, later began operating another fund including approximately  $\S9$   billion of his own money and that of a small number of former SAC employees. As of 2021, he is running a new   $\S20$   billion venture capital fund, Point72 Asset Management, with roughly 1500 employees, as his ban on accepting outside money was lifted in 2015, and is the owner of the New York Mets baseball team.  

# Loeffler, Burr and Chris Collins  

Despite passage of the 2012 STOCK Act (see Sections 12.4 and 12.6), allegations have been directed at more than 40 members of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Senate for trading on inside information obtained in the course of their official duties and/or for failing to properly disclose their insider trades. For example, after a January 2020 confidential Senate briefing by the CDC director and Dr. Anthony Fauci in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, Senators Kelly Loeffler and Richard Burr made substantial trades on companies expected to be affected by COVID. Loeffler, wife of the CEO of ICE, the parent firm of the NYSE, and Burr, who voted against the 2012 ban on congressional insider trading, were strong supporters of the president and were quickly cleared by the U.S. Justice Department.  

However, a more notorious case involved Representative Chris Collins, an early and vocal supporter of the then president, who was filmed in a White House lawn event on June 22, 2017, phoning inside information concerning Innate Immuno therapeutics to his son, Cameron Collins. Cameron sold 1,391,500 shares by the following Monday, June 26. Because the information was not obtained through his official duties, Collins was not charged under the STOCK Act, but for making false statements to the FBI and for trading on insider information obtained outside of his official duties. After repeatedly proclaiming his innocence, and narrowly being reelected to Congress, Collins resigned from his seat, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 26 months in prison. He received 7 months of COVID-related deferrals before starting his sentence in October 2020, was pardoned by the president, and was released two months later.  

# Monitoring Inside Trading Activity  

It is usually very difficult for authorities to prosecute insider trading cases. Without substantial information from others—frequently co defendants—authorities often cannot prove who knew what and when, or what has motivated profitable trades. Thus, successful insider trading prosecutions usually require cooperation from co defendants or leverage such as damaging information concerning other illegal behavior (such as tax evasion).  
There have been recent improvements to enforcement efforts. First, surveillance techniques, which played significant roles in the Rajaratnam and SAC Capital cases, have improved considerably. For example, the SEC and all of the major markets and companies themselves are purchasing and developing software systems to monitor for illicit activity. The SEC is making use of varied resources to monitor insider activity, including formation of special surveillance teams, wire tapping, and bounty payments to informants. The SEC contends with roughly 700,000 tips per year from informants. Markets such as the NYSE, Nasdaq, and CBOE are making greater use of technology to monitor trading activity for suspicious activity. For example, FINRA, through its Office of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence, has been using an intelligent surveillance application known as the Securities Observation, News Analysis, and Regulation (SONAR) system to detect suspicious trading patterns. Regardless, insider trading enforcement remains a challenging pursuit.  

# 13.3 FRONT RUNNING AND LATE TRADING  

Access to inside information clearly gives the trader a jump on the competition. So does access to information on other traders’ activity, especially in the case of a broker with knowledge of her client’s trades. Parasitic trading is the exploitation of knowledge of other traders’ activities to enhance one’s own trading profits.  

# Front Running and Parasitic Trading  

Front running  occurs when a broker uses her knowledge of a large pending order placed by his own client to buy (sell) a given security, and places his own order in front of the pending client buy (sell) order so as to benefit from the market reaction to the client’s large order. Thus, a broker might illegally front run a large buy order by purchasing shares of stock for her own account after receiving a large purchase order for that stock from a client. Front running is an example of securities fraud because the broker has taken advantage of her client, in whose interest she is obliged to act. For example, by front running a client buy order, the broker’s own buy order may force the stock price up against her client’s buy order. In addition, the front running broker may also be in violation of insider trading law, in that she has nonpublic information about an order and violates her professional code of ethics by front running it. Front running can also occur when a broker passes on trade information to another client or trader.  

In one well-publicized front-running scandal, the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the SEC accused brokers from Merrill Lynch of allowing certain clients to listen to conversations involving other clients through broadcasts on Merrill Lynch internal speaker systems. In this “squawk box scandal,” some clients were privy in advance to other clients’ trades. Favored clients then rewarded the brokers with business, commissions, and cash. Several former brokers from Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers were convicted and received probation or prison terms in 2010, as did several of their clients.  
A similar, often legal, but frequently unethical practice is  tailgating , a form of parasitic trading where the broker places an order immediately after the client’s order. This practice is questionable because the broker is acting on the basis of the client’s order, which itself might have been motivated by inside information or might precede additional client trading. Another type of ethically questionable parasitic order is  penny-jumping , where the broker places a buy (sell) order one uptick above (downtick below) below the client’s buy (sell) limit order, expecting to benefit either from the market’s reaction to the client order or to limit his losses by transacting with the client. For example, if the client were to place a large buy order at 50.00, the broker would penny jump by placing her buy order at 50.01. The broker’s order will execute ahead of the client’s order due to price priority. If the client’s order then executes, the broker will profit from any favorable price reaction due to the client’s large buy order. If the price declines, the broker can quickly sell his shares to the client at a   $\S0.01$   loss.  

# Market Timing and Late Trading  

We discussed in Chapter 4 the practice of  market timing , which is the fund trading strategy intended to exploit stale security prices and NAV deviations from fundamental values. While market timing is not illegal, it can transfer wealth between fund shareholders and necessitate that funds maintain higher levels of cash to accommodate share redemption s. Market timing may increase fund transactions costs in response to shareholder redemption s. In addition, market timing could result in civil litigation due to prohibitions in the fund’s prospectus or criminal penalties if a broker encouraged it to generate higher commissions for herself.  

To limit these costs and problems, many mutual funds have announced in their prospectuses restrictions on the number of trades that customers may execute in and out of a fund per year. However, several scandals have erupted in recent years due to fund advisers having made undisclosed arrangements with favored customers to enable them to circumvent established trading restrictions. For example, in September 2003, New York State Attorney General Elliot Spitzer filed a complaint against the New Jersey  based hedge fund Canary Capital Partners, run by Edward Julius Stern, son of Leonard N. Stern. Spitzer’s complaint alleged that Canary Capital entered into illegal agreements with mutual fund companies to defraud investors. For example, Canary made a secret agreement with Security Trust to enable it to engage in market timing-related trades. In another case, PIMCO agreed to permit Canary a specified number of trades in exchange for fees to be earned on  $\S25$   million it would manage for Canary.  

In addition, Spitzer’s allegations went further than these market timing agreement allegations, accusing Canary of  late trading . In these allegations of illegal late trading, Canary maintained arrangements with funds to purchase or redeem shares after daily NAV’s were computed. Unlike market timing, late trading is always illegal. Late trading was described by Spitzer as “betting on a horse race after the horses have crossed the finish line.” According to Spitzer’s complaint, Canary engaged in schemes to purchase mutual fund shares after   $4~\mathrm{{PM}}$   exchange closing times with the assistance of certain Bank of America fund employees. Technically, Canary allegedly submitted trades in question prior to the   $4\,\mathrm{\PM}$   deadline so that they could be time-stamped before   $4\ \mathrm{PM}.$  . However, Spitzer alleged that the Bank of America employees would hold transactions until after the market closed, providing Canary the opportunity to “confirm” its trades. In fact, in 2001, Bank of America employees allegedly installed an electronic trading system in Canary’s offices that allowed Canary to late trade by entering its orders directly, after the  $4\,\mathrm{\PM}$   deadline. Bank of America employees purportedly reconciled the “late” trades the following day. Canary Capital settled Spitzer’s complaint for  $\S40$   million and was permitted to not admit guilt. Bank of America provided compensation to its mutual fund shareholders for related losses. Spitzer and the SEC also charged Janus, Bank One’s One Group, and Strong Capital in other alleged incidences of late trading. In fact, the founder and chairman of Strong Mutual Funds, Richard Strong, was charged with late trading in his own fund.  
# 13.4 BLUFFING AND MARKET MANIPULATION  

The attraction of the securities markets to scoundrels can easily be likened to Jesse James’s attraction to banks— ’cause that’s where the money is . Scam after scam has been created; most of the older ones seem quite naive to us. However, we have the benefit of hindsight. There has always been a sense among investors that market prices do reflect information—hence, investors rely on the market for quality information. If an unscrupulous operator is able to manipulate the market, he manipulates the information to which investors react. Much as the market creates information for traders, traders can, through their trading behavior, create information for other traders. If an investor has sufficient resources to create a given type of appearance in the market, he can generate huge profits through the trading activities of his counterparts. As we discussed in Chapter 5, most forms of manipulation in the information marketplace for securities are illegal.  

# Bluffing  

In Chapter 6, we discussed how uninformed traders react to the information gleaned from the activities of informed traders.  Bluffing  is the act of fooling other traders into making unwise trades by convincing them that the bluffer has superior material information about security values. Bluffing can be a mechanism for manipulating the market. There are a number of ways that traders bluff, both legal and illegal. A trader can bluff the market by placing a bid or offer at a price or in a quantity that exaggerates his or her own true position, interest, or lack of interest in a security. For example, a bluffer might place a particularly attractive offer for a small quantity of shares, intending then to sell a much larger quantity of shares after a positive price response to the initial offer. As long as such orders are executed, they are usually perfectly legal. Bluffers may also simply spread rumors or false information about the value of a company’s shares. Such false rumor spreading can represent deceit or fraud, illegal when used to manipulate markets, and perhaps otherwise as well.  
# Spoofing  

Spoofing  is the act of placing a quote that is intended to be canceled prior to its execution. Spoofing might be considered a form of bluffing when the trader places an order that she has no intent to execute. There are four potential motivations behind spoofing:  

1.  To overload the quotation system of a market, inhibiting its ability to execute trades. This disruptive activity is often called  quote stuffing , and is usually illegal.

 2.  To delay a specific trader’s trade execution by placing that trader’s quotes behind a series of quotes with higher priority.

 3.  To create the appearance of false market depth or direction, particularly by submitting then later cancelling multiple bids or offers. This type of spoofing is often referred to as layering . Layering is frequently accomplished through a high-frequency trading (HFT) program designed to submit many quotations that are canceled after an executed transaction.

 4.  To create the illusion of liquidity, such as by rapidly repeating the transmission and cancellation of the same order, a practice known as  strobing .  

Clearly, spoofing can be used to manipulate a market in an illegal manner, and as we discussed in Chapter 5, has been specifically prohibited by Dodd-Frank. Orders, modifications, and cancellations are not considered to be illegal spoofing if they were submitted as part of a legitimate, good-faith attempt to execute a trade. Nevertheless, the rates of order cancellation reach over   $95\%$   in some markets, though, by no means are all of these cancellations related to spoofing. Order cancellations are a perfectly legitimate trading tool— when the original orders were placed in good faith, not when their cancellation was the original intent. Because it is difficult for authorities to distinguish good-faith order cancellations from spoofing, and because of the need to establish intent to defraud, authorities have faced significant difficulties with prosecution.  

Damage to markets caused by spoofing can be far-reaching, as we will illustrate shortly in this section with respect to the May 6, 2010 “Flash Crash.” Market participants lose faith in markets when they realize that prices and liquidity are illusory.  Eggington, Van Ness, and Van Ness (2016)  found that quote stuffing was pervasive, affecting approximately three-quarters of all U.S. listed stocks in 2010, and that intense episodes of quote activity impaired market quality, diminishing rather than improving liquidity and price discovery while increasing market instability.  

# Illustration: Spoofing  

In 2001, the SEC alleged that Alexander Pomper submitted a phantom limit order (an order that Pomper did not intend to execute) on NASDAQ to purchase 300 shares of the thinly traded Gumtech International (“GUMM”) at   $\S11.375$  . This limit order improved the NBB by   $\S0.3125$   from  $\S11.0625$   to  $\S11.375.$  , while the NBO was   $\S11.4375$   per share. Pomper improved the bid for GUMM, but with a bid that he apparently did not actually intend to fill. Nonetheless, this bid did seem to improve the liquidity for GUMM, tightening the spread and making the stock appear to be worth more. Then, Pomper placed an order to sell 2000 shares of GUMM at   $\S11.375$   per share through another market-making firm. Pomper’s sell order was immediately executed at  $\S11.375$   per share by this market maker because the best (phantom) bid at  $\S11.375$   placed by Pomper seemed to suggest a higher value and more liquid market for GUMM. However, after executing its sell order, Pomper canceled his order to buy GUMM for   $\S11.375.$  , realizing additional profit of  $\S625$     $(2000\times[\S11.375-11.0625])$   relative to the initial bid for   $\S11.0625$  . In 2002, the SEC announced a settlement with Pomper, whereby without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint (which also alleged other violations), Pomper agreed to pay  $\S9800$  in disgorge ment and prejudgment interest and to pay a   $\S15{,}000$   civil penalty ( Securities and Exchange Commission, 2002 ).  
# Spoofing in the Era of Dodd-Frank  

As we discussed in Chapter 5, Regulation of Trading and Securities Markets, the DoddFrank Act specifically banned spoofing. Nevertheless, Michael Coscia, through his trading firm Panther Energy Trading LLC, placed a small bona-fide sell order and many large phantom buy orders at increasingly higher prices, creating the illusion of strong buying interest. When Coscia’s small sell order was executed, he canceled his phantom buy orders, and then proceeded to implement the spoof in reverse order so as to execute a small buy order after creating the illusion of strong selling interest. These and related spoofing activities enabled Coscia to secure profits of approximately   $\S1.4$   million in 2011. These profits were later disgorged along with an additional  $\S1.4$   million fine in 2013, and Coscia was banned from trading for a year. In November 2015, the first criminal trial in the United States for spoofing led to guilty verdicts, for which Coscia was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment. In addition, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority imposed penalties on both Coscia and Panther.  

Spoofing had long been considered a manipulative, deceptive and fraudulent practice under both the Securities Exchange Act and the Commodities Exchange Act, along with related SEC, CFTC and FINRA rules. However, since implementation of Dodd-Frank along with its specific reference to spoofing in 2010, the SEC, CFTC, FINRA and various exchanges have more actively pursued traders who engage in this type of activity. Among the many more recent targets of these regulatory bodies have been Coscia, Igor B. Oystacher and his trading firm 3Red Trading LLC   $\langle\Updownarrow2.5$   million in penalties), Biremis Corp. (fined   $\S250{,}000$   and permanently banned from trading for charges related to layering), UBS   $\langle\S700$   million fine), Trillium Brokerage Services, and Navinder Singh Sarao (to be discussed shortly). In some respects, the HFT algorithms used in many spoofing schemes have been helpful in prosecutions in that their programming codes are used as evidence of intent to defraud; otherwise, proving intent can be quite difficult.  

# The Flash Crash  

One of the more worrisome and perplexing short-term market crashes occurred on May 6, 2010. This “flash crash” had earlier been blamed on HFT. While HFT may well have contributed to the crash, its actual cause remains unclear. In addition to HFT, the May 6, 2010 flash crash has been blamed on fat fingers (keyboard errors, in this case, large accidental sell orders), technical glitches, debt default possibilities in Greece, etc. Regardless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its largest intraday loss ever, dropping by almost 1000 points in less than  $30~\mathrm{min}$   before recovering almost as quickly. Prices of over 300 stocks and ETFs dropped by more than   $60\%$   relative to their prices only minutes earlier. Trades were executed at absurd prices, ranging from less than one cent to over  $\mathbb{\S}100{,}000$   (We will discuss stub quotes shortly.). For example, some shares experienced odd gains, including Sotheby’s, which increased in price from   $\S34$   to   $\S99{,}999{.}99\$  . Exchanges ultimately canceled over 20,000 executions.  
As with many market crashes, it is difficult to pin-point the cause of the May 6, 2010 flash crash. There was a general concern that morning in the marketplace about whether the Greek government would default on its debt obligations. An early SEC report noted that the crash was preceded by a rapid algo-initiated short, reportedly by mutual fund group Waddell & Reed (not an HFT), of a   $\S4.1$   billion block of E-Mini Standard & Poor’s 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  

However, HFT firms apparently were counter parties to these shorts, and immediately covered themselves by further shorting (turning the contracts into hot potatoes, discussed shortly), drying up liquidity in these markets. Within 20 minutes of the start of the “crash,” trading in the E-mini contract was halted for 5 seconds, which allowed the market to recover. When contract trading resumed, prices quickly recovered most of their losses.  

In 2015, 5 years after the flash crash, the U.S. Department of Justice filed fraud and market manipulation charges against Navinder Singh Sarao, an independent trader who operated from his parents’ home near London. Mr. Singh had engaged in spoofing activities, having used his computer-based algorithms to place thousands of orders for E-Mini Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index futures contracts. His algorithms had canceled over 19,000 orders by the afternoon of May 6. While it is doubtful that this trader or any one of the issues described above was the sole cause of the flash crash, each might have played some contributing role.  

# Buy, Lie, and Sell High  

“Pump-and-dump” schemes occur when the market manipulator touts company’s stock with false and misleading statements to the marketplace, causing the stock’s price to rise before selling his own shares at inflated prices. Although pump and dump schemes predate the telephone by more than 200 years (e.g., the South Sea Bubble), the traditional misinformation campaign is launched through a boiler room (telemarketing) operation such as those conducted by Stratton Oakmont in the 1990s. Stocks promoted by the schemes tended to be thinly traded shares of small companies. More recent campaigns have exploited improved mass communications technology, including e-mail, social media, investment research websites and newsletters, hacked websites, and Internet chat rooms.  

For example, 15 years ago, it had been estimated that as much as   $65\%$   of e-mail traffic was unsolicited (spam), and that   $15\%$   of this spam was touting shares of stock ( Frieder & Zittrain, 2008 ). Such spam operations have been linked to pump and dump operations, where operators tout shares of stock and then sell them. Frieder and Zittrain claim that stock volume for touted shares increases dramatically after spam is delivered. Frieder and Zittrain describe one scenario:  
In a well-known case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, stock touter Jonathan Lebed routinely purchased stock accounting for anywhere from  $17\%$   to  $46\%$   of the stock’s market volume for a day, and sent spammed e-mail touts on the same day. He then lodged limit orders to sell for the next day’s trading session, anticipating a rise in the stock price after the general public received his touts and some acted on them. Lebed’s case and subsequent settlement with the S.E.C. focused on his failure to disclose his own financial interest in the securities he touted; as discussed below, stock touts today often include such disclosures (See also  Securities and Exchange Commission, 2000 ).  

Frieder and Zittrain found that on days prior to touting, and on days touting takes place, returns are positive. Returns after touting are negative. Two-day returns average  $-5.25\%$  , worsening further when the intensity of touting increases. Surely no reader of these results would consider purchasing stock on the basis of unsolicited spam. Yet, someone must be. Who? Why? And why does this buying behavior continue to persist even after transaction returns are so consistently poor?  

Jonathan Lebed, the stock touter described above, was a 15-year-old trader from Cedar Grove, New Jersey. In September, 2000, the SEC settled 11 cases of stock market fraud against this high school student that had resulted in gains ranging from   $\mathbb{S}12{,}000$   to  $\mathbb{974}{,}000$  from September 1999 to February 2000. With interest, the SEC disgorged  $\S285{,}000$   in illegal profits. With his AOL connection and hundreds of Yahoo Finance postings under numerous fictitious names, Jonathan had apparently purchased shares in small companies and then posted numerous buy recommendations under fictitious names, increasing share volume from 60,000 to over a million per day in the affected companies. He also maintained a website, stock-dogs.com, where he published his opinions and recommendations. It was reported that Jonathan’s father, Greg Lebed, had a heart attack and other heart issues during the period of Jonathan’s trading and SEC battles. However, the ending of this story wasn’t all bad for Lebed. In his settlement with the SEC, Lebed was permitted to keep over  $\S800{,}000$   in profits from other transactions. For years, Lebed has remained an active trader, distributed a newsletter, and maintained a website touting penny stocks.  

# Banging the Close  

The CFTC defines  banging the close  as a “manipulative or disruptive trading practice whereby a trader takes positions in a large number of futures contracts during the closing period of a futures contract (that is, the period during which the futures settlement price is determined) in order to benefit an even larger position in an option, swap, or other 8 derivative that is cash settled based on the futures settlement price on that day.” Consider the case involving the giant (now defunct) hedge fund Amaranth Advisors, LLC, which incurred  $\S6.4$   billion in losses in the early spring 2006. The fund’s failure arose from losses in trading highly leveraged natural gas contracts on NYMEX. The CFTC later charged Amaranth and its former head trader, Brian Hunter, with trying to manipulate natural gas futures prices. More specifically, Hunter was accused of banging the close and flooding the then-open outcry NYMEX futures markets with “series of rapid and successive” orders for natural gas during the final minutes of trading before the close, thereby forcing prices down in this less active market as buying interest diminished. The actual intent of his selling activity, according to the CFTC, was to depress natural gas prices in the ICE, where Amaranth held much larger short positions through swap contracts.  
# Corners and Pools  

Corners  involve the purchase a sufficient level of a given security to obtain market power over its price. The purpose of the corner is to manipulate the price of the security, an activity made illegal by the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act. Numerous corners have existed over the years in commodity and securities markets. For example, the Hunt brothers (Nelson and Lamar), two of the then-wealthiest men in the world, attempted to corner the silver markets in the early 1980s, taking billions of inherited dollars in long positions. Although they succeeded in bidding up the price of silver almost 10-fold through their purchases, the bottom fell out of the market before they could unload their holdings. They nearly went bankrupt. A pool  is a common fund comprising participants who combine their resources to obtain a large position in a security in order to manipulate its price. Pools might be used to facilitate cornering of a market, and were a common activity prior to the 1929 stock market crash.  

# Vanderbilt v. Drew  

One of the most interesting cases of market manipulation involved Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, a 19th century tycoon, and Daniel Drew, an operator with connections to Tammany Hall. As of the early 1860s, Vanderbilt had owned enough shares (with a cost as low as  $\S8$   apiece) of Harlem Railroad Company stock to effectively control the company and its share price, bidding it up to   $\S100$  . He intended to extend the railroad’s service into Manhattan and required approval from the city to accomplish this. However, Daniel Drew, also a Harlem Railroad investor, sold his shares and shorted 137,000 shares, almost five times the number of outstanding shares. He used his influence to convince Boss Tweed to repeal the railroad’s license to operate in New York City, with the intended effect of ruining the railroad. The price of shares fell from   $\S100$   to  $\S72,$  , with Vanderbilt purchasing shares as Drew sold. In fact, Vanderbilt had, in effect, purchased the company several times over by acting as counterparty on Drew’s short sales, and had the market cornered. In time, the short selling peaked and Drew needed to cover his short positions by re purchasing the stock. But only one major investor owned shares—Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt, having cornered the market, set his price at  $\S179$   per share, a price calculated to be the maximum that Drew could afford to pay. Drew was forced to settle with Vanderbilt at his terms, Vanderbilt obtained his approval to extend the railroad into Manhattan with Drew’s cooperation, and Drew was practically bankrupted 9 in the process. Drew had fallen victim to a market  corner , intended to  squeeze the short seller :  

He who sells What isn’t his’n Buys it back Or goes to pris’n.  
# Modern Day Corners  

Such corners are not confined to “ancient” history. For example, two brokers employed by the now defunct firm Moore & Schley, Cameron & Company were accused in the late 1980s of acquiring shares of Chase Medical Group for the purpose of artificially inflating their prices.   In effect, these brokers were accused of cornering the market for these shares and engaging in phony transactions to prop up the share prices.  

In the height of the financial crisis of 2008, the German automobile manufacturer Porsche revealed that it owned  $42.6\%$   of the stock of Volkswagen, along with call options on another   $31.5\%$   of its shares. A number of hedge funds had short sold Volkswagen stock, believing that it would drop once Porsche reached its target ownership level of   $75\%$  . Unfortunately, the state of Lower Saxony in Germany owned another   $20\%$   of the shares, which it did not want to sell, creating a shortage of shares in the market available for short sellers to cover their positions. This shortage of available shares caused the share price to rise from about 200 Euro to over 1000. In effect, without breaking German securities law, Porsche had, in effect, cornered the market for Volkswagen shares and squeezed hedge fund short sellers, earning significant paper profits on its shares.  

Market corners are not confined to equity markets. The U.S. Treasury maintains a strict set of rules for trading its instruments intended to sustain a perception of fairness. For example, no bidder is permitted to bid for or obtain   $35\%$   or more of a given Treasury issue. These regulations are intended to prevent market corners. Nonetheless, it still might be possible to abuse trading and bidding rules to create an unfair advantage. For example, in summer 1991, the venerable investment bank Salomon Brothers created a huge scandal by routinely bidding on more than  $35\%$   of issues, illegally bidding on as much as  $105\%$   of certain new issues. To conceal their actions, many of their bids were placed under names of clients who were unaware of the activity. Bonds were “parked” in client accounts. Such over bidding enabled Salomon to corner the market and fix prices for new two-year treasuries, enabling the firm to generate substantial trading profits by engaging in short squeezing.  

The Treasury responded to this scandal by expanding its list of primary market participants and changing bidding procedures. Salomon fired its CEO, John Geutfrend, and several key employees including John Meriwether and Paul Mozer, the primary instigator of the fraud.   Mozer subsequently pled guilty on two counts of lying to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in his bid submissions, served four months in a minimum security prison, and was fined   $\S30{,}000$   and an additional   $\S1.1$   million in an agreement with the SEC that barred him from the securities business for life. Warren Buffet, who owned a substantial stake in the firm through his holdings in Berkshire-Hathaway, contributed significant credibility to the firm by taking over as interim CEO and is often credited with saving the firm, which since consolidated with Smith-Barney into CitiGroup.  
# Wash Sales  

Unscrupulous market participants have always had an interest in manipulating market conditions to generate profits. For example, consider  wash sales , which are sham transactions intended to create the appearance of sales where, in effect, no sales actually take place. The SEC defines a wash sale as a transaction that involves no change in beneficial ownership. Wash sales may be intended to manipulate security prices (e.g., conspirators execute transactions with one another to create records of sales prices to deceive other participants in the market). One may arrange to sell a security to a cohort at a fixed (as opposed to market-determined) price. The transaction and its price are revealed to the market, which is intended to accept this price as the market-determined value of the security. A series of wash sales at ever-increasing prices, known as a  jitney game , can give other investors the impression that the value of the security is rising, leading investors to purchase the stock. The market manipulators benefit when investors are led to purchase from them the security at inflated prices. It is quite likely that the security’s price will drop rapidly once investors realize that they had been tricked into purchasing the security. The market manipulators hope that they will no longer own the security when this happens. Wash sales may also involve the sale of securities for tax purposes with offsetting transactions to repurchase the securities or related instruments. The IRS defines a wash sale to be a sale and a re-purchase of the same security within 30 days. This sort of wash sale is not illegal if not intended to manipulate the market, though any capital losses and associated tax write-offs generated by this activity will be disallowed by the IRS.  

# Fishing  

Fishing  refers to a practice intended to obtain secret or hidden information concerning order sizes in dark pools. Fishing occurs when a trader (who might also be called a “gamer” in this setting) sends a series of small orders to a dark pool to detect whether there is a large order waiting in that pool. If the fishing results in successful order fills, the trader might infer that additional orders or a very large order await in the pool. Then, the trader can submit a much larger order at a size and price that reflects the information that he has obtained through his gaming activities. Suppose, for example, that an institutional trader has discretion reflected in his algo to buy shares at a price as high as 50.03 and places a bid at 50.00. Suppose that the current market for the shares is 50.00 bid/50.05 offer. Now, suppose that another trader, a prospective “fisher” or “gamer”, detects this algo order, but does not know its reserve price to purchase shares. The gamer “pings” the algo by offering shares at 50.04. If the offer is not immediately executed, it immediately cancels. Then, the gamer offers 50.03 and the institutional algo buys. The gamer now realizes that it has found the institution’s reserve price for the shares. The gamer now knows that it can probably sell many more shares at 50.03 rather than the 50.00 quoted bid. Thus, the gamer submits a much larger sell order at 50.03. This sort of gaming activity is often perfectly legal. In some cases, the gamer can manipulate the selling price of shares by entering small buy orders in the displayed market to force the displayed price up, say from 50.05 to 50.07. This might force the institutional seller to raise its bid to 50.05, at which time the gamer sells larger numbers of shares at this higher price.  
As we discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, an important exception to the quote rule requiring that all market centers publicly disseminate their best bids and offers through the securities information processors allows an exception for quotes that are immediately executed or canceled, such as fill or kill orders. These quotes are often not publicly displayed, but may be displayed to select clients. These orders (see discussion from Section 4.9) can result in flash trading in advance of the public quote stream. Such flash orders can facilitate fishing and have been criticized as being very unfair to the majority of market participants.  

Predatory algo trading  strategies are designed to exploit other institutional algo orders. Suppose, for example, the predatory trader detects an institutional algo order to buy a large number of shares. Suppose that a small number of these shares are offered at 50.00, and the predatory trader suspects that the institution has pegged its order to the NBBO and is willing to pay as much as 50.25 per share. The predatory algo can seek to lock in a profit by artificially increasing the share price. Upon detection of this institutional order, the predatory trader places a small bid of 50.01, then continues placing small bids at successively higher figures as the institutional algo trader increases its bid with the NBBO. Ultimately, the predatory algo places a short sell order at 50.25, knowing that it created much of the apparent demand running the price up to 50.25. When the price falls, the predatory algo covers its short position.  

# The Odd Eighths Scandal  

In Section 5.7, we introduced a somewhat different type of market manipulation, perpetrated by conspiracy involving Nasdaq dealers, sometimes referred to as the “OddEighths Scandal.” Quotes data collected during the 1990s revealed that Nasdaq dealers quoted prices far more often in even-eighths than in odd-eighths, artificially widening spreads by using round dollar amounts,  $1/4,\,1/2,$  , and 3/4 fractional amounts (Christie & Schultz, 1994). This thoroughly widespread manipulation in Nasdaq markets enabled dealers to pay less for and sell securities at higher prices, enhancing profits, and enhancing commissions in agency transactions. The ensuing S.E.C. investigation led to much negative publicity for Nasdaq, including revelations of “Chinese markets” and harassment of or refusal to trade with brokers who were uncooperative by offering deals that were “too good” to their clients or counter parties.   At the time, Nasdaq was not required to post public limit orders, so that the best prices would not have been known by or available to retail customers. This S.E.C. investigation eventually led to censure of Nasdaq and fines exceeding  $\S1$   billion. In 1997, the S.E.C. imposed new rules requiring that brokers and dealers post limit orders and their best prices on Nasdaq as well as in ATS markets such as Instinet.  
# LIBOR and Fraudulent Trading  

The London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR, introduced in Chapter 2) derives from a daily survey of 18 global banks originally conducted and compiled by the British Bankers’ Association (BBA), a UK lobby group, and reported by Thomson Reuters with respect to rates at which the banks believe they can borrow a “reasonable” number of dollars (and certain other currencies) from one another in the London interbank market. Actually, there are a number of LIBOR figures, for different maturities and currencies. LIBOR has been important because it is widely used as a benchmark for interest rates on which many loans and securities are based. A trader able to influence this rate or even rates reported by just one of the banks participating in the survey should be able to obtain significant profits trading products based on the LIBOR. This is a conspiracy scheme that involved roughly 30 traders and other employees at Rabobank Coo¨peratieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boere nle en bank B.A. (Rabobank). Similar schemes were undertaken at Barclays, UBS, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and RBS. These schemes ultimately led to major upheavals in the process of obtaining and computing rates for the LIBOR, which is now managed by the Intercontinental Exchange, the parent firm of the NYSE.  

Essentially, one such scheme involved Rabobank employees responsible for submitting Rabobank rates for the BBA surveys communicating with their own traders concerning their positions in LIBOR-related products, and these traders requesting that the survey submissions to the BBA be biased so as to favor their own LIBOR-related positions and anticipated trades. Web chat and email trails reveal that traders requested these accommodations, rate-submitters complied with the requests and that the LIBORs were biased as a result. Anthony Conti, a senior trader on the money markets desk for Rabobank, and Anthony Allen, the bank’s global head of liquidity and finance in London, were, respectively, sentenced to 24 and 12 months in 2015. They and a number of other employees were fined, and Rabobank paid over   $\S1$   billion in fines to the U.S. and U.K. However, the criminal convictions against Conti and Allen were overturned on appeal in July 2017 on Fifth Amendment grounds, because evidence against them was obtained from testimony the men were forced to give in the United Kingdom, which does not offer the same Fifth Amendment protections as does the U.S. A witness against them in their U.S. trial had also been compelled to provide testimony in a related case in the U.K.  

This LIBOR scandal had several serious ramifications. The over   $\S9$   billion in fines assessed to banks and the criminal prosecutions were really just a start. The takeover by the ICE Benchmark Administration from the BBA was a direct result of the scandal. Perhaps the most important effects of the scandal concern the erosion of trust in the LIBOR by regulators and markets, and the erosion of public trust in the market more generally. Use of LIBOR has been in the process of being phased out, with a current target date set for June 30, 2023, for many applications, and generally being replaced with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR; see Chapter 2) where practical. LIBOR had served as the benchmark for over  $\S300$   trillion in loans worldwide and many times this amount in various derivative contracts. Many existing contracts have needed to be rewritten to account for the LIBOR phase-out.  
# Other Quote Abuses  

Quote matching  occurs when a small trader places a quote one tick from that of a large trader so as to profit from the large trader’s transaction price pressure, or to use the large trader as a counter party should prices reverse. Quote matching exploits the option associated with a limit order. See end-of-chapter exercise 12 in Chapter 6 for an illustration of quote matching.  

Quote stuffing , discussed earlier in this section above, is the placement of large numbers of rapid-fire stock orders, with most or all of which being canceled almost immediately, frequently for the purpose of clogging HFT and other algorithms and data computations. The purpose of quote stuffing is not to execute orders, but to sabotage algorithms of other traders. See the description of spoofing above. More generally, most types of spoofing are intended to deceive other traders, quote stuffing is intended to clog the trading system and/or sabotage other traders’ algorithms. Be aware that the two terms are sometimes used synonymously. Both types of activities are usually illegal.  

Many dealers are obliged to post quotes for even their least liquid securities. They sometimes fulfill their obligations by posting quotes that are very distant from any reasonable market price for the security (e.g., bid for  $\S0.01$   or offer at  $\mathbb{\S}100{,}000)$  ), not intending or expecting that these quotes would ever be executed. However, in a one-sided market, these  stub quotes  might result in executions as liquidity dries up, causing securities to trade at absurd prices. In many instances, the trades and profits realized with stub quotes were entirely unintended, but executed automatically by algorithms or due to stale quotes. Nevertheless, stub quotes have the potential to destabilize markets and increase volatility.  

# 13.5 PAYMENT FOR ORDER FLOW  

Payment for order flow, a topic that we introduced in Sections 1.6 and 4.8, was originated by Bernard Madoff in the 1990s. During that era, stock prices were quoted in eighths of a dollar, considerably more than the  $\S0.01\!-\!0.02$   per share that he offered retail brokers such as Charles Schwab and Fidelity to route retail order flow to him. Madoff reasoned that the retail clientele of such firms tended to be uninformed noise traders, hence in no position to exploit inside or special information as were insiders or the informed traders that we discussed in Chapter 6. He was happy to trade against and to pay for order flow that originated only with uninformed traders; he faced no adverse selection problem with them. The S.E.C. allowed this practice to continue, reasoning that its potential for conflicts of interest would be mitigated by competition as other firms began to engage in the practice. Furthermore, it was not clear at that point that retail clients were being hurt as they still tended to trade at prices close to or at the NBBO.  

Nonetheless, there has also been significant controversy over these rebating practices as it has since spread to other market makers, smaller exchanges, and then to the larger exchanges. When exchanges and their competitors sell virtually identical products, they compete for customer order flow, usually on the basis of prices or trading costs. Presumably, this competition enables customers to obtain better prices. However, many brokerage houses internalize orders and own or make arrangements with alternative trading system (ATS) markets. This means that brokerage firms have a special incentive to internalize orders or send their orders to these ATS markets where possible—the firm will receive commissions on the trade, earn trading profits, receive payment for order flow, and secure additional business for their own systems. Clearly, many investors trade through brokers with strong potential conflicts of interest. In fact, markets even pay brokers to direct their orders to them so as to enhance their liquidity and the profitability of their traders and market makers. In addition, markets usually have order imbalances, which means that certain additional orders will serve to create liquidity while others will consume liquidity in that market. It might make sense for such markets to charge higher prices on orders that consume liquidity than those that create liquidity.  
This system, also known as  make-or-take pricing , refers to exchanges allowing patient traders to post standing limit orders that await execution until some other trader takes the other side. In effect, the patient trader is a market maker who receives payment from the exchange for making the market (liquidity rebate) and the market taker pays an access fee. Note the connection between this system and the “immediacy argument” of Demsetz described earlier in Section 6.5. These rebate programs have the potential to help customers get price improvement for their orders by creating competition among the exchanges, market makers, and liquidity providers with whom they trade, potentially resulting in superior execution quality. In addition, the practice has virtually eliminated commissions and fees for many investors. A number of observers have noted that makeor-take pricing systems have reduced spreads and improved liquidity, although the liquidity rebates normally are not reflected in bid and offer quotations. This practice continues to grow more widespread, and since February 2010, even the NYSE, which had been the most vocal opponent of payment for order flow, has been making such payments to providers of liquidity.  

On the other hand, such payments and rebating for order flow might lead to market abuses, reduce price competition for securities, and reduce security price transparency. At a minimum, the practice creates a conflict of interest for brokers; it is not clear that the rebate system provides for the best executions, at least for retail traders. For example, FINRA fined Robinhood  $\S1.25$   million in December 2019 for failing to ensure that its customers received the best prices for their orders.  Battalio, Corwin, and Jennings (2016)  suggest that payment for order flow leads brokers to send orders to venues that might be inferior with respect to fill rates and other indicators of execution quality. In addition, routing orders to dark trading venues inhibits price discovery in markets, obscuring what might be the best executions for retail traders. Furthermore, the maker-taker fee structure makes it difficult to determine the best price as required by Reg NMS because displayed quotes do not reflect rebates or fees. The customer might lose the opportunity to obtain an unannounced better price from a broker on the national exchange floor. Regardless, in 2000, the SEC adopted Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1-6 (now SEC Rule 606), requiring brokerdealers to make available quarterly reports that present a general overview of their routing practices. These quarterly reports must identify the significant venues (exchanges or ATS markets) to which customer orders were routed and disclose the material aspects of the broker-dealer’s relationship with such venues. In addition, the Rule requires broker-dealers to disclose, on customer request, the venues to which the customer’s individual orders were routed.  
# 13.6 FAT FINGERS, HOT POTATOES, AND TECHNICAL GLITCHES  

In 2005, a novice trader in a subsidiary of Japan’s second-largest bank, Mizuho Financial Group, attempted to sell one share of J-com stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for  f 610,000   $(\mathbb{S}5041)$  . By accident, he transmitted an offer to sell 610,000 shares at  f 1 each. In effect, he attempted to sell  $\S3.075$   billion worth of stock for   $\S5041$  . These 610,000 shares that he attempted to sell represented 41 times the total number of J-com shares issued by the Japanese recruitment company. Mizuho attempted to cancel and reverse the order, but not quickly enough, so that this incident (losses exceeding  f 27 billion) wiped out Mizuho’s entire profit for the quarter. The absence of filters either at the bank or at the Tokyo Stock Exchange to prevent such an obviously erroneous trade played havoc with the market for J-com stock, and caused the entire Nikkei-225 to drop by   $1.72\%$  . The broader market reaction was largely in response to traders attempting to guess which firm had made the mistake, driving down share prices for nearly all Japanese financial institutions. Later litigation assessed a significant portion of the blame on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and Mizuho recouped some of its losses.  

Fat fingers (keyboarding and other entry errors) appear to have led to many isolated incidents of sudden security price movements. For example, three years before the Mizuho incident, a trader at Bear Stearns seemed to have caused a 100-point drop in the Dow after inadvertently entering a   $\S4$  -billion sell order instead of his intended   $\S4$  million buy order. Morgan Stanley made a similar mistake with a 2004 order for  $\S10.8$  billion rather than the intended  $\S10.8$   million. Another incidence involved Diebold Inc., which increased by   $30\%$   in six seconds on June 2, 2010 on NASDAQ and BATS exchanges. Fat fingers can have significant consequences. Washington Post Co. dropped by   $99\%$   in less than one second on June 16, 2010 on NYSE Arca, and Progress Energy Inc. increased by   $90\%$   in less than one second on September 27, 2010 on NASDAQ. Nikkei 225 futures contracts dropped by   $1.1\%$   on June 1, 2010 as a result of an unintentional algo order placed on the Osaka Stock Exchange. Each of these occurrences illustrates the need (and failures) for effective trade filters, even in the absence of automatic algo executions. However, even an effective trade filter would not have helped the Bank of America trader who set up a   $\S50$   million trade on his computer while awaiting instructions from his supervisor on whether to execute. While he waited, one of his colleagues tossed a rugby ball that landed on his keyboard, causing the order to execute before it was authorized.  

# Technical Glitches  

Despite many efficiencies arising from technologies for trading and markets, various computer, software, and routing malfunctions cause regular and significant disruptions in markets and trading firms. For example, on December 9, 1987, a squirrel burrowed through a power line in Trumbull, Connecticut where Nasdaq’s data facilities were located. The squirrel’s adventure halted Nasdaq trading for 82 minutes and got himself killed. A similar event occurred in 1994, halting trading on Nasdaq for 34 minutes, and killing yet another squirrel.  
As the securities industry further automates, more frequent technical glitches occur. For example, consider the period 2012  2013. Nasdaq’s computer systems were overwhelmed during the Facebook IPO on May 18, 2012, when a surge in order cancellations and updates delayed the opening of the shares for trading and impaired later trading. Nasdaq settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay   $\S10$   million for failing its “obligation to ensure that their systems, processes and contingency planning are robust and adequate to manage an IPO without disruption to the market” ( SEC 2012 ) and settled a class action suit with Facebook investors in 2015 for  $\S26.5$   million.  

Perhaps even more disruptive was the approximately   $\S460$   million in losses incurred by the Knight Capital Group, resulting from its accidental acquisition of approximately  $\S3.5$   billion in net long positions in 80 stocks and approximately   $\S3.15$   billion in net short positions in 74 stocks. Knight’s problematic launch of insufficiently tested software led to over 4 million erroneous executions and many more trade cancellations over 45 minutes on August 1, 2012. The new software aggressively executed transactions at a rate of   $\S2.6$   million per second, causing significant slippage, raising prices as it bought and reducing them as it sold. NYSE markets were disrupted and affected stocks experienced enormous price volatility. Knight, which had been the largest equities trader in the U.S., was fined  $\S12$   million by the SEC, struggled to recover and was taken over by Getco to form KCG in 2013.  

In August 2013, Goldman Sachs unintentionally flooded U.S. exchanges with erroneous stock-option orders, losing roughly   $\S100$   million. Two days later, a connectivity issue between a trading firm and the UTP SIP (Nasdaq’s securities information processor) impaired the ability of the SIP to disseminate quotes and trades and caused a three-hour halt in trading at Nasdaq. Such technical glitches by America’s best-known investment bank and major stock exchange do little to instill confidence in technology-based trading systems, and imply the possibility of disastrous market crashes. But they also should serve as warning to traders: Expect the unexpected. Better yet, prepare for the unexpected.  

# Hot Potato Volume  

One of the most important functions of a securities market is to convey information through the price aggregation process. Trading conveys information about securities, and higher volumes are often thought to convey more or higher quality information. However, hot potato trading, repeated passing of inventory imbalances among dealers, seems to actually dilute the information content of trading ( Lyons, 1997 ). This type of trading tends to be more common in the presence of HFTs and where inter dealer volume is high. On October 4, 2010, Gary Gensler, Chair of the CFTC referring to the May 6, 2010 flash crash, remarked that:  

Much of the volume on May 6 [the Flash Crash] was just positions being moved back and forth over a matter of seconds between high-frequency traders and other market makers. This is what our economists refer to as “hot potato volume.” For the large trader’s order to actually be absorbed by the market, it had to find fundamental or opportunistic buyers who were willing to hold the position at least for more than a few seconds ( Gensler, 2010 ).  

An important lesson from this and other mini flash crashes is that high trading volume and market liquidity are not the same, especially when hot potato volume is involved.  
# A Textbook for   $\S23$  ,698,655.93 (Plus   $\S3.99\$   Shipping)  

A trading algo program gone bad might seem more understandable when you consider Peter Lawrence’s 1992 developmental biology textbook,  The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design . Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, reported that he sent one of his post-docs to purchase a copy on Amazon.com on April 18, 2011, who was shocked to see that Amazon listed 17 copies for sale: 15 used from  $\S35.54,$  , and 2 new from   $\S1,730,045.91$     $(+\S3.99\$   shipping) (See  Rooney, 2011 ). The two new copies were offered by two booksellers, Profnath and Bordeebook. Their prices quickly increased from over  $\S1.7$   million to  $\S2.8$   million, and by the end of the day, to  $\S3{,}536{,}675{.}57{,}$  . Ultimately, the book’s price topped out at   $\S23{,}698{,}655{.}93{,}$  , plus shipping.  

How did this price manage to evolve to over   $\S23$   million? First, Profnath used an algorithm to undercut Bordeebook’s price, at 0.9983 times Bordeebook’s. However, Bordeebook used its algorithm that would set its own price at 1.270589 times Pronath’s, apparently seeking the larger markup. This was the recipe needed for the book price algorithm to explode: competing booksellers’ price multiples exceeding one.  

Such algo programs gone bad are not confined to markets for books, and they are not one-time isolated events. Consider the case of Hansen Transmissions (HSNTF.PK), a company that manufactures and supplies wind turbine gearboxes. On January 23, 2009, its stock price increased from   $\S1.62,$  , the prior close, to  $\S143.32$   on the trading of 100,000 shares, apparently on the news of an alternative energy speech given by President Obama. The next day, trading opened at   $\S1.69$  . While this scenario itself was not a major market calamity, it does warn of potential meltdowns (e.g., the May 6, 2010 “flash crash”) or other market disruptions that might occur with unfiltered or even filtered algo trading.  

# 13.7 ROGUE TRADING AND ROGUE TRADERS  

Markets can be perceived as unfair for many reasons. Some investors might have better access to information than others. Certain investors are able to exercise market power due to their size, access to information, domination, or transaction volume. As we have discussed in Chapters 4 to 6, investors lacking these advantages might be unwilling to trade with their advantaged counter parties; such perceived unfairness can lead to market failure. This chapter is largely concerned with the impact that unfair trading activities can have on traders, markets, and institutions. However, illegal trading activities are often less significant causes of market failure than trading misguided by poorly designed compensation and managerial control systems. This scenario seems most apparent with failures associated with the financial market crises of the early 21st century. Perhaps, more than any other concept, the following scenarios illustrate  Darley’s law , named for John Darley, a professor of psychology at Princeton University who emphasized the importance of implementation and design of effective risk management systems to accompany objective incentive  based compensation systems:  
be to distort and corrupt the action patterns and thoughts of the group or individual it is intended to monitor.  

Rogue trading is usually characterized as systematic unauthorized trading, trading with unapproved counter parties, or trading of unapproved products. Rogue trading normally involves traders exceeding risk limits and/or loss limits set by their employers and is accompanied by efforts to conceal unauthorized actions from management and regulators. That is, rogue trading is often used as a cover for prior mistakes. In practically all instances, rogue trading is accompanied by poor internal control systems and supervisory failures that allow these deceptive actions to succeed. Rogue trading, in and of itself is not necessarily illegal (laws can be pretty specific here), it is by definition, not authorized by management. However, rogue trading is often accompanied by illegal actions to camouflage the unauthorized trading. Rogue traders do not normally face criminal charges due to trading; their illegal deceptions to cover their inappropriate trading lead to criminal prosecution. In many instances, rogue trading is motivated by what behavioral economists call an  irrational escalation of commitment , which might be likened to “throwing good money after bad.”  

The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, and exchanges require broker-dealers to supervise their employees and maintain compliance departments as part of an integrated risk management system to protect the institution and its clients, yet almost all rogue trading can be tied to breakdowns or lapses in supervisory control systems. Trading firms need to implement supervisory control systems designed to detect and deter all unauthorized trading, including those that have strong profit potential. Warning systems for limit breaches should be among the first line of defenses against rogue trading. Employees should not have access to reporting systems used to monitor their activities, a rule regularly broken in the rogue trading scenarios discussed below. Red flags suggesting the need for further questioning and/or examination should include any discrepancies in reports of account activity, the presence of any unauthorized products in trading accounts, traders working unusually long hours and working into the late night, unusually large unrealized profits and losses on unsettled transactions, movements of positions between accounts especially prior to reviews, and unusual patterns in and large numbers of cancellations and corrections. Policies mandating vacations extending at least two consecutive weeks during which traders are denied all access to trading, reporting and control systems are useful for detecting unauthorized trading. Paying particular attention to the activities of traders who request exceptions to such policies including requests to relax controls is useful as well. Lapses in essential principles such as these are important warning signals of the potential for rogue trading.  

# Rogue Traders  

# Grant & Ward  

News of one of the earliest documented rogue trading disasters broke in 1884, engineered primarily by Ferdinand Ward, a habitual con man. Ward had recruited Ulysses S. Grant, Jr., to form the brokerage firm Grant & Ward, with his father, the former U.S. president Ulysses Grant, later serving as an unwitting silent partner. Ward used the former president to falsely claim that he had inside information concerning government contracts. The firm made bad trades, illegally re hypo the cate d securities already serving as pledge for other purchases on margin, altered the firm’s books, and for a time, covered liquidity needs by using a Ponzi scheme (discussed in the next section [13.8]) that promised investors   $10\%$   per month. Liabilities of the firm ultimately exceeded assets by a factor of more than two to one. The firm failed, Ward went to prison, the former president was bankrupted, and the Wall Street Panic of 1884 ensued, worsening the economy already mired in a depression.  
# Nick Leeson and Barings Bank  

One of the most notorious rogue traders in history was Nick Leeson, chief derivatives trader at Barings’ Singapore office. (See  Waring and Glendon, 1998 , for details.) In 1995, Leeson’s trading activity single handedly brought down the centuries-old Barings Bank, forcing the sale of Britain’s oldest bank to ING for  d 1. The proud bank, which had long served the English “upper crust,” financed Napoleonic Wars, the Erie Canal, and the Louisiana Purchase, had been founded in 1762. Until its takeover, it had served as Queen Elizabeth’s personal bank. Leeson incurred  d 880 million in trading losses, sufficient to bring down the entire bank. Leeson was authorized by the bank to execute futures and options orders for clients or for other units of Barings Bank and to arbitrage price differences between Nikkei futures traded on the SIMEX and the Osaka Exchange. Both were inherently low-risk activities and did not provide much latitude for exposing the bank to higher-risk speculative activity. However, to camouflage poor trading performance and his losses, Leeson created a fictitious trading account numbered 88888 (8 is a lucky number in Chinese numerology) into which he recorded fictitious trades offsetting his own trades. Leeson claimed that this account was initially created to hide an error made by a colleague; rather than purchase 20 contracts as a customer had ordered, the colleague sold them, costing Barings  d 20,000. Regardless, Leeson used this account to hide his own bad trades that followed.  

When Leeson was discovered, he escaped Singapore to Malaysia aboard his yacht. The world followed as he then escaped to Thailand and then Germany, adding international intrigue to his story. Leeson was caught and served three years in a Singapore prison before being released for good behavior. He has since become somewhat of a celebrity ex-rogue trader, giving lectures to companies on risk management. He sold his story to a newspaper and, while in prison, wrote the book  Rogue Trader , which became the basis for the movie of the same title starring Ewan McGregor. After being awarded time off for good behavior in prison, he went on to serve as the CEO of the Galway United Football Club in Western Ireland, to maintain an active schedule on the lecture circuit, and to write his second book,  Back from the Brink: Coping with Stress .  

Clearly, Barings’ control systems were lacking. More than 20 of Barings’ employees were implicated in failing to detect the fraud. Barings management was warned about the failure to segregate back office and trading operations, but they failed to implement remedial actions. Essentially, Barings failed to implement effective compliance mechanisms, proactive risk management measures, appropriate oversight, and sound management oversight.  

What are the lessons to be learned from Leeson’s fraud? The bank neglected the first and most important step in implementing risk controls: sufficient segregation of trading and back office (record-keeping) functions. This should be the first step in preventing and stopping trading fraud. In effect, Leeson was his own supervisor. Second, management did not react appropriately when it was warned of increased concentration of financial risks from a relatively small trading unit. A substantial proportion of this U.K. bank’s profits were generated by a small trading unit in Singapore. In fact, higher-level managers might have intentionally overlooked this and other warning signs. Third, continued trading fraud, at least initially, is often committed not for personal gain, but to cover poor performance or losses. Each escalation is often an attempt to cover the previous failure. Fourth, incentive-based compensation contributes to trading fraud, not only motivating the perpetrator, but his supervisors as well. In fact, incentive-based compensation systems might have greater effects in failed supervisory systems than in rogue trading activity itself. Fifth, a single rogue trader can bring down even the largest and most venerable of financial institutions. Finally, the superstar trader should merit the closest—not the least observation, not only to ensure that his trading is legitimate, but to better understand the secrets to his success.  
# John Rusnak and AllFirst  

John M. Rusnak was a foreign exchange (FX) trader for the Baltimore-based AllFirst Financial Corp., which was owned by Allied Irish Banks PLC (AIB). Rusnak gambled incorrectly in 1997 that the U.S. dollar would fall against the Japanese yen. He used currency forward contracts to purchase yen as the dollar strengthened, inflicting several millions of dollars in losses on his employer. He hid these bad trades by attempting to trade out of them with larger trades, a doubling-up tactic used by many rogue traders. Second, Rusnak manipulated internal controls and entered fictitious trades and data into AllFirst’s books and records, hiding the facts that he exceeded his trading limits and assumed excessive risks. Again, his activities illustrate the failure of financial institutions to maintain effective and independent control systems. In an effort to cover up his losses, Rusnak created a fictitious businessman with a mail drop at Mail Boxes Etc. in New York to confirm bogus currency trades with AllFirst’s independent auditors. Over the next four years, as his trading losses mounted, Rusnak, who projected himself as a church-going family man, hid his losses with his fictitious account and other manipulations of his employer’s control system. He wasn’t caught until December 2001, by which time his losses had exceeded  $\S691$   million. Like Leeson, he disappeared and was later caught after his losses were revealed. Rusnak was not charged with stealing money, although he did earn   $\S650{,}000$   in bonuses related to his trading activity, along with a modest salary. He pled guilty to bank fraud on October 24, 2002, and received a 7-1/2-year jail term followed by five years of supervised probation, along with a  $\mathbb{S}1000$   per month restitution obligation (57,000 years of years of payments are required at this rate). Earlier in 2002, AIB had sold majority control of AllFirst to M&T Corporation. Some of the same lessons from the Leeson case apply to Rusnak, except that from Rusnak, we learn that massive compensation levels are not a necessary condition for rogue trading.  

# Orlando Joseph Jett and Kidder Peabody  

Orlando Joseph Jett, an MIT graduate with a Harvard MBA, began trading strips (zerocoupon Treasury instruments) and other Treasury instruments for the well-regarded firm Kidder Peabody in 1991, failing to report significant profits in his “rookie” year and earning a bonus of   $\S5000$  . Trading profits recorded by Jett in 1992 and 1993 were   $\S32$   million and  $\S151$   million, followed by  $\S81$   million in the first quarter of 1994. These apparent trading profits were realized on trading volumes of  $\S25$   billion,   $\S273$   billion, and   $\S1.567$   trillion for 1991, 1992, and 1993, and  $\S1.762$   trillion for the first 3 months of 1994. In 1993, Jett was named Kidder Peabody’s “man of the year” and was awarded a   $\S9$   million bonus. His compensation awards were not merely a fixed proportion of his profits; compensation proportions were increased as his trading profits increased. Furthermore, Jett’s supervisor, Ed Cerullo, was awarded a   $\S20$   million bonus in 1993 for Jett’s accomplishments. However, it was later revealed that Jett did not actually generate profits for his employer in those years; his desk actually lost   $\S85$   million. The “phantom” profits resulted from a mistaken entry in Kidder’s internal accounting system where bond payments to be made later were not discounted; that is, future cash flows were being treated as though they were immediately realized. Ultimately, when the contracts settled, Kidder Peabody realized the losses, but Jett was able to cover these losses (on paper, with the help of the flawed internal accounting system) by increasing the size of his positions, realizing more phantom profits. Interestingly, Jett was ultimately cleared of criminal wrongdoing because it could not be proven that he knew about and intentionally exploited the glitch in the accounting system, even though he repeated transactions with almost identical results and with increasing frequency. In fact, Jett argued that Kidder ordered him to increase his risks to deceive Kidder’s parent, GE, into believing that the Kidder unit was realizing its profit objectives. When GE became concerned about the ballooning sizes of Jett’s trading volume, Jett was ordered to cut back on his holdings. He did so, but apparently entered offsetting transactions to exploit the faulty accounting system and to avoid having his bonuses cut. Only when his positions were cut back were his trading losses uncovered. Jett was ultimately fined   $\mathbb{\S200,000}$   in 2007 and ordered by a judge to repay   $\S8.2$   million in losses. Kidder Peabody was sold to Paine Webber in 1994 shortly after the scandal broke, which later merged into UBS.  
A significant contributor to Jett’s losses at Kidder Peabody seems to have been lack of proper oversight by his supervisor, Ed Cerullo, who earned substantial bonuses based on Jett’s phantom trading profits. Cerullo had a strong incentive to not adequately supervise his employee. Might Cerullo and his superiors have made a conscious decision to tolerate Jett’s ballooning trading volume and probable risk limits simply because of his previous “successes” and their ballooning compensation levels? Might supervisors and higher-level managers have been complicit in the rogue trader’s seeming success? A second contributor to many trading unit failures is that trading losses can often be covered with taking positions with increased risks, a cycle that can play out until the entire firm fails. Third, as we saw in the Leeson case, close monitoring of unusually high trading profits is probably as important as close monitoring of any unusual trading activity.  

# Je´roˆme Kerviel and Socie´te´ Ge´ne´rale  

In 2008, Je´roˆme Kerviel of Socie´te´ Ge´ne´rale confessed to a  h 4.9 billion fraud where he misappropriated computer access codes, falsified documents, and employed other methods to cover his improper trading activities. It was the largest discovered trading fraud in history until Bernard Madoff’s detection (which was actually more of reporting and misallocation frauds than a trading fraud). Kerviel’s case was particularly interesting because of how ordinary and unimpressive he seemed in almost all respects. Unlike Leeson and Jett, Kerviel was by no means a trading superstar. He apparently made very profitable, but unauthorized trades that he hid by intentionally executing transactions to create losses. He argued that the type of behavior that he engaged in was commonplace in trading units, but that employers turned a “blind eye” to these activities as long as the activities appeared to be profitable. Kerviel was formally charged in France in 2008 with abuse of confidence and illegal access to computers. He was ultimately sentenced to five years in prison (two years suspended) and to make full restitution of the lost  h 4.9 billion, though the restitution was overturned on appeal. He was also given a permanent ban from employment in the financial services industry although in 2016, he won a  h 450,000 judgment from Socie´te´ Ge´ne´rale on the grounds that his employer was aware of his deceitful behavior, and, therefore, his dismissal was unfair.  
# Potentially Authorized Trading Gone Wild  

However, not all “trading gone wild” constitutes unauthorized rogue trading, though authorized large-scale trading and poor risk controls can be just as damaging. Consider former highly compensated JPMorgan Chase trader Bruno Iksil, also known as the “London Whale,” and his team of traders who lost approximately   $\S6$   billion trading credit default swaps and other instruments, partly due to inadequate risk controls. It appears that bank supervisors may have been aware of the large and risky trade positions. The bank was criticized by regulators for its high-risk trading strategies, weak management, poor response to this crisis, and failing to co-operate with regulators. Ultimately, the bank agreed to pay approximately  $\S920$   million in fines to U.S. and U.K. regulators to settle charges related to this “London Whale” trading debacle, accepting responsibility for engaging in unsafe and unsound practices and failing to oversee its traders. In its investigation of this fiasco, the U.S. Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that Chase “disregarded multiple internal indicators of increasing risk; manipulated models; dodged oversight; and misinformed investors, regulators and the public about the nature of its risky derivatives trading.”  

# 13.8 HIDING TRADING LOSSES WITH PONZI SCHEMES  

Ponzi schemes are not trading schemes. However, Ponzi schemes have been used by rogue traders to mask illegal or unprofitable trading activity such as the illegal rehypo the cation of securities in the Grant & Ward disaster discussed in the previous section. Each of the Ponzi schemes described here share an essential quality: They promised high returns with little risk. This is typical. More generally, red flags that an investment opportunity might actually be a Ponzi scheme include promises of high returns with little risk, remarkably stable investment returns over time, unregistered sellers or securities, and difficulties withdrawing money from the investment. In the case of Grant & Ward discussed in the previous section, the Ponzi scheme covered trading losses, magnified by excess margin and illegal securities re hypo the cation, which continued until the firm imploded.  

In December 2007, one of the highest profile and most respected members of the Wall Street community, Bernard Madoff, revealed to his son that his investment firm, Madoff Securities, was a Ponzi scheme. Essentially, this meant that the Madoff lost or pocketed clients’ money, and when asked or forced to meet client obligations, used funds raised from other clients to meet these obligations. This amounts to a sort of pyramid scheme to “rob Peter to pay Paul.” Although Madoff was a trader and operated a well-respected trading firm, his Ponzi scheme was not a trading fraud per se. Madoff used the Ponzi scheme to cover his trading fraud. Essentially, Madoff lied to his investing clients about trades that he executed along with the profitability of those trades, and then used his Ponzi scheme to cover his trading fraud and associated losses, and to keep clients temporarily satisfied.  
After the confession, Madoff’s son promptly turned his father in to authorities, and investors in his fund realized that their losses totaled  $\S50$   billion to   $\S65$   billion (including profits that were never realized), far and away the largest Wall Street fraud incident ever. Madoff pled guilty to 11 counts of securities fraud on March 12, 2009. Previously, Madoff had maintained a highly successful trading and market-making business, accounting for as much of  $12\%$   of Nasdaq volume. He was an active securities market regulator, having served on the NASD and NASDAQ boards during much of the 1980s, and had even served in 1990  1991 as chairman of the board of Nasdaq. However, the fraud occurred in a business distinct from his trading operation, his investment advisory operation. Madoff accepted large sums of money from “feeder funds” such as Walter Noel’s Fairfield Greenwich Group, Tremont Capital, Stanley Chais, and Avellino and Bienis as well as banks such as Santander. Madoff prohibited these funds from listing his fund in their prospectuses and was able to attract over 3000 investment clients without registering with the SEC as an investment advisor (registration is required when the advisor’s client base exceeds 15). This enabled Madoff to conduct his advisory operations outside of the purview of the SEC. Actually, the SEC had reviewed Madoff’s operations repeatedly, overlooked the Ponzi scheme evidence, and focused on whether Madoff’s investment advisory operation was obliged to register with the SEC. Madoff actually used the SEC reviews to bolster his credibility, maintaining that the SEC had regularly reviewed his operations and found nothing amiss.  

Madoff regularly provided statements and trade confirmations to clients, apparently almost entirely fabricated. He claimed to be engaging in a trading practice known as “split strike conversion,” a simple collar strategy involving the S&P 100. Madoff claimed to take long positions in a basket of stocks resembling the S&P 100, purchasing  $\mathrm{S}\&\mathrm{P}$   Index 100 puts while writing   $\mathrm{S}\&\mathrm{P}$   calls. In a Black-Scholes framework, his strategy should have produced a return comparable to the riskless rate, much less than the  $14\%$   to  $20\%$   that he actually “paid” to most of his investors. David Friehling, whose tiny accounting firm Friehling & Horowitz in Rockland County, New York, audited Madoff’s records and was paid approximately  $\mathbb{S}12{,}000$   to  $\mathbb{S}15{,}000$   per month (after 2004), was also charged with securities fraud.  

# Carlo Ponzi  

The Ponzi scheme as we discuss it in this book is not so much a trading activity as it is an activity intended to cover up another crime. For example, Madoff used it to cover his failure to produce promised investment gains and to support his fraudulent reporting. The Ponzi scheme is named for an Italian immigrant to the United States, Carlo Ponzi, who in 1919 discovered an arbitrage opportunity for which he required financing. He had spent most of his working life as a dishwasher, waiter, clerk, and so on, but learned that he could trade postal coupons obtained for one cent in Spain for six cents in postal coupons in the United States. Hence, he proceeded to solicit investors to participate in this opportunity, promising returns of approximately  $50\%$   in 45 days. The scheme seemed simple enough and thousands of investors participated. Several government agencies examined Ponzi’s trading operations, but found no illegal activity. Over several months, thousands of investors demanded their money back. Ponzi complied with each demand, enhancing his credibility. Essentially, each investor was paid from proceeds realized from the sale of securities from other investors and not enough investors demanded money back to render Ponzi insolvent. Payment from new investor proceeds was necessary because the red tape and various obstacles and expenses made the original arbitrage scheme unprofitable. When a Boston newspaper questioned the legitimacy of Ponzi’s operations, state regulators investigated Ponzi’s books and prohibited him from selling additional securities. Ponzi was still able to meet demands for cash, further enhancing his credibility. He invested company proceeds into a new bank, the Charles Ponzi Company, which brought in even more money. In time, bank auditors declared the bank to be bankrupt and it was revealed that Ponzi had served time in prison for an earlier fraud. This caused his operations to collapse and created widespread panic and even caused a number of other banks to fail. Ponzi was jailed for mail fraud and spent the remainder of his life in and out of prison for various types of fraud before dying in Brazil without enough money to be buried.  
# Other Ponzi Schemes  

Bernard Madoff’s fund is by no means the only investment company that has turned out to be a Ponzi scheme. For example, a 2009 complaint filed by the SEC alleged that from at least February 1995 to 2009, Joseph S. Forte of Philadelphia had been operating a Ponzi scheme ( Securities and Exchange Commission, 2009a ). Apparently, Forte fraudulently obtained approximately   $\S50$   million from roughly 80 investors through the sale of securities in the form of limited partnership interests in his firm and co defendant, Joseph Forte, L.P. Forte, who never registered with the SEC, apparently told investors that he would invest the limited partnership funds in a securities futures trading account in the name of Forte LP that would trade in futures contracts, including S&P 500 stock index futures. However, he continually lost money on the limited trading that he did, sustaining trading losses of approximately   $\S3.3$   million between 1998 and 2008. From the inception of the scheme, the SEC alleges that Forte and his firm lied to investors about the returns on the trading, reporting annual returns ranging from   $18.52\%$   to almost   $38\%$  . In addition, the SEC alleged that Forte stole significant portions of the funds entrusted to his care.  

James Ossie of Atlanta was charged by the SEC along with his firm CRE after raising at least   $\S25$   million from over 120 investors offering   $^{\prime\prime}30$  -day currency trading contracts” that guaranteed a  $10\%$   return in 30 days ( Securities and Exchange Commission, 2009b ). In addition, the SEC alleged that CRE and Ossie claimed to have generated profits sufficient to pay these guaranteed returns by trading U.S. and Japanese currency contracts as the exchange rate fluctuated. Apparently, Ossie told investors that his program involved very little risk because CRE had established a large, defensive reserve fund from which to pay back the   $10\%$   return on investment along with any principal that investors chose to redeem. The SEC alleged that Ossie and CRE never generated sufficient returns from currency trading to pay the promised returns, but was merely a Ponzi scheme.  
Sir R. Allen Stanford and the Stanford International Bank based in St. Croix sold certificates of deposit from Antigua that offered “unusually high and consistent returns” (double the market average, according to  Business Week ). C.A.S. Hewitt, the tiny Antiguan accounting firm that audited Stanford’s books, was run by Celia Hewett, who went missing at about the time the scandal broke and Charles worth “Shelly” Hewett, who died in early 2009. Stanford “managed”   $\S51$   billion, slightly more than the amount that Madoff managed, and seemed to be financing a lavish lifestyle on a Ponzi scheme. Stanford was included on the 2008 Forbes list of billionaires, owned an island in the Caribbean and a number of jets, helicopters and yachts. In early 2012, Stanford was convicted on 13 counts of fraud, conspiracy, obstructing justice, and violating U.S. securities laws, and was sentenced to 110 years imprisonment.  

# Additional Reading  

Chapter 2 of  Kolb and Overdahl (2006)  provide a nice discussion of market abuses and regulation in the futures markets.  Lefevre’s 1923  classic  Reminiscences of a Stock Operator  remains an entertaining and informative read, and is still the most widely referenced book on stock market scams. For a read on trading gone awry on an economy-wide level,  MacKay’s classic 1841  Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds  is probably the most important reading material for bubbles and crashes during the first half of the 19th century. The 2001  New York Times Magazine  article by Michael Lewis on the teenager Jonathan Lebed is a thoroughly entertaining read.  Shiller’s 2000  best-seller  Irrational Exuberance  remains a readable, relevant, and important book. Michael Lewis’s  Liar’s Poker: Rising through the Wreckage on Wall Street  (1989)  and  The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine  (2010)  are entertaining reads on the Wall Street mindset. James  Stewart’s 1992  classic  Den of Thieves remains among the most thorough and readable books on 1980s-era inside trading scandals. Finally, several relevant movies might be fun to watch.  Liar’s Poker ,  When Genius Failed ,  Den of Thieves ,  Rogue Trader , and  Wall Street all are worth a watch. The staff report prepared by the  Security and Exchange Commission (2021)  summarizes some very recent market updates, including new brokerage firm marketing efforts, zero-commission transactions and fractional share offerings along with certain undesirable market activities, including short squeezes.

# 13.9 EXERCISES  

1.  Describe why it is difficult to manipulate security prices in a well-developed and liquid market.  

2. a.  Most markets, including those for labor, commodities, and real estate, allow insider trading activity. Transactions in these markets are routinely based on unequally distributed information. Why should insider trading be common and legal in these markets? b.  Discussion in Section 13.2 focused on the damage to markets done by insider trading. Prepare an argument to justify legalize the practice of insider trading.  

3.  Does insider trading violate the Securities Act of 1933? If so, what section? If not, why not?  

4.  In a release dated November 5, 2001, the SEC announced an action against Israel Shenker. In this announcement, the SEC provided the following description of a series of transactions executed by Shenker:  

14:44: 44—Shenker placed an order to buy 500 shares of the target security at  $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbb{S}34.0625,}\end{array}$  , and directed that it be routed to the ECN. The order raised the NBBO bid price from   $\S31.50$   to  $\Updownarrow34.0625$  . 14:44:46—Shenker entered a limit order to sell 500 shares of the target security through SOES at a price of  $\S34.0625.$  , and the order was immediately executed. 14:44:48—Shenker canceled his buy order, causing the NBBO bid price to drop from  $\S34.0625$   to  $\S31.25$  .  

By manipulating the public quote to obtain a better execution price for his 500-share sell order, Shenker was unjustly enriched in the amount of   $\S1281.25$   ( Securities and Exchange Commission, 2001a, 2001b ).  

a.  What is the name of the type of market abuse alleged by the SEC? b.  Why were these manipulations not considered to be wash sales? c.  Why was the activity alleged by this announcement illegal?  

5.  In the chapter, we discussed a number of problems in markets that arise from legal practices and norms, but might be worthy of discussion by regulators. Consider the following issues:  

a.  Payment for order flow and the liquidity maker-taker pricing schemes have been criticized for creating conflicts of interest between brokers and their clients. Devise and discuss some strategies for mitigating the conflicts that are associated with these practices, assuming that the practices are continued.  

b.  Traders have complained that market liquidity is often not what it appears because when they place market orders in response to quotes; the quotes disappear before their orders are executed. That is, quotes are canceled between the times traders initiate responses to them and when the executions are attempted; the quotes are simply not reliable. In fact, in many markets, over   $95\%$   of quotes are canceled rather than executed. Devise and discuss some strategies for making quotes more reliable to traders.  
6.  In Section 13.7, we discussed the need for trading firms to question and more closely examine “traders working unusually long hours and working into the late night,” and to ensure that traders take “vacations extending at least two consecutive weeks during which traders are denied all access to trading, reporting and control systems are useful for detecting unauthorized trading.” Why are such policies helpful to limit rogue trading?

 7.  Many observers of the market, including Michael Lewis, author of the book Flash Boys, have accused HFT firms of front-running by observing order flow to the market and using those orders and their superior technology to place and execute their own orders before earlier “slow orders” are executed. At least for the scenario described here, does the accusation of HFT front-running seem justified? Why or why not?

 8.  How might retail clients of brokers benefit from payment for order flow?
