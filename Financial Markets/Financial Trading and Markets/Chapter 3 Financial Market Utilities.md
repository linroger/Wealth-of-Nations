# Financial Market Utilities and Securities Trading Support  

# 3.1 SECURITIES TRADING INFRASTRUCTURE  

Casual traders are usually well-served by their retail brokerage firms in dealing with the mechanics of trading. Such traders, often making a small number of trades per day, receive most of the services and details that they require from their retail brokers and avoid many of the complexities that professional traders encounter when dealing with the mechanics of trading. Professional traders often encounter more complex trading regulations and technicalities and need to be better informed with respect to the “nuts and bolts” of their trading activities. Even simple issues, which can usually be ignored by casual traders, become more important to professional traders. For example, how do traders take possession of the securities they buy? How do they receive cash for the securities they sell? What is the total cost of derivative exercise or settlement? How are exercise and settlement requirements fulfilled for their derivative transactions? What are the costs and risks associated with all these issues? These trader activities all occur within the  financial market infrastructures , sometimes referred to as the “plumbing for financial markets,” which provide key services that are critical to the smooth and reliable functioning of markets. Individual institutions providing such services often are referred to as  financial market utilities , which include central counter parties and provide reliable transfer, payments, clearing, and settlement systems. Serious traders need to be familiar with such systems and institutions, especially those that involve clearing firms and clearinghouses, along with their practices and the requirements they face when dealing with them.  

We will narrow our discussion in this chapter to focus on securities trading infrastructure and utilities while broadening our discussion to include institutions that provide pretrade, brokerage (execution), and posttrade services, including quotations, data, and prices. Some broader definitions of financial market infrastructure include exchanges (we discussed these in the previous chapter), cloud computing systems, cyber security, and various support systems for banks and other depository institutions. Most of these services are beyond the scope of this book. Here, we will introduce quotations systems, followed by brokerage operations. We will then emphasize traditional securities market infrastructures such as clearing and settlement systems and central counter parties, along with the other services they provide.  
# 3.2 PRICE AND QUOTATION SYSTEMS  

Traders can subscribe to direct price and quote data feeds from any number of the various securities exchanges in the U.S. At the same time, for example, stock traders and traders in certain other markets have to contend with the same securities being traded in multiple venues. That is, U.S. stock and other securities markets are fragmented, which hinders the informative quality of pricing and market efficiency and can hinder the ability of traders to obtain the best possible prices for their transactions. The costs of subscribing to and analyzing multiple data feeds is prohibitive for most traders. The U.S. Congress has made several efforts to legislate reductions in market fragmentation and its harmful effects on investors without hindering market competition. The U.S. Congress has also made efforts to improve competition between markets for securities trading. For example, the Securities Act of 1975 amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to facilitate development of a national market system for securities transactions. With the national system created by the 1975 Act, Congress intended to increase competition, efficiency, and price transparency in securities markets, and to promote  best execution  and order interaction. In this system, national and regional exchanges would list security prices simultaneously on relevant quotation and trade reporting systems. The purpose of this national market system was to ensure that investors would receive the best possible executions for their securities transactions, where the meaning of best execution, in a rather vague manner, seeks to account for the best price given the existing NBBO, execution speed, differences in quantities of securities actually offered and bid, transactions costs and market depths. We will discuss further the concept of best execution in Chapters 4 and 5.  

The Securities Industry Automated Corporation (SIAC), fully owned by the NYSE, maintains the primary systems for disseminating NYSE price and quote information to the public. The National Market System’s prices and quotations are compiled and disseminated by securities information processors (SIPs). The system operated and maintained by the NYSE is simply called the  Securities Information Processor  (SIP), although a second SIP is operated by Nasdaq.  

SIPs link U.S. markets by collecting, consolidating, and compiling all trade prices and all bid/ask quotes along with certain other critical information including highs, lows, and the NBBO from all relevant trading venues into a single continuous data feed. SIPs seek to mitigate the adverse effects of market fragmentation while retaining competition among trading venues, including registered exchanges and certain other markets, which are required to provide quotation and transaction data to a designated SIP. The two U.S. equity SIPs are the  Consolidated Tape Association  (CTA), overseen by the NYSE, and Unlisted Trading Privileges  (UTP), overseen by Nasdaq. These SIPs combine and disseminate prices and quotes through three SIP networks: Tape A, governed by the CTA, which reports for NYSE securities regardless of where they trade; Tape B, also governed by the CTA, which reports for exchanges, ATSs, and venues other than the NYSE and Nasdaq;  
and Tape C, governed by UTP for securities listed on Nasdaq (see  Securities and  $\operatorname{Ex}$  change Commission [2020] ).  

The CTA’s two reporting systems are the Consolidated Tape System (CTS) and the Consolidated Quotations System (CQS). The CTS is a high-speed electronic system that reports transaction prices and volumes for securities on most U.S. equity exchanges and markets, displayed by some data vendors in “Time & Sales Windows.” The CQS provides traders with price quotes from the various equity market venues and FINRA and calculates and disseminates the NBBO and certain trading restrictions, mostly related to short sales and market halts, displayed by some vendors in a limit book format. Both CTS and CQS data are combined into network Tapes A, B, and C and sent to subscribers. In addition, data compiled by the SIAC for the CTA is also compiled to the U.S. options SIP, the Options Price Reporting Authority  (OPRA).  

These information processing systems might be regarded to be the centerpieces of the Inter market Trading System  (ITS), a general term for the market system arising from 1970s U.S. Congressional efforts to enhance market competition and mitigate the negative effects of fragmentation. The ITS displays quotes from different markets, compiles the NBBO and has linked markets for trade executions and to facilitate investors’ access to the best quotes.  

Information and data are valuable assets, and sales of these data are important sources of revenue to exchanges and their members. An SIP will charge its many users of data for access to its data. The varying types of users pay different rates for different use patterns and different quantities of data, with typical retail access through brokers costing more on a per query basis (usually, the costs are absorbed by their brokers) than professional user fixed prices, which usually cost more overall for continuous and more detailed access. Many traders access this price and quotations data through various types of vendors as described in Chapter 1 of this book. Media organizations purchase data at yet different rates. To encourage information production and improved markets, the SIP rebates revenues to markets and traders, who regularly contribute and improve price quotes and contribute more data to the systems.  

# 3.3 BROKERAGE OPERATIONS  

Securities brokerage firms have linked traders and investors who are widely dispersed throughout the world, enabling them to execute transactions in central physical and electronic venues. Securities brokers traditionally received commissions for their execution services and often provided a variety of other services to their clients. The process of executing securities transactions has become increasingly complex over the years, but brokerage firms continue to appear as the face of trading processes to most investors.  

Until 1975, brokerage firms in the United States functioned as a rather exclusive cartel, fixing commissions and offering clients a wide array of services ranging from providing trade executions and margin opportunities to offering advice and management services. Brokerage firms were all said to be full service, and included firms such as Merrill Lynch, E.F. Hutton, Paine Webber, and Smith Barney. The industry was forced as of May 1, 1975, acting on SEC Rule 10b-3 to break its cartel and compete with respect to brokerage commission levels. Numerous discount brokers opened operations, competing against full service brokers by offering trade executions with lower brokerage commissions. Discount brokers initiating operations in the 1970s included Quick & Reilly and Charles Schwab. The Internet’s development in the 1990s and shortly afterwards created opportunities for Internet brokers such as Ameritrade, ScottTrade, Interactive Brokers, and E-Trade to further reduce commissions and execute transactions for clients without actually speaking live with brokerage account representatives.  
Investors wishing to open brokerage accounts need to consider their trading needs and interests to properly select their brokers. Investors needing substantial advice and counsel along with other services may find their needs better fulfilled by full-service brokers such as Merrill Lynch, Raymond James, or UBS. In addition, there is some statistical evidence (discussed earlier) suggesting that larger full-service firms better provide for transaction price improvement (executing the client’s transaction at a price that is better than the best bid or offering at the time of the transaction). Investors who are comfortable with their trading experience and who expect to execute smaller trades, particularly more frequent smaller trades, might prefer the lower commissions offered by an Internet broker such as ScottTrade or T.D. Ameritrade. These on-line brokers will often offer low flat-rate commissions, sometimes even dropping to zero, particularly when the brokerage firms receive payment for order flow (rebates).  

J.D. Power and Associates regularly provides broker quality information based on its customer satisfaction surveys. Important evaluation criteria include commission levels, percentage of orders showing price improvement, frequency of limit order executions, margin and cash interest rates, and customer satisfaction.  Barrons  conducts similar surveys. Such surveys are useful in making broker-selection decisions.  

Most stock orders in the United States are placed through stockbrokers who were traditionally compensated with commissions. These commissions are or were typically charged as a fraction of the dollar volume of the transaction and as a function of the number of shares associated with the order, or in many instances, a simple flat commission (recall sources of brokerage revenues in Section 1.7). Sometimes, the broker’s commission will be a function of the bid-ask spread; that is, the difference between the lowest price a trader is offering for the security and the highest price an investor is willing to bid for that security. OTC markets and particularly exchanges will provide for trading priority rules, which designate which orders will be filled or the sequence in which orders will be filled. Frequently, priority rules are designated according to transaction price, size, location of origination of order timing, and so on.  

# Securities Investors Insurance Corporation  

The “Paperwork Crisis” of the late 1960s and early 1970s (to be discussed shortly) caused many brokerage firms to fail, at the cost of public confidence in stock markets. In response, the  Securities Investors Protection Corporation  (SIPC) was created by the U.S. Congress as a nonprofit corporation under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 to protect clients from failures of registered securities brokerage firms. In some respects, the SIPC is analogous to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in that it insures investor accounts in U.S. brokerage firms for up to  $\S500{,}000$   in cash and securities, including up to   $\S250{,}000$   in cash (money market mutual funds are considered by the SIPC to be securities), but only in the event of the failure and liquidation of the brokerage firm. Thus, this coverage is very limited. The SIPC does not provide protection from declines in security values, nor does it provide protection for losses from securities not registered with the SEC or even from fraud unless the brokerage firm fails. Coverage extends to non–U.S. citizens.  
The SIPC assesses its members, normally annually at a rate of 0.0015 of net operating revenues as of 2021. These assessments are used to contribute to a default fund, which as of year-end 2020 had reached an overall value of approximately  $\S3.9$   billion. The SIPC seeks to ultimately grow this fund to   $\S5$   billion. The SIPC also maintains a  $\S2.5$   billion line of credit with the U.S. Treasury. From its creation in 1970 to year-end 2020, the SIPC had injected  $\S3.1$   billion from its fund to cover investor losses, enabling it to recover approximately  $\S141.8$   billion on behalf of 773,000 insured investors (see  SIPC [2021] ).  

# Back Office Operations  

Most securities brokerage firms will operate front, middle, and back offices, which refer to groups that provide different categories of functions and services. Traditionally, front-office personnel produce revenues by engaging in direct interaction with the broker’s clients (client-facing), middle-office personnel directly support front-office staff, and back-office personnel provide support services behind the scenes. Operations or back-office personnel include IT specialists, accountants, operations staff, human resources staff, office managers, customer service representatives, and regulatory compliance staff. As we mentioned in Section 1.2 and will detail shortly in this chapter, crucial back-office activities include trade confirmation, clearing, and settlement functions, almost always conducted with the assistance of clearing institutions, as we will discuss shortly. Back-office activities also include margin calculations, exercise and settlement for derivative securities, records and account maintenance, software and information technology, and data provision and might include efforts related to strategic planning for the brokerage firm. Back-office brokerage personnel often work with clearing firms (especially when their employers do not self-clear) and clearinghouses.  

# 3.4 CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT  

The general  clearing  process involves two primary tasks: trade comparison (matching of trades) and settlement (physical delivery of securities and cash or book entry delivery). Clearing refers to the set of activities resulting in settling claims of financial institutions against other financial institutions. The operations department of a financial institution, often referred to as the institution’s back office, is responsible for handling or overseeing the clearing and settlement processes for their own transactions.  

# Clearing Firms and Clearinghouses  

Only approximately   $5\%$   of over 5000 U.S. brokerage firms are self-clearing; that is, only  $5\%$   are capable of clearing trades for themselves. Other brokers, known as correspondent firms, forward their orders to a  clearing firm . A clearing firm is authorized by a clearinghouse (defined below) to manage trade comparisons and other back office operations. Leading clearing firms include Pershing, LLC, RBC Correspondent Services, and Southwest Securities, Inc. Most traders who are unaffiliated with self-clearing institutions will clear their transactions through such clearing firms.  
A  clearinghouse  clears transactions for a market such as the NYSE and is typically established by that market or members of that market. A clearinghouse facilitates the trade settlement between two clearing firms (also called as member firms or clearing participants) and seeks to ensure that the clearing firms honor their trade settlement obligations. The clearinghouse will typically guarantee the obligations of its member firms, and often require collateral to ensure that settlement obligations are fulfilled. The collateral is pooled into a clearinghouse guarantee fund. The clearinghouse will step into a transaction to be settled by its members and assume the settlement obligations of both counter parties to the transaction, in effect becoming the counter party to both sides of every transaction, a process known as  novation . Thus, the clearinghouse, acting as a  central counter party , acts as the counter party for each party to every transaction, and assumes all credit risk associated with each party. Option clearinghouses will handle the process of option exercise.  

In the United States, the  National Securities Clearing Corporation  (NSCC, a division of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, described below), the successor to the combined clearing corporations of NYSE, AMEX, and NASD, is the major clearing agent for equity markets. NSCC serves as the clearing agent for these three major equity markets as well as for many bond markets. Its primary facility for clearing is the Securities Industry Automated Corporation (SIAC), which maintains the computer systems for clearing. Clearinghouses clear and settle trades for most options, futures, and swap markets. Most U.S. options exchange transactions are cleared through and guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The OCC clears transactions for options and futures on equity instruments, stock index contracts, currencies, and certain interest rate contracts as well as a number of contracts in other markets.  

# Trade Confirmation and Comparison  

Confirmation is the first step of the clearing process, occurring after the trade reports are sent to traders’ clearing agents (if relevant) who forward them to the central clearing agent (if the market centrally clears) by both counter parties in the trade. When trades are executed, buyers and sellers record trade details. Brokers and dealers receive confirmations that the trade has been executed and pass on details of the confirmation to clients. The typical confirmation document received by the client reports the security’s name and CUSIP number (the security’s nine-character alphanumeric identifier issued by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures), the number of units traded, the security price, and the broker commission and other fees, along with trade and settlement dates.  

Trade comparison is the second step in the clearing process. Comparison matches counterparties in transactions. Trades are compared and are said to be cleared when the counterparties’ records are identical. This happens for the vast majority of trades.  Out-trades  in futures markets or  DKs  ( don’t knows ) in other markets, which are trade reports with discrepancies resulting from recording errors, misunderstanding and fraud, are sent back to traders to resolve or reconcile.  
# Netting  

The number of securities transactions that occurs each day is huge, requiring some sort of process to simplify the process of changing title to securities and moving corresponding cash proceeds between accounts.  Netting  is the simplification process used by clearing firms, and is one of the most important functions of the clearing process, and of the NSCC. Netting is the process of adding all of an institution’s purchases of each security, adding the sales of each security, deducting sells from buys to determine the net change in holdings of that security for the institution and computing the net cash flows associated with all transactions. The NSCC is able to reduce the total number of trades requiring an exchange of money by about   $98\%$   through the netting process, where millions of transactions are reduced to each clearing member receiving net debit and credit notifications for cash and for each traded security. The NSCC uses an automated system through the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC) to “net down” or reduce the number of trading obligations that require financial settlement.   Since most brokerage firms execute large numbers of both buy and sell transactions for the securities that they trade, the netting down process results in only about   $3\%$   of the total reported matched or offsetting transactions actually having to be settled between financial institutions. At the end of the netting process, the NSCC delivers to each brokerage firm settlement instructions.  

# Custody and Trade Settlement  

Trade settlement  occurs when buyers receive their securities and when sellers receive payment for their securities. Stock ownership in most cases is evidenced by a certificate. The  Depository Trust Company , a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, holds stock certificates of member firms, registering them in member names and maintaining computerized records of ownership and transfers.   The Depository Trust Company and the National Securities Clearing Corporation, the two major units of the DTCC, were both founded as a result of paperwork crises in the 1960s and 1970s when messengers were delivering paper securities certificates by hand on behalf of brokerage firms and settling transactions on paper. As of 2018, the DTCC was holding in custody approximately  $\S52.2$   trillion in securities and processed a daily average of over 1.4 million transactions during the year. Overall, the DTCC settled more than  $\S2.329$   quadrillion in securities transactions in 2020, including equities, fixed income instruments, mutual funds, insurance products, and so on. Equity securities are held in street name, meaning that securities are held in the names of brokers (nominee names), who, in turn, maintain their own records of ownership in client accounts.   Settlement of a trade is completed when the DTCC transfers the ownership of the shares from the selling firm to the buying firm in its automated book-entry record keeping system and transfers money between firms with net credits and net debits. Firms that have net credit after end-of-day netting are owed more by other brokers than they owe. As depicted in  Figure 3.1 , the  National Securities Clearing Corporation  (NSCC) transfers money to banks of these net credit firms from accounts of brokers with net debits through the  Fedwire  system. At present, the SEC requires that settlement occur within two days   $(\mathrm{T}{+}2)$   after most transactions. In addition, the DTCC provides cost basis information and other information services. The DTCC provides clearing services at a very low cost, averaging approximately  $\S0.018$   per trade.  
Modern settlement of trades normally takes place in electronic book entry form. However, during most of the 19th century, each NYSE transaction required delivery of paper certificates and checks and had to be settled within one day   $(\mathrm{T}{+}1)$  , creating significant pressures as messengers rushed to make deliveries after transactions. Failure to make timely delivery impaired the performance of counter parties, intensifying contagion risks.

FIGURE 3.1 Clearing and Settling an NYSE Transaction 4  

3 Actually, shareholders can maintain stock custody themselves through physical certificates or, if the company allows, hold their stock through direct registration with the company. These alternative choices significantly diminish the convenience of transaction execution relative to registration in street name. 4  $\operatorname{Ex}$  See a more detailed version of the clearing and settlement process at  Securities and change Commission (2015) , p. 45, particularly with respect for involvement of entities such as transfer agents and introducing brokers.  
In response to these pressures and several financial market panics, the NYSE introduced netting to the clearing processes with the founding of the NYSE Clearinghouse, later to be called the Night Clearing Branch. In 1920, the Stock Clearing Corporation (SCC) was established by the NYSE to serve as the central counter party for every transaction. The establishment of the SCC provided for novation and meant that market participants needed to have checks and stock certificates delivered daily only to a single central counter party, the SCC. A  central counter party , typically a clearinghouse, serves the role of buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer in each market. The central counter party through novation drastically simplifies paperwork and delivery relative to bilateral settling (parties to each transaction settle with one another), record-keeping, and securities transfer. The central counter party also guarantees contractual obligations, thereby reducing the risk of market failure. Members of the clearinghouse, called clearing members, interact directly with the central counter party both as principal and as agent for their clients, which include brokerage firms, institutional traders, smaller financial institutions, insurance companies, etc.  

NYSE market activities continued to expand, and despite the novation innovations implemented by the DTCC, strains on clearing and settlement systems resumed. As mentioned earlier, in the 1960s, securities clearing involved the physical transfer by messenger of paper securities and checks. By 1967, this system became untenable due to the tremendous paperwork backlogs associated with increasing securities market activity. Ultimately, the volume of trading activity led to closure of the NYSE on Wednesdays, shortening of other trading days, and increasing settlement to  $_{\mathrm{T}+5}$  . These backlogs and trading impairments, collectively known as the  Paperwork Crisis , diminished investor confidence in the safety of U.S. capital markets and were a contributing factor to more than 100 broker-dealers and acquisitions operating under stress or failing. The  Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) was set up in 1973 to handle the clearing business for the major stock exchanges. Since 1999, the DTCC has owned the Depository Trust Company and the National Securities Clearing Corporation. The DTCC also owns the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation and Deriv/SERV, LLC. The DTCC is owned by its customers, exchanges, and ECNs that clear through their facilities. The NSCC and the DTCC also require brokerage firms to maintain collateral to ensure that they fulfill their obligations. In Europe, the major central securities depositories are Euroclear (the world’s largest clearance and settlement system for internationally traded securities), EuroCCP (currently owned by Cboe Global Markets), and Clear stream (Deutsche Bo¨rse Group). The London-based LCH Group (formerly the London Clearing House) provides a variety of clearing services in the United Kingdom.  

In addition to producing obvious efficiency gains, central counter parties serve another important function: they improve market resilience by increasing transparency and reducing counter party risk. For example, the OTC derivatives markets faced unprecedented risk levels and contagion (spread of economic crisis) in September 2008 due partly to the huge number of bilateral (no central counter party) derivative contracts involving Lehman Brothers, the giant dealer on the brink of bankruptcy. The market’s inability to net and settle the roughly 930,000 outstanding bilateral derivatives contracts with Lehman threatened to cascade and melt down the entire financial industry. On the other hand, LCH Swapclear, the clearinghouse for 66,000 Lehman trades with notional value of  $\S9$   trillion in five currencies, successfully managed contracts that it served in the wake of the collapse ( Loader, 2020 ). Within a month, the losses to LCH and its default fund (funded by LCH Swapclear members to enhance default protection) were zero, and the surplus Lehman margin was returned to Lehman’s bankruptcy administrators. Thus, the Lehman crisis might have been mitigated with novation and use of a central counter party for its OTC transactions, due in part to the ability to net down individual trader settlement obligations more easily. Use of a central counter party spreads and mutualizes risk among market participants, whereas standardizing margin and other trading requirements reduces market abuses and improves transparency through improved monitoring and efficiency of information gathering. Numerous studies, including one by  Bernstein, Hughson, and Weidenmier (2019) , have found empirical results confirming both risk-reduction effects and share price improvement resulting from use of clearinghouses and central counter parties.  
# End of Day Settlement  

Central settling provides for end-of-day trade settlement of net funds with settling banks. Members of the clearinghouse designate their own settling banks, from which their settlement funds are disbursed and collected. In the U.S., the DTC and NSCC use the National Settlement Service (NSS) provided by the Federal Reserve System and the Fedwire system to settle DTC member funds accounts. Each day, the DTC posts final netnet figures for each clearinghouse member for securities and each settling bank for cash, with the designated settling banks using the NSS to transfer funds among the banks to settle their cash obligations and to directly post debits and credits to bank accounts (see Figure 3.1 ). Each settlement bank will then transfer funds accordingly to and from its own designated clearinghouse members.  

Investors can commit settlement violations if their new trades are not fully covered by settled funds, which include cash balances, incoming cash, available margin, and settled proceeds of fully paid-for securities. Traders should be sure to understand their broker’s policies concerning settlement violations such as purchasing a stock through a cash account without settled funds or sufficient settled funds, then selling that stock before paying for its purchase. While such transactions may well be permissible in a margin account with sufficient margin, it is likely that the trader’s broker will prohibit such transactions in a cash account.  

# Margin, Collateral, and Hypo the cation  

As discussed in Chapter 2, client account risk with brokers is reduced through the imposition of margin requirements on clients. Margin requirements are normally imposed on the purchase of equity and other securities with borrowed funds, short sales, positions in futures contracts, writing of options contracts, etc. These margin requirements are analogous to the posting of returnable collateral on open positions, ensuring that clients fulfill their trading obligations; that is, settlement risk in the market is mitigated through the imposition of margin or collateral requirements, sometimes known as  performance bonds . As discussed earlier, central counter parties (through novation) further reduce settlement risk by requiring collateral from their members, who are mostly brokers and dealers.  
Posted collateral in the clearinghouse default fund (also called the participants’ fund) for each member is a function of member trading activity, the volatility of member-traded securities, imbalances between member buying and selling, and the member’s financial condition. Posted collateral in the custody of the DTC is maintained by its Collateral Monitor, whereas the OCC in 2016 held approximately  $\S100$   billion in collateral posted by its members. If securities are used as collateral in default funds, the DTC will reduce their value as collateral relative to cash; that is, the securities are given a  haircut  (the difference between the market value of a security and its value as collateral).  

Most clearinghouses require of their members minimum collateral calculated on at least a daily basis. Similarly, brokers require a variation (maintenance or mark to market) margin of their clients, typically adjusted daily depending on the risks associated with the client accounts. In some scenarios, especially when markets are stressed, brokers and central counter parties will require  additional  margin from their clients or members to account for widening of spreads and reduced liquidity. Broker collateral with clearinghouses will be netted across client accounts and positions and will also vary daily. Both initial margin and variation margin amounts are determined by relevant clearinghouses, although brokers might impose more stringent requirements on clients, and these margin requirements can vary as market volatility changes.  

Whereas minimum margin requirements are often dictated by a relevant regulatory agency such as the Fed or CFTC, brokers, clearing firms, and clearinghouses are generally free to impose stricter requirements on their traders and members. Margin requirements will vary among brokers, instruments, etc., and will often be set based on the perceived risk of client accounts or clients themselves. Margin obligations for futures and options positions can be covered with cash and can sometimes be covered with other assets, contracts, or securities, such as government treasury instruments, bank guarantees, FX, CDs, and equities. Again, various clearinghouses and brokerage firms set their own rules for acceptance, subject to requirements imposed on them by higher authorities.  

A popular risk and margin calculation system used and adapted for use by many clearinghouses and clearing firms is the  Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk  ( SPAN ), created by the CME in 1988, particularly for use with futures and options portfolios. The older SPAN system was structured to analyze a grid or array comprised of 16 possible changes in market conditions within boundaries of the risk parameters set by the clearinghouse. The array was structured for use with an algorithm to calculate “scanning risk,” which is considered to be the worst possible loss scenario for the portfolio. This analysis is then used to set the margin requirement for the portfolio. The OCC developed a somewhat similar method, known as the  Customer Portfolio Margin System  (CPM), for a risk assessment and margin calculation system used with options portfolios, based largely on its older Theoretical Inter market Margining System (TIMS) structure. We will detail and discuss updates to the SPAN system later in Chapter 10.  

In general terms,  hypo the cation  is the pledge of assets as collateral for debt or other obligations, typically in scenarios involving mortgages, margin, short sales, and repo agreements. With respect to the hypo the cation of securities, the asset owner typically does not give up ownership rights such as voting in corporate affairs and dividend or interest payments unless the owner defaults on her obligations. For example, should the broker issue a margin call that the client fails to meet, the pledged assets can be seized and sold.  
Re hypo the cation  occurs when the securities broker re-uses assets pledged by a client as collateral as its own collateral; that is, the same asset is being used as collateral for both the client’s loan and the broker’s loan.  

# Delivery  

Only a small fraction of listed futures and options contracts involve physical delivery of assets or even cash delivery at settlement or expiry, because most positions are closed out earlier. Thus, netting ensures that no further obligations are outstanding on closed positions. Futures and options exchanges and clearinghouses establish rules and manage the processes for physical delivery of assets underlying contracts or cash delivery. Of course, major U.S. derivatives exchange clearinghouses serve as central counter parties. Thus, on settlement and exercise dates, they make appropriate delivery to clearing members and take delivery of assets as per settlement or exercise obligations. Netting operations significantly simplify delivery procedures. Contract specifications set forth delivery obligations, including the settlement figure for futures contracts, sometimes referred to as the  Exchange Delivery Settlement Price  (EDSP).  

When delivery procedures and policies are violated by clearing members, clearinghouses impose fines and other penalties, which can include trading suspensions and revocations of trading privileges, in addition to adverse publicity and other reputation al costs for the trading member. Similarly, clearing and brokerage firms penalize their clients who fail to make appropriate deliveries.  

# 3.5 OTHER FINANCIAL MARKET UTILITIES AND FUNCTIONS  

The financial market infrastructure consists of numerous types of utilities, including clearinghouses and clearing firms. In addition, clearinghouses and clearing firms perform additional functions on behalf of their members and the corporations they serve. We discuss some of these services and utilities below.  

# Dividends  

Stock value is primarily a function of dividends anticipated to be paid by the issuing firm, often on a quarterly basis. Ultimately, the prospect of payments made to shareholders of the firm are what attracts shareholder investment. A custody agent, often either a clearinghouse or a bank, facilitates this process for the dividend-paying corporation, collecting funds from the paying corporation and enabling the distribution of proceeds to shareholders of record. The process typically extends over several weeks, with four dates of particular importance. On an issuing firm’s dividend  declaration date , the company’s board announces that a dividend will be paid. The stock trades  cum  (with the)  dividend until the  ex-dividend date , typically a few weeks later, at which time it begins to trade without the dividend ( ex-dividend ), which is set by the exchange to fall two days before the  date of record  announced by the issuing firm’s board. The issuing firm actually makes the payment on the  dividend payment date  as announced by the board through a paying agent or bank, which then transfers most of the payment to the DTC’s affiliate Cede & Co. through Fedwire. Afterwards, the DTC distributes payments through its automated Dividend Service to appropriate members (brokerage firms, clearing firms, and banks), which then credit payments to their client accounts.  
Stock dividends allocated and dividend reinvestment plan allocations requested by issuing firms are simply reflected in clearinghouse member accounts. Clearinghouse members then allocate these dividends to their customer (beneficial owner) accounts.  

# Transfer Agents  

A  transfer agent  ( share registry  in the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand) is a third-party financial institution or individual that maintains records of ownership and transfers of shares and other securities issued by a publicly traded company.   Transfer agents might be trust companies, banks, or similar institutions that normally serve as paying agents of dividends, interest, and other disbursements to shareholders and other investors. Many transfer agents will handle company mailings to investors, deal with investor problems and issues, manage rights issues, reissue and cancel stock certificates (including certificates associated with stock splits), and tender offers, reorganizations, and bankruptcies as well as lost or stolen certificates. Many transfer agents will also manage dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), solicit proxies, and monitor corporate elections.  

# Debt Market Utilities  

The fixed income discussions in Chapter 2 focused primarily on debt instruments and primary debt markets, largely involving the Treasury Automated Auction Processing System (TAAPS) and corporate instruments, whereas in this subsection, we focus more on secondary markets. Secondary OTC U.S. Treasury markets are enormous, including  $\S14$  trillion outstanding in roughly 390 different instruments in 2018, with an average daily trading volume of  $\S530$   billion.  

U.S. regulations do not require Treasury security trades to be centrally cleared. In fact, most dealer-to-customer trades are normally cleared bilaterally, as are many dealer-todealer trades and trades by principal trading firms. Still, many dealer-to-dealer trades are executed through inter dealer brokers and cleared centrally, particularly if both traders are members of the relevant central clearinghouse, which is normally the Fixed Income Clearing Corp. (FICC), a unit of the DTCC. As is the case with other central clearing markets, such trades are netted and involve novation by FICC. Members of these clearinghouses meet stringent risk-management standards, fulfill capital requirements, and contribute to default funds. The FICC has two primary divisions—the Government Securities Division (GSD), which clears Treasury and government agency issues, repos, and reverse repo issues (more than   $\S1.4$   quadrillion total cleared in 2019), and the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (more than  $\S67$   trillion cleared in 2019). Clear stream clears and settles for a wide variety of European debt markets.  
Settlement in U.S. Treasury markets is typically   $_{\mathrm{T}+1}$   except for when-issued trades (trades executed before the instruments are issued) and a very small number of same-day cash settling trades. Treasury instrument trades can be executed by voice (phone) or electronically. Those executed by phone normally clear more slowly and are subject to more DKs (don’t knows).  

The NSCC clears and settles most U.S. transactions involving municipal and corporate debt instruments, whereas the DTC acts as the central securities depository for almost all municipal securities, even though this custody arrangement is not usually mandated. Corporate bonds are treated by the DTC in much the same underwriting manner as shares of stock. Interest payments are forwarded by issuing companies to paying agents or bond trustees, which pass those in the custody of Cede & Co. to the DTC; the DTC credits payments to member accounts (while forwarding payments to appropriate banks), which then allocate payments to client accounts (see  Morris & Goldstein [2010] ). The DTC also handles maturities of issues and call and conversion activation s, transferring funds and making appropriate account changes as well as bankruptcy and reorganization announcements along with appropriate payments and member account adjustments.  

# 3.6 SYSTEMIC ALLY IMPORTANT FINANCIAL MARKET UTILITIES  

The nature of business for clearinghouses requires that they match long positions in securities and instruments against short positions in the same instruments. Every buy is matched with a sale. Exact matching provides a substantial protection against clearinghouse risk. Further protection is provided by clearinghouse margin requirements, clearinghouse capital, and a mutual default fund contributed to by clearinghouse members. However, what if a counter party to a large transaction were to fail and be unable to fulfill its obligation to the clearinghouse? What if this obligation were long-term and allowed for substantial price volatility or movement before the settlement date of the instrument?  

A central counter party’s  default waterfall  stipulates the sequence of resources available to the central counter party or clearinghouse to protect the market and its participants from broker and clearing firm defaults.   If the defaulting trader’s or client’s margin is insufficient to enable its broker or clearing firm to cover the client’s obligations, the broker or clearing firm then draws on the account balance of its client. If the full balance of the defaulting client’s account is insufficient to cover the client’s obligations, the broker or clearing firm is still required to make good to the clearinghouse on these obligations. The next protection in the default waterfall is the defaulting trader’s broker or clearing firm margin with the clearinghouse, which can be seized to cover the default amount. If this member’s margin proves insufficient to cover the obligation, the clearinghouse withdraws funding from the defaulting (brokerage firm or clearing firm) member’s contributions to the clearinghouse’s default fund. Should these funds prove insufficient, the clearinghouse draws on its own capital in the fund, and if necessary and permitted by the clearinghouse rules, draws on the non defaulting clearinghouse members’ contributions to the clearinghouse’s default fund as well. Should all of these resources prove insufficient to cover default obligations, each clearinghouse will maintain a sequence of recovery tools, which might include assessments or additional contributions of assets by clearinghouse members, which stipulate how its members will cover all obligations.  
Fortunately, central counter party failures are rare; even clearing member defaults are unusual (see  McPartland and Lewis [2017] ). A major exception was the 1974 failure of the French Caisse de Liquidation, the result of unmet margin calls by commodity dealers and the clearinghouse’s failure to increase margin requirements. The Malaysian Kuala Lumpur Commodity Clearing House failed in 1983 for similar reasons. There have been several near failures, including the Hong Kong Futures Exchange, which was closed for 4 days in 1987 and required a government influx of cash. As we will discuss later, sometimes governments provide for bailouts of systemic ally important financial market utilities. All three of these central counter parties cleared long-term derivative contracts, which exposed them to additional risks. Both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Options Clearing Corporation experienced stress events due to unmet margin calls resulting from the 1987 stock market crash. Neither institution defaulted, but investors were concerned about their viability. The commodities default fund for the Swedish Nasdaq Clearing AB in 2018 was more than   $50\%$   depleted by the failure of a single trader to meet a margin call. Nevertheless, despite these exceptions over the years, clearinghouse and central counterparty arrangements have generally tended to withstand even severe crises.  

Financial market utilities are institutions that provide the essential infrastructure for transferring, clearing, and settling financial transactions. Many of these utilities also serve as central counter parties.  Systemic ally important financial market utilities  (SIMFUs) are U.S. financial market utilities that have been designated by the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (see Chapter 5) as being among those whose material financial distress or failure could pose a threat to the financial stability of the U.S. Title VIII of the DoddFrank Act of 2012 provided for the designation of both the Financial Stability Oversight Council and SIMFUs, and for potential access to emergency liquidity at the discretion of the Federal Reserve System.  

One important example of a SIMFU is the  Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), the largest private sector (it is owned by its member banks) clearing system in the world, clearing and settling more than  $\S1.8$   trillion daily. The failure or even disruption of CHIPS activity would have a devastating impact on the functioning of the U.S. financial system. The following institutions have received the SIMFU designation due to their critical roles in U.S. financial markets infrastructure:  

The Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS) CLS Bank International (provides settlement services in FX markets) The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME) ICE Clear Credit, LLC (clears credit default swaps) The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC – listed options and certain futures)  
The Depository Trust Corporation (DTC, a unit of DTCC) Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (a unit of DTCC) The National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC, a unit of DTCC)  

These SIMFUs face enhanced regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve System, the Securities Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. For example, the Division of Clearing and Risk of the CFTC oversees derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs), the clearing of swaps, futures, and options on futures, and market participants that may pose risk to the clearing process. Furthermore, SIMFUs face heightened standards for their boards of directors and heightened expectations for comprehensive risk management systems and liquidity maintenance along with detailed and viable plans for recovery and resolution.  

First, although rare, clearinghouses do fail. Should a SIMFU experience a stress event, a first step to recovery is normally to draw from the accounts of and to demand additional margin from members or specific members associated with the stress. The second line of defense might be the SIMFU’s own capital, followed by injections from the SIMFU’s mutual default fund, if such a fund is maintained. Most clearinghouses then provide for their members to inject additional capital as needed. Without detailed recovery and resolution plans, additional lines of defense or resolution, including potential government bailouts, tend to be rather ambiguous, even in the U.S.  

# Additional Reading  

Unpublished papers prepared by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (2020)  and  Jones (2018)  provide a substantial amount of detailed information on SIPs and the CTA along with the reporting data that they offer traders.  Jones (2018)  provides a wide-ranging discussion of securities market data itself as an essential product, sold by exchanges and other venues to financial institutions, media, and individuals in competitive markets. Costs and benefits of information to traders are discussed as well.  Loader (2020)  is an easy-to-follow and fairly comprehensive book providing useful discussions on securities clearing and settlement along with various clearinghouses and related institutions.  Morris and Goldstein (2010)  do not discuss clearing and settlement with as much detail as Loader, but their monograph offers an even more basic introduction to IPOs and other market issues. Their earlier book ( Morris & Goldstein, 2009 ) also provides a readable, basic introduction to clearing and settlement. A more technical discussion of clearing, margin calculations, and central counterparties, particularly in derivatives markets, is provided by  Gregory (2014) .

# 3.7 EXERCISES  

1.  Some stock brokerage firms have offered temporary “specials” where they don‘t earn commissions on stock trades and a few (e.g., Robinhood Financial, discussed in the chapter) have made zero stock trading commissions permanent part of their business model. In fact, most stock brokerage firms earn less than  $40\%$   of their revenue from commissions. How can such firms realize revenues from their clients or elsewhere if they don’t produce stock-trading commissions?

 2.  Congress and the SEC have attempted to enhance market competition among U.S. trading venues without intensifying the harmful effects of market fragmentation. What is market fragmentation, and what are its effects that might adversely affect securities markets? How might SIPs mitigate these adverse effects caused by multiple market venues?

 3.  The SIP evolved from the ticker tapes providing price and volume data from the exchanges. It is said that now, the SIP is far busier than it was more than a century ago when the ticker tapes were significant. Why is this?

 4.  Each stock trading venue provides quote and trade information to the SIP, which disseminates the information to the market. On which tape would the NBBO for shares of the Bats-traded Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) be reported? Why?

 5.  Describe how real-time clearing differs from batch processing. Why is netting less expensive than real-time processing?

 6.  Netting  and  novation  are important activities of most clearing firms. What is the difference between these two activities?

 7.  Support the argument that central counter parties (novation) in derivatives markets standardize credit risk for all traders.

 8.  The table below represents transactions executed during a given trading day in a given stock market:

a.  What is the net change of shareholding s in each of the broker accounts with DTC? b.  What is the net change of shareholding s in each of the client accounts with each broker? c.  What is the net change of the DTC’s cash account with each settling bank? d.  What is the net-net cash amount due or paid to the DTC?  

9.  Some observers suggest that real-time clearing   $(\mathrm{T}+0)$   would improve market efficiency relative to   $(\mathrm{T}+1)$   or   $(\mathrm{T}+2)$   clearing. a.  How would real-time clearing affect the netting process? b.  How would real-time failure affect the number of out-trades or DKs (don’t knows) in the clearing process?  

10.  During the winter of 2021, Robinhood Securities, a brokerage firm popular with retail investors, temporarily restricted trading certain highly volatile securities, including shares of GameStop. The DTCC had become concerned that Robinhood would be unable to fulfill its rapidly increasing collateral requirements. Why would Robinhood risk alienating its customers by restricting trading in GameStop and other securities experiencing such frenzied trading? What else might Robinhood have done to assure the DTCC that it would be able to fulfill its collateral requirements?  

11.  Long-term U.S. Treasury bonds are considered to be very high-quality investments with virtually zero default risk. Is it reasonable to assume that the risk of settling U.S. Treasury bonds is also of very low risk to the clearinghouse?
