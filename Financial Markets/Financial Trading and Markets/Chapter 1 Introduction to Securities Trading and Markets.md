# Introduction to Securities Trading and Markets  

# 1.1 TRADES, TRADERS, SECURITIES, AND MARKETS  

A  trade  is a security transaction that creates or alters a portfolio position based on an investment decision. The trade action and the trade decision follow the investing decision to buy, sell, or otherwise take a position in an asset or instrument. The trade decision concerns how to execute the investment decision, in which markets, at what prices and times and through which agents. Trade decisions are more concerned with the speed, costs, and risks associated with executing the transaction, while investing emphasizes selection of the security. The investment strategy is linked to the rationale to buy or to sell (e.g., to exploit under valuation). Investing is a positive sum game, allocating capital towards production and risk management. Trading is often a zero sum game, except to the extent that it facilitates investing, produces information, and improves markets by enhancing liquidity (ease of buying and selling securities) and reducing execution costs. While investing and trading activities might be distinguished from one another, there is a significant overlap between them, where high-turnover short-term investing, also referred to as trading, blurs the distinction between the two.  

Traders  compete to generate profits, seeking compatible counter parties in trade and seeking superior order placement and timing.  Proprietary traders  seek profits by trading on their own accounts while  agency traders  trade as commission brokers on behalf of clients. Most proprietary traders are  speculators  who focus on profits derived from price changes, arb it rage urs  who focus on price discrepancies, and  hedgers  who seek to control risk.  Dealers , who trade directly with clients, and  brokers , who seek trade counter parties for clients, facilitate the trading process. Brokers act as agents for investors, buying and selling for them on a commission or mark-up basis. Dealers maintain  quotes  ( bids , which are solicitations to purchase and  offers , which are solicitations to sell) and buy and sell on a profit basis. The typical quote specifies the security, the proposed transaction’s price, and the number of units to be exchanged at this price. The spread is simply the difference between the best offer and best bid.  Buy side traders  such as individual investors, mutual funds, and pension funds buy exchange or liquidity services. This means that buy side traders make investment decisions to take positions in securities and seek counter parties to buy from or sell to.  Sell side traders  such as day traders, market makers, and brokers provide liquidity and markets to buy side traders. Sell side traders stand by awaiting orders from buy side traders. One should not confuse buy side and sell side traders with buyers and sellers of securities; buy-side traders buy liquidity services and sell-side traders sell liquidity services. Regulatory definitions for traders will be discussed shortly.  
# Trading Illustration  

Consider a hypothetical scenario where an equities analyst working for the Flagellan Fund has recommended that the fund purchase shares of the General Engine Company. The fund’s portfolio manager agreed, and placed an order for 50,000 shares with the fund’s inhouse trader. The in-house trader decided to transact 10,000 shares herself, and placed buy orders of 20,000 shares each with two brokers, Kanteven-Fitzgerald and Themus Trading. Counter parties for the trades will be found in various trading venues, including exchanges and alternative trading systems. Flagellan is considered a buy side market participant, not because it is buying shares, but because it is buying liquidity. Its counter parties in trade will probably be a combination of buy side and sell side market participants.  

# Securities and Instruments  

The term “security” has several alternative definitions. In this text, we generally define a security to be a tradable claim on the assets of an institution or individual. Where real assets contribute to the productive capacity of the economy, securities are financial assets that merely represent claims on real assets. Many securities represent ownership (e.g., shares of stock) or creditor ship (e.g., bond) of an institution (e.g., corporation). Some instruments will represent obligations to buy or sell (e.g., futures contracts) or options to buy or sell. Most corporate securities imply either fixed claims (such as bonds that typically involve fixed interest and principal repayments) or residual claims (such as common stock, whose owners receive assets remaining after creditors’ and other claims have been satisfied). Most securities are marketable to the general public, meaning that they can be sold or assigned to other investors in the open marketplace.  

In a 1946 decision (SEC v. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293), the U.S. Supreme Court defined a security to be an investment contract based on the following four criteria, which are collectively referred to as the  Howey Test :  

1.  The involvement of an investment of money or other valued assets.

 2.  The formation of and investment into a common enterprise.

 3.  An expectation of profits from this investment.

 4.  The use of a third party to promote the offering.  

Some of the more common types of securities and tradable instruments are classified and briefly introduced in the following:  
1.  Debt securities : Denote creditor ship of an individual,   $\mathrm{form},$   or other institution. They typically involve payments of a fixed series of payments to interest or amounts towards principal along with principal repayment. Examples include:  

Bonds:  Long-term debt securities issued by corporations, governments, or other institutions. Treasury securities:  Debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury of the federal government.  

2.  Equity securities (stock):  Denote ownership in a business or corporation. They typically permit for dividend payments if the firm’s debt obligations have been satisfied. The two primary types of marketable equity issued by corporations are:  

Common stock:  Security held by the residual claimant or owner of the firm Preferred stock:  Stock that is given priority over common stock in the payment of dividends and liquidation; preferred stock holders must receive their dividends if common stock holders are to be paid dividends  

3.  Derivative securities:  Have payoff functions derived from the values of other securities, rates, or indices. Some of the more common derivative securities are:  

Options:  Securities that grant their owners rights to buy or sell an asset at a specific price on or before the expiration date of the security. Options on stock are among the 1 most frequently traded. The two types of stock options are :  

Call:  A security or contract granting its owner the right to purchase a given asset at a specified price on or before the expiration date of the contract Put:  A security or contract granting its owner the right to sell a given asset at a specified price on or before the expiration date of the contract  

Futures contracts:  Instruments that oblige their participants to either purchase or sell a given asset at a specified price on the future settlement date of that contract. We will discuss later the differences between futures and options contracts. Investors may take either a long or a short position in a futures contract. A  long  position obligates the investor to purchase the given asset on the settlement date of the contract and a short  position obligates the investor to sell the given asset on the settlement date of the contract.  

Swaps : Provide for the exchange of cash flows associated with one asset, rate, or index for the cash flows associated with another asset, rate, or index.  

4.  Commodities : Contracts, including futures and options on physical commodities such as oil, metals, corn, and so on. A commodity contract will be characterized by five features: the commodity (e.g., heating oil no. 2), the exchange on which the contract is traded (e.g., NYM for New York Mercantile Exchange), the size of the contract (e.g., 42,000 gallons), the settlement price per unit (e.g.,   $\S2.75$   per gallon), and the settlement date or delivery month (e.g., September 2010).  

5.  Currencies : For transactions to be executed between countries with different currencies, some type of foreign exchange (also called currency exchange, FOREX or FX) must take place. Foreign exchange is simply the trading of one currency for another. Exchange rates denote the number of units of one currency that must be given up for one unit of a second currency. Exchange transactions can occur in either  spot  or  forward  markets. In the spot market, the exchange of one currency for another occurs when the agreement is made. For example, dollars may be exchanged for euro now in an agreement made now. This would be a spot market transaction. In a forward market transaction, the actual exchange of one currency for another actually occurs at a date later than that of the agreement. Thus, traders could agree now on an exchange rate for two currencies at a later date. Spot and forward contract participants take one position in each of two currencies:  
a.  Long: An investor has a “long” position in the currency that he will accept at the later date. b.  Short: An investor has a “short” position in the currency that he must deliver in the exchange. Currency futures contracts are much like forward contracts, standardized to trade on exchanges with specified settlement prices, dates, and contract sizes. Futures contracts normally provide for margin and marking to the market.  Indices : Contracts pegged to measures of market performance such as the Dow Jones  

Industrials Average or the S&P 500 Index. These are frequently futures contracts on portfolios structured to perform exactly as the indices for which they are named. Index traders also trade options on these futures contracts.  

It is important to note that this list of security types is far from complete; it only reflects some of the instruments most frequently discussed in this book. In addition, most of the instrument types will have many different variations.  

Investors purchase securities for investment purposes. Their purchases may be motivated by profit motives or by risk management. As we discussed earlier, profits might be obtained through successful  speculating  (forecasting correctly the direction of security prices and payments associated with securities). Speculators are highly dependent on quality information. A second potential source of profits is  arbitrage , the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same or substantially similar asset at different prices. Arbitrage succeeds when the sum paid for purchased assets is less than the sales proceeds of sold assets. Arb it rage urs are highly dependent on low transaction costs and speed of trade execution. Profits can also be obtained through market making, that is, by providing liquidity while profiting from differences between bid and offer prices. Many investors will profit from all three types of trading motivations. Investors might also purchase securities to manage risk. For example, some securities serve as excellent hedges for others. Securities are purchased from selling  counter parties and the acquisition and liquidation processes are referred to as trading.  

We will regularly discuss margin in its various forms in later chapters. In brief, the term  margin  refers to funds posted at the initiation of an investment position by a trader to ensure the trader fulfills her trading obligations. Margin can also refer to borrowing money to invest in securities—that is, for example, to buy stock on margin.  

# 1.2 SECURITIES TRADING  

Trading occurs in securities markets, physical or virtual, where traders communicate with one another and execute transactions. The basic function of a market is to bring together buyers and sellers. Most markets also provide information in the price discovery process, and the information revealed in this process is a function of market structure. This book will focus on the process of trading and design of markets, and will discuss investing and certain investment decisions as well when appropriate.  
The first component of a trade involves the  acquisition of information  and quotes. Quality information and transparency are crucial to price discovery, the process by which the market discovers prices. Traders want to know prices at which they can buy (ask or offer prices) and sell (bid prices), along with the more recent prices of actual executions (e.g., last). Real-time and time-delayed quote and price services can be purchased from data vendors such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv Eikon, and Factset or obtained through a variety of broker, media and other sources.   Transparent  markets disseminate high-quality information quickly to the public. Generally, markets that communicate real-time bids, offers, and executed trade information are more transparent than dealer markets that do not.  Opaque markets  are those that lack transparency.  

The second component of the trade is the  routing  of the trade order. Routing involves selecting the broker(s) to handle the trade(s), deciding which market(s) will execute the trade(s) and transmitting the trade(s) to the market(s). An individual investor might route her trade through her broker who might route it to a major exchange. The third component of the trade is its  execution , when the security is actually bought or sold. Buys are matched and executed against sells according to the rules of that market. Rules might provide for electronic execution, telephone execution, or direct human (face-to-face) execution. Finally, the fourth component of the trade is its  confirmation ,  clearance , and  settlement . Clearance is the recording and comparison of the trade records, and settlement involves the actual delivery of the security and its payment.  Trade allocation  might also be a part of this final process, as large institutional orders involving many clients and many transactions are allocated to various clients. Settlement is the actual transfer of securities and payments.  

# Algorithmic Trading: A Brief Introduction  

Large orders move markets. For example, a large buy order increases security prices, which, obviously, is not good for the buyer placing the order. Typical transaction sizes in many markets such as the NYSE used to be very small relative to the order sizes placed by institutional traders. This meant that large institutional trades could have a significant and unwanted impact on execution prices unless larger orders were broken into smaller orders, to disguise them as uninformed small investor orders.  Algorithmic trading  refers to automated trading with the use of computer programs for automatically submitting and allocating trade orders among markets and brokers as well as over time so as to minimize the price impact of large trades. Many institutional and agency traders employ algorithmic trading (also called automated trading, black box trading, and rob o trading) to break up large orders into smaller orders to reduce execution risk, preserve anonymity, and minimize the price impact of a trade. Significant portions of these orders might be withheld from public display to minimize their price impact in the market. The hidden portions of these large institutional orders are sometimes referred to as  dark liquidity pools  because they are hidden from the public. Orders are often partially revealed, in which case they are called  iceberg  or hidden-size  orders, with brokers instructed not to reveal the full size of the order. Rooted in program trading (defined by the NYSE as computer-initiated trades involving 15 or more stocks with value totaling more than  $\S1$   million) dating back to the 1980s, algorithmic trading accounts for between  $30\%$   and  $80\%$   of trade volume in many markets.  
Strategies used by algorithms vary widely. Generally, algorithmic trading results from mathematical models that analyze every quote and trade in the relevant market, identify liquidity opportunities, and use this information to make intelligent trading decisions. Some algorithmic trading models seek to trade at or better than the average price over a day (e.g., volume weighted average price—VWAP, pronounced Vee-whap) and others seek to execute slowly so as to have minimal price impact. Algorithms sometimes are set to produce more volume at market opens and closes when trading volume is high, and less during slower periods such as around lunch. They can seek to exploit any arbitrage opportunities or price spreads between correlated securities. In addition, algorithmic trading can also account and adjust for trading costs such as commissions and taxes as well as regulatory issues such as those associated with short selling (borrowing stock, then selling it). However, algorithmic trading does have risks, such as leaks that might arise from competitor efforts to reverse engineer them. Many algorithms lack the capacity to handle or respond to exceptional or rare events. This can make algorithmic trading very risky. In addition, any malfunction, including a simple lapse in communication lines, can cause the system to fail. Thus, careful human supervision of algorithmic trading and other safeguards are crucial.  

While algorithmic trading traditionally refers to the trade slicing and execution methods discussed above, the term is sometimes used in a more general sense to include “alpha models,” which are used to make trade decisions to generate trading profits or control risk. Thus, more generally, algorithmic trading could be defined as trading based on the use of computer programs and sophisticated trading analytics to execute orders according to predefined strategies. Thus, algorithmic trading can be generalized to include program trading as defined by the NYSE earlier in this section. Regardless, algorithmic trading is highly dependent on the most sophisticated technology and analytics.  

# 1.3 BARGAINING  

One of the most important aspects of the trading process is to arrive at a price agreeable to all parties of the trade.  Bargaining  is the negotiation process over contract terms that occurs between a single buyer and a single seller for a single transaction. The negotiation can be over price, quantity, security attributes, or any other factor important to one or both counter parties. More generally, bargaining occurs when two or more economic agents have in common an interest to cooperate, but have conflicting interests over the details of cooperation. Bargaining is the process used by agents to seek an agreement.  

Bargaining is useful in the trading of securities when transaction sizes are large enough for the benefits of negotiation to exceed the costs of negotiation. Bargaining on prices occurs between floor brokers on the NYSE when the transaction size is large enough to justify the cost of personal interaction.  Liquidnet , an “upstairs” market that matches institutional buyers and sellers of large blocks of equity securities and other instruments, enables institutions to directly bargain and trade confidentially with one another. Liquidnet provides an electronic format for this negotiation process. Traders use the system by entering symbols for securities that they wish to buy or sell. If Liquidnet sees a potential match, it notifies the counter parties, who bargain anonymously with each other in a virtual meeting room using the Liquidnet system. In an effort to protect trader confidentiality, Liquidnet rates traders with respect to the likelihood that they will actually execute transactions that Liquidnet arranges. Traders seeking to avoid front-running and quote-matching can request that trade information be hidden from other traders who are deemed unlikely to actually successfully negotiate transactions.   When matched, trade counter parties negotiate directly with each other the terms of their trade. Counter parties will know prices from other markets, leaving relatively little room for significant pricing disagreements. If they come to terms, they report the transaction to Liquidnet, which arranges the transfer and takes a commission on each share. In January 2017, Liquidnet claimed that the average size of its institutional orders was approximately 42,000 shares, compared to average order sizes of less than 300 shares in the NYSE and NASDAQ markets. In the NYSE and NASDAQ markets, institutions seek to execute large orders with small counter parties, requiring them to break up orders and work them over time. It is very difficult for institutions to disguise their intents with respect to order directions and sizes, placing them at obvious disadvantage in the trading arena. Obviously, trading against smaller orders is not the most effective means of satisfying institutional liquidity needs. Bargaining is often an expensive means to discover a price, but its costs may be less than its benefits for large transactions.  
Bargaining power is the relative ability of one competitor to exert influence over another. In a trading scenario, bargaining power typically reflects one trader’s ability to influence the transaction price. Relative bargaining power among traders is typically a product of the following:  

•  Patience and liquidity, which increases bargaining power

 •  Risk aversion, which reduces bargaining power

 •  Credible alternatives and options that enhance bargaining power

 •  The cost of backing down, which decreases bargaining power

 •  Superior information, which increases bargaining power

 •  Reputation with respect to strength, staying power, and resolve, all of which enhance bargaining power  

# 1.4 AUCTIONS  

An  auction  is a competitive market process involving multiple buyers, multiple sellers, or both. An auction is the process of trading a security through bidding, and then placing it to the winning bidder.   Vickrey (1961)  demonstrated that optimal bids are increasing in bidders’ values; therefore, the auctioned object will be won by the bidder who values it the most. Auctions are a useful and cost-effective method for pricing a security with an unknown value. That is, auctions are useful price discovery processes.  
A  Walrasian auction  is a simultaneous auction where each buyer submits to the auctioneer his demand and each seller submits her supply for a given security at every possible price. Theoretically, the Walrasian auctioneer conducts a series of preliminary auctions called  ta tonne ment  to determine supply and demand levels at various prices. In the actual auction, supply is balanced against demand meaning that the resulting transaction price is set so that the total demand from all buyers equals the total supply from all sellers. Thus, the Walrasian auction finds the clearing price that perfectly matches the supply and the demand. While the Walrasian auction has been used primarily as a theoretical construct, it does closely resemble certain financial auctions, such as that conducted in the London Bullion Market Association fixing process.   In this market, five representatives of firms would meet twice each day at the offices of N.M. Rothschild where the chairman called out prices so that firm representatives could announce their levels of supply and demand at announced prices. Until the imbalance between supply and demand cleared, new prices were announced. Many markets use similar procedures to open trading for the day.  

An  English auction  or ascending bid auction, used by the English art and antique auctioneers, is typically employed to sell automobiles, farm equipment, and animals as well as art. English auction participants bid openly against one another, with each successive bid higher than the previous one. Because the auction is open and involves public sequences of bids, it provides for some degree of price discovery before it concludes. The auction ends and a “winner” is declared when no participant is willing to bid higher.  

The traditional  Dutch auction  or descending bid auction, used in the 17th-century Dutch tulip bulb auctions, begins with the auctioneer calling out a high offer price, which is reduced until some participant submits the first and highest bid, crying out “mine.” The “winner” pays that price. Thus, the Dutch auction does reveal some information concerning a price ceiling on the auctioned object. The Dutch auction is particularly useful for matching a number of identical goods to an equal number of highest bidders. Consider the following example involving a Dutch auction of   $\S20$   billion in 91-day U.S. T-Bills, where the bids (based on yields to maturity) by financial institutions are given in  Table 1.1 .  

Obviously, the Treasury wants to sell as many bills as possible at the highest possible prices. This results in the lowest yields. The bid-to-cover ratio in this illustration is  $\S31.5$   billion/  $'\!\Phi\!20$   billion  $=1.525$  . This means that  $\S11.5$   billion in bids will not be successful. Bids will be satisfied from the lowest yield (highest price) until   $\S20$   billion in bills have been allocated. The stop-out price will be at a yield of   $3.35\%$   and all winners (Citigroup, Wells Fargo, UBS, Deutsche Bank, and JP Morgan Chase) will pay this same  
TABLE 1.1 Treasury Bids Illustration

price. Actually, JP Morgan Chase will be allocated only   $\S0.5$   billion, because its bid filled the  $\S20$   billion total being offered.  

In the Yankee variation of the Dutch auction, all successful bidders would pay the prices that they bid. While the Yankee variation has the potential to deliver a higher total sales volume, it might discourage bidders from bidding aggressively. See the “winner’s curse” below.  

Another variant of the Dutch auction was used by Filene’s, a department store that was based in Boston. In the store’s basement were marked-down goods, each with a price and date attached. The price paid at the register was the price on the tag minus a discount that depended on how much time elapsed since the item was tagged. The longer the item remained unsold on the shelf, the more its price was reduced.  

First-price sealed-bid  auctions have all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids so that no bidder knows any of the other bids. The first-price sealed-bid auction does not allow for price discovery until the auction concludes. The winner submits the highest bid and pays the bid price. The winner of a bidding contest in these three auction structures faces the “ winner’s curse ” problem if the auctioned item’s value is not known with certainty. All bidders’ bids are subject to value estimation error. The winner bids the most, and is the most likely to have bid too much for the auctioned object.  

The  second-price sealed-bid auction  (Vickrey auction) is identical to the first-price sealedbid auction, except that the winner pays the highest losing bid rather than his own winning bid. The motivation for the Vickrey auction is to encourage higher bids, in part, by reducing the winner’s curse. In a second-price auction, bidders bid more aggressively because a bid raises the probability of winning without increasing the expected cost, which is determined by someone else’s bid. A variation of the Vickery auction is used in the Federal Reserve Bank Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) markets (we will discuss agency instruments in the next chapter).  

Double auctions  or  bilateral auctions  are used for the trading of most publicly traded securities in secondary markets (after markets). In double auctions, buyers submit  bids (maximum purchase prices) and sellers submit offers (minimum selling prices; also called asks) that are ranked from best to worst. These bids and offers create demand and supply profiles for the market. Transactions occur when the highest bid and lowest offer match. A  continuous double auction , such as that on the New York Stock Exchange, allows for many transactions on an ongoing basis as the security is continuously being auctioned.  
# Auction Outcomes  

The type of auction structure selected in a market can have a significant impact on submitted bids, winners, final prices, revenues realized by sellers, and information realized in the auction process. However, the  revenue equivalence theorem , perhaps the most significant result from the game theory of auctions, states just the opposite. The revenue equivalence theorem holds that, under specific restrictions, the auction type (from the listing above) will not affect the auction outcomes. Consider, for example, an environment with perfect and complete information, where all risk-neutral bidders know the values that all bidders place on the object to be auctioned. In this environment, the winner of a first-price sealedbid auction with infinitesimal bidding increments is the participant who most highly values the auctioned object. The winner will pay a price equal to the highest price submitted by the auction losers. Note that this auction outcome is identical to the second-price sealed-bid auction. In addition, the English and Dutch auctions produce the same outcome in the perfect and complete information scenarios. The key to reconciling this conflict is that the revenue equivalence theorem is based on assumptions of perfect and complete information, with risk-neutral bidders and infinitesimal bid increments. Thus, the analysis of auction type should focus on the nature of violations of these assumptions. Actually, perfect and complete information is not a necessary assumption; it is sufficient that each bidder’s value be independent and randomly drawn from a common distribution.  

While the revenue equivalence theorem states that under restrictive circumstances, the auction structure will not affect revenue, experimental, statistical, and other evidence suggests otherwise. For example, evidence suggests that there is more over bidding in secondprice auctions than in standard English auctions (e.g., see  Kagel, Harstad, & Levin, 1987 ). Thus, one needs to pay close attention to how deviation from revenue equivalence theorem assumptions affects auction outcomes.  

# Common Value Auctions  

6   A  common value auction occurs when all bidders place the same value on the item to be auctioned, and that value is known with certainty. Consider the following auction example with three bidders such that each has the opportunity to bid on some random amount of cash between zero and  $\S1$  . Suppose that every monetary value between 0 and  $\S1$   is equally likely, such that    $E[V]=\S0.50$  . Since each bidder has equal access to information, we will refer to this structure as a  symmetric information structure  problem. Without any additional information, risk-neutral bidders might value the random sum of cash as highly as  $\S0.50_{.}$  ; risk-averse bidders will value the random sum less than  $\S0.50$  . Thus, we see here that risk aversion will affect valuation of an object of unknown value. Therefore, risk aversion will affect bids and the revenue equivalence theorem will no longer apply. In addition, the revenue equivalence theorem no longer applies because bids will not only be a function of expected value, they will also depend on information revealed in the bidding process.  
Now, suppose that each of the three bidders will obtain a noisy signal,    $s_{1},\,s_{2},$   and  $s_{3}\!\in\!(0,\,1)$  , concerning the value of the bundle of cash such that the mean of the signal amounts equal the value of the bundle:   $(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})/3=V$  . Now, suppose that Bidder 1’s signal is  $s_{1}=0.80$  . Then, his estimate of the value of the bundle is    $E[V_{1}\,|\,s_{1}=0.80]$  . If Bidder 1 is risk neutral,   $\S0.80$   is the value that he attributes to the bundle. But, does this mean that Bidder 1 will bid   $\S0.80$   for the bundle?  

First, recall the  winner’s curse  problem raised earlier. If Bidder 1 wins the auction by bidding  $\S0.80_{.}$  , this will mean that the other bidders received lower value signals than Bidder 1, indicating that   $\S0.80_{.}$  , the signal received by Bidder 1, certainly exceeded the bundle value. Thus, winning the auction is a negative signal (ex-post) as to the value of the bundle. If Bidder 1 wins the auction by bidding  $\S0.80_{,}$  , he will have overbid and will suffer from the winner’s curse. This means that, from the perspective of Bidder 1 if he wins, the distribution of bundle value must range from 0 to 0.80 rather than from 0 to 1.00. This is because if Bidder 1 makes the highest bid, it is because his signal was higher than those of his competitors. Thus, the high end of his valuation range will be   $\S0.80$  . This means that the anticipated mean signal values received by other bidders should be   $\S0.40$  , since their valuation ranges will be from 0 to   $\S0.80$  , given that Bidder 1 will submit the highest bid. Thus, based on this information, Bidder 1 should revise his bid for the bundle to  $[B_{1}\,|\,s_{1}=0.80]=(\S0.80+\S0.40+\S0.40)/3=\S0.5333.$  .  

All four auction designs will place the bundle with the same winner. However, let us consider Bidder 1 bidding strategies under different auction structures. In a second-price sealed-bid auction,  $\S0.5333$   is an appropriate bid because there is no information revealed in the auction process. In a first-price sealed-bid auction, Bidder 1 should bid less than  $\S0.5333$  . This is also true in the Dutch auction. However, additional information is revealed in the bidding process in the English auction, and this information serves to reduce the winner’s curse. This information should be used in forming the bidding strategy. Generally speaking, with more than two bidders, the highest bid or revenue realized in the English auction will be greater than or equal to that in the second-price sealed-bid auction, which will be greater than or equal to that in the Dutch auction, which will equal that obtained in the first-price sealed-bid auction. However, English auctions are often more vulnerable to manipulation by shills.  Klemperer (1999, 2002)  provide a good review of results in auction theory.  

# Google’s Dutch Auction Format  

Google, in its widely publicized  $2004~\mathrm{IPO},$  , structured a Dutch auction process intending to sell 25.8 million shares of its stock, suggesting bids in the range of  $\S108$   to  $\S135$   per share. This Dutch auction searched bids for a clearing price that enabled it to finally sell 19.6 million shares at the IPO price of  $\S85_{.}$  , thereby raising  $\S1.67$   billion. The first trade price was   $\S100.01\$  , rising to over  $\S300$   within a year and over   $\S500$   within three years. Lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston, collected a   $3\%$   commission on the offering rather than the standard  $7\%$   fee. Some observers opined that, if successful, the Google IPO could lead to a transfer of power and fees away from underwriters in favor if issuing firms. However, it is not clear just how successful the IPO was. The IPO price was not as high as anticipated or nearly as high as subsequent trading prices. A later follow-on offering was priced at   $\S295$   per share, raising  $\S4.18$   billion. On the other hand, the IPO created substantial favorable publicity for the firm and raised fortunes for its owners.  
# 1.5 INTRODUCTION TO MARKET MICRO STRUCTURE  

Investors participate in the markets for information, the markets for securities, and the markets for transaction services ( Stoll, 2003 ).  Market micro structure  is concerned with the markets for transaction services. Market micro structure is the area of financial economics that concerns trading and market structure, market rules and fairness, success and failure, and how the design of the market affects the exchange of assets, price formation, and price discovery. Market micro structure is concerned with costs of providing transaction services along with the impact of transactions costs on the short-run behavior of securities prices (see  Stoll, 2003 ). The market structure is the physical (or virtual) composition of the market along with its information systems and trading rules. Market micro structure examines  latency , the amount of time that elapses between when a quote or an order is placed by a trader and when that order is actually visible to the market. Micro structure also concerns transactions costs and the impact of transactions costs on the behavior of securities prices. Transactions costs are often reflected in bid-ask spreads, security price mark-ups, and in commissions paid to brokers. Generally, the best market is that which has the lowest transactions costs, facilitates the fastest trades, results in the fairest prices, disseminates price information most efficiently, and provides for the greatest liquidity. A market is said to be liquid when prospective purchasers and sellers can transact on a timely basis with little cost or adverse price impact.  

The basic components of a securities market are investors, brokers and dealers who make markets and facilitate trading, and the market facility, physical and virtual, within which trading takes place. Investors include individuals and institutions. Some market participants are price takers (typically individual investors and institutions that invest for the longer term) and others are price seekers (day traders and market makers). Brokers act as agents, processing trades on behalf of client accounts on a commission basis. Upstairs brokers deal directly with investors, and downstairs brokers execute transactions on trading floors. Dealers trade on their own accounts to secure trading profits.  

# Market Execution Structures  

Securities markets are categorized by their  execution systems , that is, their procedures for matching buyers to sellers. The primary execution systems are  quote-driven markets  where dealers post quotes and participate on at least one side of every trade,  order-driven markets where traders can trade without the inter mediation of dealers,  brokered markets  where many blocks (10,000 or more shares, as defined by the NYSE or   $25\%$   of daily volume elsewhere) are broker negotiated, and  hybrid markets . Most over-the-counter (OTC) currency and bond markets are primarily quote driven, and most stock exchange, futures, and options exchanges are primarily order driven. Quote-driven markets display quotations of specialists and market makers while order-driven markets display all quotes. In a pure quote market, dealer spreads are the source of market maker profits, whereas in a pure quote market, there are no dealers.  
Actually, to some extent, most markets are hybrids. For example, the NYSE uses designated market makers (formerly specialists) who can act as dealers on transactions and brokers may execute block transactions on exchanges. Stock markets around the world, with the most prominent exception being the OTC markets in the United States, are more likely to be order driven. This is because such markets require less human intervention, and tend to be cheaper to run. However, the lack of a dealer book, improved transparency, and dealer quotes tend to reduce liquidity in such markets, and may drive orders away from them to quote-driven markets.  

# Continuous and Call Markets  

Should markets facilitate trading anytime they are open or is it more important to allow orders to accumulate for more competitive order matching? Continuous markets allow for orders to be executed whenever the market is open, whereas call markets allow for trading of securities only at predetermined times or intervals during the trading day. Continuous markets allow for an order execution whenever a bid and offer match or  cross  (higher bid than offer) one another during the trading day. During the course of a trading day, the NYSE and Nasdaq typically act as continuous markets as order matching engines match buy and sell orders against one another. Continuous markets provide for  immediacy , enabling orders to be executed quickly whenever markets are open.  

However, in a call market, orders for a given security are  batched  for simultaneous execution when the market is called, and for those orders to be matched by a certain set of rules or algorithm for execution. Orders to buy and orders to sell a particular security accumulate in the market until the start of the trading session, at which time, orders are matched and securities are traded. The market maker or specialist, if one or more exist in the market, seeks to find a market clearing price by matching buy orders against sell orders so as to minimize the order imbalance. The NYSE and Nasdaq function more like a call market during daily market openings in which purchase and sell orders are batched and matched for market clearing, facilitating price discovery after a period of nontrading. Crossing networks, which can be particularly appealing to investors placing infrequent large orders, also function as call markets, generally with prices calculated from those in other markets.  

Both continuous and call markets have long histories and clear relative advantages. Advantages of a continuous market include:  

•  Continuous markets provide liquidity for investors who wish to trade outside of the called trading sessions.

 •  Continuous markets allow for frequent trading that can allow for continuous price discovery.  
•  Continuous markets allow for simultaneous trades in different trading venues.

 •  Continuous markets post bid and offer quotes on a continuous basis, improving price  

certainty for investors seeking to trade. Advantages of a call market include:

 •  Liquidity is enhanced in call markets during trading sessions due to the accumulation of orders for a security along with the investor focus on that given security at the time of the auction.

 •  Call markets can improve liquidity for less active markets such as those for less liquid stocks or during less active periods such as after the closing of normal trading activity.

 •  Large orders experience less  market impact  (price increases due to excess demand or price decreases due to excess supply) in call markets due to the accumulation and potential balancing of orders prior to the market session.

 •  Call markets do not require that trading apparatus be available to all securities during the course of the trading day as do continuous markets.

 •  Call markets diminish the speed advantages of participants with speed or other technological advantages such as high frequency traders.

 •  If trading sessions are relatively frequent, price discovery can be more effective in a call market as only a single equilibrium price results from the auction.

 •  In a call market, prices need not be affected by the sequence in which orders arrive.  

# 1.6 ORDERS, LIQUIDITY AND DEPTH  

Orders  are specific trade instructions placed with brokers by traders without direct access to trading arenas. The typical brokerage will accept and place a number of types of orders for clients. In fact, the various exchanges and alternative trading systems in the U.S. will accept over a hundred different types of orders, not counting permutations of the basic types. These order types include some specifically designed for high frequency traders (HFT), others specifically designed to protect against HFT strategies, orders designed to be executed at market opens and closes, and others intended to control which market will be used for execution. Among the more common types of orders are the following:  

•  Market order : Here, the broker is instructed to execute the order at the best price available in the market.

 •  Limit order : An upper price limit is placed for a buy order; the broker will not buy at a price above this limit. A lower price limit is placed for a sell order.

 •  Stop order : Here, the broker is instructed to place the buy order once the price has risen above a given level; in the case of the stop-sell (or stop-loss) order, the broker sells once the price of the security has fallen beneath a given level. Stop-loss orders are often intended to protect against stock price declines.

 •  Day order : If not executed by the end of the day, this order is canceled.

 •  Good till canceled order : This order is good until canceled.

 •  Not held order:  Here, the broker is not obliged to execute while he is attempting to obtain a better price for his client.  
•  Fill or kill order:  This order must be filled in its entirety immediately, or it is canceled.

 •  Immediate or cancel order:  This order is immediately executed to the extent possible; unexecuted amounts are canceled.

 •  Market-on-close (MOC) order:  This order must execute at the market’s end-of-day closing auction, irrespective of price.

 •  Limit-on-close (LOC) order:  This order must execute at the daily closing auction only if the closing price is at least as good as the limit price set by the client.  

This list of order types is far from complete and some brokers and exchanges will not accept all of these types of orders. Order types are not mutually exclusive; for example, a good-till-canceled, limit buy order is a legitimate order type as is a stop limit sell order. The stop limit sell order authorizes the broker to initiate the sell order once its price drops to the stop trigger, but only if the limit price can be realized for the sale.  

# Liquidity  

Liquidity  refers to an asset’s ability to be easily purchased or sold without causing significant change in the price of the asset. Liquid assets can be traded quickly, with low transactions costs, at any time and with little impact on the asset’s price. Markets with large numbers of active participants and few constraints on trade are more likely to have greater liquidity. Bid  offer spreads are generally considered to be quick indicators of liquidity, with narrow spreads suggesting that price impacts of trading will not be severe. Black (1971)  described liquidity as follows:  

1.  There are always bid and asked prices for the investor who wants to buy or sell small amounts of stock immediately.

 2.  The difference between the bid and asked prices (the spread) is always small.

 3.  An investor who is buying or selling a large amount of stock, in the absence of special information, can expect to do so over a long period of time at a price not very different, on average, from the current market price.

 4.  An investor can buy or sell a large block of stock immediately, but at a premium or discount that depends on the size of the block.

 5.  The larger the block, the larger the premium or discount. In other words, a liquid market is a continuous market, in the sense that almost any amount of stock can be bought or sold immediately, and an efficient market, in the sense that small amounts of stock can always be bought and sold very near the current market price, and in the sense that large amounts can be bought or sold over long periods of time at prices that, on average, are very near the current market price.  

Kyle (1985)  characterized three dimensions of liquidity. The first is  width  (also known as tightness), which is simply the bid  offer spread. The second is  market depth , which refers to a market’s ability to process and execute a large order without substantially impacting its price. The third dimension of liquidity is  slippage  (also known as market impact, price impact, or market resilience), which indicates the speed with which the price pressure resulting from a non informative trade execution is dissipated (the price returns to normal).  
TABLE 1.2 Market Depth 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e7ea8e7931943dfcef385ba42bcd4304a6736aac04118294f7a180c5f6d095de.jpg)  

Normally, markets with larger numbers of active participants have more depth than thin markets. Suppose, for example, that there are two competing markets for Stock X with the  $X$  following offer prices (central limit order book) for Stock  as depicted in  Table 1.2 . Suppose that the last transaction for Company  $X$   stock was at a price of  $\S50.00$  . Further suppose that an investor places a market order to buy 5000 shares of Company X stock. In Market A, the investor will obtain 1000 shares for   $\S50.00,$  , 2000 for   $\S50.03,$  , 1000 for   $\S50.05,$   and 1000 for

  $\S50.06$  . The final price rises to   $\S50.06$  . In Market B, the investor will obtain 2000 shares for

  $\S50.00.$  , 1000 for   $\S50.01$  , and 2000 for  $\S50.03$  . The final price in Market B rises to   $\S50.03.$  , less than Market A. Thus, Market B has more depth than Market A, at least with respect to the stated demand for the stock. We will focus more on liquidity in Chapters 4 and 6.  

# Order Precedence Rules  

The typical double auction will have many bids and ask prices for a given security at any point in time. Whose quotations will be the next to be executed or will have priority in the next transaction?  Order precedence rules  concern which traders can place bids and offer quotations with greatest priority for execution and which can accept the quotations of other traders. In almost all cases, the primary precedence is  price priority . The participant with the highest bid or lowest ask has priority on an execution. However, there will be many instances where multiple traders have made quotations at the same price. Which quotations receive secondary priority? Some markets give priority to the first trader to make that particular quotation if that quote improved the previous best quote. This is called  time priority . The trader who last improved the price is normally the first to post a quote at the current best price. Time priority is intended to encourage traders to aggressively improve their quotations and is most effective when the tick size (minimum increment for quote differences) is larger. However, some markets will provide for public order precedence, meaning that orders placed by the general public will have priority over otherwise competing orders placed by exchange members. These public precedence rules are intended to enhance the credibility and perceived fairness of markets in the eyes of the general public.  
Even price priority can be violated when a security trades in multiple markets. For example, consider the scenario where the best bids on a stock are  $\S49.95$   for 100 shares and  $\S49.94\$  in another market for 1000. A prospective seller wishes to sell 1000 shares. In some instances, under “best execution” rules (discussed in Chapters 4 and 5), rather than break up the 1000 sell order, the broker will  trade through  the  $\S49.95$   order in one market, executing the entire transaction for 1000 shares at  $\S49.94\$   in the second market.   In most instances, this cannot be accomplished legally in a single exchange market. Sometimes time or even price priorities are violated when a broker routes an order to a market in exchange for  payment for order flow . In this scenario, the broker might receive a payment from a satellite market or market maker such as Citadel Securities for routing the transaction to it rather than to the principal market for the security. We will discuss payment for order flow in more detail later in this chapter and in Chapters 2  5 and 13.  

Unlike most other exchanges, the NYSE employs a model of precedence known as  parity and priority , in which price priority is still the primary rule when executing multiple orders. However, with multiple quotes at the same price, time priority no longer takes secondary precedence for execution. Instead, orders at the same price are allocated against a sufficiently large counter party trade with the original setter of the best quote being first allocated   $15\%$   (rounded to the nearest round lot) of the execution, then all orders except those in the Electronic Book (off-floor orders from the public), if shares remain to be traded, including those from the original price setter (even if in the Electronic Book), the DMM, and floor brokers participating on a parity (equal) basis for their displayed orders. After these member orders are executed, orders remaining in the Electronic Book are executed once the original price setter order is fulfilled or cancelled. Small and discretionary orders do complicate the priority model somewhat.  

Whereas time priority rewards faster traders with execution priority, the NYSE claims to level the playing field by allowing for more sharing of executions. This may serve to improve execution fill rates and reduce transactions costs for retail traders, encouraging broader market participation. These claims might be somewhat controversial (see, for example,  Battalio, Jennings, and McDonald [2021] ), and the NYSE priority rules might increase trading costs to the general public, partly because of the priority advantage enjoyed by floor brokers over the Electronic Book (which includes retail investors) and partly because most retail trades route to markets other than the NYSE.  

# 1.7 DAY TRADING  

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines day traders to be individuals who have all of the following three characteristics: (1) The trader maintains substantial trading activity. The trader buys and sells frequently (10 to 20 daily trades should be sufficient) and trading is a primary source of income for the trader. (2) The trader’s trading activity is sustained on a regular and continued (one year minimum) basis. (3) The trader seeks to profit from short-term stock price fluctuations rather than dividends, capital appreciation, and interest.  
The day trader should complete a year in advance IRS Form 3115 Application for a Change of Accounting Method.   This is crucial to avoid difficulties with the wash sale rule. The purpose for completing this form is to seek permission to use the mark-tomarket accounting technique. In addition, this designation will strengthen the trader’s argument that she is a for-profit day trader, allowing for better expense deduction possibilities, such as departing from the   $2\%$   miscellaneous threshold and the at-risk rules. In addition, at-home day traders should consider whether they qualify for home office and other depreciation deductions.  

FINRA (the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; formerly NASD, the National Association of Securities Dealers), based on its Rule 2520, defines the day trader somewhat differently. Anyone who executes buy and sell transactions on the same margin account on the same day is said to be day trading. A  pattern day trader  executes four or more of these round-trip transactions within five consecutive business days.   Pattern day traders are required to maintain only   $25\%$   margin requirements rather than the  $50\%$   maintained by other non institutional traders. Rule 2520 requires maintenance of  $\S25{,}000$   of equity in the margin account to take advantage of this exception, but the pattern day trader can margin this account by four times, rather than the usual two times based on the   $50\%$   rule for other individual investors.  

For other individual investors, Federal Reserve Board (FED) Regulation T requires   $50\%$  initial margin along with  $25\%$   maintenance margin. Thus, such an investor would have to put up  $\S5000$   in cash to purchase  $\mathbb{S}10{,}000$   in shares. This would give the investor  $\S5000$   in equity position in the shares, or a   $50\%$   initial margin. However, if the value of the shares were to drop to  $\S6000$  , the investor’s equity would drop to  $\S1000.$  , or to   $16.67\%$   of the current investment   $(1000/6000)$  , well below the   $25\%$   maintenance margin. The broker would then need to require the investor to post an additional  $\S500$     $(25\%\times\S6000-\S1000)$   to fulfill the margin requirement.  

Brokerage clients should carefully read their  hypo the cation agreements  that define terms of their margin accounts, including unauthorized liquidations of shares purchased on margin and loaning of shares to other investors who may wish to short sell them. The hypothecation agreement will detail terms concerning pledges of client assets (how they might be used as collateral) as well as how the broker might pledge the client’s assets for its own obligations. Equally important, they should be very familiar with the requirements imposed by FED Regulation T and FINRA Rule 2520.  

While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the IRS have fairly specific definitions for day traders, other definitions exist as well. For example, some people distinguish between day traders and swing traders. Some say that swing traders usually hold a stock or a position from one day to a week and tend to concentrate on just a few selected stocks or positions. In this context, day traders neutralize their positions at the end of each trading day.  
# Online Brokers and Direct Access Trading  

Selection of a broker, or brokers, is a crucial decision for the day trader.  Barron’s  conducts and publishes results of surveys rating the various online brokers. When making this decision, the trader should consider a number of factors, including commissions and other fees, trade execution quality, account balance minimums, margin and other interest rates, customer service and live-agent telephone access, bank services, information, research and analytical services, trading platform, level of real-time quotes, and investment selection (some brokers won’t work with mutual funds, IPOs, or bonds). Other conside rations might include whether the broker is or has been targeted by the SEC, FINRA, or NASD for investigation for significant and persistent violations, along with the outcomes of these investigations. How the broker routes orders and the extent to which it accepts payment for order flow might also be important considerations.  

Full-service brokers  such as Oppenheimer, Raymond James, and UBS provide a wide array of services to their clients, including trade execution, advice, market research, and so on. They typically are compensated with commissions on securities transactions, interest on uninvested cash balances and might impose periodic account maintenance charges as well. Discount brokers  such as Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, E\*Trade, TradeKing, and ScotTrade provide for online trade execution, and may or may not provide other services as well. For most long-term investors and some day traders, services provided by one or more of these types of brokerage firms are perfectly appropriate. Most of the firms listed here provide more than a single type or level of service to a wide array of different types of clients.  

Trade execution commissions are an important source of revenues for many brokers. However, this source of revenues has taken on less importance in recent years as brokers have relied more on producing revenues from:  

•  interest from lending clients’ idle cash balances;

 •  margin interest—that is, charging clients interest to purchase securities on margin;

 •  fees from loaning clients’ securities to short sell;

 •  sales of their own mutual funds and ETFs;

 •  payment for order flow, a huge source of revenue for Robinhood Financial and Ameritrade;

 •  subscription fees for premium services such as research reports and NASDAQ Level II market data (e.g., Robinhood Gold);

 •  portfolio management and investment advisory fees;

 •  selling educational, advisory, and other financial services; and

 •  various administrative and service fees such as for wire transfers, software, yearly administrative fees, signature guarantees, back-end fees for account transfers, and account liquidations.  

Massa (2019)  reported that as of August 2019, Charles Schwab clients’ accounts totaled about   $\S3.7$   trillion, with about  $\S265$   billion of this sum earning interest for Schwab rather than for clients, accounting for as much as  $45\%$   of its revenues. Some brokerage firms have used “zero commission” promotions to attract new customers, which then might pay higher stock-trading commissions after the promotion periods end. Retail customer orders can be especially desirable for many brokers and the dealers from which they receive payments for order flow because retail clients are assumed to be uninformed, creating no adverse selection risk for the broker’s dealers or market makers. Accordingly, many retail brokers route nearly all their customer market orders to market makers and internalize rs seeking payment for order flow arrangements. Brokerage firms might use low commissions to “hook” clients with the hope that they can sell them premium services such as wealth management services.  
In many instances, high-volume traders will require faster and better trade execution. Direct access trading systems  may provide for faster and potentially superior execution for such traders. Direct access trading through firms such as such as Interactive Brokers, Questrade, and TD America’s Think or swim enables traders to execute transactions directly with market makers and designated market makers on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and certain ECNs, eliminating the broker from direct transaction participation. The trader may have more control over routing the transaction, avoiding issues related to payment for order flow and  slippage  (movement in the security price against the trader caused by the trader’s impact on supply or demand). While transactions through brokers can execute within a fraction of a second, transactions in many markets take at least seconds and some take minutes or longer. Most direct access transactions on active exchanges execute within fractions of a second. Direct-access trading fees are typically volume based, include exchange and other market fees, and may include fixed platform and software fees. However, total fees can actually be higher than those charged by the deepest discount brokers. In addition, more knowledge is likely to be required on the part of the trader, and high trading volume is likely to be necessary to make this method of trading more cost effective.  

# Trading Platforms  

A trading platform is a computer system used to place or route quotes and transactions through a network to a financial intermediary or market. Trading platforms can be either software-based (e.g., Trade Station, E\*Trade Pro, Bloomberg EMSX, and Litespeed Trader), or web-based such as those provided by most brokers (e.g., Charles Schwab Active Trader, Think or swim, and E\*Trade). Software-based platforms are usually integrated with analytical tools, although many web-based platforms are as well. Trade Station provides trading technology for stocks, options, futures, and forex (foreign exchange, or currencies), along with tools for creating strategies and testing, notably, including a simulation for back testing. Trading platforms can monitor markets and can often be programmed to automatically execute trading strategies based on the customer’s custom trading rules. This can mean that the trading platform can be customized for the customer’s own trading algorithms.  

While trading platforms are easily obtained from brokers or developers of relevant software, there are a number of advantages to the trader who creates her own platform. In fact, many brokers and trading arenas are equipped to feed data into and accept quotes and execute transactions through Excel spreadsheets. Thus, a trader can create a spreadsheet designed to receive market data such as quotes and recent transactions and program in his own trading rules or algorithms to transmit quotes and execute transactions. Such platforms can quickly analyze market data, respond to trading rules, and provide for simultaneous transmission of multiple quotes and executions. Speed, accuracy, and efficiency can be enhanced considerably with the preparation of appropriate spreadsheet macros. For example, macros can be created that compare bid and offer quotes for a number of different securities, complete computations, and then transmit quotes or execute transactions based on “if/then” statements reflecting trading rules. These macros can include buttons to follow rules and can scan data and execute transactions in the trader’s absence. In addition, a custom spreadsheet-based trading platform is obviously very flexible and, often with little adjustment, can continue to be used when the trader switches brokers or trades new instruments. There are a number of firms that can provide assistance with developing spreadsheet-based trading platforms, although many traders should be sufficiently competent to develop platforms without significant assistance.  
# Quotations and Price Data  

The day trader will need timely access price quotes. Markets where securities are traded usually retain ownership of quotation, price, and transaction data and sell these data to interested customers. In fact, in recent years, the single largest source of revenue to major exchanges such as the NYSE has been from the sale of price, volume, and quote data. Real-time quotes are available to traders as quickly as they can be transmitted and displayed; otherwise they are said to be delayed. Delayed quotations are usually less expensive than real-time quotations data. However, in a trading environment where milliseconds (thousandths of a second) or even microseconds (millionths of a second) matter, what exactly is real-time data? In theory, real-time data display exactly as quotes are placed and transactions are executed. However, quotes and transactions data cannot be made available to all traders instantaneously. Different data and vendor services provide these data using different technologies from different locations. Traders compete to obtain these data as quickly as possible and vendors compete to provide it as quickly as possible. Microsecond and even millisecond delays are to be expected, and can easily spoil many trading strategies.  

More extensive real-time quotations data are more expensive than less extensive data. Level I quote access displays the best bid and offer prices (inside quote or BBO: best-bidoffer) and, in some cases, quote sizes. Level II quotes display the same along with other quotes in descending order for the best bids and ascending for the best offers along with market symbols for each (see  Figure 1.1 ). Symbols include NBBO for the national best bid offer (best buy and sell quotations), markets, recent transactions, and so on. Market participant IDs are omitted. Level II access provides the order book (or TotalView access for all quotes) and is necessary for most trading strategies. Almost all brokers provide their clients with free Level I real-time quotes, and most now provide free Level II quotes as well. Some may also provide free Level III quotes, but this varies over time. IEX and several other exchanges (see Chapters 2 and 4) offer real-time data including free depth-of-book details to many of their clients and subscribers. Level III quotes, offered to NYSE, OTCBB (Over the Counter Bulletin Board, described in Chapter 2) and NASDAQ members, enable  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/a886ce3133ea1f27b12793f6cee8cebea4b4eb48c25d9218088e919fcdf3818d.jpg)  

traders to have direct access to enter and revise quotes, execute orders and receive trade confirmations. NASDAQ’s Super Montage TotalView provides more detail on the depth of data than Level II, enabling traders to view market makers’ quotes that are not as good as their best.  Figure 1.2  provides a sample screen from Super Montage TotalView. Note that multiple quotations are frequently provided by several of the MPIDs (market participant IDs).  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b69c93edb637f251289207ace8c7020f3dc485d3e5fd34fc965b7076b86643de.jpg)  

One of the most popular sources of market information and price data is Bloomberg, which offers real-time data and news through  Bloomberg Professional  and access to these data through its Bloomberg terminals. Costs vary, but as of 2018, single machine access can be licensed for roughly   $\S24{,}000$   per year, and interestingly, with only relatively insignificant volume discounts. The system provides data, news access, analytical tools, email, and trade processing systems, and is used by over a quarter million professionals worldwide. There are many, and often less expensive, competitors, including Refinitiv Eikon from Thomson Reuters, FactSet Research Systems, and information content vendor Factiva (Dow Jones). Less expensive quotations systems, such as eSignal and MetaStock, offer prices and quotations for as little as  $\S100$   per month, and sometimes provide charts and related services.  

More specialized data systems are available as well. Real-time data for stock, currency, and futures markets can be obtained via Internet, wireless, or satellite feeds. Specialized providers such as IQFeed and e-Signal offer quotes and recent executions to traders and can be linked to spreadsheet-based trading platforms. On a fee basis, information providers such as Dow Jones and Thomson Reuters can offer electronically “tagged” news products that can be picked up by computer algorithms to trigger programmed trading decisions.  
# Trading Arcades and Prop Shops  

A  trading arcade , sometimes, and perhaps incorrectly referred to as a proprietary trading firm or prop shop, is a physical (and sometimes virtual) location for traders to work and trade. The trader in the arcade might lease office space, a desk, a trading platform, computers and screens, analytical services, access to market data and news services such as Bloomberg or Reuters, order routing technology, clearing and settlement services and office facilities, in an effort to benefit from reduced expenses and economies of scale. Increasingly, no physical space is provided; instead, traders can work from home. Some trading arcades will provide some or all of the capital to be traded, with or without interest. The trader can usually expect to receive reduced brokerage commissions and other trading costs. In addition, the arcade might charge for training services and receive payments from exchanges for order flow. The typical trading arcade will promote itself as “one-stop” shopping for independent traders.  

The distinction between trading arcades and prop shops is often blurred, though trading arcades tend to focus more on providing trading facilities to independent traders while prop shops tend to focus on building long-term employee or partnership arrangements, providing internships, free or paid training programs and close ongoing support to traders. Many prop shops will focus on a variety of market-making activities, and function similar to traditional proprietary trading firms and trading departments in major financial institutions. Some prop shops and trading arcades will provide capital to traders in exchange for a split in trading profits. Firms that provide capital and receive all or most of trading profits are more likely to be referred to as prop shops while true arcades simply provide trading facilities to traders who trade capital in their own accounts.  

Many trading arcades were created by floor traders who were rendered obsolete when their trading environments transformed into electronic markets. These traders transitioned from physical trading floors where physical stamina and ability were advantages to electronic arenas where key stroking ability such as those gain from playing video games provided an advantage. Some arcades have focused on working with amateur traders who have gone through periods of unemployment. In some cases, they have provided training to prospective traders, often for a fee, after which many traders failed in their trading efforts. Trading arcades are frequently short-lived businesses, although some of the longerlived arcades have included those operated by Maverick Trading. Prop shops are more likely to invest heavily into their affiliates and employees for traders. Well-established prop shops and larger financial institutions with prop shop units include Jane Street Capital, Hudson River Trading, Group One Trading, Susquehanna International Group, Geneva Trading, DRW Trading, and Citadel.  

# 1.8 TRADING AND THE BROADER ECONOMY  

The financial services industry plays a crucial role in national and world economies by creating, trading, and settling financial instruments, which are associated with the capital needed for production of goods and services, for shifting funds from “surplus agents” to “deficit agents” and for risk mitigation and shifting. Growth in financial service sectors often accompanies growth in real production sectors, as was clear in the U.S. during the 1920s era, which was characterized by technological improvements and the post 1980s IT growth era. However, as we will discuss shortly, the U.S. economy also experienced significant productive growth during the post-War period 1945  1970 with only a modest share of growth in the financial services sectors. Nevertheless, since issuing and trading of financial instruments is key to planning, production and distribution in a capitalist economy, it is important to evaluate the important role of trading.  
# The Scale of Financial Markets in the U.S. Economy  

Tremendous financial growth of financial services industries has helped fuel significant overall economic growth, produced huge compensation packages for financial executives and even larger profits for financial firms. Philippon (2013) reported that “total compensation of financial intermediaries (profits, wages, salary and bonuses) as a proportion of GDP [adjusted for government defense spending] is at an all-time high. We see in  Table 1.3  that  

TABLE 1.3 Value Added by Industry as a Percentage of Gross Domestic Product 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8b2f72970059ddac5c2184502b5af1859d0e908392da807944d071807c4e3965.jpg)  
Adapted from: Bureau of Economic Analysis; Release Date: November 3,  2016 .  
this proportion was   $7.2\%$   in 2015, based on 2015 GDP of approximately   $\S18$   trillion and the share of the financial industry at about  $\S1.3$   trillion (the latter two nominal figures are not listed in  Table 1.3 ). This proportion had risen from a 1947 post-war level of  $2.3\%$  , based on 1947 GDP of   $\S250$   billion and the financial industry’s share of   $\S5.9$   billion. Thus, this tremendous growth in U.S. economic output has been accompanied by more than triple the growth rate in the financial services industries, although much of this financial sector growth has occurred after 1980.  

While the financial sector’s share of GDP has set new records since 2000, it was nearly as high during the 1920s before collapsing in the 1930s and 1940s. As we noted above, the growth of the financial services industries was not always correlated with the economic growth rate, such as during the relatively strong post-War economy before the 1980s, when regulatory and other structural factors restrained financial sector growth. With some growth in the 1970s and larger growth rates afterwards, we see from Table 1.3  that the U.S. financial sector has more than tripled in size relative to GDP. Significant growth rates have also been recorded in U.K., Australian, Canadian, and Swiss economies.  

# The Scale of Trading in Financial Sectors  

Trading and liquidity are essential for healthy financial markets, for facilitating capital acquisition by productive institutions and for improving the flow of information. There is no doubt that trading has reached unprecedented levels in recent years. For example, in the U.S., total dollar trade in S&P 500 stocks reached  $\S29.5$   trillion, close to 1.7 times U.S. GDP early in the 21st century (see  Collin-Dufresne & Daniel, 2014 ).  Table 1.4  suggests that  

TABLE 1.4 Stock Market Turnover Ratio   $(\%)$  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/02a49066730160e24a0251b7a1215cfafcedca997c86c837587317d9f72933b2.jpg)  
Compiled from various sources listed in this subsection. 2020 figures were taken from the closest year for which data were available.  
equity trading, as evidenced by market turnover in many countries has dramatically increased. The U.S. experienced equity market turnover of   $108.5\%$   in 2018, meaning that annual trading in U.S. equities was about 1.08 times the total value of outstanding shares ( World Bank, 2021 ).  Table 1.4 , compiled from various sources listed in this paragraph, suggests that trading activity in certain other countries, including China, was even higher. Turkey led the world in stock market turnover in 2020 with   $365.8\%$   ( World Bank, 2021 ). Even more strikingly, the Bank for International Settlements (2016) found that average worldwide  daily  trading volume in foreign exchange for April 2016 was   $\S5.6$   trillion, not substantially different from other months in recent years. In commodities markets, volumes (open interest) of exchange-traded derivative contracts have increased enormously, and are now often 20 to 30 times greater than the actual physical production of underlying commodities, with similar volumes in over-the-counter trade ( Sil ven no inen & Thorp, 2013 ). Thus, increased levels of trading were pervasive across financial instruments and countries.  

# Financial iz ation  

Clearly, financial inter mediation and trading in particular have played ever-increasing roles in national and world economies. With substantial resources and talents directed towards financial services, we might expect or at least hope that that productive firms have better and less expensive access to capital than ever. So, have these increasingly important roles of the finance sector actually delivered value-added to real economies? Or, has financial sector growth crowded out competing real economic sector growth? To what extent has financial sector growth improved human welfare and heightened economic stability?  

Krippner (2005)  and  Arrighi (1994)  defined  financial iz ation  as“a pattern of accumulation in which profits accrue primarily through financial channels rather than through trade and commodity production.” We now ask whether our increased economic focus on the financial sector has improved our ability to direct resources to production or actually shifted resources away from real production.  

Philippon (2015) , in his examination of these issues, characterizes the cost of financial inter mediation as “the sum of all spreads and fees paid by non-financial agents to financial intermediaries,” which is “also the sum of all profits and wages in the finance industry.” Philippon estimated these costs over each of 142 years in the U.S., finding them to range around   $1.5\%{-}2\%$   of intermediate d assets, showing constant rather than increasing returns to scale and remarkable consistency over time despite drastic improvements in technologies. These results are surprising. Firms were able to obtain needed capital at pretty much the same per-unit cost in 1870 as in 2012, despite huge growth and prodigious applications of new technologies in finance industries. How is it that the per-unit costs to firms seeking financial services do not decrease, even as the technological innovation would seem to reduce the financial institutional costs for providing these services? Philippon argues that these efficiencies were consumed as compensation and profits by finance professionals and financial institutions rather than passed on to firms in real sectors as either service improvements or cost reductions. Thus, he suggests, financial iz ation did not so much improve the process of inter mediating capital between surplus and deficit agents, but instead was associated with increased creation and trading of financial instruments, which served to increase compensation to financial executives and profits to financial institutions.  
However, the compensation captured by finance professionals and the profits realized by their employers do not fully capture the costs of financial iz ation to society. Consider, for example, the investment of   $\S300$   million into the Spread Networks high-speed fiber optic cable that, starting in 2010, enabled competing financial traders to reduce their communication times between markets in Chicago and New York from 16 to   $13\ \mathrm{ms}$   (a very fast blink of a human eye is approximately   $200~\mathrm{ms})$  ). This installation was quickly followed in 2011 by microwave technology (constructed by data networks provider McKay Brothers) that reduced the time to  $9\;\mathrm{{ms}}_{\ast}$  , and with further investment, 8.5 and then  $8.1~\mathrm{ms}$  ( Budish, Camton, & Shim, 2015 ). Similar communications investments were made connecting Tokyo and Singapore markets, New York and London (the Hibernia Express   $4600~\mathrm{km}$  transatlantic submarine cable) in   $58.95\,\mathrm{\ms},$  , and numerous market centers around the globe. It is not easy to believe that such minute improvements in trading speed reduce the cost of capital for real-sector firms.  

The technological arms race is probably dwarfed by the race for brain power. Consider that thousands of brilliant minds that are focused on trading problems and technology rather than on health research, building transportation infrastructure and pursuing other pressing social problems. While it is sensible for individual financial firms to seek the best talent, does Wall Street provide the most long-term benefit to society relative to alternative uses of this human capital? At a minimum, resources used in the human capital deployment decision do represent a significant opportunity cost to society.  

On the other hand, it is easy to understate the benefits of trading because they are simply more difficult to readily isolate and evaluate. Trading in a free-market is essential to the production and flow of information, planning and managerial decision making, capital formation, risk transfer, etc. The strength of the economy depends on the resources devoted to the financial sector. We do know that capital allocation is a necessary component of a healthy economy; trading is an essential component of this process. Should not such essential activities command society’s best minds and resources?  

What is society’s payback from this resource deployment?  Turner (2010)  argued that “There is no clear evidence that the growth in the scale and complexity of the financial system in the rich developed world over the last 20 to 30 years has driven increased growth or stability.” If financial iz ation did not significantly improve growth, stability, or firms’ access to capital, how did it impact the economy? Turner suggests that we see little evidence, either at macro or individual investor levels that financial and economic risk has been substantially mitigated by increased market liquidity and trading. In fact, he suggests, speculation required to produce liquidity might have produced de stabilizing and excessive momentum effects.  

Furthermore,  Godechot (2016) , based on his study of 18 OECD countries, argues that the GDP share of the finance sector is a substantial driver of world wealth inequality, explaining between  $20\%$   and  $40\%$   of the increase in wealth inequality from 1980 to 2007. In particular, he argues that rise in financial iz ation’s contribution to inequality was driven largely by the increase in equities trading volume on national stock exchanges and by the large balances of shares held by banks.  
Finance academics and professionals have traditionally accepted that trading, speculation and liquidity are beneficial to economies. This is surely true, at least to a point. Perhaps, increased levels of each are even more beneficial. Highly liquid financial markets reduce costs of capital, and, when functioning properly, they reduce uncertainty and improve information flows. But, do more liquidity and more activities that enhance liquidity always improve the economy? Clearly, there are benefits and costs to increased liquidity, but what are the appropriate trade-off levels between benefits and costs of additional financial activities? Has our economy reached the point of diminishing marginal returns to liquidity? Is there a point at which we should we consider transactions taxes discourage excessive devotion of resources to areas of economy that might need scaling back (see, for example,  Summers & Summers, 1989 )? Numerous countries all over the world, including the U.K., Australia, and China, have at some point at least temporarily imposed financial transactions taxes. The state of New York imposed a financial transactions tax in 1905 and retained it until 1981 after threats by the NYSE to move out of state.  

Financial iz ation is now an important research topic in economics. However, financialization is by no means a focus area of this book. Instead, we will focus on the theory and practice of financial trading from the perspective of the individual or institution. However, readings from the lists below should provide some insights on the important roles of financial trading in society.  

# Additional Reading  

Harris (2003)  is certainly one of the most useful introductory books on trading, especially with respect to micro structure. However, trading mechanisms are changing so rapidly that even this excellent book will be somewhat dated. Chapters 1 to 9 are much more comprehensive than the material presented here in Chapter 1, and very much worth reading.  Kim (2007)  provides excellent explanations of electronic and algorithmic trading technology in Chapters 1 to 3 and 6 to 7.  Elton, Gruber, Brown, and Goetzmann (2010)  provide a brief and readable introduction to securities markets in Chapters 2 and 3, and much of the remainder of the book will be useful to traders as well. Elton et al. is among the best MBA-level texts on portfolio analysis. The two articles by  Klemperer (1999) and (2002)  are excellent general introductory reviews of auction mechanisms.  Stoll’s 2003  review on market micro structure is an excellent overview of the topic, especially from an academic perspective. There are numerous businesses with websites providing information on brokerage services, data provision, trading platforms, and trading arcades. Zingales, in his 2015  address to the American Finance Association, raises the issue of financial iz ation and the seeming divergence between academics’ and the general public’s perceptions of the net benefits to society of the practice of finance.

# 3.  How does trading differ from speculating?  

4.  Suppose there was an open outcry English second-price auction. All bids are public. You are willing to bid a maximum of   $\S100$   for the auctioned item. You know that no one else will be willing to pay more than  $\S200$   for the object. The first bid by one of your competitors is for  $\S10$  . What should you bid? Why?  

5.  An auction house has decided to sell a sculpture in an open outcry second-price auction. The auction house manager does not know the value any bidder will place on the work, but does know that every bidder will pay at least  $\S500{,}000$   (there is a gallery that has already announced its intent to pay at least this amount for the work, either from the gallery or from the successful bidder). Thus, the successful bidder can always sell the work for   $\S500{,}000$  . In addition, the auction house knows that no one will be willing to pay more than  $\mathbb{41}\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{,}000$   for the work because the only other identical sculpture (made from the same cast) is on the market for  $\mathbb{S}1\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{,}000$   and has not drawn any interest. Thus, the auction house believes that any particular bidder is willing to pay a random sum between  $\S500{,}000$   and  $\mathbb{S}1\mathrm{,}000\mathrm{,}000$   for the work (this random sum is the value of the work to the bidder), with an expected value of  $\mathbb{S}750{,}000$   and distributed uniformly (any value within this range is equally likely) between the minimum and maximum.  

a.  Suppose that there are two bidders. What is the expected value of the second highest bid? Hint: If there are to be  $n$   independent draws from a uniform distribution on the range,  $[x_{1},\,x_{2}],\,E[x_{\mathrm{MAX}}]=x_{1}+(x_{2}-\,x_{1})n/(n+1)$   and  $E[x_{\mathrm{WIN}}]=x_{1}+(x_{2}-\,x_{1})/(n+1)$  . b.  Now, suppose instead that there are three bidders for the sculpture. What is the expected value of the second highest bid? c.  Suppose that there are 999 bidders for the sculpture. What is the expected value of the second highest bid?  

6.  There are two ways to purchase T-Bills. The first is to enter a competitive bid at the auction where the bidding institution competes for a given dollar amount of the new issue based on how much it is willing to pay. Only the approximately 2000 securities brokers and dealers that are registered to operate in the government securities market are permitted to participate directly in the competitive bidding process. However, these registered firms may participate on behalf of their clients. Second, noncompetitive bids can be tendered by anyone where the prospective purchaser states how many bills he would like to purchase at the average price of accepted competitive bids. Competitive bidders for T-Bills generally enter their bids just before the deadline (1:00 PM Eastern Time) to participate in the auction. Noncompetitive bids are limited to  $\S5$   million and are normally due before 12:00 noon (Eastern Time) on the day of an auction. Noncompetitive bids are satisfied at the average price of successful competitive bids. The Treasury determines the dollar amount of competitive bids that it wishes to satisfy by subtracting the face values of the noncompetitive bids from the level of bills that the Treasury wishes to sell. Successful competitive bids are selected by ranking them, starting with the highest bid. Successful bidders obtain their bills at the prices that they bid; the lowest bid is referred to as the stop-out price. Consider the following example involving a Dutch auction of  $\S20$   billion in 91-day T-Bills, where the bids (based on yields to maturity) by financial institution are given as follows:  
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/aea45d7c180dfc03ee93c12bd9f3e9a4de5c69655da8772321d0a66f172decd9.jpg)  

Further suppose that individual investors have placed noncompetitive bids totaling  $\S2.5$   billion. What is the bid-to-cover ratio in this auction? What is the stop-out price? Which bids will be satisfied?  

7. a.  In an all-pay auction, all bidders pay the amounts that they bid for the object to be auctioned, but only the winner, that is, whoever places the highest bid, takes possession of the object. This auction process has been likened to the system of political contributions, where all lobbyists make contributions to politicians, but only the highest-contributing lobbyists can exert influence. Similarly, the all pay auction might be similar to a ticket line at a limited-seating rock concert, where each bid is reflected by the amount of time that the bidder waits in line. Other allpay auction scenarios might involve political campaign contributions, job promotions, and R&D races. Now, consider an all-pay auction for a  $\S1$   bill. Describe how such an auction structure might realize higher revenue for the seller of the  $\S1$   bill.  

b.  Consider the entertainment shopping site, PennyCave.com ( http://www. pennycave.com/ ; defunct as of June 2017). This site, as do other penny auction sites, auctioned electronic items such as music players and computer screens. Items were normally sold to the highest bidder at a price that is (or seems) substantially less than the value of the auctioned item. Bidders paid a fixed amount (e.g.,  $\S1.$  ) for each bid that they placed. The auction clock was set for a specific length of time (e.g., 24 hours), but a bid placed in the final seconds reset the clock for another 20 seconds. Its market structure follows (as of April 25, 2011):  

$\bullet$   The starting price on each auction is   $\S0.00$  . Bid increments are  $\S0.01$  . •  Each bid costs the bidder one credit. Credits are purchased from PennyCave for costs ranging from  $\S0.67$   to  $\S1$  , depending on the quantity purchased. •  The price only goes up by  $\S0.01$   with each bid placed.  $\bullet$   If a bid is placed in the final moments, the auction clock is reset for 20 seconds. •  How does this auction structure compare to an all-pay auction structure? What is the advantage of having bid increments set at   $\S0.01?$  

8.  The Designated Market Maker (DMM) on the NYSE has received the following bids, each to purchase 100 shares of XYZ stock at the market open: 9.98, 9.99, 10.00, 10.01, 10.02, and 10.03. She has received the following offers, each to sell 100 shares of XYZ stock at the market open: 10.01, 10.02, 10.03, 10.04, 10.05, and 10.06.  
a.  Assume that this is the only market for the stock. What is the best bid prior to the market’s open? What is the best offer? b.  Describe the demand curve or schedule for XYZ stock based on the data above. (Note: it is not continuous.) c.  Describe the supply curve or schedule for XYZ stock based on the data above. (Note: it is not continuous.) d.  What is the clearing price for this market? That is, at what price does supply equal demand for the stock? e.  Based on your solution to part d above, what bids execute at open? What offers execute at open? f.  Again, assume that this is the only market for the stock. What is the open NBBO after the initial clearing of orders?

10.  Exactly what does an investor expect from her broker when she places a stop limit order with a stop price to buy at 50 and a limit price of 50.10? Why might an investor place such an order?  

11.  High frequency trading is the practice of executing multiple transactions for securities followed by extremely short holding periods. Such market practices often require highly sophisticated computing and communications technologies. Many market observers have commented that high frequency trading (HFT) is unfair to small investors who lack the high-priced equipment and technology to compete with much larger traders. Many of these observers have proposed curbs on HFT activity, including having exchanges and other markets replace continuous trading with batch trading or call markets. Why would batch trading (call markets) reduce the level of HFT?  

12.  Suppose that orders arrive at the market in the following timed sequence, after the best-bid-offer (BBO) has been set at 49.98  50.02: 11:01.01 DMM bids 50.00 for 1,000 shares, setting the best bid 11:01.20 Floor broker bids 50.00 for 600 shares 11.01.40 Bid at 50.00 for 1,500 shares is placed in the Electronic Book 11:02.00 Bid at 50.00 for 1,000 shares is placed in the Electronic Book 11:02.10 Offer to sell 2,000 shares at market is placed in the Electronic Book a.  How would these orders be allocated for execution based on price/time priority? b.  How would these orders be allocated for execution on the NYSE?

14.  Suppose that investing   $\S10$   million on eradicating mosquitoes carrying the Zika or other infectious virus will have a clear and significant impact on the spread of this disease, saving over 500 lives and preventing disabling conditions in another 500 persons. Suppose that an equal investment into a new trading platform will produce  $\S300$   million in additional revenues to a brokerage firm. Consider the following rhetorical questions:  

a.  Which investment is likely to produce more social benefits? Which investment is likely to produce more private benefits to the decision-maker? b.  Would an institution that makes the investment that produces more social benefit be more highly regarded by society than the institution making the investment with higher private benefits? c.  Should governments play a significant role in making such decisions?
