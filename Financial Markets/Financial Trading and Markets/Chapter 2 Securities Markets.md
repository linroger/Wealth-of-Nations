# Securities Markets  

# 2.1 EXCHANGES AND FLOOR MARKETS  

The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, in a manner somewhat different from our definitions in the previous chapter of this book, defined an  exchange  to be:  

any organization, association, or group of persons, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange as that term is generally understood, and includes the market place and the market facilities maintained by such exchange.  

An exchange is a physical or virtual meeting place drawing together brokers, dealers, and traders to facilitate the buying and selling of securities. Thus, exchanges include the floor-based markets where brokers and traders physically congregate as well as many virtual meeting sites and screen-based systems provided by  electronic communications networks ( ECNs ). In the United States and many other countries, exchange transactions are executed through some type of auction process. Exchanges in the United States are intended to provide for orderly, liquid, and  continuous markets  for the securities they trade. A  continuous market  provides for transactions that can be executed at any time for a price that might be expected to differ little from the prior transaction price for the same security, whereas a call market  allows for trading of securities only at specific points or intervals during the trading day. In addition, exchanges traditionally served as  self-regulatory organizations (SROs) for their members, regulating and policing their behavior with respect to a variety of rules and requirements. However, in the United States, the  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  ( FINRA ) has provided for self-regulation of the two major U.S. stock markets since the 2007 consolidation of the  National Association of Security Dealers  (NASD) and the Member Regulation, Enforcement and Arbitration operations of the New York Stock Exchange.  
# 2.2 THE WAY IT WAS  

# National and Regional Exchanges  

Understanding the history and evolution of securities markets is important for understanding their current structures and practices. U.S. stock markets have been the world’s most significant and most followed, and merit particular attention. Traditionally, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), now a unit of the Intercontinental Exchange Group, and the American Exchange (ASE or AMEX) were regarded as the two national exchanges in the U.S., but the NYSE acquired the ASE in 2008. The ASE’s successor’s market is now known as NYSE MKT, which trades small cap equities, with physical floor facilities alongside the NYSE in New York. Until the 1990s, numerous “regional exchanges” continued to operate. Regional exchanges, a term whose meaning is now somewhat in flux, traditionally referred to all but the two national exchanges, including those in Chicago (formerly the Midwest Exchange), Boston, and Philadelphia, the descendant of the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Exchange. The Pacific Exchange, which originated as two separate regional exchanges in San Francisco and Los Angeles, maintained separate trading floors in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and was eventually acquired by the Archipelago Group. Archipelago has since merged (in 2006) with the New York Stock Exchange to form the New York Stock Exchange Group which, as part of the NYSE Euronext Group in 2013, was acquired by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which then spun off Euronext and remains the owner of the NYSE.  

Regional exchanges traditionally listed stocks that would not qualify for national exchange listing as well as provided local or competing markets for a number of national exchange listed securities. However, many regional exchanges no longer fit this mold, and most do not consider themselves to be regional. In some instances, either lower transactions costs or better prices can be obtained for clients for dual-listed securities on the regional or smaller exchanges; to some extent, competition provided by these regional exchanges may result in lower transactions costs for investors on national exchanges. In addition, different market structures and rules might provide for unique execution opportunities for clients and investors. There are also a number of exchanges for other securities such as the Chicago Board of Trade (CBT—for futures contracts), The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the Kansas City Board of Trade, and the Commodities Exchange (COMEX). Finally, there are several exchanges without actual trading floors, including the National Exchange (formerly the Cincinnati Exchange, currently located in Chicago) and the International Securities Exchange (ISE). These exchanges operations are based entirely on electronic platforms.  Table 2.1  provides a more comprehensive listing of exchanges as recognized by the SEC as of April 2021 along with several of the more significant U.S. futures exchanges (Designated Contract Markets) registered with the CFTC.  

# Early Ancestors to Modern Exchanges  

Until recently, U.S. stock markets and many others had evolved rather slowly over the centuries, hanging on to their roots, traditions, rules, and regulations. Much of their TABLE 2.1 U.S. Stock and Futures Exchanges as of April 2021

current structures and idiosyncrasies still draw from this evolution. Understanding this evolution is helpful to understanding their current structures, policies, and procedures. Precursors to modern stock exchanges might have existed in Egypt as early as the 11th century, where it is believed that Jewish and Islamic brokers traded a variety of creditrelated instruments. Thirteenth-century Bruges (Belgium) commodity traders assembled in the van der Beurse family home (and inn), ultimately becoming the “Bruges Beurse.” Additional bourses opened elsewhere in Flanders and Amsterdam, generally trading alongside merchants of commodities. Codifying of and enforcing trading rules and regulations by the exchange in Antwerp and later exchanges substantially facilitated transactions and reduced transactions costs among the traders from many countries, perhaps even contributing to the slow decline of the important merchant guilds over subsequent centuries (see  Raj, 2017 ). The Amsterdam Stock Exchange opened in the early 17th century, trading shares of the Dutch East India Company. The exchange continues to operate as a unit of Euronext, a family of European exchanges, and is the world’s longest continuously operated exchange. Several early exchanges began in coffee houses and taverns, where brokers and dealers would meet to trade securities. For example, the London Stock Exchange started operations in about 1698 in Jonathan’s Coffee House on Change Alley.  

The first securities exchange to operate in the United States was in Philadelphia, the second, in New York, which opened operations in 1791. The New York Stock Exchange began operations outdoors after the May 17, 1792 signing of the “Buttonwood Agreement.” This contract, signed by 24 brokers under a buttonwood tree at what is now 68 Wall Street, fixed brokerage commissions among its signatories and prohibited off-board trading (i.e., traders and brokers were to trade only with each other). In earlier days, exchanges often operated outdoors so that brokers could call out their orders from their office windows to the street where transactions actually took place. In late 1793, this group of brokers obtained the Tontine Coffee House, which was used for cold weather trading until the 1880s. In 1865, the New York Stock Exchange adopted its current name. The American Stock Exchange, known as the New York Curb Exchange until 1953, did not move indoors until June 27, 1921. For much of its history, NASDAQ was not considered to be an exchange because it did not have a physical trading floor. Founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), NASDAQ—formerly known as the National Association of Security Dealers Automated Quotation System—has served as an electronic stock market allowing brokers and dealers to efficiently transmit bid, offer, and close prices for securities.  

# Traditional New York Stock Exchange Structure  

Since the New York Stock Exchange is the largest and arguably the most important exchange in the world, we will first emphasize its structure and organization, first past and then present. Until 2006, the NYSE was a sort of hybrid corporation/partnership whose members faced unlimited liability.   At the same time, the NYSE structure was unaffected by the death or departure of any one of its 1366 members. Only members who owned or leased seats had trading privileges and there were four types of members, discussed below. Each member was an individual and most were sponsored by or associated with a brokerage firm or other organization (typically called a member firm). A membership was referred to as a seat, which was purchased (for as much as  $\S4$   million in 2005, and last sold on December 29, 2005 for   $\S3{,}505{,}000)$   through a competitive market process. Full membership was limited to 1366 seats, although there had been special limited trading permits issued as well. Now, under the new structure, one can join the 1366 members by purchasing a full trading license that permits the member to trade for one year. As of January 2017, the annual fee for a full trading license was   $\S50{,}000$  , billed monthly. The four types of traditional memberships were as follows:  
House Broker : Also known as a commission broker, executed orders on behalf of clients submitting orders through brokerage firms. Until 2006, approximately half of the members on the floor were commission brokers. This and other broker roles have been taken over by “trading floor brokers.”  

Independent Broker : Also called a two-dollar broker, executed orders on behalf of commission brokers when activity was high. Alternatively, sometimes commission brokers executing orders on behalf of off-floor clients were referred to as floor brokers. This type of distinct membership no longer exists. Floor Trader : Executes orders on her own trading accounts. As of 1992, there were approximately 40 floor traders on the NYSE and this number continued to decline through 2006. However, the NYSE has since created the “supplemental liquidity provider” role, which is intended to enhance market liquidity by allowing for proprietary trading. We will discuss this new role shortly. Specialist : Was charged with the responsibility for maintaining a continuous, liquid, orderly market for the securities in which he specialized. He also kept the book (records) for unexecuted transactions and bought and sold on his own account. There were approximately 400 specialists on the NYSE in 1992. Specialists were typically selected on the basis of their performance as specialists for other securities and other qualifications. Specialists were involved in approximately   $20\%$   of NYSE transactions as a principal. Because of their dual roles in running the market for securities on behalf of the exchange and as traders buying and selling those securities at a profit, the specialist’s role was particularly interesting and somewhat controversial. The specialist was expected to fulfill his obligation to maintain a continuous, orderly, and liquid market; this role may have conflicted with the desire to earn trading profits. The specialist has been replaced by the “designated market maker” (DMM), to be discussed shortly.  

Traditionally, trading activity for the shares of approximately 2779 listed firms (prior to 2006) centered around trading posts located around the floor throughout various rooms. Brokers and traders would congregate about these posts and specialists who oversee trading activity. Clerks employed by the exchanges recorded trading activities and relayed records to systems that disseminated data to the investing public. However, this system has mostly given way to automated screen-based trading, DMMs who are expected to maintain liquid and orderly markets for specific stocks, and offfloor supplemental liquidity providers who are paid fees by the exchange to execute transactions.  
# Transforming the NYSE  

On April 20, 2005, the New York Stock Exchange dropped a bombshell on the investing public, announcing its intent to be taken over by Archipelago, the successor to the Pacific Stock Exchange. In a single sweep, the NYSE would be merged, privatized, expanded into derivatives markets, and have a springboard for its transformation to an electronic trading market. Stock markets have traditionally emphasized roles of the specialists (replaced by DMMs) who conduct auction markets and maintain liquidity for off-floor brokers and traders. Since the founding of the NYSE in the late 1700s, exchange markets have brought together widely dispersed brokers, dealers, and individual investors, creating highly organized, visible, and regulated environments intended to facilitate trading and price discovery. The traditional floor-based stock exchange in the United States centered around a specialist with a regular “trading crowd” that focused its energies on a small number of stocks. The specialist conducted an auction market for the trading crowd that gathered about. Floor brokers entered the trading crowd with orders initiated by larger off-floor traders, while smaller and routine orders were more likely to be routed to the specialist through an electronic routing system such as the now-obsolete  SuperDOT , the “super designated order turnaround system.”  

The merger with Archipelago and the embrace of modern technology have completely changed the way that the NYSE conducts its markets. Now, the roles of the specialist have been passed on to  designated market makers  (DMMs) whose responsibilities and rights differ somewhat from their specialist predecessors. DMMs have no trading advantages relative to other market participants, have no special access to order books, and are compensated by listing firms to provide liquidity. The DMM manually manages the market open and close for her securities, overseeing the process of determining the market clearing prices. The exchange’s matching engine is a software algorithm that continuously matches buy and sell orders for execution through the trading day, though the process is overseen by the DMM, who commits capital to maintain liquidity in her market. In addition, the DMM steps in with her own capital during period of market turbulence, seeking to maintain a balance between buy and sell orders, maintain price continuity and to reduce market volatility. We will further discuss the DMM roles shortly.  

The NYSE has overhauled other technologies as well. For example, in July 2009, the SuperDOT system was replaced by the NYSE  super display book system  (SDBK) for routing, execution and reporting orders. This new system enables customers to execute orders in as quickly as five milliseconds without broker intervention.  

Sophisticated traders are very concerned with the development of fast and efficient buyand-sell order processing systems, order executing (clearing and settling) systems, and systems for the analysis of investments. Technology affects order processing, routing, and matching of trades, as well as valuation, hedging, and portfolio risk management techniques. The NYSE has responded with numerous enhancements to facilitate trading activity. For example, it has dramatically increased its ability to handle increasing transaction volume (typically averaging between one and two billion equity shares between mid-2016 and mid-2017) due to improved technology. For example, the NYSE’s ECN, the SDBK permits orders to be routed electronically by brokerage firms for execution. Most program trades are also submitted through the SDBK system, accounting for over   $10\%$   of all orders. Overall, the SDBK system executes approximately  $99\%$   of all NYSE orders. For these SDBK orders, the brokerage firm need not have the order presented at the trading post by a commission broker. This means that the order can be executed faster, perhaps within 5 milliseconds. Equities orders that are executed by a broker on the floor itself are much larger, averaging approximately 29,000 shares. When the NYSE opens at 9:30 EST, orders that have accumulated matched and the DMM attempts to establish a market clearing price. The DMM will attempt to open the security at a price that deviates as little as possible from the prior day’s close at  $4{:}00\ \mathrm{\bar{PM}}$  .  
# De mutual iz ation and Governance Changes  

A mutual organization is owned by members, typically employees, clients, or suppliers. Mutual stock exchanges are owned by members who have trading rights in the exchange’s market. Accompanying the improvement of exchange technology in trading has been a trend to de mutual ize exchanges. This de mutual iz ation trend has meant that many exchanges have restructured to become stockholder-owned corporations. Euronext and the Australian, Pacific, and London Exchanges were among the first to de mutual ize in 1997 through 1999, following the Stockholm Exchange in 1993. NASDAQ de mutual i zed in 2000 and the NYSE in 2006. Most exchanges justified restructuring to for-profit institutions based on their needs to raise capital to finance their technology and infrastructure expenses. Exchange de mutual iz ation has also provided for more intense competition among markets. Exchange self-regulation and other regulatory issues remain important concerns for these restructured institutions. To avoid conflicts of interest, the NYSE Group created a not-for-profit corporation, NYSE Regulation, Inc., with the New York Stock Exchange LLC as its sole equity member. This new corporation performs all the SRO (selfregulatory organization, to be discussed later) regulatory responsibilities that had been conducted by the NYSE. NYSE Regulation seeks to ensure that listed companies comply with NYSE listing regulations, actively engages in the exchange rule-making process, and monitors exchange trading activity for suspicious behavior.  

The NYSE merger followed on the heels of the Richard Grasso compensation quagmire, where former CEO Grasso and the NYSE were heavily criticized for his  $\S180$  -million pay package. Grasso resigned in 2003 and was followed in several months by John Thain who approached Archipelago about merging. The  $\S6$   billion merger deal granted the 1366 NYSE members about  $64\%$   of the combined firm’s shares and the remainder to Archipelago shareholders   $(30\%)$  , NYSE top management   $(5\%)$  , and lower-level managers and employees   $(1\%)$  . Interestingly, the  $5\%$   granted to NYSE CEO John Thain and other top managers was valued at approximately   $\S300$   million, more than the disputed sums paid to former CEO Richard Grasso. A number of NYSE member-seat holders, notably Kenneth Langone, former chairman of the NYSE Board of Directors, complained about the price accepted by NYSE management. However, a seat on the NYSE sold for  $\S960{,}000$   in January 2005, and  $\S1.6$   million on April 20, 2005, shortly before the takeover announcement, and for  $\S3$   million in July 2005, shortly after the takeover announcement. By year-end, the price of a seat had risen to  $\S4$   million before dropping to  $\S3.505$   million at year-end. In addition, some NYSE members complained about Thain’s former employer, Goldman Sachs, representing both sides in the deal. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs owned several seats on the NYSE and maintained substantial holdings of Archipelago shares. However, two other investment banks, Greenhill and Lazard, did required due diligence for the deal. The deal was valued by these institutions at between   $\S3$   billion and  $\S5$   billion, a substantial discount below the value implied by the July 2005 market price of Archipelago shares.  
# Diminished Floor Trading Activity  

As the NYSE developed, acquired, and improved its ability to handle electronic transactions, actual in-person floor trading activity diminished. As of the end of 2006, the NYSE trading floor exceeded 43,000 square feet. During 2007, the NYSE closed trading rooms; by November 2007, slightly more than half of this trading space was available for in-person transactions. In fact, as early as 2007, trading activity on the NYSE trading floor produced less than   $10\%$   of NYSE revenue. More important sources of revenue to the NYSE now include listing fees charged to firms that want their shares traded on the NYSE and from selling price, quotations, and other transactions data to the public. The trading floor crowd

 (including members, clerks, etc.) has diminished in numbers from over 3000 to less than

 1700. Less than half of NYSE volume is executed on the floor, and DMMs (specialists) have been involved in less than 1 in 30 transactions as opposed to 1 in 7 as recently as 2002.  

The NYSE functioned without any floor trading when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the exchange to close its physical trading floor from March 23, 2020, until it gradually reopened beginning May 26, 2020. The suspension of floor trading meant that  D-orders  (discretionary orders), which can be executed only by floor brokers, were also suspended, having a significant impact on daily closing auctions, the period most impacted by direct human trading. Electronic trading continued throughout this period while floor employees worked remotely. Closing the floor did reduce both liquidity and pricing efficiency, even relative to Nasdaq, which was restored by reopening the floor ( Chung & Chu wong an ant, 2021 ). Through the broader period extending from February to August 2020, NYSE stock markets experienced unprecedented volatility largely due to the impact of the pandemic on the economy.  

# Current New York Stock Exchange Equities Membership Types  

As discussed above, the specialist role yielded to that of the DMM, who commits capital to support liquidity and maintains critical management roles in auctions for securities. The specialist’s liquidity providing function was taken over by both the DMM and  supplemental liquidity providers  (SLPs), outside firms that commit to maintain liquidity in specific stocks. The DMM has the obligation to maintain fair and orderly markets and facilitate price discovery in his assigned securities. The DMM opens and closes the market for its securities each day, using his own capital (or that of his employer) to resolve order imbalances and to seek market clearing prices (prices at which demand equals supply) for the securities for which he is responsible. The DMM is required to quote at the national best bid or offer (NBBO) a specified percentage of the time (typically  $40\%$  ), provide price improvement (that is, facilitate higher bids to accommodate prospective sellers and lower offers to accommodate prospective buyers), and match incoming orders based on a pre programmed capital commitment schedule. DMMs for a listed security can be selected by the issuer of the listed security or the issuer can delegate authority to the NYSE to select an eligible DMM. NYSE DMM firms include or have included BofA Merrill, Barclays Capital, GTS Securities, GETCO Securities LLC, Citadel Securities, and Spear, Leeds & Kellogg Specialists LLC.  
A second type of NYSE equities membership is the  trading floor broker  who works orders on behalf of clients on an agency basis. Trading floor brokers are positioned at the point of sale on the exchange floor during openings, closings, and unique intraday occurrences to execute trades.  

The third type of NYSE equities membership is the SLP, a high-volume member trading electronically off of her own proprietary account adding liquidity to the NYSE. SLP members are rewarded, often with rebate fees paid by the NYSE (averaging  $\S.0019$   in July 2016), for aggressively providing liquidity and improving markets. They are expected to maintain a bid or offer at the NBBO in each assigned security during at least   $10\%$   of the trading day. Major NYSE supplemental liquidity providing firms have included Barclays Capital, Citadel Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Company, HRT Financial LLC, and KCG Americas LLC.  

# Option Exchanges  

Most stock options in the United States are traded on one of the options exchanges. The oldest stock options exchange is the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which also owns the C2 Options Exchange. The NYSE has grown in stature in options markets with the NYSE Amex and NYSE Arca, acquired through takeovers. NASDAQ OMX operates the NSDQ and PHLX (formerly the Philadelphia Exchange). In addition, the Boston Options Exchange (BOX, which is jointly owned by the TMX Group and a consortium of broker dealers) and ISE (owned by Nasdaq) both maintain stock option markets.  Table 2.2  provides volume data for all of these and other equity options exchanges. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), jointly owned by the U.S. options exchanges, is technically the counter party for all listed options transactions in the United States. This means that all option buyers own options that were written by the OCC and all option writers are obligated to the OCC. This arrangement, given the financial stability of the OCC and each of the exchanges that own and back its obligations and all of the brokerage firms that back the obligations of the exchanges have effectively eliminated default risk in listed options trading.  

Options trading took place entirely over the counter until the 1973 opening of the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The nature of options trading lends itself to technological development at every stage of the trading process. First, because of option-trading strategies’ emphases on relative valuation and stochastic processes, the valuation and portfolio analyses require mathematical analyses that are computer-based. Maintenance of these strategies requires abilities to rapidly trade in and out of multiple positions simultaneously, relying on electronic communication technologies capable of handling large amounts of data instantaneously. Technologies offered through the Internet offer these capabilities, forcing exchanges to anticipate and quickly improve on developments in order to compete.  

Competition among options exchanges continues to intensify, fostered by a myriad of new technologies and the introduction of equity option multiple listings beginning in the fall of 1999. The International Securities Exchange was launched in May 2000 as the first fully electronic exchange in the United States, adding a significant dimension of competition to the then largely floor-based markets offered by the CBOE, AMEX, and PHLX. In addition,

the ISE traded options with well-established markets on the other exchanges. In addition to the ISE, well-established foreign exchanges such as Eurex electronically trade contracts on U.S. equity instruments, further intensifying competitive pressures on major U.S. options exchanges. In fact, practically all European and Asian securities and derivatives exchanges have become entirely or almost entirely electronic. This increased competition has led to a number of important results, including narrowing spreads (  $\mathit{\Omega}.8\%$   between 1999 and 2000 alone according to a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) study; also see  Battalio, Hatch, & Jennings, 2004 ), highly uncertain futures for competitors, and the development and implementation of innovative quotations and trading systems.  

Options exchanges have innovated substantial technological advances to maintain and even anticipate developments in other markets. For example, exchange-initiated technological advances include NASDAQ’s automated exchange,  Super Montage . Options exchanges have experienced launching of the Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE Command, launched in 2012 as CBOE’s trade platform and engine located in Secaucus New Jersey. Such trading systems provide for instantaneous filling and confirmation of orders at the best prices along with transparency of trades. Asset managers rely on such systems to obtain speedy access to information, to route and execute orders, and to obtain trade confirmations. Several exchanges are providing for off-site market makers such as the CBOE  Remote Market Makers  (RMMs). These systems facilitate trading by off-floor investors and enhance liquidity by expanding the membership of market makers. They offer market makers direct access to the trading floor, enabling them to participate in the provision of market liquidity and subjecting them to the same market-enhancing responsibilities without requiring their physical presence.  
# 2.3 OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS AND ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEMS  

During most of the 20th century, the two national exchanges (NYSE and AMEX) along with a small number of regional exchanges hosted all U.S. exchange-based trading. All other trading was conducted either directly between counter parties or intermediate d by broker dealers in what was called the  over-the-counter (OTC)  markets. The creation of the electronic bulletin board NASDAQ by NASD, followed by its evolution into a full-fledged ECN, and then its recognition as an exchange, along with the introduction of numerous alternative trading systems such as BRUT and BATS, blurred the distinction between exchange and OTC markets.  

# Over-the-Counter Markets  

The  OTC markets  have traditionally been defined as non exchange markets. Where the expression applies, OTC markets are made up of broker-dealer houses that execute transactions on behalf of client accounts as well as their own. In addition, included are transactions executed directly by trading counter parties. Almost all federal, municipal, and corporate bonds are traded in the OTC markets as well as many derivative products, structured products, and shares of smaller corporations.  

Securities brokers and dealers in the OTC markets are members of FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which absorbed the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD). FINRA is an independent, self-regulated agency cooperating with the SEC. As of March 2017, 3819 broker/dealer firms and 634,874 registered representatives were regulated by FINRA. FINRA also operates the largest securities dispute resolution forum in the world, closing 3635 arbitration s and 172 mediations in 2016.  

OTC markets for equities are comprised of a number of venues. For example, the Overthe-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is an inter dealer electronic quotation system that displays real-time quotes, last-sale prices, and volume information for many OTC equity securities. OTCBB is not an exchange; securities are not actually traded through the system. OTCBB securities include national, regional, and foreign equity issues, warrants, unit investment trust issues (UITs), American depositary receipts (ADRs), and direct participation programs issues (DPPs). Investors do not have direct access to OTCBB.  

Another important OTC equity venue is the OTC Markets Group, Inc., informally known as “Pink Sheets.” This group also facilitates trading of shares of nonlisted companies, providing quotation, messaging, and information services to broker-dealers. Pink Sheets maintains categories based on the level of financial and corporate disclosure provided by companies quoted through their systems. For example, shares quoted in OTCQX, the top tier of the OTC market, meet certain financial standards, and are subject to qualitative reviews. OTCQB tier companies (mid-tier) also provide significant information disclosure to the marketplace. Pink is the third tier of the OTC market and is further categorized into three tiers characterized by their information disclosure requirements, which might be virtually nonexistent in the lowest tier.  
The OTC markets also include the so-called third and fourth markets. Third markets exist for listed securities traded between brokers off any exchange. Fourth markets are those where institutions trade securities directly among themselves in the so-called  upstairs markets . These markets are particularly important for bank-to-bank derivatives and structured products transactions. Institutions have used these markets for block trades (transactions involving more than 10,000 shares or  $\mathbb{\S200,000}$   of a security), particularly when such a transaction might pose liquidity problems on an exchange. The upstairs markets might account for as much as half of all stock transactions volume, although statistics are difficult to estimate and confirm.  

Stock exchanges and other markets vary with respect to how orders are intermediate d. For example, the NYSE permits many of its members to act as both agents (brokers) and dealers. This means that an order counter party might be either a dealer trading on her own account or a broker representing a client. On the other hand, the OTC markets are usually dealer markets, where investors transact only with or through dealers.  

# Alternative Trading Systems  

An ATS might be defined as a securities trading venue that is not registered with the SEC as an exchange. Alternative trading systems provide electronic forums for linking dealers with each other and with institutional investors. They also match and cross trades in the upstairs market (fourth market). We will discuss the more precise SEC definition shortly. The four primary types of ATSs are:  

1.  Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) , which are virtual meeting places and screenbased systems for trading securities. These ECNs include or have included Bloomberg Tradebook (which bills itself as a more comprehensive full-service agency broker), CBSX, and Direct Edge. Some ECNs have been acquired by or are now exchanges.

 2.  Dark Pools and “Crossing Networks,”  where quotations for share blocks are matched anonymously. These ATSs include or have included Credit Suisse Cross finder, Goldman Sachs Sigma X2, Liquidnet, Posit (ITGP), MS Pool (Morgan Stanley), and CITIBLOC (Citigroup). Participants in crossing markets often enjoy reduced transactions costs and anonymity but often must wait for counter party orders to accumulate before transactions can be executed.

 3.  Internal iz ation Crossing Networks  such as UBS PIN that allows brokers or firms to fill orders from that firm’s own internal supply of stock.

 4.  Voice-Brokered Third-Party Matching .  

A small listing of alternative trading systems is provided in  Table 2.3 . As of October 2021, the SEC listed a total of 85 Alternative Trading Systems with Form ATS on file ( Securities and Exchange Commission, 2021a ).

The most important of the ECNs dealing with equities have included  BRUT  (purchased by NASDAQ)  Instinet ,  REDIBook , and  Archipelago , with the latter two having merged in 2002. Instinet, the first of the ECNs, was founded in 1967 as Institutional Networks, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Reuters in 1987, took its shares through an IPO in 2001 and merged with Island shortly afterwards before going private again in 2005. The focus of Instinet’s activities was block trading (10,000 or more shares), seeking to provide its clients with a high level of confidentiality. Major ECNs dealing with foreign exchange include Hotspot and Currenex.  

The SEC defines an ATS to be an automated system that centralizes, displays, crosses, matches, or otherwise executes trading interest, but is not currently registered with the Commission as a national security exchange or operated by a registered securities association. However, the SEC had defined the term “exchange” to include “any organization, association, or group of persons that: (1) Brings together the orders of multiple buyers and sellers; and (2) uses established non discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of a trade.” Under this new definition, at least several ATSs might be considered exchanges, even if they are not the traditional “brick-and-mortar” type. In the past few years, several large ATSs, including BATS and DirectEdge, have registered with the SEC as exchanges. Thus, consider the following definition provided by Rule 300(a) of SEC Regulation ATS:  

Alternative trading system means any organization, association, person, group of persons, or system:  

1.  That constitutes, maintains, or provides a market place or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange within the meaning of Rule 3b-16 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and  
2.  That does not: i.  Set rules governing the conduct of subscribers other than the conduct of such subscribers’ trading on such organization, association, person, group of persons, or system; or ii.  Discipline subscribers other than by exclusion from trading.  

What the ATS does  not  do is what distinguishes it from an exchange. However, these sorts of distinctions might remain in flux elsewhere.  

The NYSE share of NYSE-listed trade executions have been steadily dropping as electronic exchanges and ATSs have grown in importance. For example, NYSE’s share of trading in its own listed stocks declined to   $67.3\%$   by December 2006, then down further to  $22.5\%$   by December 2013 ( Baldauf & Mollner, 2020; NYSE Euronext, 2014; Weber, 2007 ). Table 2.4  provides a listing of important U.S. equity markets along with their shares of daily volume as of January 2021. Notice towards the bottom of  Table 2.4  that FINRA and

Since the 1990s, equity markets have become less concentrated as the major exchanges have lost their monopolies. The newer, more  fragmented  markets enable investors to route their orders to a number of different centers that compete for order flow. Whereas concentrated markets tend to provide for enhanced price transparency, reduced search costs for liquidity, fewer arbitrage-producing price discrepancies, fewer front-running opportunities (see Chapter 13), and potentially greater depth, the older concentrated markets suffered from many of the drawbacks that seem associated with monopoly, including higher trading costs. In the more fragmented markets, technology has improved (causal relationships go both ways), and market innovations are both more substantial and more quickly implemented. Thus, transactions are more quickly executed and their costs have diminished considerably.  

# 2.4 THE DECLINE OF BRICK AND MORTAR  

The natural monopoly power associated with the old exchange-based, open-outcry stock markets owes its early existence to a nearly complete absence of technology and communication systems. Investors were far too dispersed to conduct unaided securities transactions, and security traders required a central physical meeting site for competitive executions. This site or exchange enabled large networks of local broker offices to execute securities transactions on behalf of these widely dispersed investors. New York’s Wall Street district provided an excellent venue for this purpose and the regional exchanges filled specific niches in the securities markets. As telecommunication technology advanced in the early decades of the 20th century offering market access to millions of investors, U. S. securities markets nearly self-destructed, only to be salvaged by regulatory authorities and intense efforts by exchanges to curb market abuse. Exchanges have since facilitated monitoring for regulatory compliance in much the same manner that they facilitate trading. Shortly after passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the SEC gained authority over the exchanges that, in turn, monitored and regulated their members.  

Until the mid-1970s, brokerage firms maintained their monopoly power with a system of fixed transaction fees. All of their transactions were routed through the principal exchanges and off-floor markets. Exchanges had limited competition for securities listings. The primary sources of competition among securities brokers were in the arrays of services that they offered. After price controls were lifted in 1975, the market saw formation of a number of discount brokerage houses that unbundled non transaction services such as research and were able to offer drastically reduced execution costs. The market segmented to an extent, with some firms offering only transaction executions and others offering the full array of brokerage house services such as client advice. However, the vast majority of transactions were still routed through the principal exchanges and off-floor markets.  

More recent technological developments in telecommunications, wireless communications, the Internet, and globalization have imposed enormous competitive pressures on U.S. securities exchanges. With the electronic NASDAQ system beginning in 1971, competition from foreign fully automated exchanges trading U.S. securities (e.g., Eurex), development of fully automated exchanges in the United States (e.g., the ISE), and ECNs, such as the Instinet, Island, and Posit systems that allowed direct trading between institutions, exchanges have been forced to accept and even innovate technological development to survive.  
The natural monopoly enjoyed by traditional brick-and-mortar markets had been enhanced by a number of barriers to entry. Overhead outlays were required for large investments in office facilities, communications equipment, fixed exchange fees and memberships, broker training and licensing, and building client bases. Each of these overhead outlays was accompanied by significant time lags and increasing time required for recapturing initial investments (payback periods). In addition, traditional brokerage offices experienced significant returns to scale (see  Stigler, 1961 ), making it almost impossible for smaller and newer firms to compete against larger better-established firms. Each of these barriers to entry into the securities brokerage business applies to the creation of overheadintensive, brick-and-mortar securities exchanges and markets. For example, in the late 1990s, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange constructed new futures pits that cost   $\S180$   million and   $\S228$   million, respectively. However, recent electronic and other technological developments, particularly the Internet, substantially relieve these costly barriers to entry. First, most prospective clients already have Internet access and usage skills. Transaction costs are substantially reduced through use of equipment already installed in client homes. Whereas the typical U.S. customer stock transaction executed through a phone call has a variable cost of about   $\S1$  , its cost is reduced to just  $\S0.02$   executed online. Similar disparities exist in open-outcry and electronic markets. For example, the open-outcry LIFFE charged about   $\S1.50$   per for long and short positions on the Bund futures contract in the late 1990s; its electronic German competitor DTB charged only  $\S0.66$   for the same contract. Open-outcry exchanges in the United States charged fees of approximately  $\S1.50$   per contract (see  Cavaletti, 1997 ).  

More significantly, overhead expenses for Internet brokers run approximately   $1\%$   of assets, as opposed to   $2\%$   to   $3\%$   for brick-and-mortar offices. Time required for Internet brokerage firm start-ups is substantially reduced relative to brick-and-mortar start-ups. In addition, the Internet and other technological advances have reduced economies of scale for brokerage firms. For example, as the Internet has largely replaced “cold calling,” the fixed costs of seeking and soliciting the business of small clients have dropped significantly. Furthermore, clients of electronic brokers trade far more frequently than those of full-service brokers, with some estimates ranging to 10 to 25 times as frequent (Varian, 1998). Hence, smaller individual investors are able to play larger roles in securities markets at lower costs. The increased participation of smaller investors, acting as day traders, enables them to replace specialists and market makers, at least to some extent, in the provision of liquidity to the market. In addition, the reduction of scale economies has increased competition among brokerage firms, in large part because so many of their services (e.g., advice, loans, and cash management) could be unbundled and com mod it i zed through automation. Some of these services require very little initial capital outlay and no unique technology.  

Removal of fixed brokerage commissions has substantially increased competition in the brokerage industry as reduced costs of service provision have softened barriers to entry. Brokerage commissions and fees had fallen from an average of   $\S52.89$   per trade in early 1996 to   $\S15.67$   in mid-1998. By 2000, a few online brokerage services had temporarily reduced their commissions to zero, and most still charge less than   $\S15$   per transaction. In fact, many stock brokers, including Robinhood Financial and Public.com, charge no commissions at all on stock trades (see end-of-chapter Exercise 4 for a discussion of this).   This particular scenario is interesting and quite controversial because it seems to be in part a direct result of  payment for order flow , where brokerage firms and other institutions receive compensation from market makers (including high-frequency trading firms and internalizers) acting as wholesalers, electronic exchanges, market makers, and ATSs as payment for directing their order flow to those institutions or markets. However, this practice has grown more widespread, and in 2010, even the NYSE began making payments for order flow to providers of liquidity (traders whose orders that remove dealer inventory or orders from market backlogs). Barriers to entry based on ownership of physical facilities are disappearing, and existing firms are being forced to vary their product lines and merge into other institutions.  
Combinations, alliances, and mergers between exchanges have also enabled previously smaller and less efficient markets to compete against larger ones. These combinations have enabled exchanges and markets to mutually benefit from one another’s technological resources. Some of these combinations have been domestic such as OneChicago, LLC, an alliance created by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange to trade equity futures contracts and the Pacific Exchange and the Archipelago Exchange merger. On the international scene, the New York Mercantile Exchange opened a satellite open-outcry trading floor in Dublin for trading in a Brent crude oil futures contract and mergers among exchanges in other countries such as those forming Euronext and Eurex (combining the Deutsche Bo¨rse AG/SWX Swiss Exchange). Each of these latter combinations offered improvements in investors’ abilities to trade on a global basis.  

# Electronic versus Open Outcry  

Which trading and brokerage platforms result in lower trading costs? For example, does open outcry result in superior trading performance relative to electronic execution? In an interesting study,  Bakos et al. (2005) , with   $\S60{,}000$   provided by the Salomon Brothers Center at New York University’s Stern School, opened a series of accounts at various fullservice, discount and electronic securities brokers. Their commissions for 100-share lots averaged   $\S7.50$   for electronic brokers and   $\S47$   for full-service voice brokers. They found that full-service brokers were more likely to route orders to the principal exchanges than electronic brokers and that such orders were more likely to be improved. However, for smaller orders, these price improvement advantages are more than offset by the higher brokerage commissions. Hence, specialists and market makers on exchanges were able to provide better order executions while brokers using electronic markets charged smaller commissions. It appeared that smaller investors fared better with discount electronic brokers while larger transactions resulted in better after-commission executions on the principal exchanges.  
Many of the studies of electronic versus open-outcry trading have used bid-offer spreads as a liquidity metric (e.g.,  Battalio, Greene, & Jennings, 1997 ), where wider spreads indicate lower liquidity.  Shyy and Lee (1995)  found that spreads appeared to be wider in electronic markets than in open-outcry markets;  Pirrong (1996)  found just the opposite. Pirrong argued that mis communications and misunderstandings between trade participants reduce efficiency of open-outcry markets and that these issues are avoided in electronic markets. Regardless, time to execute trades is certainly reduced in electronic markets. In addition, screen-based trading has facilitated after-hours markets. Now, a number of exchanges are offering investors opportunities to trade after normal business hours.  

The evidence concerning the provision of liquidity by open-outcry exchange markets relative to electronic markets is both ambiguous and mixed (e.g.,  Breedon & Holland, 1997 ;  Pirrong, 1996 ). Some electronic systems have effectively eliminated driven floorbased, open-outcry markets. For example, Breedon and Holland describe how during 1997  1998, the computerized Eurex drew practically  $100\%$   of the trading in German Bund futures from the open outcry LIFFE, which had held a  $70\%$   market share only months earlier. By 2000, LIFFE had abandoned open outcry entirely for LIFFE CONNECT, a fully automated system. However, LIFFE did retain the bund options contracts, probably because of the more complicated strategies associated with them. In 1998, MATIF operated its open-outcry and electronic systems simultaneously. Within two weeks, the computerized system had taken all volume from the open-outcry markets that had to be closed. The Hong Kong Futures Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange both abandoned open outcry during this same period.  Frino, Hill, Jarnecic, and Aitken (2004)  found that spreads narrowed on the Sydney and Hong Kong Exchanges, whereas spreads widened on the LIFFE. In addition, according to Frino et al., bid-ask spreads on all three exchanges appear to widen in response to price volatility at a faster rate under electronic trading than with open-outcry trading, suggesting that the specialist-based system may offer better price continuity in periods of uncertainty.  

One of the difficulties of screen-based trading is the inability to efficiently disseminate significant amounts of information concerning trades. While it is easy enough for screens to display bid and offer prices, open outcry participants are able to more easily verbally communicate order types and combinations as well as other more complicated trade details. Such matters grow in importance when trade sizes are larger or when, for example, an options trader is attempting to leg into a spread (execute spread transactions one at a time) or other position. While screen-based trading provides for a greater level of anonymity, many traders prefer a market where their counter parties can be identified. In addition,  Sarkar and Tozzi (1998)  argue that open-outcry exchanges provide for more liquidity in more active markets while newer, less active issues are less likely to be found in open-outcry markets.  

One of the more controversial aspects of electronic brokerage transactions is that customers do not normally exercise their right to direct trade order routings and that orders are not routed in their entireties to the markets with the best prices. Brokers do have a responsibility to route orders to the market with the best execution (or price, depending on the particularly regulatory regime), a rather ambiguous and difficult concept to implement, and one that few retail traders understand. Many brokers have agreements with order wholesalers or market makers such as KCG Holdings, Inc. and Citadel Securities, LLC., which in turn, route orders so as to internalize them (execute against their own inventory) to capture larger spreads. Other orders might result in compensation by exchanges and markets to route transactions to them. These exchanges and market makers pay wholesalers for order flow that result in profits to wholesalers, creating conflicts of interest in dealings with clients. This practice, “payment for order flow,” was pioneered by the infamous Ponzi schemer Bernard Madoff.   Thus, a retail brokerage firm will receive payments from a wholesaler that receives payments from an exchange or other market for routing orders to that market. For example, in 1999, the Knight/Trimark Group was paid   $\S138.7$   million for order flow, with over   $10\%$   of this sum received from Ameritrade, a large electronic brokerage firm ( Bakos et al., 2005 ). TD Ameritrade recorded revenue of approximately   $\S1.15$  billion in 2020 from payments for order flow. Specialists and many market makers on the major exchanges resented this controversial practice of order flow payment and many discount retail brokerage clients seem unaware of it. But, as we discussed earlier ( Section 2.4 ), in early 2010 even the NYSE began making payments for order flow to providers of liquidity. While the conflicts of this practice are obvious, payment for order flow does subsidize brokerage operations, which in turn, might reduce client trading costs. In addition, the practice might enhance liquidity. However,  Rosov (2016)  argues that resultant conflicts of interest might more than offset the reduced trading costs.  
# 2.5 CROSSING NETWORKS AND UPSTAIRS MARKETS  

One of the most vexing problems faced by institutional traders is the price pressure, called  slippage , associated with large transactions. For example, placing a large sell order will force prices down against the seller. In fact, merely attempting to execute a large sell order reveals negative information to the market. To avoid adverse price effects of orders, traders often use  crossing networks , which are alternative trading systems that match buyers and sellers with respect to agreed-upon quantities. Crossing networks do not publicly display quotations, thereby enabling participants some degree of anonymity and insulating them from slippage. Trades are priced by reference to prices obtained from other markets rather than by the more traditional auction systems.   Traders using crossing networks announce their order sizes. The crossing network then matches buy and sell orders at prices obtained from more traditional auction markets such as the NYSE. This crossing procedure enables institutional traders to execute without exposing their order flow to competitors. The crossing network, by having prices determined elsewhere, also prevents the price impact or pressure typically associated with auctions of large blocks of shares. Because crossing networks do not reveal prices or client identities, and they represent non displayed liquidity, they are sometimes referred to as  dark pools of liquidity . In sum, these dark pools of liquidity accounted for  $37\%$   of U.S. equity volume in August 2014 ( Baldauf & Mollner, 2020 ).  

4 We will discuss payment for order flow and Bernard Madoff separately in Chapter 13.  

5 The  Securities and Exchange Commission (1998)  defines crossing networks as “systems that allow participants to enter unpriced orders to buy and sell securities. Orders are crossed at a specified time at a price derived from another market” (i.e., a continuous market such as the NYSE).  
As initially established, crossing networks provided ideal marketplaces for large passive investors such as index funds to transact for large blocks of securities, at prices based on published auction market bid-ask quotations, while avoiding slippage problems. However, in more recent years, several networks have reported smaller average transactions sizes as traders find a wider variety of uses for these trading venues. Several of these crossing networks have accommodated traders by providing electronic executions, many based on algorithms to determine order execution sizes and prices.  

The NASDAQ Crossing Network provides traders with opportunities to match orders at known benchmarks (e.g., the mid-point of the spread) or closing or other prices several times a day. For example, trades can be executed after regular market hours, providing liquidity outside normal trading sessions. The match price might be the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of all trades during the day (see Section 10.3 for details on VWAP). ITG’s Posit systems allow traders to enter order quantities that are matched during listing market trading sessions with execution prices at the midpoint of best bid and offer currently prevailing in the listing market.  

We discussed  Liquidnet  in Section 1.3, which is a negotiating venue that matches institutional buyers and sellers of large blocks of equity securities, enabling them to directly bargain and trade confidentially with one another. Liquidnet provides an electronic format for this negotiation process. Traders use the system by entering symbols for securities that they wish to buy or sell. If Liquidnet finds a potential match, it notifies the counter parties, who bargain anonymously with each other in a virtual meeting room using the Liquidnet system. This facility for bargaining distinguishes Liquidnet from the other crossing systems discussed here. Thus, trade counter parties negotiate directly with each other the terms of their trade. Counter parties will know prices from other markets, leaving relatively little room for significant pricing disagreements. If they come to terms, they report the transaction to Liquidnet, which arranges the transfer and takes a commission on each share.  

The New York Stock Exchange also conducts several after-hours crossing markets. First, the NYSE offers Crossing Session I from 4:15 to   $5{\cdot}00\;\mathrm{pm}$   after the NYSE closes regular floor trading. Crossing Session I, when in effect, enables traders to match single stock orders at closing price. In addition, the NYSE offers Crossing Session II from 4:00 to   $6{\cdot}30\ \mathrm{pm}$   to enable program trades for 15 or more securities, regardless of their value. Furthermore, the NYSE MatchPoint system was an electronic facility that matched aggregated orders at predetermined fixed times with prices that were derived from ongoing floor trading.  

# Internal iz ation  

Internal iz ation occurs when brokers execute their own client buy orders against their own client sell orders, representing both sides of a trade and without routing them to central markets. Internal iz ation allows brokers to execute transactions more easily and at a lower cost. Of course, internal iz ation does present some obvious potential problems. First, internal iz ation may inhibit the broker’s ability to properly represent the client as the client’s agent, particularly when the broker is also representing a client on the other side of the transaction or acting as a dealer. Second, internal iz ation results in fewer transactions being executed in the central market, which increases market fragmentation and reduces transparency and potential price competition. These problems can lead to reduced liquidity and increased price volatility in the central market. Internal iz ation can also lead to violations of price and time priority. Perhaps worse for the broker’s clients, the transaction may be more susceptible to manipulation or may not be executed at the best possible prices, consistent with the point above concerning the broker’s ability to represent the client.  
Internal iz ation of customer orders is not possible for options markets transactions when options transactions must be executed on options exchanges as per rules of each options exchange. However, some brokerage firms will internalize or submit their own orders simultaneously with their customer orders, such that there is a reasonable possibility that they will execute against each other. On the other hand, the options exchange trading crowd might “break  $\ensuremath{\mathbf{up}}^{\prime\prime}$   one or both sides of the orders, perhaps at better prices, so that the brokerage firm only participates in the executions of parts of one or both orders.  

# 2.6 FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKETS  

In terms of dollar volume, the U.S. markets for debt instruments are larger than for any other type of security. Debt markets, including markets for mortgages, are more than twice as large as stock markets. Debt securities, sold for the purpose of raising capital, are IOUs issued by a variety of types of organizations, including federal, state, and local governments and their agencies, as well as by corporations and other institutions. A debt security represents a claim on the issuer for a fixed series of future payments. For example, a debt security might specify for its owner to receive a stated series of interest payments until the instrument matures. The instrument might also provide for principal repayment when the instrument matures. These securities are issued in  primary markets and then traded in  secondary markets , just as are other financial instruments. Debt securities will normally specify terms of payment, including amounts and dates, collateral and priority (who is to be paid first in the event of issuer financial distress). Among the various types of debt securities are bonds, notes, mortgages, and Treasury instruments. Many of the fixed income securities with shorter terms to maturity are considered to be money market instruments.  

# U.S. Treasury Securities and Markets  

The U.S. Treasury is the largest issuer of debt securities in the world. In 2020, the U.S. Treasury (technically, the Fed) auctioned   $\S19.683\$   trillion in Treasury instruments through 503 public auctions using the Treasury Automated Auction Processing System (TAAPS). The federal government raises (borrows) money through the sale of U.S. Treasury issues including Treasury bills (T-Bills), Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, Treasury inflationprotected Securities (TIPS), and Floating Rate Notes (FRNs). By purchasing Treasury issues, an investor is loaning the government money. Notwithstanding the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, and several threats of repeat crises, the U.S. federal government has proven to be an extremely reliable debtor (at least it has made good on all of its Treasury obligations with nearly   $100\%$   consistency). Treasury issues are fully backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which has substantial resources due to its ability to tax citizens, create money and borrow more. Thus, these securities are generally expected to have the lowest default risk and should generally be safer than the safest of corporate bonds or short-term notes.  
Aside from occasionally issued cash management bills (CMBs) with maturities as short as 1 day, the Treasury obligations with the shortest terms to maturity are  Treasury bills . They typically mature in less than one year (4, 13, 26 or 52 weeks). These issues are sold as pure discount debt securities, meaning that their purchasers receive no explicit interest payments. Instead, investors purchase them at a discount from their maturity or face values. Such pure discount instruments are also known as zero-coupon issues.  

One variation on the T-Bill issue is a so-called  STRIP , issued through the U.S. Treasury’s  Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities  (STRIPS) program beginning in 1985. While by no means identical to T-Bills, STRIPS are portfolios of singlepayment instruments sold by the Treasury in blocks with varying maturities. For example, a single STRIP maturing at the end of five years from now would provide for a fixed payment at that time. Individual STRIPS sold in blocks can be “stripped” from the block and sold in secondary markets.  

In addition to the short-term pure discount instrument issues discussed above, the Treasury also offers a number of longer-term coupon issues. For example,  Treasury notes (T-Notes) have maturities ranging from 1 to 10 years (typically, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years) and make semi-annual interest payments. Similarly,  Treasury bonds  (T-Bonds) typically range in maturity from 10 to 30 years and make semi-annual interest payments. Bonds issued prior to 1985 were frequently callable, meaning that the Treasury maintained an option to repurchase them from investors at a stated price. The last such call occurred in 2009. More than half the marketable Treasury debt outstanding as of 2000 was in the form of notes, while bills and bonds each represented about  $20\%$  .  

Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPs) are currently offered with 5-, 10-, and 30- year maturities, and have coupon and principal amounts adjusted by the Consumer Price Index. Floating rate notes are currently offered with 2-year maturities and have coupon rates indexed to the most recent 13-week Treasury bill offering. The U.S. Treasury also offers non marketable issues such as  Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds ,  Series I U.S. Savings Bonds , and  Series H U.S. Savings Bonds.  These savings bonds are normally issued only to individuals and cannot be traded among investors. Such issues are often subject to certain restrictions (such as a  $\S5000$   maximum level of Series EE purchases per year). These bonds can be purchased through most banks and savings institutions, and many businesses maintain plans through which their employees can purchase savings bonds through payroll deduction programs.  

# Agency and Government-Sponsored Enterprise Issues  

The U.S. federal government has created and sponsored a number of institutions known as  agencies  and  government-sponsored enterprises . These institutions enable the government to make funds available for a number of policy-related functions. Among the oldest of these government-sponsored enterprises is the  Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae), created in 1938 by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to expand the flow of money to housing markets during the Great Depression. This institution was intended to spur investment into real estate, improve employment during the depression, and to help enable people to purchase homes. The primary functions of Fannie Mae were to purchase, hold, and sell FHA-insured (and, after World War II, Veterans Administration  insured) mortgage loans originated by private lenders. Created with a congressional charter, and then privatized in 1968, FNMA was, until September 2008, one of the largest privately owned corporations in the United States with shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange. However, the institution was delisted and taken over by the federal government during the financial crisis of 2008. The firm received a bail-out package from the federal government to support it until 2012, and remains owned by the federal government.  
FNMA facilitates capital acquisition in the mortgage industry through the creation of mortgage-backed securities , instruments denoting ownership in these pools of mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities are created by their sponsors who purchase residential mortgages from banks and thrift institutions and then create debt and other securities backed by pools of these mortgages. In effect, FNMA purchases the mortgage obligations held by banks and thrifts, repackages them as debt security portfolios, insures them, and re-sells them to the general public. The funds raised by the sale of these securities are then used to purchase additional mortgages from banks, increasing capital available to the mortgage and housing markets. These portfolios of mortgage-backed securities are also called  passthrough securities  because the interest and principal obligations associated with the mortgages are passed through to the security holders and enable banks with relatively short liability terms to remove 30-year mortgage assets from their balance sheets.  

Typical issues of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as those of FNMA do not have the full faith and credit backing of the federal government as do the bulk of agency issues such as those of GNMA. Separating and repackaging the credit risk implications of FNMA issues through the process of synthetic se curit iz ation enhances the market potential of GSE issues. Credit risk derivatives such as synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDSs) created through this process are marketed separately from the mortgages with which they were initially created.  

The  Government National Mortgage Association  (GNMA or Ginnie Mae), established by Congress in 1968 as a “spin-off” of FNMA, is a corporation owned by the U.S. federal government. GNMA guarantees mortgage-backed securities for the FHA (Federal Housing Administration), Veterans Administration (VA), and other agency mortgage issues. Many mortgages issued by these agencies are targeted towards particular groups such as lowerincome or veteran families, and experience relatively high default rates. The mortgages issued by agencies, such as GNMA, unlike government-sponsored enterprises such as FNMA, are  full faith and credit instruments , meaning that the U.S. federal government backs them with its full ability to tax, borrow, and create money.  

The  Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  (FHLMC or Freddie Mac), a stockholder corporation created in 1970 by the federal government, also creates, insures, services, and sells pass-through securities related to single family and multi family residential mortgages. Freddie Mac’s creation was essentially to provide competition in the secondary mortgage market to the virtual monopoly granted to Fannie Mae, thanks to federal protections enjoyed by Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were intended to compete in a “separate but equal” regulatory framework. Freddie Mac was also placed in conserva tor ship by the federal government during the financial crisis of 2008  2009. Freddie Mac is currently a government-owned corporation.  
The  Student Loan Marketing Association  (SLMA or Sallie Mae) was established in 1972 to create, insure, and sell pass-through securities related to student loans. While originally created as a government agency in 1972, the company began a privatization process in 1997 that was completed in 2004. The institution is now a publicly traded firm known as SLM Corporation , and originates, services, and collects private student loans. In 2014, the firm spun off its federal student loan servicing businesses into a separately traded company known as Navient Corporation.  

# Municipal Securities and Markets  

The municipal securities markets owe much of their success to the U.S. federal taxation code that permits investors in municipal instruments to omit from their taxable income any interest payments received on these issues. Thus, as of 2021, interest received on municipal bonds normally need not be declared as part of personal income subject to federal income taxation. This feature makes municipal bonds more attractive to investors, particularly those in higher income tax brackets, enabling state and municipal issuers to offer these bonds at reduced interest rates. However, such municipal bonds are more difficult to market to tax exempt institutions, pension funds, individuals in low income tax brackets and mutual funds because they do not receive enough benefit from the income tax exemptions to offset their low interest rates.  

Several types of municipal issues are offered by state and local governments. The first, so-called  general obligation bonds , are full-faith and credit bonds. This means that the issuer backs the bonds to the fullest extent possible, given its assets and other obligations. However, municipal issuers usually lack the unlimited taxing and money creation abilities of the federal government. Thus, default risk analysis and ratings are important.  Limited obligation bonds  provide for the issue to be backed only by specific resources or assets. For example, a revenue bond may be backed only by the cash flows generated by a specific asset such as a toll bridge.  

Most municipal issues are rated for default risk by private rating agencies such as  Fitch . Many municipal issues are insured by private insurance institutions. This insurance is intended to mitigate the default risk associated with the issue, and make them more attractive to investors. This reduced risk enables issuers to offer bonds with reduced interest rates to the public. Among the larger insurers of municipal bonds are the AMBAC Assurance Corporation, the National Public Finance Guaranty Corp., the Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), MBIA Insurance Corporation, and the Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.  

While most municipal issues are income tax exempt at the federal level, and, under certain circumstances at state and local levels as well, not all are tax exempt, and some municipal issues qualify for other types of benefits. For example, the Build America Bonds (BABs) program, created to help revive the American building industry during the 2009  2010 recession ke taxable interest payments to bond holders, but allow for issuers to receive either 35% federal subsidies on interest payments that they make or, instead, offer special tax credits for the bondholder. As with typical municipal bonds, these federal programs reduce the net cost of financing with these municipal bonds. These long-term bonds are often more marketable than their tax-exempt counterparts to tax exempt institutions, pension funds, and mutual funds because their interest rates are higher. Somewhat similar taxable municipal issues include tax credit bonds, which include qualified school construction bonds, qualified zone academy bonds, clean renewable energy bonds, and qualified energy conservation bonds. These bonds offer similar subsidy or tax considerations.  
# Money Market Issues of Financial Institutions  

Non government financial institutions are obviously significant issuers and borrowers in the primary markets for debt instruments. For example, the  federal funds  markets allow banks and other depository institutions to borrow from one another to meet Federal Reserve requirements. Essentially, this market provides that excess reserves of one bank may be loaned to other banks for satisfaction of U.S. central bank reserve requirements. The rate at which these loans are extended is referred to as the  federal funds rate .  

Normally, bank accounts are not regarded as marketable securities. One exception to this is the  negotiable certificates of deposit  (a type of jumbo CD). This is a tradable depository institution CD account with a denomination or balance exceeding   $\mathbb{\S}100{,}000$  . The amounts by which jumbo CDs exceed  $\S250{,}000$   are not covered by FDIC insurance. Negotiable CDs are often purchased by wealthy individual investors, financial institutions, corporate treasuries, and by  money market mutual funds , which are created by banks and investment institutions for the purpose of pooling together depositor or investor funds.  

Banker’s acceptances  are originated when a bank accepts responsibility for paying a client’s loan or assuming some other financial responsibility on behalf of a client. Because the bank is likely to be regarded as a good credit risk, these acceptances are usually easily marketable as securities.  

Repurchase agreements  (repos) are issued by financial institutions (usually securities firms and banks) acknowledging the sale of assets (typically treasuries and fixed-income instruments) and a subsequent agreement to repurchase at a higher price in the near term. This agreement is essentially the same as a collateralized short-term loan; the securities (collateral) reduce credit risk, and the ability of the buyer to be the seller in subsequent repo agreement reduces liquidity risk. Both reductions in risk serve to reduce the cost of the loan to the original repo seller. The repo rate is determined by the price at termination relative to the price at the initiation of the agreement, then adjusted for time. The counter party institution buying the securities with the agreement to resell them is said to be taking a  reverse repo .  

# Corporate Bonds and Markets  

Corporations are also important issuers of debt securities. Large, well-known, creditworthy firms, including financial institutions, needing to borrow for a short period of time may issue large denomination short-term notes frequently referred to as  commercial paper . Well-developed markets exist for these short-term promissory notes, though secondary markets tend to be inactive. Firms requiring funds for longer periods of time may issue corporate bonds . Many issues are rated by major credit rating agencies, as we will discuss later. These longer-term instruments are often issued with a variety of features, including call ability, convertibility, sinking fund provisions, and so on. There are many different types of corporate bonds. The terms of the bond will be specified in a contract known as a bond indenture . In addition, firms may make bank commercial loans, although secondary markets for bank loans tend to be limited in size and scope.  
Callable bonds  can be  called  by the issuing institution at its option. This means that the issuing institution has the right to pay off the callable bond before its maturity date. The callable bond typically has a  call date  associated with it as well as a  call price . The call date is the first date (and perhaps only date) that the bond can be repurchased by the issuing institution. The call price is normally set higher than the bond’s par value and represents the price that the issuing institution agrees to pay the bond owners. Because the issuing institution retains the option to force early retirement of callable debt, the call provision can be expected to reduce the market value of the callable bond relative to otherwise comparable non callable bonds.  

Convertible  bonds can be convertible by bond holders into equity or other securities. This normally means that the convertible bondholder has the right to exchange the convertible bond for a specified number of shares of common stock or some other security. The conver tibi lit y provision of such a bond enhances its value relative to otherwise comparable non convertible bonds.  

Debentures  are not backed by collateral. However, they and other bonds can have a  sinking fund  provision to provide for additional repayment assurance for bond holders. One type of sinking fund provision has the issuing institution placing specified sums of money into a fund at specified dates that will be accumulated over time to ensure full satisfaction of the firm’s obligation to bond holders. Alternatively, sinking funds will be used to retire associated debt early. The debt retirement can be effected either in the open market at prevailing market prices or called back by the issuing firm. The call can occur at the call price if specified in the bond indenture or, if so provided by the indenture, called at random by the issuing firm.  Serial bonds  are issued in series with staggered maturity dates.  

Many more innovative bonds have been offered in the market.  Floating rate  bonds have coupon rates that rise and fall with market interest rates;  reverse floaters  have coupon rates that move in the opposite direction of market interest rates.  Indexed bonds  have coupon rates that are tied to the price level of a particular commodity like oil or some other value such as the inflation rate.  Catastrophe bonds  make payments that depend on whether some disaster occurs, such as an earthquake in California or a hurricane in Florida. These catastrophe bonds provide a sort of insurance for issuers against the occurrence of the disaster. In some respects, purchasers of these bonds are providing insurance to the issuers.  

The predecessor to the NYSE was established in 1792 as a venue for trading bonds. Since then, corporate and later municipal and Treasury bonds have been traded on organized exchanges and in the OTC markets, with the relative importance of these markets changing over time. While over 1000 bonds trade on “NYSE Bonds,” the largest centralized corporate bond market in the United States, the majority of trades for corporate bonds occur in the OTC markets. FINRA TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) provides corporate bond trading data to the public, as all FINRA member broker/dealers are required to report OTC corporate bond transactions data to TRACE.  
# Credit Ratings and Credit Agencies  

Most publicly traded corporate bonds are rated by well-known agencies with respect to anticipated default risk. Corporations pay institutions such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s to rate the risk of their issues, although a few credit agencies, including EganJones, have received revenues from investor subscribers. Both of these credit rating agencies are registered with the SEC as NRSROs, Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, which allow them to rate credit worthiness for purposes on regulatory suitability to be purchased by banks. Other U.S. NRSROs include Fitch, A.M. Best, HR Ratings, Japan Credit Rating Agency, LACE Financial Corp., Rating and Investment Inc., Morningstar Credit Ratings LLC, and DBRS Ltd. Bonds without ratings assigned by these agencies can be very difficult to sell; in fact, many institutions face regulatory restrictions on purchasing bonds that are either unrated by NRSROs or have ratings below a given level. These constraints provide issuing companies with incentives to seek ratings from NRSROs. In past years, particularly before the financial crisis of 2007  2009, reputations enjoyed by these rating agencies had generally been quite solid.   In fact, as indicated above, numerous international and federal government regulatory agencies including the SEC and the Fed sanction NRSROs, and constrain or limit banks and other institutions’ investment in low-rated instruments. For example, Basel II guidelines allow for “external credit assessment institutions” ratings for assessing bank risk. The SEC allows investment banks and broker-dealers to use credit ratings from NRSROs listed above for similar purposes. In effect, rating agencies can serve as for-profit regulatory authorities. Federal regulatory agencies such as the FDIC can prohibit financial institutions from buying risky bonds, while credit agencies determine which bonds are risky. For example, federally chartered banks are often restricted from purchasing bonds with ratings below investment grade (BBB or higher are investment grade). Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s use the rating schemes depicted in  Table 2.5 , though the actual rating categories can be more finely graded with the addition of a plus or minus sign and/or with a numerical value. Other rating agencies use similar schemes.  

While credit rating agencies have enjoyed many decades of strong reputation and success, many have been rounded criticized for their failures leading to the 2006  2008 U.S. housing crisis and the 2010/2011 European Union (EU) debt crisis. Many critics have argued that these agencies are often too slow in responding to dramatic shifts in market conditions and that traders are often much faster at responding to such shifts. For example, Enron bonds were rated triple-A by both major agencies until only a few days before the company filed for its 2001 bankruptcy protection. The agencies also seemed to miss troubles brewing at WorldCom,  
TABLE 2.5 Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Corporate Bond Ratings

Finer rating gradations noted with plus, minus and numerical values are omitted from this table.  

Parmalat, and Delphi until just before their bankruptcy filings, as well as conditions leading to the 2006  2008 subprime crises, particularly with respect to mortgage-backed securities. In fact, several credit rating agencies maintain investment grade ratings for Lehman Brothers as late as the morning of its September 2008 bankruptcy filing. Nevertheless, bond rating agencies do play a crucial role in the evaluation of default risk.  

Bonds rated BBB (or Baa) and higher are typically referred to as investment-grade bonds, while bonds below this level are considered speculative grade. Speculative-grade bonds are often called  junk bonds . There is significant evidence that these bond ratings are highly correlated with incidence of default, suggesting that these agencies are least reasonably useful in forecasting default and indicating default risk. Furthermore, it is fairly unusual for ratings provided by these agencies to differ by more than one grade. Bond markets seem to agree with these statistical findings, pricing bonds such that their yields are strongly inversely correlated with bond ratings.  

Credit rating agencies rate a variety of corporate, municipal, and financial institution issues. For example, S&P, Moody’s, Fitch, and DBRS rate commercial paper. Moody’s uses the lettering system P1, P2, and P3 to indicate superior, satisfactory and adequate ratings. S&P follows a similar system with A1, A2, A3, B, C, and D ratings, Fitch with F1 to F5 and DBRS with R1, R2, and R3.  

Bond rating agencies make extensive use of financial statement and ratio analysis to compute their ratings. Such analyses are frequently supplemented by statistical techniques such as  multi discriminate analysis ,  probit , and  logit  modeling. While their ratings in the past have been almost universally accepted in financial markets, even to the extent that numerous SEC, Federal Reserve, and other regulations have been based on these ratings, there have been problems with the ratings:  

1.  Many rating agencies are paid by the firms that issue debt instruments, creating potential conflicts of interest.  
2.  Rating services have provided consulting services to issuing firms, advising them on strategies to improve their ratings. However, such services have been restricted by the Credit Rating Reform Act of 2006, Dodd-Frank and other legislation (see Chapter 5).

 3.  Credit agencies have been accused of strong arming clients and potential clients. For example, Moody’s published an “unsolicited” rating of Hannover Re, a German reinsurance firm. It sent a letter to Hannover indicating that “it looked forward to the day Hannover would be willing to pay” ( Klein, 2004 ). Hannover management refused payment, perhaps based on its paid use of two competing ratings agencies for its debt. Moody’s continued to rate Hannover debt, which continued refusing to make payments. Over time, Moody’s cut Hannover ratings to junk status, despite high ratings given by other agencies.

 4.  As mentioned above, rating agencies have missed major bond crises and other scenarios when bonds should have been downgraded.

 5.  Numerous studies, including  Xia (2014) , have suggested that credit agencies lag the market in re-evaluating credit risk and updating ratings. In fact, since debt issuers often pay for credit ratings, credit rating agencies might even have an incentive to delay credit rating downgrades to avoid displeasing revenue sources.  

NRSROs are required to provide to the public performance statistics for the issues that they rate. These performance statistics are normally available on agency websites, and typically include default rates and transition (rating up- and down-grades) for their rated issues.  

# Euro currency Instruments and Markets  

Euro dollars  are freely convertible dollar-denominated time deposits outside the United States.   The banks may be non-U.S. banks, overseas branches of U.S. banks, or international banking facilities (not subject to reserve requirements). Eurodollar markets began after World War II when practically all currencies other than the U.S. dollar were perceived as unstable. Thus, most foreign trade between countries was denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the Soviet Union and Eastern European institutions were concerned that their dollars held in U.S. banks might be attached by U.S. residents in litigation with these countries. Thus, they dealt not with actual U.S. dollars, but merely denominated their debits and credits with dollars. Monies owed to them were simply offset by monies that they owed. In a sense, they dealt with “fake” euro dollars, but since their trading partners did also, and their accounts tended to “zero out” over time, this did not create significant problems. Their euro dollars were left in Western European banks. During the 1960s and 1970s, these markets thrived due to regulations imposed by the U.S. government such as Regulation Q (interest ceilings), Regulation M (reserve requirements), the Interest Equalization Tax imposed beginning in 1963 to tax interest payments on foreign debt sold in the United States, and restrictions placed on the use of domestic dollars outside the United States. More generally, euro currencies are loans or deposits denominated in currencies other than that of the country where the loan or deposit is created. Roughly  $65\%$   of euro currency loans are denominated in dollars.  
Euro credits (e.g., eurodollar credits) are bank loans denominated in currencies other than that of the country where the loan is extended. They are attractive due to very low interest rate spreads that are possible due to the large size of the loans and the lack of reserves, FDIC, and other requirements directly or indirectly affecting domestic loans and deposits. Their rates have traditionally been tied to the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate, based on a survey panel of interbank loans) and various U.S. rates that will be discussed later. However, there has been a widespread migration in contracts from use of LIBOR as a benchmark towards the  Secured Overnight Financing Rate  ( SOFR ), which is based on calculations drawn from the far more extensive U.S. Treasury repo markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced that the LIBOR should be phased out and replaced by June 30, 2023.  

Loan terms for Eurocredit instruments are usually less than five years, typically for six months.  Euro commercial paper  is the term given to short-term (usually less than six months, often just a few days) notes issued by large, particularly “credit worthy” institutions. Most commercial paper is not underwritten. The notes are generally very liquid (much more so than syndicated loans) and most are denominated in dollars. They are usually pure discount instruments. EMTNs are interest-bearing instruments usually issued in installments. Most are not underwritten. Eurobonds are generally underwritten bearer bonds denominated in currencies other than that of the country where the loan is extended.  

# 2.7 MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD  

As discussed above, the oldest continuously operating stock exchange is Euronext Amsterdam Bourse, which first traded stock of the East Indies Trading Company in 1602. The NYSE started trading in the streets; the Paris Exchange, now known as Euronext Paris, organized under Napoleon’s regime, started on a bridge (Pont au Change); and the London stock market started in a tavern. Traditional brick-and-mortar exchanges since have been any one of three basic types. The first, the  public bourse , is essentially a public institution, established by and operating under the authority of a government. However, most public bourses, including the Paris Bourse in 1990, have reorganized to become private bourses. The  private bourse , such as the NYSE, is a private institution established by independent investors and institutions. The NYSE has evolved into a publicly traded stock institution, although it is still a private bourse in this context. These exchanges are still subject to governmental regulation. Finally,  bankers’ bourses  exist where the primary dealers of securities are banks, and where commercial banking functions were not distinct from brokerage functions as was the case in the United States. In Germany, bankers’ bourses have served banks who were also the primary stockbrokers.  

As of 2021, the largest stock markets in terms of monetary volume are in New York (NYSE and NASDAQ), China, Europe, and the U.K. As of 2021, the NYSE listed equities exceeding   $\S26$   trillion in market value (see  Table 2.6 ), with Nasdaq gaining ground in recent years.   The United States and United Kingdom (UK) have long histories of funding business with publicly traded equity securities, whereas commercial bank funding has

played larger roles in Japan and Germany. This is one of the major reasons as to why the London stock markets are larger than those elsewhere in Europe, despite the relative small size of the UK economy relative to that of Europe.  

Since 1974, China, India, and the Pacific region have produced the largest growth rates in equity markets as a percentage of world equity markets. The combined proportions of these markets as a percentage of world markets have grown from   $16\%$   to   $32\%$   in 2010. Japan, China and India have been the most significant contributors to this figure. European equity markets as a percentage of the world total have increased from   $22\%$   to   $24\%$  . U.S. equity markets have remained fairly constant, declining from  $57\%$   to  $55\%$   of the world total.   Over this 43-year period, the world equity market has grown from less than  $\S900$   billion in 1974 to over   $\S69$   trillion as of 2020.  

Emerging markets are those that have some but not all of the characteristics of developed markets. While the term’s definition varies, and some economists even argue about whether the term still is useful, there is still some agreement as to where the term might apply. The BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, are considered to be the largest of the emerging economies. Notice in  Table 2.6  that China and India are represented in the world’s largest equity markets. Other emerging markets might include South Korea (though, it is arguably a developed country), Mexico, Indonesia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and South Africa. The Economist and Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) compile well-known lists and other information on emerging markets.  

Reports from ING Baring Securities and the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that U.S. ownership of foreign stocks has increased from  $\S41$   billion in 1985 to   $\S3.977$   trillion in 2010.   This increased investment has been the product of a number of factors, including improved investing technology, reduced constraints on capital mobility, a greater appreciation for benefits of diversification, and a belief in the potential for higher returns from foreign investment. Historically, European and Japanese investors have maintained higher levels of international investment, but U.S. equity portfolios have significantly increased foreign holdings.  
# 2.8 CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND MARKETS  

For transactions to be executed between countries with different currencies, some type of foreign exchange (also called currency exchange, forex, or FX) must take place. Foreign exchange is simply the trading of one currency for another. For example, an American tourist in France can exchange dollars from her bank account for euros at an automated teller machine (ATM) in Paris.  

Markets for foreign exchange are crucial for trade and the economies of most countries. The total monetary volume of foreign exchange markets is huge. The Bank for International Settlements, a major regulator and fac il it at or in markets for foreign exchange, estimated that the market for foreign exchange was approximately   $\S1.2$   trillion per day in 1996, growing to over  $\S6.6$   trillion daily by April 2019, making the exchange market the largest financial market in the world, larger than all world equity and bond markets combined.   Approximately  $\S2.4$   trillion of this volume involved spot contracts; the remainder involved forward, swap, and other derivative contracts. Almost two thirds of transactions involved counter parties trading from different countries.  

Why exchange currencies? Obviously, currency exchange is needed in many international transactions for consumption and investment. For example, a Canadian automobile leasing firm purchasing a fleet of Japanese automobiles will pay the Japanese manufacturer in yen, which it purchases with Canadian dollars. In addition, investors speculate on exchange rates, buying those currencies that they believe will increase in value and selling those that they believe will decline in value. Some speculators will borrow money in lowinterest rate economies and lend it in high-interest rate economies. Investors and companies exchange currencies to hedge their financial and business risks associated with international trade and financial transactions. Investors also exchange currencies to exploit arbitrage  opportunities; that is, they buy currencies in markets where they are under priced and sell them in markets where they are overpriced.  

# Exchange Rates  

Exchange rates  denote the number of units of one currency that must be given up for one unit of a second currency. For example, the direct exchange rate of one dollar in terms of the South African rand might be ZAR14, meaning that 14 rand are required to purchase one U.S. dollar. The indirect exchange rate is the inverse of the direct rate. Thus, if one U.S. dollar can be exchanged to purchase 14 South African rand, the direct exchange rate of rand for dollars is 14. Correspondingly, the indirect exchange rate of dollars for rand is 0.0729;  $\S0.0729$   is the cost of one rand.  
Foreign exchange rates are determined by supply and demand conditions. A variety of factors will affect these supply and demand conditions, including:  

1.  Government policies

 2.  Supply and demand conditions for commodities in the two countries

 3.  Income levels in the two countries

 4.  Interest rates in the two countries

 5.  The perceived risk of engaging in trade with the two countries  

As of 2019, the most commonly traded currencies in spot markets are the U.S. dollar

 (involved in  $89\%$   of all FX transactions), the EU euro   $(31\%)_{\!.}$  , the Japanese yen   $(17\%)$  , the UK pound   $(13\%)$  , and the Australian dollar   $(7\%)$  . The most common trading pair is the EUR/USD, representing approximately  $28\%$   of all FX transactions.  

# Cross Rates  

During the Bretton Woods regime following World War   $\operatorname{II},$   cross rates referred to the price of a currency other than the U.S. dollar in terms of the price of any other currency besides, again, the U.S. dollar. The Bretton Woods agreement provided that currencies would be pegged to the U.S. dollar. Thus, rates were normally expressed in dollars, although the term cross rate retains its meaning after the Bretton Woods system is largely obsolete.  Table 2.7  provides a listing of  cross rates  (the exchange rate or cost of one currency in terms of another) for several different major world currencies along with rates in dollars.  

The price of the Swiss franc (CHF) in terms of dollars is given in  Table 2.7  to be   $\mathbb{S}1.0217$  . The price of a U.S. dollar in terms of the UK pound is  d 0.7676. These two rates imply that the price of a Swiss franc in terms of the UK pound is   $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbb{S}1.0217\times£.7676=0.7824,}\end{array}$  , consistent with the cross rate given in  Table 2.7 .  

TABLE 2.7 Cross Currency Rates, May 17, 2017 
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/d8756b94b72efd857b6cf8d915957a53e99c22582414d9e683ee8872be608353.jpg)  
# Forward Exchange Rates and Contracts  

Exchange transactions can occur in either spot or forward markets. In the spot market, the exchange of one currency for another occurs when the agreement is made. For example, dollars may be exchanged for euros now in an agreement made now. This would be a spot market transaction. In a forward market transaction, the actual exchange of one currency for another actually occurs at a date later than that of the agreement. Thus, traders could agree now on an exchange rate for two currencies at a later date.  

A forward exchange contract is a contract specifying delivery of one currency for another at a later date. Thus, a forward exchange contract is simply a contract providing for the exchange of currency at some future date. Forward exchange contracts involve one position in each of two currencies:  

1.  Long: An investor has a “long” position in that currency that she will accept at the later date.  

2.  Short: An investor has a “short” position in that currency that she must deliver in the exchange.  

Forward exchange contracts will usually involve a third party to act as an intermediary between the exchange parties. This intermediary, generally a bank, is referred to as a market maker. The forward exchange rate, or forward rate, is the number of currency units that must be given up for one unit of a second currency at a later date. This rate may be quite different from the spot rate, which designates the number of currency units that must be exchanged for one unit of another currency now. Forward rates are likely to differ from spot rates simply because supply and demand conditions are likely to change over time. Thus, anticipated changes in the five factors listed above may cause forward rates to differ from spot rates.  

There are a number of reasons for participating in forward exchange markets. Many investors participate for the purpose of speculation; they may feel that they know which directions exchange rates will change, and therefore, take positions in contracts enabling them to profit from anticipated changes. Such speculation is often regarded as quite risky. Corporations often take short positions in forward contracts to lock in exchange rates for the dates that they must deliver cash to companies in other countries. Corporations might take long or short positions in contracts to diminish their exchange rate risk. Corporations might take short positions in forward exchange contracts to lock in the exchange rates for foreign-denominated cash flows they anticipate receiving. A smaller group of investors, known as arb it rage urs, purchase forward contracts, and then invest in one of a variety of offsetting securities (including offsetting forward contracts) for the purpose of profiting from market price discrepancies.  

Participants in forward exchange markets face a number of risks. Among these are:  

1.  Rate risk: Exchange rates may change in directions opposite to those anticipated by participants.

 2.  Credit risk: The other party to the contract may default by not delivering the currency specified in the contract. In many instances, an intermediary such as a large reputable commercial bank may act to ensure that one or both contracting parties will honor their agreements. Dealer reputation is key.  
3.  Liquidity risk: The market participant may have difficulty obtaining the currency he must deliver; he may be “stuck” with a currency that will be difficult to sell. Again, a number of intermediaries may improve liquidity by trading and making markets for various currencies.

 4.  Trading system risk: The trading platform, ECN, exchange, and other communication systems are all subject to malfunction or failure.  

Because a forward rate specifies the prices investors will pay for currencies at a later date, one might argue that the prevailing forward rate of exchange equals the expected spot rate at the time of currency delivery:  

$$
F_{0}=E[S_{t}]
$$  

Equation (2.1)  states that the forward rate of exchange prevailing at time 0 equals the rate of exchange expected for time  $t$  . Speculators will tend to force  Equation (2.1)  to hold, at least approximately, through their trading activity. However, it is important to remember that the forward rate is based on actual market prices of forward contracts whereas an expected spot rate is merely a prediction by an investor, using prevailing information about prices and other factors such as risk preferences and uncertainty to establish. Hence, there are good reasons for the two values to diverge, including inefficiencies in markets for currencies, commodities, and securities. Nevertheless, there are generally strong relationships between the two for many investors at most times.  

Forward markets can involve dealers executing individually negotiated transactions directly with one another through electronic trading systems or by telephone. Futures contracts are standardized transactions with standardized settlement dates on organized exchanges. While forward contracts frequently settle with delivery of the underlying asset, futures contracts typically provide for settlement by cash equivalence.  

# Futures Markets  

Futures contracts differ somewhat from forward contracts in that they are standardized and trade on exchanges, and typically provide for margin (collateral) and marking to the market (changes in margin requirements). That is, futures contracts are traded on exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange. These exchanges and their associated clearing corporations eliminate much of the credit risk and some of the liquidity risk associated with futures contracts. Of course, the rate risk and other forms of risk remain. Standardization of contracts limits the numbers of contracts that can be created, thereby enhancing trader interest in those that do trade. In addition, governments, exchanges, and brokerage houses require that futures traders maintain deposits (margin) to ensure that they will honor their obligations. Often, an investor must vary his margin, depending on the trading environment and the prices of the underlying currencies. This variance of margin, which increases as the value of the investor’s obligation increases and decreases as the obligation decreases, is referred to as “marking to the market.”  

In the United States, a clearing house serves as the intermediary for all futures transactions. Technically, contract participants are all obligated to the clearing house to settle their contracts. Futures trading in the United States, including the trading of FX contracts, is regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which functions in a manner similar to the SEC. The forward markets, which generally include only wellknown institutions, are self-regulated, and institutions that trade forward contracts are dependent on maintaining their reputations.  
Futures and forward contracts are used for hedging and for speculation. Arb it rage urs help maintain an efficient pricing system by seeking situations where contracts and currencies are mispriced relative to one another. Businesses with foreign customers and suppliers frequently use futures contracts to hedge their exchange rate risk. For example, consider a Japanese firm ordering a communications system from an American manufacturer for   $\S5{,}000{,}000$   payable upon delivery in six months. The Japanese firm is obliged to pay in dollars, but has no control over the price of dollars in yen; thus, it faces the risk that the value of the dollar will increase from its current price of, say,  f 100 per dollar. Since most U.S. firms expect to be paid for their products with dollars, many foreign firms and individuals with this type of exchange rate risk would be discouraged from purchasing American products. However, there are a number of types of derivative securities to control this risk. For example, the Japanese firm could purchase in American markets put options (options to sell) on  f 500,000,000 with an exercise price of   $\S0.01$   per yen. This purchase of puts would guarantee the Japanese firm a minimum selling price for  f 500,000,000 needed to purchase   $\S5{,}000{,}000$  . If the price of dollars were to decline, the Japanese would simply purchase the   $\S5{,}000{,}000$   in cash markets for fewer yen.  

# Currency Trading  

Professional currency traders participate in interbank and inter dealer markets as well as exchange markets for various types of contracts on currencies. The most important currency trading centers are located in London, with about  $37\%$   of total volume; New York,  $18\%$  ; Tokyo,   $6\%$  ; and Frankfurt, Zurich, Hong Kong, and Singapore with somewhat less. Note that the dispersion of markets implies that forex markets operate around the clock. Transactions can be executed between any two counter parties that agree to trade via the telephone or electronic network or trade through an exchange. To a large extent, currency trading is decentralized. Dealers can post or advertise their exchange rate bids and offers using an information or distribution network, such as Reuters and Nex Group.  

Many OTC trades proceed through a three-step process similar to the following:  

1.  A trader communicates by phone or electronically the currency pair and the amount he would like to trade with a given counterpart in trade.

 2.  The counter party responds with both a bid and an ask quotation.

 3.  The trader responds to the bid and ask quotations by buying, selling, or passing on both.  

The transaction is then executed if the trader agrees to buy or sell.  

# Inter dealer Brokers and Electronic Broking  

The interbank forex markets comprise transactions directly between banks and through electronic brokering platforms. Inter dealer brokers facilitate many of these transactions through highly developed trading platforms. The largest of these brokers, the UK-based NEX Group, formerly known as ICAP Plc, is very active in both voice and electronic markets, averaging over  $\S1.5$   trillion daily in all of its brokering services.  
FX dealers and certain other financial institutions are permitted to participate in the major electronic broking services. These services provide quotes, permit entry of quotes, and trade execution services. The largest of these with respect to forex trading is EBS BrokerTec, which was created as Electronic Broking Services, a joint venture of several of the world’s major foreign exchange market  making banks, and then ultimately acquired by BrokerTec in 2014 to form EBS BrokerTec. It provides quotations, data and news feeds, analytical services and handles close to  $\S200$   billion daily in spot FX transactions as well as contracts for several commodities. A major competitor is Reuters Eikon. These services permit straight-through processing, improving speed of transactions and reduced errors.  

# Futures and Other FX Markets  

Currency and interest rate futures are traded on numerous exchanges throughout the world. Among the U.S. exchanges listing currency futures are the International Monetary Market (IMM), a subsidiary of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), NASDAQ OMX (formerly the Philadelphia Board of Trade (PBOT)), the New York Board of Trade, and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Non-U.S. exchanges trading currencies and currency futures include the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE, owned by the Intercontinental Exchange Group), Euronext Paris, Eurex Frankfurt, ICE Futures Singapore, and the Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX).  

# Orders, Quotes, and Spreads  

As noted above, the bid price is the maximum price a dealer is willing to pay for a currency and the ask or offer price is the minimum that she is willing to accept. Dealers typically quote both bid and offer prices, with offer prices normally somewhat higher. The difference between bid and offer prices is called the spread. Narrower spreads are usually seen in more competitive and efficient markets.  

An example of a pair of bid and offer quotations on a pair of currencies, say euro/dollar, might be 0.8221/26. Here, the dealer is specifying a bid of EUR 0.8221 per dollar and an offer rate of EUR 0.8226. The spread in this example is 0.0005, or 5 basis points, sometimes called 5 pips. Interbank transactions on the order of   $\S1$   million typically quote spreads around 1 to 2 basis points while consumer exchange transactions spreads can be as high as 1000 basis points.  

A variety of types of quotation types are used in the trading of currencies. Currency traders must become familiar also with the way that currencies are quoted in the particular environment in which they work. When a currency pair is quoted, the first currency or the denominator currency in the pair is typically called the base currency and the second or numerator currency is the counter or quote currency. In most quotations, the U.S. dollar is the base currency, and quotes are expressed in units of counter currency per USD (e.g., JPY/USD or CAD/USD). The normal exceptions to this convention are quotes involving the euro, the pound sterling, and the Australian dollar; these three are quoted as dollars per foreign currency. Other quotation conventions are as follows from the perspective of a U.S. trader:  
1.  Direct quotations (home price of foreign currency, e.g.,  $\mathbb{S}1.8000/\mathfrak{E})$  2.  Indirect quotations (foreign price of home currency, e.g.,    $\pm0.5556/\mathbb{S})$  3.  European quotations (price of USD, e.g.,  $\mathrm{CHF1.8000/\Phi}$  )

 2.  American quotations (price of foreign currency,   $\S0.5556/\mathrm{CHF})$  . European quotes are more common except when trades involve the following currencies:    $£_{\mathrm{UK}},\,\S_{\mathrm{AU}},$   and  $\S_{\mathrm{NZ}}$  .

 3.  Outright quotations are the price of a currency in the forward market quoted in terms of a second currency.

 4.  Point (or swap) quotations are quotations for a currency in forward markets in terms of the premium or discount relative to the spot price. Generally forward spreads exceed spot spreads due to higher uncertainty in forward markets.

 5.  Forward quotations are often made in percentage terms as follows: a.  Forward premium or discount as a percent per annum (European terms):  

$$
[(\mathrm{Spot\,rate}-\mathrm{forward\,rate})\div\mathrm{forward\,rate}]\times1200/n
$$  

b.  Forward premium or discount as a percent per annum (American terms):  

$$
[(\mathrm{forward\;rate}-\mathrm{Spot\;rate})\div\mathrm{forward\;rate}]\times1200/n
$$  

8.  Cross rates refer to quotations not involving the dollar. These quotations are primarily an artifact of the Bretton Woods system.

 9.  Eurodollar futures quotation: Stated as an index of the three-month LIBOR:  

$$
F=100-\mathrm{LIBOR}
$$  

With the exception of the Japanese yen, currency quotations are expressed to four digits. As we mentioned above, the last of these four digits is referred to as a basis point, pip, or percentage in point. The yen is quoted in hundredths (e.g.,   $\mathrm{JPV/USD}=\P120.07/\P)$  .  

# 2.9 CRYPTO CURRENCY AND BITCOIN TRADING  

Crypto currency  and altcoin refer to digital currency in which encryption (cryptography) techniques are used to regulate its creation and supply and to verify its transfer among users.  Bitcoin , the best known of crypto currencies, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment network and digital currency created in open-source  $C++$   programming code. Bitcoin does not rely on a central monetary authority to issue, monitor, facilitate, verify, and approve transactions. Instead, Bitcoin is underwritten by a P2P network akin to file-sharing services like BitTorrent (a protocol supporting the practice of P2P file sharing). The network and payment systems are based on an open-source protocol that uses a public but anonymous transaction log. As of February 2021, over 18.6 million bitcoins have been issued out of 21 million planned, with an approximate dollar value of nearly USD1 trillion at more than USD50,000 per coin. Bitcoin surged to more than USD60,000 in April 2021. The rate of increase in the number of bitcoin available to trade has been fairly uniform since its 2009 inception.  
Bitcoin came into being in 2009, due to its pseudonym o us developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Units of bitcoin (BTC) are created by evidence of  forced work , also known as mining. Bitcoins are awarded in blocks of up to BTC50 to bitcoin “miners” for solving increasingly difficult proof-of-work computational problems related to public and private keys (discussed below), which are used to confirm transactions and prevent double-spending. Essentially, miners receive bitcoin in exchange for verifying the legitimacy of a block of other bitcoin users’ transactions; miners provide the essential service necessary for the accounting of bitcoin.  

Generally, one owns money (for example, cash or coins) by being in physical possession of it. One “owns” bitcoin by being able to execute transactions with it; bitcoins exist only as records. Transactions by bitcoin are executed by  hashing , an update to a public transaction log called a blockchain. Payments are made to and from bitcoin addresses (public keys), which are associated with “wallets,” which might be as simple as a scrap of paper with a public key written on it or a webpage requiring a user ID and password. Bitcoin addresses are 33-character alphanumeric strings, such as, for example,  15 rD bFc be daDs YUI er Bp pok Ch 8 X bbs tD fi . The log to which this address is added is the blockchain, the complete listing of previous bitcoin transactions. A transaction derives from two keys:  

1.  A  private key , a 64-character random or difficult-to-guess alphanumeric string analogous to an email password along with a digital signature that is, as was just discussed, derived (hashed) from the private key but that cannot be used to derive or decode the private key.

 2.  A  public key , as described above, a 33-character alphanumeric string derived from the private key based on a cryptographic Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm used to ensure that funds can be spent only by their rightful owners.   The public key might be analogous to an email address; everyone knows the address, but only the owner can access its contents or send a message from it. The signature associated with the public key can be used to verify the identity of the sender but cannot be duplicated by anyone without access to the private key.  

If the signature can be matched to the public key by computers in the network, the transaction is validated. Essentially, the matching ensures that the bitcoin exists in the wallet and has not been used before. Thus, all transactions are cleared by a database housed on user computers known as  nodes  and verified by miners. Any fraudulent change to any part of the record, represented by a 64-character “hash,” will necessitate changes to every other part of the blockchain, also represented by hashes, and on every record maintained by every individual participant in the system. Thus, the blockchain itself protects the integrity of each hash or block in the chain. Node records are publicly available and must be in agreement to validate transactions.  

Bitcoin and other crypto currencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin are traded in numerous virtual venues including Coinbase and Binance. Such marketplaces provide a variety of services to simplify the ownership and trading processes, including trading platforms such as Coinbase Pro and custodial wallets, which are often insured.   Bitcoin activity in near real-time can be viewed at numerous online sites, including  https://blockchain. explorer  and  https://www.blockchain.com/btc/unconfirmed-transactions . Futures contracts on bitcoin are traded on the Cboe Futures Exchange, and bitcoin futures and options are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
# 2.10 COMMODITIES AND FUTURES  

# Commodities  

A commodity market trades in raw or primary products rather than manufactured products.  Soft commodities  are agricultural products such as wheat, livestock, coffee, cocoa, and sugar.  Hard commodities  are mined or extracted, such as gold, rubber, natural gas, and oil. More recently developed commodities markets include those for emissions, electricity, and cell phone minutes. Well-developed commodity markets require that the commodities be well-defined and standardized. For example, one ounce of gold of a given purity should be the same regardless of who owns or sells it. Commodity markets can include physical trading of the actual commodity or a variety of derivative contracts including spot contracts, forwards, futures, options on futures and swap contracts. Trading in futures contracts predates by centuries stock markets; there is evidence of trading in rice futures in China dating to 6000 B.C.E.  

# Forward and Futures Contracts  

A  forward contract  represents an agreement providing for delivery of a given quantity of an asset at a later date at a given price. Essentially, a forward contract provides for the seller (an entity taking the short position on the asset) to deliver the specified asset on a settlement date (or month) to a purchaser (an entity taking the long position on the asset). The actual exchange of the asset for cash occurs at settlement, a date subsequent to the date of origination of the forward contract. A large number of forward transactions involve direct negotiations between banks, brokerage firms, and other financial institutions.  

A  futures contract  also represents an agreement specifying delivery of given quantity of an asset on a settlement date at a given price. However, the futures contract differs from a forward contract in several important ways. First, a forward contract is created by its long and short participants according to whatever terms they agree to. A futures contract is created by a  clearing house  which acts as a middleman between all contract participants. The clearing house serves as counter party on all transactions which effectively eliminates default risk. A futures contract is traded on an exchange. To facilitate trading and to ensure that a reasonably large number of investors will be interested in the futures contract, the futures contract is standardized with respect to the exact quantity and nature of the asset to be delivered along with the settlement date. To ensure that both parties to the futures contract will honor their commitments, futures traders are required to post  margin , which is, in effect, collateral required by the brokerage firm. Furthermore, futures contracts often provide for  marking to the market , which involves daily re-computations of the margin requirement based on updated asset value.  
Exchanges and clearing houses will clearly specify terms of futures contracts. First, the asset, its quality and grade are specified in the contract, along with the size of the contract (e.g., weight, volume, etc.) and the asset delivery terms. Although physical delivery of the asset is rare because most contracts are  closed out  (canceled by offsetting trades) prior to maturity or provide for the delivery of cash equivalence ( cash settlement ), these terms are still important. Contracts will also provide for a settlement date or delivery month.  

There are a number of important exchanges that trade futures contracts, including the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. See  Table 2.1  in Section 2.2 for a listing of major U.S. futures exchanges. In addition to these markets, the London Metal Exchange, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange, and OTC markets are very active. Futures markets in the U.S. are tightly regulated and overseen by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the National Futures Association (NFA), and to a lesser extent, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC).  

Futures contracts have been traded for many centuries on many types of commodities, including agricultural products such as corn, wheat, and pork bellies, metals such as gold and copper, minerals such as diamonds, petroleum, and phosphates, as well as paper and timber. Futures contracts are traded on an assortment of financial securities such as treasury bonds, equity market indices, and interest rates. As discussed in previous sections, futures contracts also trade on a large number of different currencies.  

# Futures Contracts and Business Risk  

Although futures markets allow investors to speculate and engage in arbitrage, one of their most important functions is to enable businesses to control risk. Consider the following simple example involving a wheat farmer and a cereal manufacturer. Suppose that the manufacturer needs to purchase wheat in three months for cereal production and the farmer, who is just now planting seed wishes to sell wheat at harvest in three months. Since the market price of wheat is likely to be affected by general economic and trade conditions, weather, and many other factors beyond the control of the two trading partners, neither knows what the price of wheat will be in three months. Hence, the manufacturer faces uncertainty with respect to cereal production costs and the farmer cannot know what revenues he will derive from the sale of his produce. Such uncertainty clearly affects the abilities of the trading partners to make appropriate business decisions. In fact, in the face of such uncertainties, businesses often scale back their levels of operations to avoid devastating losses. It would seem simple for the farmer and the cereal manufacturer to agree on a transaction price of wheat in advance. In fact, this is exactly what the futures market allows trading partners to do; the party wishing to lock in a purchase price for wheat takes a long position in a futures contract and the party wishing to lock in a selling price takes a short position in the futures contract. The futures contract, in effect, obliges each of its participants to transact for wheat at the agreed upon price (settlement price) on the settlement date. However, since the manufacturer never knows exactly whose wheat it will purchase, and the farmer never knows exactly who will be the end user of his wheat, they simply take positions in futures contracts with seemingly anonymous counter parties. Actually, the clearing house is the counter party for each futures transaction. Although the farmer actually sells wheat at the prevailing market price at harvest, his short position in the futures contract enables to him offset decreases (increases) in the market price of wheat with gains (losses) in his short position in the futures contract. Similarly, the cereal manufacturer purchases wheat at the prevailing market price at harvest, though its long position in the futures contract enables to him offset increases (decreases) in the market price of wheat with gains (losses) in its long position in the futures contract.  
# 2.11 SWAPS AND SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES  

A  swap contract  provides for the exchange of one set of cash flows for another set of cash flows. The amounts of these cash flows are usually tied to values associated with other assets or portfolios but could be tied to practically anything that can be quantified and observed. Many types of swap contracts are custom made (bespoke) and flexible, are often outstanding over longer time frames, and are frequently illiquid. The latter two charact eris tics present important problems for counter parties seeking to limit risks. Most swap contracts are created and standardized in some respects using a master template provided by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA; see Chapter 5).  

Swap contracts are regularly specified for interest rates, commodities, currencies, debt and equity securities, and many other types of assets. Swap contracts have a number of uses. For instance, swap contracts enable financial market participants to synthesize other securities that are either unavailable in securities markets or are unfavorably priced. When desired securities or security combinations are unavailable or unfavorably priced, a swap contract can be customized to replicate that security’s or combination’s cash flow structure. Swap contracts can also be used to obtain exposure to a particular asset or market without having to commit or lock up funds in an investment.  

# Examples of Swap Contract Types  

A  total return swap  is a tradable contract that provides for one party to make a payment based on the total economic performance of a specified asset in exchange for some other fixed or variable cash flow. That is, in the context here, the payments between contracting parties to a total return swap are based on changes in the market valuation or rate related to a specific credit instrument, irrespective of whether a credit event has occurred. A total return swap in effect provides for exchanging an obligation to pay interest at a specified fixed or floating rate for payments representing the total return on a loan (interest and principal value changes) of a specified amount. Interpreted broadly, other types of swap contracts discussed here might also be considered total return swaps.  
Interest rate swaps  enable counter parties to swap streams of cash flows associated with two or more different debt instruments or interest rates. For example, a floating-to-fixed swap enables one counter party to make a payment based on a floating interest rate such as the SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a reference rate based on overnight repurchase agreement [repo] transactions) in exchange for a payment based on a fixed rate. The payments exchanged between contracting parties to this interest rate swap are based on changes in the market valuation or rate related to the floating rate credit instrument.  

For a more specific example of a “plain vanilla interest rate swap,” suppose that a bank enters into a one-year agreement in which the client pays the SOFR on the notional amount of   $\mathbb{1}{,}000{,}000$   in exchange for a fixed rate of  $5\%$  . Suppose that after one year, the SOFR is   $4\%$  . The payment is netted at the end of the swap term with the bank making a payment of   $\S10\bar{,000~}=\ (\S1,\!000,\!000\times\,[5\%\!-\!4\%])$   to the client.  effect, the client has swapped a variable interest payment for a fixed rate payment at 5%.  

A  credit default swap  (CDS) provides for one party to pay a fixed premium or series of premiums in return for protection against a specified credit event (e.g., default) or events. A CDS might be used by a lender to arrange for a counter party to reimburse him in the event of a borrower default. To provide this credit enhancement or insurance, the counterparty accepts a premium or series of premiums for acting as the counter party.  

A CDS can resolve for a lender much credit uncertainty and usually allows for default recovery much faster than court bankruptcy proceedings. The resolution of a borrower default in bankruptcy is never a simple matter. Defaults, debt restructurings, and bankruptcies usually take years to resolve and are usually very costly. The ISDA (discussed in Chapter 5) process speeds up and governs the way borrower defaults are handled with respect to the many types of CDS contracts. Essentially, the ISDA provides for clear definitions of credit events, the declaration of a default, and the setting and design of a bond or debt auction process. This auction can provide for the physical settlement of bonds involved in the default, in which impaired bonds can be liquidated and prices can be discovered. This auction process provides the basis for an appropriate cash flow from short to long CDS position holders and allows for much faster resolution for lenders than court bankruptcy proceedings.  

An  equity swap  is a contract providing for the delivery of cash flows associated with shares of equity or an equity index in exchange for the cash flows associated with another asset such as a debt or index instrument. For example, an investor wishing to relieve herself of risk associated with shares that she is currently holding, without selling and exposing herself to capital gains tax liability under some tax regimes, might agree to deliver to another investor the cash flows (dividends and capital gains for a specified period) associated with her shares. The second investor, in turn, agrees to deliver cash flows associated with a treasury bond to the stock investor. Such equity swaps are used to exploit apparent mispricing in equity markets, to manage risks associated with domestic or foreign equity investment, to circumvent dividend withholding tax requirements in foreign countries, to speculate in foreign equity markets when direct ownership is not permitted, and to avoid tax events or certain corporate transaction reporting requirements.  
# Swap Execution Facilities  

A  swap execution facility  (SEF) is a registered electronic trading system that enables OTC swaps traders to provide and obtain quotes and execute swap transactions by accepting bids and offers. An SEF is in many respects similar to a formal exchange, although the term refers to any distributed group of trading systems approved for swaps but not regulated as an exchange. SEFs are intended to provide institutional traders enhanced efficiency and transparency to swaps markets along with reduced systemic risk to the overall financial system. Traditionally (before the Financial Crisis of 2008), most OTC swaps were privately negotiated and traded by financial institutions over the telephone. Such trades were usually cleared bilaterally between trade counter parties.  

An SEF maintains Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs; see Section 1.6 and Chapter 4), which collect quotes from market makers to be disseminated to members. An institution (sometimes called a market taker) seeking to accept one of the orders in the CLOB can execute a transaction at the best available price. Many SEFs promote pretrade transparency by maintaining a  request for quote  (RFQ) system. Here, the market taker submits an RFQ (or request for quote stream) to at least three swap market makers, often with assistance of the SEF. Market makers provide quotes, which may or may not be supplemented by the CLOB. Then, if the market taker accepts a quote, the trade is executed through the SEF and reported in compliance with established facility rules to enhance competition, fairness, and transparency. Traders are monitored for adherence to rules, and most trades are centrally cleared to standardize and mitigate fragmented counter party risk. Once a swap contract becomes traded on a facility, SEFs continue to provide quotes and execution services for that contract, enhancing liquidity and transparency for swaps market participants.  

The inter mediation by an SEF between two counter parties in a swap agreement is intended to allow counter party risk shifting by the two counter parties to a trustworthy institution that can take both sides of the transaction. The fairly large number of SEFs, such as those managed by TP ICAP, ICE Swap Trade, Tradeweb, and Bloomberg, are regulated by the SEC (for security-based swaps) and the CFTC. The CFTC maintains a list of registered facilities at https://sirt.cftc.gov/SIRT/SIRT.aspx?Topic  $=$  Swap Execution Facilities . These facilities are a product of Title VII of the 2011 U.S. Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act (see Chapter 5), which mandates most OTC swaps to be cleared and traded through such facilities if they are not listed on a designated contract market such as an exchange. As will be discussed in the next chapter, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act was largely the result of the relative success after the 2008 meltdown of Lehman Brothers in recovering Lehman positions that had cleared with the LCH.Clearnet Group’s clearinghouse relative to positions that had not cleared through a clearinghouse. There are exceptions to regulatory facility clearing and trading requirements, such as for highly illiquid and bespoke swap contracts that tend not to be made available to trade.  

Most U.S. swap transactions are now executed and cleared by swap execution facilities. Financial institutions obtain authorization to serve as swap execution facilities by meeting requirements set forth by Dodd-Frank, the SEC, and the CFTC and by submitting a formal application to the SEC.

# 2.12 EXERCISES  

1.  For a 20-year period beginning in 1986, the NYSE was regularly criticized for making less use of electronic and computer technology than most of its competitors around the world, even less than exchanges in emerging and developing countries and than exchanges just starting business. The NYSE would argue that its specialist system required more “face-to-face” contact than other non specialist exchanges. a.  Why would the NYSE specialist system require more face-to-face contact than its competitors? b.  Assume that face-to-face contact hurt investors more through increased trading expenses and reduced trading efficiency than it helped them. That is, assume that the argument that you prepared for part (a) is simply wrong. Why might the NYSE still resist adopting improved electronic and computer technology?

 2.  Why is the NYSE trading model often referred to as a hybrid model of trading?

 3.  An ATS (Alternative Trading System) might be defined as an exchange that does not operate as a self-regulatory body. True or false?

 4.  Might a bond’s credit rating imply any information about the liquidity risk or interest rate risk of a bond?

 5.  Suppose that the spot price of gold is  $\S1100$   per ounce. The current one-year riskless rate of interest is   $3\%$  . a.  Provide a forecast for the price of gold in one year based on a relevant expectations hypothesis. b.  Provide an estimate for the one-year forward price for one ounce of gold. c.  Justify your use of the expectations hypothesis that you used in your answer to parts a and b. d.  What would cause the forward price of gold to deviate from your forecast?  
6.  Suppose that the Swiss franc is currently trading at 2 per U.S. dollar. The franc is expected to be revalued to CHF2.5 per dollar. a.  Has the franc been devalued relative to the dollar? b.  Has the dollar been devalued relative to the franc? c.  What is the percentage anticipated revaluation of the franc relative to the dollar? d.  What is the percentage anticipated revaluation of the dollar relative to the franc?  

7.  Assume that  $\S1$   will purchase  d 0.60 and  f 108; that is, one U.S. dollar will purchase 0.6 UK pounds and 108 Japanese yen. Assume that goods in the three countries are identically priced after adjusting for currency exchange rates and that there are no arbitrage opportunities. a.  What is the value of  d 1 in  f ? b.  What is the value of  f 1 in  d ? c.  If one ounce of gold costs  $\S1500$   in the United States, what is its cost in the UK and in Japan?  

8.  Why must a forward price equal the spot price on the settlement date of the forward contract? That is, why do many forward prices converge to spot prices at settlement?

 9.  What are the differences between forward and futures contracts?  

10.  Equity swaps have been used by investors to reduce their risk in an equity investment without actually selling shares. For example, corporate managers have used the executive equity swap  to reduce their personal exposure in their shares of their employers’ stock. In a well-publicized case involving Autotote Company, at the time a Nasdaq-listed manufacturer of wagering equipment, the CEO, Lorne Weil, arranged a swap contract through Bankers Trust (since taken over by Deutsche Bank) to deliver dividends and any capital gains (which would be negative in the event of a capital loss) associated with Autotote stock in exchange for associated cash flows pegged to the variable interest rate LIOBR. How might Mr. Weil have benefitted from this transaction?  

11.  Assume that exchange rates of Swiss francs per dollar are 1.6 and 1.8 in the spot and one-year forward markets, respectively. Thus, an investor can transact for 1.6 francs per dollar today and contract to transact for 1.8 francs in one year. Assume that nominal interest rates are   $10\%$   in the U.S. and   $12\%$   in Switzerland. Demonstrate an arbitrage opportunity. That is, demonstrate how an investor can obtain an arbitrage profit by simultaneously using spot and forward markets to transact for securities and by borrowing and/or lending money. Further assume no transactions costs or barriers on transactions and that interest rates apply to both borrowing (short) and lending (long).
