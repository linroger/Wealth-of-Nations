# 13.1 BANK BALANCE SHEETS AND INCOME STATEMENTS  

Financial statements of banking institutions are not easy to read, because most of us grew up on accounting textbooks devoting much space to manufacturing categories like cost of goods sold, property plant and equipment, and depreciation. Let us start by looking at two very different US banks. The first is J.P. Morgan, a global bank headquartered in New York with over 230,000 employees around the world, and with large investment banking, asset management, private equity, and institutional trading businesses. In the USA, such a bank is referred to as a money-center bank. The Federal Reserve subjects money center banks with large trading books to Basel rules. In continental Europe, J.P. Morgan would be classified as a universal bank similar to Deutsche Bank or UBS. The second bank we look at is Zions Bancorporation, a fairly large regional bank based in Salt Lake City, Utah, with over 10,000 employees, and geographically covering the southwestern and intermountain region of the USA from Texas in the south through Arizona, Nevada, and California, up to Washington in the northwest. The equivalent profile banks in Europe would be "La Caixa," the third largest bank in Spain with 27,000 employees, or Raiffaisen Bank co-op with 55,000 employees in central Europe (Austria and beyond). The difference for the European banks is their multicountry/currency structure. However, the main business is similar: payment services, savings and deposit accumulation and consumer business, and real estate credit extension.  

First, we look at the income statement and the (average) balance sheet of J.P. Morgan. Chase as of Q3 of 2010 in Tables 13.1 and 13.2, found in the November 9, 2010, Form 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In Table 13.1, of the total $\$23.8$ billion revenue in Q3 2010, $\$11.3$ billion or. $47\%$ comes from fees, and. $\$12.5$ billion or. $53\%$ comes from Net Interest Income. The fee revenue components are investment banking,. principal trading, custody, asset management, credit cards, and others. Roughly then, in a broad sense, J.P. Morgan's income is a little more than half traditional bank and a little less than half investment bank. A typical investment bank, like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley,. combines pure investment banking with principal/institutional trading and asset management. A look at the assets and liabilities in Table 13.2 confirms this assessment. Long-term loans represent $34\%$ and all interest-bearing assets including loans, deposits, fed funds, and debt. tradeables represent $81\%$ of all the assets. Interest- and non-interest-bearing deposits represent. $47\%$ of total liabilities. Other main sources of funding include fed funds, general long-term debt, and trading liabilities..  

When trying to evaluate J.P. Morgan's financial health, one needs to look at threats/opportunities to its revenue/income stream and at the net worth position equal to the value of assets minus the value of liabilities. For the former, we can use the traditional maturity gap analysis and credit management methods to analyze the $53\%$ coming from net interest income. We would need other methods to evaluate the quality of the earnings on. the investment banking, custody, or asset management side. Market VaR methods can only help with characterizing the principal trading revenue, and, to a limited extent, some of the other areas.

(d) Reflects a benefit from the favorable market environments for dollar-roll financings in the third quarter of 2010. (e) For the quarters ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, the annualized rates for AFS securities, based on amortized cost, were $2.74\%$ and $3.64\%$ , respectively.

Looking at the balance sheet side, we find that about. $81\%$ of the assets are yield curve. sensitive. Here, traditional duration gap and market VaR methods would seem to be close. cousins. Both focus on defining the yield curve hedge exposures in interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Market VaR can be used to extend the hedge approach to cover equity positions. and derivatives.  

The financial statements for Zions in Tables 13.3 and 13.4 reveal a different business mix. The main contributor to revenue/profit is net interest income, aided by deposit account fees and service charges. Employee expenses, and derivative and securities losses offset all the income resulting in small net losses for the reporting periods. The trading account is minuscule. The balance sheet confirms the picture of Zions as a traditional deposit-and-loan

Interestbearing deposits represent $61.5\%$ and non-interest-bearing deposits another $30.4\%$ of the total liabilities. Borrowed funds are relatively small; most are fed funds and repos.

its troubled real estate loan portfolio. The TARP funds strengthened its liquidity, increasing. its money market position. Net interest margin (the difference between the rates earned on invested assets minus the rates paid on the liabilities) remained very healthy, above. $3.5\%$  

The vast majority of commercial banks around the developed world have a profile similar to that of Zions or J.P. Morgan, or in between. The more global ones may show more investment banking, trading, custody, or asset management income. Specialty banks would have revenues concentrated on particular areas. Smaller Swiss banks may have more asset management and private banking fee revenues. Bank of New York or State Street Bank in the USA may show more custody and commission income. The world's more regional- or savings-oriented banks would show mostly deposits and loans and majority interest and service fee income similar to Zions. In either case, the interest-rate sensitive portfolio would probably represent more than three-quarters of all balance sheet assets.  

The next two sections cover two main methods of assessing a financial institution's invest-. ment value, profitability, and risk relative to changing market interest rates, each focusing on one key variable:  

Interest-Sensitive (Maturity) Gap Management: Net interest margin $=$ (Interest revenue -- Interest cost) / Total earning assets   
Duration Gap Management: Net worth $=$ Market value of assets - Market value of liabilities  

The objective of Asset-Liability Management (ALM), often conducted through the asset-. liability committee (ALCO) of a firm, is not simply to arrive at a final number, but to have a. firm grasp of the details. In particular, we want to understand the breakdown of the income or net worth exposure to interest risk organized into maturity/duration buckets..
