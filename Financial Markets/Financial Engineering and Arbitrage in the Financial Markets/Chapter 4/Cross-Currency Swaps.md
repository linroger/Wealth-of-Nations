# 4.3 CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS  

Cross-currency swaps are exchanges of bonds denominated in two different currencies, e.g.. one side is dollars and the other side is euros. The basic structure is an exchange of fixed coupon flows in one currency for fixed coupon flows in another currency, but not uncommon are exchanges of fixed-for-floating or floating-for-floating. Sometimes the coupon and the. principal exchanges involve different currencies, matching flows on multicurrency bonds.. Cross-currency swaps allow issuers to alter the currency of their liabilities. The valuation. exploits the dual nature of these swaps, as exchanges of bonds or strings of currency forwards, and largely relies on present valuing both sides of the swap. The peculiarities are that the principal exchange must be included in the total PV and that market-structural demand/supply. imbalances may cause zero-PV floating-floating exchanges to trade at non-zero values..  

# 4.3.1Definition of a Fixed-for-Fixed Cross-Currency Swap  

A UK-based company wants to issue new debt with a maturity of 5 years to finance an expansion of its American operations. The company is unknown in the US and there is not much demand currently for its debt in the US markets. The company is expecting the funds to repay the new debt issue to come from its North American operations.  

Let us assume that the current exchange rate is $\$1.50/£$ and the company's credit rating is AA, i.e. the same as that reflected in swap rates. The company needs to raise $\$150$ million now. Table 4.10 shows the yield curves at the time of the issuance, i.e. the zero-coupon rates in the US and UK (as it is usually annual in the UK and semi-annual in the USA, we show both). It also shows calculated par coupon rates. The par coupon rates are the rates that fixed coupon bonds would have to offer to price to par.  

If there is no strong demand for the company's US dollar bonds, the company might have. to pay investors a rate higher than the fair $4.359746\%$ semi. To address the lack of demand, the company can issue UK bonds and swap the cash flows into dollars. If the company issues $£100$ million bond with a $4.780222\%$ annual coupon, the bonds will sell at par. The annual coupon outlay will be 4.7802222 for the next 5 years. The principal due in 5 years will be. 100 million.  

The proceeds of 100 million from the sale of the bonds can be exchanged into $\$150$ million at today's exchange rate of $\$1.50/£$ . The company can convert the sterling-denominated coupon and principal liability all into dollars. To that end, it enters into a 100 million . $\mathrm{\Delta}(=\S150$ million) cross-currency swap (with a bank) to receive fixed pounds and pay fixed dollars. That is, it agrees to the schedule of cash flows in Table 4.11..

The swap receipts are identical to, and will offset, the coupon and principal payments owed on the bonds, leaving the company with zero net GBP cash flows. The USD payments are equivalent to the coupon and principal payments on a $\$150$ million face value $4.409975\%$ coupon bond.  

Except for profit markup, the dealer will not charge (or pay) anything to enter into this swap, because the present value of the USD stream is equal to. $\$150$ million (fictitious par USD bond) and the present value of the GBP stream is equal to. $£100$ million (fictitious par GBP bond), and the two present values are equal to each other at today's exchange rate of $\$1.50/£$  

Figure 4.1 summarizes the net flow of cash on the bond and the swap.  

The receipts from the swap counterparty are passed to the bond investors. What is left is. the dollar obligation in the form of a dollar coupon stream and principal payment at the end.. Note that the scheduled swap flows for year 5 include the principal repayment. The company's coupon cash flow is 4.78022 million on the receive side and. $\$6.614962$ million $(4.409975\%$ on $\$150$ million) on the pay side. The principal exchange is 100 million on the receive side for $\$150$ million on the pay side. In currency swaps, the principal exchange at the end of the swap is standard, unless specifically deleted in the swap agreement. (The exchange rate that equates the two at the outset most likely changes by the time of the exchange - the end of the swap.) In interest rate swaps, the principal exchange is defined in the same currency and, hence, not necessary.

Figure 4.1 UK bond swapped into dollars  

The swap shown in Table 4.11 is non-standard. The pay side would probably pay semiannually following the US corporate bond market conventions. For the swap to be par -i.e. with no compensating payment by either party - the swap's USD rate would be set to $4.359746\%$ semi-annual, instead of $4.409975\%$ annual (this is not exactly a simple EAR conversion). The company would have annual GBP cash flows on the receive side, passed on to its bondholders, and semi-annual USD cash flows on the pay side. The flows are illustrated in Table 4.12.  

# 4.3.2 Valuation and Settlement of Cross-Currency Swaps  

The hedging of cross-currency swaps is analogous to that of interest rate swaps, i.e. dynamic hedge computed by blipping the inputs to the yield curve bootstrap, except that the curve blipping has to involve the yield curves in both currencies and the spot FX rate. In a fixedfixed swap, the dealer has exposure to points on the two curves and to the currency exchange. rate through the coupon exchanges and the principal exchange. The final hedge consists of Eurocurrency futures positions as in Table 4.9, but in dollar and pounds, and a spot FX position.. Rather than repeating the blipping argument, let us illustrate here what happens when the swaps. are off-market or are unwound.

The prior example assumed no compensatory cash flows up front. The bond issue and the swap occurred at the same time and the rates on the swap were set to the current market rates. This need not be the case. Bond issuers can come to the swap market not just at issuance, but. any time they want to alter the structure of their liabilities - fixed into floating, floating into fixed, one currency for another - because their internal cash flow needs have changed or they. want to speculate on the direction of currency and interest rates..  

Suppose our UK company with American operations issues a 5-year 100 million $4.780222\%$ fixed rate GBP bond. The company converts the 100 million proceeds into. $\$150$ million to invest in the project, but, expecting the widening of the interest rate differential between the UK and the USA, it leaves the bond issue unswapped. Suppose 1 year later,. the FX rate is still $\$1.5/£$ but interest rates in the UK have risen by 50 bp while interest rates. in the USA have stayed the same, as in Table 4.13..  

To take advantage of the interest rate differential, the company enters into a 4-year GBP/USD fixed-fixed swap. The principal is 100 million on the receive side and $\$150$ million on the pay side. The current 4-year rate is $4.910531\%$ , but the company asks the dealing bank to match the bond coupon rate of $4.780222\%$ which is now off-market. Since the company is accepting. a rate lower than the fair market rate, it will have two choices (the dealer should be indifferent). One is to pay the current on-market USD rate on the pay side of the swap, and receive a one-. time payment from the dealer for the present value differential. The calculation of the upfront payment is shown in Table 4.14 and is done two ways, as the PV of the payment shortfalls. (summed up) or as the shortfall PV of the $4.78022\%$ bond which now prices to 99.532839.

The second choice is to receive no payment today, but to pay a lower USD rate on the swap. We solve for the fixed USD rate which makes the PV of all the payments $\$700,742$ or 467,161 lower than par; the fictitious dollar bond prices to $\$149.299258$ million. Table 4.15. verifies that the rate $3.812193\%$ on $\$150$ million produces the desired PV.  

Note that the coupon rate $3.812193\%$ is lower than the par rate of $3.939253\%$ by $0.127060\%$ which is not equal to the $0.130309\%$ UK rate differential.  

# 4.3.3Cross-Currency Swaps as Packages of Off-Market FX Forwards  

Instead of dissecting the cross-currency swap "vertically" and viewing it as an exchange of two fixed coupon bonds in two different currencies, let us dissect it "horizontally,' one cash flow exchange at a time to view it as a string of FX forwards. Let us examine the original currency swap in Table 4.11 entered into by our UK-based company with American operations, and compute the forward exchange rates locked in for each cash flow exchange. These are simply the coupon ratios for the coupon flows and the original spot $\$1.50/£$ rate for the final principal exchange. We separate the last exchange into the coupon and principal components.  

The FX rates in the last column of Table 4.16 are not real forward rates quoted by anyone. In. fact, the real forwards can be arrived at by plugging the spot rate and the zero-coupon curves. shown Table 4.10 into the covered interest rate parity. Given the true FX forward quotes, we. calculate in Table 4.17 the GBP equivalent of the USD payments that can be locked in today,. the net GBP flow for each future date, and the mark-to-market on each forward cash flow exchange locked in the swap (net flow discounted to today). The MTM is the amount the company would have to pay (receive) up front if it were to enter into each GBP-for-USD cash flow exchange separately in the FX forward market..  

The sum of all the MTMs is equal to zero. The 5-year swap can be viewed as a package of 6 forwards to sell USD forward for GBP with the amounts set by the swap cash flow schedule.

and shown in Table 4.17. Each forward is off-market, i.e. it has a non-zero PV. The first five have a positive PV to the company: the GBP inflow exceeds the GBP equivalent of the USD outflow. A dealer taking the other side would have to be compensated up front with the. MTM amount. For example, for year 1 the company is to receive 4.780222 million and pay $\$6.614962$ million at today's forward FX rate equivalent to 4.442710 million, which is a net positive flow of 0.337512 million. The company would then have to compensate the dealer by paying the present value of that amount, or 0.326966 million. The same logic applies to the rest of the flows. The last cash flow exchange is a large negative PV contract - the company is to receive 100 million and pay the equivalent of 101.725158 million. To accept that, the company would have to receive up front 1.360910 million. Each cash flow exchange is an off-market FX forward with a non-zero PV. If the swap market did not exist, each could be separately arranged in the forward FX market. Yet, if the CIRP holds in FX markets, then, in today's pounds, the MTM settlements of all six off-market FX forwards sum to zero..  

# 4.3.4 Multicurrency and Combination Cross-Currency Swaps  

Depending on its needs, the UK company need not limit itself to a fixed-fixed dollar-for-. sterling swap. Suppose 1 year after issuing the 5-year sterling bond, it finds itself in the situation described by Tables 4.13 to 4.15. Since the sterling rates have risen, and to offset the cash flows on the remaining 4 years of bond coupon interest, the company is in the fortunate situation of being able to be paid 467,161 for entering into an off-market receive-GBP $4.780222\%$ 4-year swap in Table 4.15, or be paid 0 but lock in the pay-USD coupon to a. low rate of $3.812193\%$ in Table 4.15. If the company's view is that a further rate widening.

between dollars and pounds is unlikely, then the company can overlay an interest rate swap on the currency swap in order to change its liability into floating USD. A receive-fixed 4-year USD fixed-for-floating interest rate swap would leave it with a floating dollar liability for. the remainder of the term, or until it decided to swap again. If the company decides to take 467,161 out of the currency swap, then it can enter into an interest rate swap to receive a par rate of $3.939253\%$ in USD and to pay LIBOR flat. If it did not take any money out and locked. in an off-market $3.812193\%$ in USD on the fixed-fixed currency swap, then it could enter into. a USD interest rate swap to receive $3.812193\%$ and pay LIBOR minus a large spread whose present value in today's terms is equal to $\$700,742$ . The same dealer should be able to offer a combined package of the two swaps in one GBP fixed-USD floating currency swap..  

A fixed-floating currency swap is a combination of a fixed-fixed currency swap and an interest rate swap in one of the currencies. In practice, the cross-currency swap market convention is to treat as the principal building block a floating-floating currency swap and layer on it interest rate swaps. If we layer on one interest rate swap then one side gets converted to fixed,. producing a fixed-floating currency swap; if we layer two interest rate swaps, then both sides get converted to fixed, producing a fixed-fixed currency swap. The reason for this convention is that demand and supply conditions in currency markets (typically at any given time, many corporate customers want to go the same way on the swaps, e.g. receive pounds and pay dollars) result in an unusual situation of zero PV floating-floating structures trading at non-zero PVs. A LIBOR flat-for-LIBOR flat swap in two currencies with a principal exchange at the end at the current spot FX rate should have no value. Both legs of the swap are floating rate bonds that price to par. Yet if everyone borrows in yen, but would like to pay interest in dollars, then everyone will be willing to pay a few extra basis points in dollars. Think of Japanese corporate customers with easy access to yen credit, but operations in dollars. In that case, JPY/USD cross-currency swaps will trade at yen LIBOR flat against dollar LIBOR plus spread, and that. spread will vary by term. While it is easy to come up with a stylized reason for this wedge into the straight no-arbitrage present valuation, the exact reasons are not easy to explain and. may involve demand and supply, transaction costs, credit differential and an imbalance in dealer and corporate customer flows. The cross-currency swap spread, although for most currency pairs is quite small, changes over time and is an additional unhedgeable source of risk for dealers.  

Cross-currency swaps may involve interest and principal flows in more than two currencies.. The most common multicurrency swap has coupon exchanges in one pair (e.g. pounds for dollars) and the final principal exchange calling for a third currency (e.g. pounds for euros). This does not engender any difficulties in pricing or hedge computation. If the principal. exchange is at the current spot rate, then the swap still prices to zero; if not, it calls for an MTM settlement up front. However, the actual hedging of a long-term multicurrency swap may be more complicated. If the term of the swap is much longer than the available futures in one of the currencies, then the CIRP is unlikely to hold without a bid/ask spread. The swap's hedge has to be accomplished with coupon bonds, and the final principal exchange has to be hedged separately, perhaps with a large currency position (the principal exchange is much larger than any coupon exchange), a forward or spot plus interest rate hedges. Over time, the hedge may result in large unrealized offsetting gains and losses in multiple currencies. While theoretically this is easy to compute, practically it may result in large unwanted exposures..  

There are several other variants of cross-currency swaps commonly encountered in practice. The main one is a plain vanilla two-currency swap, floating-for-floating or fixed-for-floating, but with no principal exchange at the end. Theoretically, this is easy to handle and at time zero it results in a zero PV. Practically, it involves a large FX risk at the final date of the swap.. This is easy to see when considering the view of the swap as an exchange of two floating. rate bonds. In static replication, the dealer would simply buy one bond and short the other to offset the flows on the swap. However, since the principal exchange is missing from the non-vanilla swap, the principal exchange on hedging bonds in this static strategy has to be undone statically through a large FX forward or a position in zero-coupon bonds. Over the life of the swap, that position may result in very large settlement balances expending dealer. capital. The principal exchange in a plain vanilla cross-currency swap plays an important role in simplifying the hedge.  

Coupon accrual features of swaps can cause hedging difficulties similar to the lack of principal exchange. If one side of the swap accrues but does not settle interest periodically, then large MTM balances can accumulate. This is risky even in a one-currency interest rate swap, but even more so in a cross-currency swap. A currency cocktail swap, where one side. of the swap receives a single currency but the other pays multiple currencies, may exhibit hedging risks similar to accrual and no-principal swaps. The cocktail feature itself is not a. source of risk. The pay side is simply dynamically hedged with strips of interest rate futures broken into component currencies. A principal exchange into the same cocktail of currencies. avoids hedging pitfalls, since static replication can proceed by splitting one side into a basket. of coupon bonds. If, however, the principal exchange is into just one currency, then there is a mismatch between the cocktail of coupons and the single currency of the principal.  

The overall lesson of cross-currency swaps, and swaps in general, is that the more the swap looks like an exchange of two standard bonds the easier it is to hedge. As soon as there is some principal and coupon mismatch - be it in the form of a missing principal or a principal in a different currency, or a non-standard coupon - the hedging becomes more difficult. It either involves more components with offsetting but large balances, or moves away from perfect static replication to duration matching to a combination of bonds.
