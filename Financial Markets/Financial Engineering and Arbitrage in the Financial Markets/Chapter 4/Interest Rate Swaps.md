# 4.2 INTEREST RATE SWAPS  

Interest rate swap flows are defined in the same currency. They allow users to change their asset or liability flows from fixed rate to floating rate and vice versa. The floating side is in the. majority of cases indexed off the LIBOR rate. In the USA, sometimes the role of LIBOR is. played by the Fed Funds, Commercial Paper, T-Bill, or Cost of Funds Index (COFI) rate..  

# 4.2.1 Definition of an Interest Rate Swap  

Suppose a UK company issues a 5-year 100 million floating rate bond with an annual 12- month LIBOR coupon, but wants a fixed rate liability to match the repayment schedule to a guaranteed government contract. The floating rate bond is issued at par; each coupon rate is set at the beginning of the interest accrual period and paid at the end, making the bond equivalent to an annual revolving loan.  

The company enters into a 100 million notional principal fixed-for-floating interest rate swap whereby it agrees to receive an annual floating coupon equal to LIBOR, and pay an annual $4.780222\%$ fixed rate coupon. The pay flows are known in advance, the received. LIBOR flows, except for the first one, are not. The swap cash flows summarized in Table 4.1 assume a made-up LIBOR path starting at $3.0225\%$ and ending at $5.0625\%$  

The floating LIBOR receipts on the swap, whatever they happen to be, will exactly offset the coupon interest the UK company will owe on the issued bonds, leaving it with a net fixed coupon liability to the swap counterparty.

We can view the swap as an exchange of two fictitious bonds by adding a receipt and a payment of 100 million in year 5; the two netting flows are skipped in Table 4.1. All the floating rate coupon receipts, plus the omitted 100 million one-time receipt in year 5, represent a bought floating rate bond (worth par today). The $4.780222\%$ fixed coupon payments and the omitted 100 million one-time payment in year 5 represent a shorted fixed-rate bond. If the fixed rate is chosen so that the fixed-rate bond is worth par today, then no payment to or. receipt from the dealer is needed today to enter into the swap (to settle the difference in present values).  

The same swap, looking at each cash flow exchange in turn, can be viewed as a string of FRAs. Each exchange is an agreement to receive a floating rate, set at the beginning and paid at. the end, and to pay a fixed rate at the end of the interest accrual period. This is identical to the FRA settlement formula. Even though we do not know the floating side of the exchange until the set time (FRA expiry), we know that a market FRA rate would eliminate that uncertainty at no cost. The FRA rate for each exchange is different and differs from the fixed rate of the swap, except by coincidence. Each exchange is an off-market FRA with a non-zero PV. To value the swap, we compute from the yield curve the market forward rate for each period and substitute it for the floating rate, using the certainty equivalence argument. The swap reduces to the differences between the swap fixed rate and the computed fair FRA rates. Once we compute the forward-equivalent receipts and the scheduled fixed rate payments, we discount these fixed-fixed exchanges to today. These FRA marks, some positive and some negative, represent how much would have to be paid to or received from a dealer to enter into the floating-for-fixed $4.780222\%$ exchanges. The fixed rate on the swap would be chosen so that. the sum of all the marks is zero..  

Table 4.2 illustrates the principle. Given the annual spot zero rates, we recover the forward zeros, compute the floating cash flows, as if they were fixed at those forward zeros, net them against the fixed $4.780222\%$ side, then PV the differences using the original spot rates. The fixed rate of $4.780222\%$ is chosen so that the total mark-to-market is equal to zero at the outset. In Table 4.2, the receipt of the floating LIBOR set 1 year from today to be paid 1 year later (2 years from today) can at the outset be locked into 4.040803 million. Netted against the 4.780222 million to be paid 2 years from today, the excess (0.739419) can be settled today by an immediate receipt of its PV equal to 0.688493. The same logic applies to all five exchanges. In early years, these have a negative PV to the company; in the last 3 years, they have a positive PV to the company.  

Fixed rate and floating rate swap flows do not have to have the same periodicity. Usually,. the frequency and day-count convention of each swap leg are determined by the market. Our

GBP-denominated swap example would more likely have quarterly floating interest receipts and annual fixed coupons. In the USA, the fixed side is typically semi-annual with the 30/360 day-count while the floating side is quarterly with the Act/360 day-count. Swaps following interest conventions for a given currency are labeled plain vanilla. They can be simply present valued using bootstrapped yield curves.  

# 4.2.2 Valuation of Interest Rate Swaps  

In order for the present value of the swap to be equal to the cost of a replicating strategy, the yield curve underlying the swap valuation must be bootstrapped from the liquid instruments that will be used to hedge the swap. The "spot zeros" reflecting swap counterparties' credits are the Eurocurrency (LIBOR) deposits that trade freely and at tight spreads in both directions, but they trade only for very short maturities. Maturities over 1 year have to be synthesized from Eurocurrency futures or FRAs. This is achievable with the use of liquid futures or forwards for up to 10 years for the US dollar, 5 years for the euro, and 2 years for the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and a few other currencies. Beyond 5 or 10 years, long-term government bonds can be bought and shorted at tight spreads. Since these bonds reflect the credit rating of the sovereigns (not the swap parties), they require a "plug" in the form of a swap spread which itself is continuously determined in the market..  

We will illustrate the process of pricing a US interest rate swap, its execution, and the subsequent hedging involved. Suppose on September 26, 2003, a New York dealer is contacted by ABC Corp. to provide a quote on a 5-year. $\$200$ million notional principal, plain vanilla. interest rate swap where ABC will pay the dealer a fixed rate semi-annually and will receive quarterly a floating rate of 3-month LIBOR. Suppose the dealer is faced with the "building. blocks" rates in Table 4.3.  

We assume that Eurodollar expiry dates correspond to the swap roll dates (normally we would have to interpolate). First, we determine the forward rates that can be locked in for future 3-month periods. If we had FRAs, we could use those directly, but here we do not. We need to "correct"' the FRA rates implied in the Eurodollar futures prices by what is called a futures convexity adjustment (see Chapter 6). The correction takes into account the fact that the futures settlements take place every day until the futures expiry, while the FRA settlement is one-time on the FRA start date. The longer the expiry date, the bigger is the adjustment, as it depends on the volatility of the short-term discount rate. The ultimate check if the adjustment is correct is the comparison to FRA rates, if available.

We build the zero-coupon curve from the money market rate and the convexity-adjusted implied futures. We compute the discount factors to a sequence of future dates: 3 months, 6 months, up to 60 months.  

Table 4.4 shows the results. For each forward period we take 100 minus the Eurodollar futures price as the implied futures rate. We add to it the convexity adjustment to get the. FRA rates (if we had some of those we could have skipped the initial steps). Then we daisychain today's spot LIBOR and the FRA rates to get the ever-longer spot zero rates (quarterly compounded) and discount factors. This last step reflects the cash-and-carry argument.. $\$1$ received on a future date can be synthesized by investing the dollar amount equal to the discount factor in a 3-month spot deposit and rolling it over to the final maturity by locking in. the reinvestment rates implied in all intermediate futures.  

Having constructed the yield curve, we are now ready to price the swap. Since the floating side of the swap (plus the principal) is worth par, in order to determine the semi-annual 5-year fixed rate, we need to price a 5-year semi-annual fixed coupon bond and find the coupon rate on the bond that prices the bond to par. We iterate on the fixed rate until we find one for which the bond's price is 100. Table 4.5 verifies that the target rate is $3.3636\%$ semi-annually compounded.

Knowing the fair rate of $3.3636\%$ , the dealer quotes $3.39\%$ . ABC accepts this and the swap is done. ABC Corp. has agreed to pay a fixed rate of 3.39 (semi) and receive floating 3-month LIBOR. The dealer computes his profit relative to his estimated cost of synthetic manufacture as 2.64 bp running, which is equivalent to 12.28 bp up front, or $0.001228\times200,000,000=$ $\$245,639$ . Table 4.6 reprices the fixed rate bond using the actual agreed-upon rate of $3.39\%$  

The more direct way is to take the 2.64 bp difference as each cash flow, multiply by the correct discount factor, and sum the PVs to get the 12.28 bp upfront total.  

# 4.2.3Hedging of Interest Rate Swaps  

While the profit on the swap can be calculated up front, it is not realized instantaneously,. only over the life of the swap. In order for the dealer to capture this value, he will need to manufacture the swap at the estimated cost, which can be done in two ways. The first is to synthetically replicate the offset of the scheduled cash flows. Expecting to receive. $3.39\%$ fixed against floating quarterly LIBOR, the dealer can lock in a payment of. $3.3636\%$ fixed against a receipt of floating LIBOR, using Eurodollar futures or FRAs.

would cancel and the difference in fixed sides would be the flow of profit. The second and most common is through a dynamic hedge strategy that uses the same replicating instruments. A hedge is defined as a set of positions whose values change one-for-one in opposite direction to the hedged swap. The static replication and the dynamic hedge share the same design:. produce profit up front and a zero liability in the future. The difference lies in intent. In the static replication, we match the cash flows with the instruments that lock them (futures). We leave them alone, letting the cash flows offset each other as they come due. In a dynamic hedge, we blip the inputs to the yield curve construction process (futures) to compute the local sensitivity of the swap PV to each instrument's rate $\left(\mathrm{local}=\right.$ relative to small 1 bp changes). We execute the hedge, but do not leave it alone. We recompute the set of local sensitivities and adjust the hedge after every change in the yield curve every day over the life of the swap. This by itself would produce no loss of value (zero liability) by the end of the swap, but that. is not our only intention. As we enter into new unrelated swap and hedge positions, with mismatched dates and terms, or unwind the original swap, we net the hedges against those new risks, potentially resulting in a smaller net hedge. Of course, if the dealer does not "deal' - that is, pay and receive on a variety of swaps, but grows a one-sided position where he always receives but never pays fixed on new 5-year swaps - none of the hoped-for offsetting of hedges will occur. However, if the two-sided flow does occur, then the local sensitivities on the different swaps may cancel each other. That is, the swaps on the dealer's books will, with some residual hedge, balance each other and the hedging will serve a purpose of temporarily offsetting risks until the next natural hedge is found. The dynamic hedge is, in this context, mainly a solution to the new deal timing mismatch.  

Normally, the dynamic hedge computation is done employing a basic blipping method as it is the most flexible. In our simplified example we assumed that the swap roll dates fall exactly on futures expiry dates. That is almost never the case and we end up interpolating the yield curve to figure out the forward rates that can be locked in and the discount factors to the pay dates. The static replication, no matter how careful, is also rarely exact. Hedging by blipping the curve simply recognizes this reality. Blipping consists of changing, one by one, the input rate of a spot deposit or a Eurodollar futures price, reconstructing the yield curve (discount factors), and recomputing the PV of the swap. This way, one arrives at the number of contracts of each futures that must be traded so that changes in their marks exactly offset the changes in the PV of the swap. Since blipping is performed for small rate changes (1 bp), only those small changes are perfectly hedged, the hedge has to be recomputed and readjusted frequently (perhaps once a day). That is why, even though the swap, unlike an option, can be statically replicated, the typical hedging process is dynamic and similar to delta hedging an option. Mathematically, it is equivalent to a Taylor series expansion with discretized first derivatives.  

In order to determine the exact hedge for the receive- $3.39\%$ swap, we must derive the PV sensitivities of the swap to blips of the curve one instrument at a time. We start by changing. the price of the first Eurodollar December 2003 contract by. $-0.01$ to 98.82. We rebuild the zero curve and reprice the swap. The change in the present value of the swap in dollars divided by $\$25$ gives us the number of December contracts that need to be sold to hedge the swap.. This first step is illustrated in Table 4.7 with the blipped $100-98.82=1.18$ value.  

In the second step, we return the December 2003 futures value back to 98.83 and change the price of the March 2004 contract by $-0.01$ to 98.74. We rebuild the curve and reprice the swap. The change in the present value of the swap in dollars divided by $\$25$ gives us the number of March 2004 contracts that need to be sold to hedge the swap. Table 4.8 illustrates the calculations.

In the third step, we return the March 2004 futures value back to 98.75 and change the price. of the June 2004 contract by $-0.01$ . We would continue the process until we reached June. 2008 futures, the last contract within the final maturity of the swap. Since the swap matures in September 2008, and September 2008 ED contract locks the rate from September to December, we don't need to blip that contract. If the swap maturity fell in between September and December 2008 and there were any interpolation involved, we would have to blip September 2008. as well.  

The hedge calculation consists of perturbing each input instrument by 1 bp, rebuilding the curve, repricing the swap, and computing the change in the PV of the swap as a result of the 1 bp change in the input instrument. Since our curve-building instruments are Eurodollar futures, each with a basis point multiplier of $\$25$ , we divide the swap PV change by $\$25$ to get the hedge ratio, or the number of contracts to be sold to offset the change in the value of the swap resulting from a 1 bp blip.  

There is one other instrument that is an input to the yield curve construction: the spot. 3-month LIBOR rate. Following the same procedure as illustrated in Tables 4.7 and 4.8, we. blip the 3-month spot rate to obtain a swap PV change of. $-\$4,992$ . Since establishing and unwinding of spot deposits every day can be costly, a substitute hedge can be put on which assumes parallel rate movements of spot deposits and the first Eurodollar futures. Normally this sensitivity to the spot rate can be hedged with the first available Eurodollar contract as a proxy for spot, e.g. with a serial October contract if available, stacked on top of the other Dec 2003 hedge, left unhedged, or a combination of these options. The. $\$4,992$ change is equivalent to $-200\cot2003$ contracts.

Table 4.9 summarizes the hedge for the $\$200$ million receive- $3.9\%$ swap. It involves short positions in 19 quarterly Eurodollar contracts and one serial front contract. Since we are. receiving fixed and paying floating on the swap, the swap will gain value when interest rates decrease, and lose value when interest rates increase. The short positions in Eurodollar contracts will have a negative mark-to-market when interest rates decrease (prices increase), and a positive mark-to-market when interest rates increase (prices decrease). The offset in value changes between the swap and the hedges will be identical..  

Each day after the inception of the swap, and every time interest rates change dramatically, the dealer will repeat the entire exercise, compute new hedge amounts, and trade the appropriate. number of contracts to ensure that his holdings are equal to the currently required hedge.. Every day the profits and losses on the futures will exactly offset the PV changes on the swap. As the swap ages and actual cash flows drop off, fewer maturities of the futures will be held. Daily adjustments to the positions will be small, and over time all hedges will be. liquidated.
