# 10.2 BASKET CREDIT DERIVATIVES  

The term "basket credit derivative" sometimes refers to a CDS on a portfolio of defaultable securities. The protection buyer pays a fixed dollar premium per quarter, expressed as per annum basis points on the total principal of all the securities in the basket, and receives losses from default events. Such a structure, which typically underlies a synthetic CDO, is simply a. basket of individual CDSs written on each bond or loan in the portfolio. For example, a $\$200$ million basket CDS written on four bonds, each with. $\$50$ million principal, is really four. $\$50$ million CDSs. If each premium is. $50~\mathrm{bp}$ , then the basket CDS premium is initially $200~\mathrm{bp}$ and it is reduced every time an underlying bond matures or defaults. The pricing of the simple basket CDS is easy as the sum of the separable components. In this section, we describe more complicated variants of the true basket structures in which there is a payout interaction of the component bonds or loans..  

# 10.2.1 First-to-Default Basket  

The most popular basket credit derivative on the market is the first-to-default basket. The underlying portfolio (cash or synthetic) typically contains three or more different corporate names. Similar to a one-name CDS, the contract is structured as a swap with one leg being. the premium for default insurance paid to the protection seller, and the other leg being a. one-time protection payout settlement (cash or physical exchange) if and when the default occurs. The main difference is the definition of default as the first default on any (reference) bond in the portfolio. Upon default, the premium payments stop and a one-time protection payout is made by the protection seller. In the cash settlement formula, the payout is equal to $100\%$ minus the percent recovery value on the defaulted bond times the principal amount of the basket. In the physical settlement formula, the protection seller pays the principal amount of the swap and receives the principal amount of the defaulted bond. At the time of the first default, the protection on all the subsequent defaults is discontinued..  

Figure 10.5 shows an example of a first-to-default basket derivative. The basket contains three reference bonds issued by ABC Corp., XYZ Corp, and SAF Corp. The total notional principal on the swap of. $\$100$ million, the maturity of 5 years and the premium of $2\%$ are agreed upon. As soon as the first default occurs, the buyer of the protection stops the premium payments and receives from the seller of the protection the principal amount plus the accrued interest minus the recovery value of the defaulted bond. Since the total principal of the basket is $\$100$ million and the premium is. $2.0\%$ quarterly, then assuming it is stated on a 30/360 basis (normally it is not and matches the LIBOR convention, e.g. Act/360 in the USA), the protection buyer pays a $2.0\%/4\times\$100$ million $=\$500,000$ premium to the protection seller every quarter. If, 2 years into the 5-year swap, ABC Corp.'s bond defaults and it trades in the aftermarket at 60 cents on the dollar, the protection seller will make a one-time payment of $100\%-60\%$ times $\$100$ million $\textstyle(=\$40$ million) to the protection buyer, and the arrangement will be terminated. The seller will not receive any premiums after that, and the buyer will not receive any payments even if XYZ and/or SAF bonds default over the subsequent 3-year period.

Figure 10.5A first-to-default basket derivative  

The pricing of basket derivatives is quite difficult and depends critically on the correlation of defaults of the reference names. The minimum price of the first-to-default basket is the price. of the highest single-name CDS, i.e. CDS on the riskiest bond. The maximum price is the sum of three single-name CDSs. If the correlation is high, and the bonds will tend to default together, the price of the first-to-default structure will be low, but always at least as much as that of the riskiest bond. As the correlation diminishes from one (bonds default together) to zero (bonds default in different scenarios), and further, the probability that one of the many. bonds will default increases, and the price goes up all the way to the sum of all single-name CDSs. From the seller's perspective, the attraction of the first-to-default basket lies in the fact that typically the price charged will be much higher than that of the riskiest single-name CDS, to compensate for the increased probability of default relative to the single-name CDS, yet the total loss exposure is limited to the same amount as on the single-name CDS. From the buyer's perspective, the first-to-default is a cheaper way to hedge exposure of the entire portfolio of bonds than buying all the individual CDSs. Of course, the hedge is not perfect, it protects against the "most likely" default, and the buyer is exposed to the risk of multiple defaults.  

It is not only the correlation, but also the statistical dependence (or directional causality). of the defaults that drives the price of the basket derivative. To see this, consider the case. where ABC is a major airline like Lufthansa or Delta, and SAF is a regional airline like Augsburg Air or Skywest, the latter two deriving most of their revenue by contracting to operate.  

short-distance flights for the big airlines. Clearly a default by a small airline will not necessarily cause a default by a major one, but a default by Delta/Lufthansa will ruin Skywest/Augsburg. In this case, the price of the basket derivative will be close to the higher of the two: the cost of the CDS on the major airline or the cost of the CDS on the regional airline. Since either default triggers the swap, the cost will depend on the riskier of the two.  

Now consider the case of no dependence and negative default correlation. Suppose the. basket consists of Glaxo, a UK pharmaceutical company, and Best Buy, a US electronics retail company. BestBuy is a highly cyclical consumer discretionary retailer; Glaxo is a global countercyclical staples company. The two are unrelated business entities. The cost of the basket security is likely to be near the cost of purchasing two separate single-name CDSs on the two. companies as either default will trigger the swap, and the defaults are likely to occur under different economic conditions. As the two companies' defaults are most likely not perfectly negatively correlated, the total price of the basket derivative is likely to be lower than the sum of the two CDSs.  

# 10.2.2 Nth-to-Default Basket, Arbitrage Conditions, and Hedging  

Theoretically, other basket structures, such as second-, third-, or last-to-default derivatives, can easily be structured, but as of this writing they have not proved to be very popular.  

Let us understand the workings of the last-to-default basket structure. The derivative pays only if all the reference bonds default. The minimum price can be lower than the lowest of the individual name CDSs; that is, it can be close to zero. The maximum price is the price of the highest of all the individual CDSs on the riskiest bond. The obvious arbitrage bound is that the price of the second-, third-, or last-to-default basket must be lower than the price of the first-to-default basket (assuming the same recovery rate for all the bonds) as the latter structures always pay later, and the payout is applied to the same total notional principal. The second arbitrage condition is that the purchase of all the ordered derivatives, i.e. the first-, second, . . . , last-to-default baskets is identical to the purchase of all the individual name CDSs. So, while the price of the first may be higher than the highest individual CDS and the price of the last-to-default may be lower than that of the least risky CDS, the sums of the prices must be the same.  

The exact price of the last-to-default depends on the individual securities default probabilities (marginal distributions), on the default correlation structure, and on the directional dependence (causality) structure. High correlation, which means a higher probability of joint losses, tends to increase the price of the last-to-default. Lower correlation, which implies a lower probability of multiple defaults, tends to decrease the price of the last-to-default.  

The interaction of the correlation and the directional causality also plays a role. In the Delta/Skywest example, the correlation is high (implying a high price for the last-to-default) and the causality runs from the bigger airline (Delta) to the smaller one (Skywest). In the last-to-default case, the basket only pays if both names default, so the probability structure of Delta dominates (the price of the basket is close to the price of the individual CDS on Delta) irrespective of whether Delta's marginal probability of default is lower or higher than Skywest's. Even if Skywest's marginal probability of default is much higher than Delta's, since Skywest's default does not cause Delta to default, the price of the last-to-default basket will be closer to the individual CDS on Delta, the lower of the two..  

In the low correlation, low causality Glaxo-Best Buy case, the price is driven by the joint. probability distribution. The probability of two defaults is likely to be lower than the probability of the default of the riskier of the two. If the correlation is zero or negative, then the probability of two defaults drops to zero.  

# 10.2.3 Hedging of Basket Derivatives  

The standard technique for hedging basket credit derivatives is to take positions in delta. amounts of individual CDSs. A default correlation is calibrated using the term structure of individual name CDSs. The correlations are taken as constants and the exposures of the basket. structure to the individual CDSs are computed. The best comparison would be to an option. on a small portfolio of equities priced in a Gaussian fixed correlation structure model with exposures computed to the individual stocks. The dealer is left with the residual risk to the changing correlation structure. The hedge is also subject to high rebalancing costs as the. underlying hedge instruments are individual CDSs, not cash bonds..  

Consider the hedge for a dealer buying of a 5-year first-to-default credit derivative defined in Figure 10.5. The hedge illustrated in Figure 10.6 consists of selling three individual CDSs on ABC, XYZ, and SAF. Suppose we use a Gaussian copula model with an average correlation input of 0.5 and compute the price for the basket of 200 bp. Suppose also that the delta, i.e. the hedge ratio, for each CDS turns out to be 0.7 and each CDS is quoted at 100 bp.  

Initially, for each $\$100$ million of the first-to-default the dealer buys, he sells. $\$70$ million of each individual CDS. He spends 200 bp on premium and receives 210 bp in premium. That is, each quarter he pays $\$500,000$ and receives $\$525,000$ . The dealer is typically a net premium receiver and has exposure to time decay. The dealer is also "long gamma.' Every time the cost of the underlying individual CDSs change and the dealer has to rebalance the hedge, he "buys low and sells high" When the cost of insuring ABC credit rises and the CDS spread on ABC widens from $100\mathrm{bp}$ to $120\mathrm{bp}$ , the delta increases. Conversely, when the cost of insuring SAF. credit declines from 100 bp to $80~\mathrm{bp}$ , the delta decreases.  

Figure 10.6 shows the hedge rebalancing for a long first-to-default position. When the spread on the ABC credit widens (ABC becomes riskier) and the spread on the SAF credit. narrows (SAF becomes safer), the dealer sells another $\$10$ million of the ABC CDS receiving additional $1.2\%$ on a $\$10$ million notional, and unwinds at a profit or buys $\$10$ million of the SAF CDS paying $0.8\%$ on a $\$10$ million notional. Net, the dealer has a positive cash flow on the rebalance. If the SAF credit were to subsequently widen back to 100 bp or more, the dealer would sell more of the SAF CDS. In this way, the dealer sells more at a higher spread. and buys back at a lower spread. Meanwhile, if none of the credits defaults, the value of the first-to-default basket insurance slowly decays.
