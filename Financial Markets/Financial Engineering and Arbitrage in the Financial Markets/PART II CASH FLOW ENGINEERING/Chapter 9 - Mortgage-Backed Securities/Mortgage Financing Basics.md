# 9.1  MORTGAGE FINANCING BASICS  

Mortgage loans that are used to finance the purchase of a piece of real estate are recorded in. municipal property registers. The record includes the name of the bank granting the loan (or the subsequent assignees) and the lender's first (lien) right to liquidate the property or to the funds obtained from the future sale of the property by the owner. Mortgage loans are thus. strongly collateralized.  

Mortgage "originators' like banks or mortgage brokers (UK: building societies, credit. unions, and banks) use several criteria in evaluating the mortgage loan application. In the USA they may use the \*FICO score" (after the Fair Isaac model) contained in a credit risk evaluation report compiled by a credit-reporting firm such as Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion. They may. use the information about the income sources provided by the buyer on his loan application form ("documentation'). They use the information about the property regarding ownership or. "title' and evaluate the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Since the loan is likely to be immediately sold, the originators make sure that the loan fits into one of the "conforming" categories defined by the GSE that will buy the loan. If the LTV is high, the mortgagee may be forced to. take out private mortgage insurance (PMI) or a second-line loan to increase the down payment (equity part). In the 1990s-2000s, documentation standards were sloppy (often falsified) as originators were eager to classify any loan as conforming to get it ready for an instant sale.  

The underwriting process of a mortgage lender moves the loan through the application, appraisal, and documentation stages. Once the loan is approved, the lending bank or credit union commits funds until the closing date. On that date, the funds are paid out and the ownership of the property is transferred, including the recording of the transfer and the loan in the town or county records. Almost immediately, the loan is sold. The originating bank or broker earns the origination fee, which is a percentage of the face value of the loan. The sale of the loan does not change the fact that the payments on the loan will have to be collected over the following years, also taxes and hazard insurance on the property will have to be paid quarterly or annually. The work of collecting loan payments and maintaining the associated escrow accounts to cover the disbursements is called "servicing.' The institution that provides the servicing of the loan is compensated for it in the form of a "base" servicing fee, $0.25\substack{-0.4\%}$ per annum of the outstanding balance. Often excess servicing is also retained. Before the mortgage is securitized and placed in the pool it may also be insured. The total of these payments is referred to as "servicing fee." Very large banks and specialty servicing banks offer servicing to other lenders. Sometimes the originating bank retains the servicing.  

Mortgage loans can have a variety of terms. Maturities are 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. The interest rates can be fixed, floating, or a combination of the two. Payments are typically monthly, but can be biweekly. They include interest and principal portions in the fully amortizing (UK: repayment mortgage) or adjustable (UK: standard variable) case, or only interest in the interest-only balloon case. The most popular mortgage loans are a 30-year level-payment fully-. amortizing fixed rate monthly loan, a 30-year fully amortizing annually or monthly adjustable. rate mortgage (ARM) tied to T-Bills or LIBOR plus a margin (sometimes the Fed Funds, Prime. rate, or the COFI index are used), and the hybrid fixed-floating structure wherein the rate is. fixed for 3-7 years and then floats. Each of these structures provides different prepayment. incentives to the borrower. Generally the greatest interest rate risk (duration and convexity) is associated with the 30-year fixed structure. The interest rate on the mortgage is stated as an annual percentage rate APR (e.g. $6\%$ ), but is compounded monthly (i.e. is really $6\%/12=0.5\%$ per month), resulting in an effective annual rate (EAR) higher than the APR. Mortgage interest accrues over a calendar month and is paid in arrears (at the end of the month) with a slight (up to 2-week) grace period. The servicer collects the mandatory interest and principal portion. plus any partial prepayment amount, sometimes also escrow amounts for taxes and insurance. if the homeowner prefers that method. The interest, principal, and prepayment portion minus the servicing fee are then forwarded to the pool trust entity that owns the mortgage.  

Mortgage loans come in a variety of forms and sizes. A "conventional' loan, as defined by Fannie Mae, is no bigger than $\$300,000$ to $\$900,000$ depending on the geographic location;. a larger size is called "jumbo.' Residential mortgages cover single family detached homes,. 1-4 family homes, multifamily homes, condominiums, co-ops, etc. "Conventional' can also referred to fixed rate. Mortgages can also be divided into "prime" (high FICO), further divided into A-paper and Alt-A, and "sub-prime" (low FICO score and high LTV)..

period, equals the borrowed principal balance of. $\$300,000$ . The interest portion of the monthly.   
payment is always $0.5416667\%$ of the outstanding principal at the beginning of the month..   
The principal reduction portion is the remainder of the monthly payment.  

The mortgage holder can send extra payments sporadically or each month at his/her discre-. tion. These are applied to the principal and reduce the ending principal balance for the month in which they are sent. Since the total scheduled monthly payment stays the same, the interest part of subsequent months' scheduled payments shrinks, leaving room for a faster repayment of the principal.  

# 9.2PREPAYMENT RISK  

Residential mortgage loans in the USA can be prepaid by the borrowers without any penalty (in the UK they may incur a redemption penalty or a tie-in). In contrast, commercial real estate loans are often subject to lock-out periods and varying penalties for an early repayment. This no-penalty feature makes residential mortgages easy to refinance with an entirely new loan (some home purchases are refinanced many times), partially prepay ("curtail') with extra monthly checks, pay off at the time of the sale. Generally, all of these cases are termed "prepayments.' However, some prepayments are interest rate-sensitive and some are not. Refinancings are driven by the difference between the current level of interest rates and the fixed rate on the mortgage, and by the speed of decline in the interest rates. Prepayments due. to curtailments, home sales, property destruction, or defaults, are generally driven by the life factors of the homeowner, not interest rates. There are other factors that affect the prepayment behavior of homeowners, such as the year the owner bought the house, the geographic location, and the general economy and employment..  

The standard unit of prepayment speed is the PSA (Public Securities Association) benchmark, developed a long time ago on the basis of prepayment statistics for GNMA loans. Instead of quoting directly the percentage of the principal prepaid during the month (called the single monthly mortality rate, SMM) or the annualized equivalent of SMM (called the conditional prepayment rate, CPR), traders quote the percentage PSA. $100\%$ PSA" or"100 PSA' means that for mortgages under 30 months old we use a CPR equal to $n\times0.2\%$ , where $n$ is the seasoning (age) of the mortgage, and for mortgages 30 months and older we use a $6\%$ CPR. "140 PSA' means that they multiply these numbers by 1.4. The idea is that newly. originated mortgages are less likely to be paid off or refinanced (as the homeowner is settling or interest rates have not had a chance to move), so it is necessary to have an upward sliding scale ("ramp') of the rate of prepayments relative to the age of the mortgage. At. $2{\frac{1}{2}}$ years of age or older, all mortgages are roughly equally likely to prepay at. $6\%$ CPR. Figure 9.1 shows the PSA ramp.  

The information about the prepayment rate of a mortgage or a pool of mortgages is interpreted in the following stages. We are given the PSA rate as 175, $P S A=175\%=1.75$ Together with the age of the mortgage $n$ in months, we translate the PSA into the CPR. If the mortgage is $n=7$ months old, then:  

$$
C P R=1.75\times1.4\%=2.45\%
$$  

If the mortgage is $n=101$ months old ("fully seasoned'), then:  

$$
C P R=1.75\times6\%=10.5\%
$$

Figure 9.1 The PSA Curve.  

We then de-annualize the CPR into the SMM following the monthly compounding rule:  

$$
1-C P R=(1-S M M)^{12}
$$  

to get  

$$
S M M=0.9202\%
$$  

The SMM is then applied to the ending scheduled principal for the month. That is the. prepayment represents the additional decrement of the principal on top of the scheduled amortization as part of the scheduled monthly payment. In the individual mortgage example of Table 8.1, the scheduled ending principal in month 101 would be reduced by. $0.9202\%$ , i.e.  

$$
E n d P r i n c i p a l=S c h e d E n d P r i n c i p a l\times(1-\mathrm{SMM})
$$
