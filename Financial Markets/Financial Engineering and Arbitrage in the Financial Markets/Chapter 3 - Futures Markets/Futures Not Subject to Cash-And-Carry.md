# 3.4  FUTURES NOT SUBJECT TO CASH-AND-CARRY  

Assets like stocks, fixed income instruments, and currencies are examples of pure financial assets. As they are claims on real assets and are held purely for investment purposes, investors are indifferent to holding these assets or claims on them. For example, stock investors are rarely interested in seeing stock certificates; what matters to them is that they receive dividends and are able to sell their holdings on demand. Bond investors want coupon and principal cash flow. Currencies are held for their purchasing power and can be substituted for by checks, debit,. or credit cards. Because investors do not hold pure financial assets for their physical qualities but for their qualities as claims on income, they are held long as a store of wealth and easily substitutable by many investors. They are not subject to restrictions on short sales, and both cash-and-carry and reverse cash-and-carry strategies are executable and almost at the same cost. This is most obvious with currencies where a purchase of one currency automatically means a sale of another. For pure financial assets, the general form of the fair value equation includes the cost of financing (paid carry) net of any received carry, such as (coupon) interest. or dividends.  

Most agricultural, energy, and metal commodities are convenience assets. Holders of these. commodities own them not only for investment purposes, but to be used in production, and. any disruption to that production may be costly. Having a forward contract fixing the purchase price is not the same as holding the physical asset. This additional implicit value -- which varies from user to user and is derived from owning the physical asset -- is called a convenience yield. It can be most easily treated as a form of dividend, as the owner of the asset has a valuable insurance policy that his business will not be disrupted. When giving up the asset (selling. or lending), the owner has to be compensated for the loss of the convenience. The reverse cash-and-carry strategy may not be executable at all or may lead to very high costs. Financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, may exhibit this convenience value, but a stock borrow fee or a special repo rate put a competitive market-determined dollar value on it. Gold can be argued to have some convenience aspects due to its industrial uses, but it trades mostly as a financial asset (store of wealth). It can be either directly or indirectly (through ETFs) shorted, and gold bullion is largely fungible. Some metals (such as palladium) and agriculturals (such as orange juice concentrate and soybean meal) are definitely convenience assets, and the value. of the convenience has to be taken explicitly into account in the cost-of-carry equation. Using continuous notation, this can be imagined as an additional term in the exponent, similar to the dividend yield:  

$$
F=S e^{(r+s-c y)t}
$$  

where $r$ is the interest rate, $s$ is the storage cost as extra interest charge, and. $c y$ is the convenience yield. Again, note that the stock borrow fee is a monetized value of the convenience. For metal. or agricultural commodities, the convenience value is less obvious, but not less real. In fact,. we can turn the argument around to state that, by observing the futures contracts relative. to the spot price, we can impute the market-determined value of the convenience (by the. marginal investor) as the wedge in the cost-of-carry equation. The convenience yield can be large (positive) resulting in a decreasing pattern of futures prices on subsequent contracts, and smaller than the spot price, called backwardation..  

There are many economic explanations for the pattern of commodity futures prices. The earliest one goes back to Keynes. In Keynes' view, most hedgers are producers of commodities (farmer selling wheat) who tend to short futures at a discount to expected future spot value (anxious to lock in price) in order to compensate speculators for accepting the risk (the difference between the expected future spot and the futures price is the reward). This results in normal backwardation. Note that the statement of value is relative to the expected future spot. price not the fair value from the cost-of-carry equation. Figure 3.1(a) illustrates the situation. The hedgers' demand for futures is inelastic (steep) and the hedgers want to short futures. Speculators display elastic (flat) demand; they can go long or short as long as they expect.

to make a profit on the futures price moving to the expected spot. The futures price obtains where the hedgers' demand for, and the speculators' supply of, futures are equal in absolute value.  

The opposite of normal backwardation is a contango. Here, most hedgers are the buyers of commodities (Starbucks buying coffee) who go long futures at a premium to expected future spot value (anxious to lock in price) in order to compensate speculators for accepting the risk (the difference between the futures price and the expected future spot is the reward). This results in futures trading higher than expected spot, as shown in Figure 3.1(b). The hedgers' demand for futures is again inelastic (steep), but the hedgers now want to buy futures. The. speculators' supply is elastic (flat). The futures price settles above the expected spot where the demand and supply are equal in absolute value; the speculators end up net short..  

In real life, there is no way of knowing for sure whose demand (for future delivery) is stronger at any given moment of time: that of the sellers (producers) or the buyers (users). There is also no way to impute the expected future spot. The only observations we can make is futures prices relative to spot prices. Since, for most physical commodities, financing and storing are positive costs: if the convenience yield is negligible or zero, futures prices should rise with expiry. However, we also argued before that - as is the case for many physical commodities - if financing to buy spot (cash-and-carry) is easy, but shorting the commodity spot and lending money balances (reverse cash-and-carry) is not, then the cost-of-carry fair value becomes a ceiling on a futures price, i.e. we have an inequality:  

$$
F\leq S+F i n a n c i n g\pm C a r r y
$$  

We should bear these factors in mind when trying to interpret the pattern of futures prices. as the normal backwardation or contango. When futures prices rise rapidly with expiry well. beyond the cost-of-carry, we can construe that as a contango (and/or negative convenience yield). When they are flat or declining, we could be in the normal backwardation excess supply. of futures by producers and/or we could be experiencing a large positive convenience yield of owning the asset spot. For example, after the commodity market crash in February 2009, news. headlines reported large releases of oil supplies from tankers on the open sea (suggesting the. unwinding of "open' cash-and-carry strategies), and the pattern of prices was increasing in expiry as in Table 3.21.  

The drastic jump in price from March to April cannot be explained by financing plus storage costs and could be interpreted as a contango due to the unloading of excess supplies. Usual explanations for contangos include resolutions of wars, expectations of new supply lines, or negative convenience yields, like holding wheat just before a plentiful harvest.

On July 22, 2003, the news of the day was a substantial drop in coffee prices as expectations of frost affecting the August crop in Brazil faded. Coffee prices dropped substantially on that day, with spot prices dropping the most, resulting in a contango for the coffee prices in Table 3.22.  

Assuming LIBOR of $1.13\%$ (continuously compounded) and zero storage costs, the September-July price difference reflected the convenience yield of $-9.92\%$ . Also on July 22, 2003, NYMEX crude oil futures were reported at the prices shown in Table 3.23. The last two columns show the fair values and the convenience yields, calculated under the assumptions of LIBOR at $1.13\%$ and storage costs of $\$2$ per barrel per year, or $6.1\%$ (continuously. compounded) per year given the spot price of 31.98.  

The results show substantial convenience yields for the near months, much greater than the financing and storage costs. Thus, little of the futures-spot price differential is explained by the cost-of-carry argument, rendering the spot-futures and futures-futures cash-and-carry arbitrage highly speculative.
