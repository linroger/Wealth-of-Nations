# 11.5 FUNDAMENTAL INDEXING  

The last 10 years have ushered in a new trend in indexing. Instead of the traditional selfrebalancing cap weighting model, several funds shifted to alternatives in designing their. diversified portfolios. In general, the use of any stock-weighting method other than cap-. weighting is called fundamental indexing. The two most popular of these schemes are equal weighting and dividend weighting, followed by earnings, revenues, free cash flows, book equity, and composites thereof. Why is there such an interest?.  

In the CAPM theory, one of the critical assumptions is that every investor (if he or she. is mean-variance "rational' or subject to certain "rational' utility function) will choose the. market portfolio. This uniform behavior will dictate that the best portfolio is a cap-weighted set of all risky securities. The world isn't so neat. Some asset classes are illiquid; riskless assets are different for investors in different part of the globe. Not everyone indexes; perhaps there is value to be discovered. According to Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, a firm that offers several. fundamental index ETFs, cap-weighting overweights overpriced stocks and underweights. underpriced stocks. The three- and four-factor index models seem to state that in addition. to the cap market portfolio, size, book value, and momentum matter. Simple cap weighting. may not be the optimal method for a passive investor trying to capture reward for systematic. risk. To index properly, a passive investor would have holdings of portfolios mimicking all systematic factors. Is fundamental indexing an attempt to build such investable vehicles in one. fell swoop? While there is no convincing research to show how fundamental indexing relates. to the priced risk factors, the intuition points to the possibility that fundamental indexing is. related to capturing, in a haphazard way, the exposure to the other factors. Or perhaps the index model's factors are haphazard (only imperfectly rotated from the true factors), and. fundamental indexing captures the true factors better.  

# 11.5.1 A Brief History of Fundamental Indexing  

Burton Malkiel and John Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, have not budged one bit in their strong support of cap indexing since the 1970s (see Malkiel, 1973). The self-maintaining cap weighting is the cheapest way to replicate the performance of the entire stock market. Stocks that go up increase their weight in the index; stocks that go down decrease their weight in the index. Theoretically, the portfolio manager offering an index fund has to do nothing beyond administer the fund, collect dividends and update the shareholding for splits. The only maintenance and turnover come from constructing a narrower index (only 500 stocks) and cost optimization by not holding all the required stocks and incurring a tracking error. However, if all the stocks represent all the systematic risks in the economy, then one should hold all the stocks.  

In 2003, Rydex/SGI offered to investors the first equal-weighted index of S&P 500 stocks under the ticker RSP. The same year, iShares (originally owned by Barclays, currently owned by BlackRock) launched the first dividend-weighted index ETF of top. $100~\mathrm{US}$ stocks under the ticker DVY. In 2005 and 2006, Research Affiliates offered several fundamentally-weighted indexes of US stocks under the PowerShares family. Wisdom Tree launched their fundamentalweighted ETFs in 2006. Since then, all of these providers have created or are working on funds and ETFs reweighting international markets, country indexes and sub-indexes, and industrial. sectors. For example, in the global stock space, DEM is an ETF tracking a dividend yield rank-weighted index of emerging market stocks. It covers stocks from Asia, Eastern Europe,. and Latin America with weights based on their dividends. In the US space, DLS is smallcap dividend weighted, DIM is mid-cap dividend weighted, and DLN is large-cap dividend weighted. The innovation in the ways indexing can be done efficiently continues apace..  

One potential drawback of alternative indexing is portfolio turnover. The general expense ratios for equal and fundamental-indexed funds hover around $0.4\mathrm{-}0.5\%$ , while cap indexing is generally under $0.2\%$ for most of the developed country stock markets. However, because this way of indexing is not self-sustaining (cap weighting is), the fundamental-indexed ETFs have double the turnover and potentially higher cap gains distributions than cap-weighted ones.  

# 11.5.2 Fundamental Indexing and Rebalancing  

One important feature of the fundamental-indexed funds is their scheduled rebalancing. In defining a cap-weighting index, no one asks how often the fund manager rebalances to maintain. the composition of the portfolio. It does not matter; the fund rebalances itself except for unusual situations of stocks merging, dropping out of the index, etc. This is not so with equal. or fundamental-indexed funds. The frequency of rebalancing is dictated by the compromise. between the desire to maintain the index weights and to avoid transaction costs and turnover. Most of the time, the funds are rebalanced quarterly..  

Consider SPY, the SPDR cap-weighted index of the top 500 US stocks, and RSP, the. Rydex equal-weighted index of the same universe of stocks. To start with, RSP overweights in. smaller stocks and underweights in the largest stocks relative to SPY. As some stocks go up,. and some go down, SPY does nothing, while RSP sells the winners and buys the (relative or absolute) losers.  

Two facts, well documented by the US stock research, jump to mind. First, small stocks. outperform large over time; small stocks have higher standard deviations. Second, stocks exhibit short-term momentum and long-term reversals. The automatic rebalancing built into the equal-weight fund can potentially be a way to bet on these statistics and take advantage of reversals. The overweighting in small caps (actually small large caps) can also contribute to the relative outperformance of these indexes. We may not be overperforming, but rather being. compensated for increased risk.

EWRI is a US stock ETF equally weighted in sectors. It is well documented that it is not. small-vs-large or value-vs-growth, but actually the industrial sector variation that accounts for most over- or underperformance of a portfolio relative to the index. The appeal of the EWRI is the sector rebalancing. EPS is an earnings-weighted ETF of US stocks. Earnings. and cap weightings are closely related reflecting the earnings discounting philosophy of stock valuation. PRF is based on a composite of Research Affiliates fundamental metrics. Let us hope they have picked the right ones..  

# 11.5.3Tactical Asset Allocation  

This section is deliberately one paragraph long. Tactical asset allocation is active investing with passive (sector, country, asset class) ETF vehicles relying on a black-box allocation tool. It is a religion: if you believe in the statistical or man-biased crystal ball inside the black-box because it performed miracles in the past, or an adviser talks you into it, you go for it. The fundamental indexing crystal ball is mechanical and $100\%$ transparent. The real unanswered question is: are both the result of statistical data mining into the past to see what worked and offer no guidance for the future? And how different is that from a four-factor index model?  

# 11.5.4Fundamentally Indexed US Funds  

Here is a sample of retail fundamentally indexed funds trading on US exchanges as of March 2011. They are in no particular order, just what I found interesting scouring press coverage;. some funds are not fundamentally indexed but offer strangely narrow market focus. Table 11.6 contains the list with the size of the fund. Table 12.3, at the end of Chapter 12, contains a. similar random list of retail funds attempting hedge fund replication. Buyer beware!.
