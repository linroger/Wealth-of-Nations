# 2.6 SHORT SELLING  

Securities - stocks and bonds - bought on behalf of their customers are held in brokerage. houses in "street name,' i.e. the customers' names are not identified and the brokerage simply. holds the total number of shares or bonds for all its customers, collects the total amount of dividends or coupon interest from the issuer, and apportions them into the customers' accounts..  

Because of that, these securities can be borrowed/lent like a generic commodity among the. customers of the same brokerage house and among brokerage houses. This allows account holders to borrow securities they do not own, sell them to a third party, repurchase them from another investor, and return them to the original owner. The process of borrowing a security. from a broker's pool of stocks and bonds and selling the security in the market is called short selling.  

Just as buying a security (also referred to as going long a security) is done in the hope of profiting from its appreciation, short selling is done in a hope of being able to repurchase the security at a lower price later to profit from the reduced price. Short selling, just like buying, is an important mechanism in the process of bringing material information about the economic condition of the issuer to the market and the overall fair price discovery. Cash and margin. buyers come with positive news; sellers and short sellers come with negative news..  

Short selling can only take place in margin accounts. The short seller receives cash for the sold securities, but is also required to post additional cash with a broker to ensure that the securities will be returned to the original owner before he or she decides to sell them. With a large pool of similar securities to lend out, brokers rarely have to resort to calling the securities loans, but there is always a possibility. Also, if the value of the securities goes up and the short seller's liability increases, the broker will issue a margin call on the customer by asking for additional cash. The margin is also used to pay the original owner of the securities any intermediate cash flows due on the security while the security is sold short. The owner/lender of the security may be due dividends or coupon interest which cannot come from the issuer as these now go to the new owner, so the short seller has to compensate (through the broker) the original owner of the securities for those cash flows. Let us review the mechanics of margin accounts and buying, selling, and shorting securities.  

# 2.6.1 Buying on Margin  

Stocks and bonds can be purchases for cash, i.e. using only the buyer's own funds, or on margin,. i.e. by borrowing some of the needed cash from the broker. The margin loan is collateralized by the purchased securities. Since margin loans play a larger role in money and credit creation in the economy, they are regulated by the central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the USA, by setting the initial and maintenance margin minimums. The margin is defined as the owner's equity in the account as percentage of the value of the securities..  

Suppose the broker's margin requirements are. $50\%$ initial and $40\%$ maintenance, and Jack wants to buy 400 shares of ABC Corp. currently trading at $\$50$ per share. Of the $\$20,000$ needed, Jack puts up $\$10,000$ of his own cash and borrows. $\$10,000$ from his broker. His margin is $50\%$ . He buys the ABC stock hoping its price will go up..  

Suppose he is right, and ABC's price rises by $10\%$ to $\$55$ . Jack sells his 400 shares for $\$55$ a share, or $\$22,000$ . He pays off the margin loan of $\$10,000$ (we ignore the interest on the loan) and is left with.. $\$12,000$ , a $20\%$ return on his invested capital of $\$10,000$ . His 2:1 leverage allowed him to double his profit relative to the price change. If he had purchased the stock with his own cash of. $\$20,000$ , his return would have been only $10\%$ , the same as the rise in the price of the stock..  

Suppose, instead, that Jack is wrong and ABC's stock goes down $10\%$ to $\$45$ . Jack sells his 400 shares for $\$18,000$ , repays his $\$10,000$ margin loan and is left with $\$8,000$ , incurring a $\$2,000$ or $20\%$ loss on his investment of $\$10,000$ . His 2:1 leverage doubled his percentage loss relative to a straight cash purchase. Margin and leverage are symmetric, they amplify gains, but they also amplify losses by the same ratio.  

For a buy transaction, the margin requirement (owner's equity as percentage of security value) is defined as:  

$$
M a r g i n=\frac{\mathrm{Securityvalue}-\S\mathrm{Loan}}{\mathrm{Securityvalue}}
$$  

Initially, Jack's margin was:  

$$
M a r g i n=\frac{400\times\mathbb{\mathbb{S}}50-\mathbb{\mathbb{S}}10\mathrm{,000}}{400\times\mathbb{\mathbb{S}}50}=50\%
$$  

When ABC's stock price dropped to $\$45$ , Jack's margin was:.  

$$
M a r g i n=\frac{400\times\S45-\S10,000}{400\times\S45}=44.44\%
$$  

Had the stock dropped further, Jack would have been called by the broker to post additional. cash collateral. The margin call would have occurred when Jack's equity in the account dropped to $40\%$ , i.e. when  

$$
0.40={\frac{400\times P-\S10,000}{400\times P}}\Rightarrow P=\S41.67
$$  

ABC's price dropped down to $\$41.67$ . While an individual investor's leverage cannot in this example increase to more than 100:40 or 2.5:1, it is easy to see how a fund, if allowed to use the margined securities to collateralize additional cash loans, could obtain a much higher leverage.  

# 2.6.2 Short Selling in a Margin Account  

Suppose the broker's margin requirements are still $50\%$ initial and. $40\%$ maintenance, and Jack wants to short sell 400 shares of ABC Corp. currently trading at. $\$50$ per share. After borrowing the shares from the broker, Jack sells them to a third party for the $\$20,000$ . Jack is required to leave his funds with the broker, perhaps earning interest on his balances, and he is required to post an additional $\$10,000$ of his own cash. The total cash balance in the account is $\$30,000$ and his margin is $50\%$ . He has short sold the ABC stock hoping its price will go down.  

Suppose he is right, and ABC's price drops by $20\%$ to $\$40$ . Jack buys back 400 shares for $\$40$ a share, or $\$16,000$ . He returns the borrowed securities (we ignore any loan fees) and. is left with $\$14,000$ in the account, a $40\%$ return on his invested capital of $\$10,000$ . His 2:1 leverage allowed him to double his profit relative to the price change. If he had had to post the full collateral of $\$20,000$ on the short sale, his return would have been only $20\%$ , the same as the decline in the price of the stock.  

Suppose instead that Jack is wrong and ABC's stock goes up. $20\%$ to $\$60$ . Jack buys back 400 shares for $\$24,000$ , leaving him with $\$6,000$ in the account, a $\$4,000$ or $40\%$ loss on his investment of $\$10,000$ . His 2:1 leverage doubled his percentage loss relative to a straight. sale out of/repurchase into his own inventory. Margin and leverage are again symmetric, they amplify gains, and they amplify losses by the same ratio..  

For a short sale transaction, the margin requirement (owner's equity as a percentage of security value) is defined as:  

$$
M a r g i n={\frac{\oint{\mathrm{Account}}{\mathrm{balance}}-{\mathrm{Security}}{\mathrm{value}}}{\mathrm{Security}{\mathrm{value}}}}
$$  

Initially, Jack's margin was:  

$$
M a r g i n=\frac{\mathbb{S}30,000-400\times\mathbb{S}50}{400\times\mathbb{S}50}=50\%
$$  

When ABC's stock price rises to $\$52$ , Jack's margin is:  

$$
M a r g i n=\frac{\mathbb{\P}30,000-400\times\mathbb{\P}52}{400\times\mathbb{\P}52}=44.23\%
$$  

If the stock were to rise further, Jack would be called by the broker to post additional cash collateral. The margin call would occur when Jack's equity in the account dropped to $40\%$ i.e. when  

$$
0.40={\frac{\S30,000-400\times P}{400\times P}}\Rightarrow P=\S53.57
$$  

ABC's price rose to $\$53.57$ . The margin call for a short sale occurs much earlier, i.e. for a much smaller price movement, than the margin call on a buy transaction.  

Short sales have been subject to some controversy, especially when the short sale is naked.. Naked short selling is similar to check kiting. Because security transactions may take a few. days to clear (the electronic agreement to transact is instant, but the actual delivery of securities and/or payment for them is delayed), if unchecked, it is possible for a short seller to borrow the stock, sell it, and buy it back, even before the original sale is cleared, and then roll it over into another short sale. In this way, the amount of shorted stock may exceed the total amount of stock outstanding. That is clearly not what the mechanism of short selling has been intended for.  

# 2.6.3 Short Selling of Bonds  

The above is an example of a short sale of ABC stock. If ABC happened to go ex-dividend between the time of the short sale and the time of the repurchase of the stock, Jack would have had to pay out of his account the amount of the declared dividend to the lender of the stock. The same happens when one short sells a bond (Figure 2.19).

Figure 2.19 Short $\$50m6\%$ 4/15/38 on February 15  

Suppose on February 15, Jack shorts. $\$50$ million of Pfizer $6.00\%$ April 15, 2038 bonds selling at par. On February 15, Jack borrows the bond from his broker J&R Brokerage and. sells it in the open market for. $\$50$ million plus accrued interest of. $\$1$ million (120/180 of the semi-annual coupon of $3\%$ on $\$50$ million). On April 15, Jack has to reimburse J&R Brokerage. $\$1.5$ million for the coupon cash flow J&R would have received from Pfizer had it not lent out. the bond. If the short position stays on through the next coupon date of October 15, Jack will again have to reimburse J&R $\$1.5$ million. This will continue until Jack buys the bond back in the open market and returns it to J&R..  

If the bond is trading at 95 on November 15, Jack can buy it back for $\$47.5$ million plus the accrued interest of $\$250,000$ , or the total invoice price of. $\$47.75$ million, having in the. meantime paid for two coupon cash flows of $\$1.5$ million each on April 15 and October 15.  

High grade bonds are often used in repurchase (repo) and reverse repo agreements. A repo. is an overnight borrowing arrangement structured as a sale of a bond and an agreement to. repurchase it the next day for a prearranged price. The difference in the sale and repurchase. price is the interest paid on the borrowed funds. A repo is not a short sale, as the bonds are. not borrowed but owned and delivered as collateral at the time of the repo. However, bonds obtained as collateral through a reverse repo (lending cash by buying and subsequent reselling of collateral) can be short sold to a third party. The reverse repo has to be entered into as a term agreement or rolled over daily for the duration of the short sale. A reverse repo is thus a way of borrowing bonds.  

The greatest misconception about futures and forwards is that they predict the path the spot prices will take in the future. In that view, spot prices reflect the supply and demand conditions. now, and futures prices reflect the consensus about the supply and demand conditions in the future. A forecast of future drought or supply disruption leaves spot prices unchanged but. raises the futures price. Yet why wouldn't a potential adverse event incentivize an enterprising trader to buy the commodity now, store it, and deliver it later, putting upward pressure on the spot price? The fact is that information about the future supply and demand conditions affects jointly spot and futures prices. Moreover, as discussed in this chapter, most spot and futures. prices are tied to each other mathematically by a cost-of-carry equation which reflects the cost of financing a purchase of the commodity spot and carrying it (storing and earning a yield) to the futures expiry date. This cash-and-carry arbitrage allows the synthetic replication of a. futures contract with a spot purchase or sale and a borrowing or lending of funds.  

While futures and forwards do not predict future spot prices independently of the current spot prices, they perform a very important function in a market economy. They allow economic agents to eliminate future price risk and focus completely on product innovation and efficiency. Suppliers of commodities investing in their extraction or cultivation (corn and coffee growers, palladium miners) can lock in future sale prices today. Buyers of commodities who use them as inputs into production and innovation (coffee sellers such as Starbucks, or car company suppliers investing in lithium or cobalt batteries) can lock in future purchase prices today. The price risk transference in the futures markets would be impossible without thousands of speculators who stand ready to go long or short contracts for multiple future delivery dates. They expect to make profit over time by taking short-term positions based on the analysis of the demand and supply of the commodities, in the process establishing prices, and sending economic signals for efficient allocation of resources in the economy.
