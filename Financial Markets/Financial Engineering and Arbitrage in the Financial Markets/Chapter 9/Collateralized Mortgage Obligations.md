# 9.4 COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS  

Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are created by unbundling the interest, scheduled principal and prepaid principal flows of pass-throughs and rebundling them back into new streams of cash flows, called "tranches,' according to strict priority rules. Pooling can only go so far in diversifying risk. The objective of the tranche design is to create senior classes of securities with stable cash flows that are safer than the underlying pool. The senior classes have cash flow priority. As a consequence, we end up with very risky companion "equity" classes to which the risk is transferred.  

There are several ways to slice loan cash flows. We cover the three most common designs:  

The sequential class CMO, with several classes ordered by priority and labeled A, B, C, D,. etc. Each class receives the stated interest as it comes, but principal is sent first to A, then to B, then to C, etc.   
The PAC CMO (the planned amortization class CMO) is a variant of the sequential CMO with a principal amortization schedule based on lower and upper bands on prepayments.. The IO/PO classes, where interest is sent to the IO class and all principal is sent to the PO. class. This can be combined with a PAC design..  

Each design divides the total risk of the pool differently. In the sequential structure, no matter how risky the pool, class A always gets paid first. This insulates it from almost all default risk and a lot of prepayment risk. The PAC structure artificially restricts the prepayment risk even further by not sending too much principal flow when prepayments are very high, and sending extra flow when prepayments are very slow. A senior PAC class's cash flows are very predictable. The IO/PO structure exposes the IO holders to the risk of fast prepayments and the PO holders to the risk of slow prepayments. This design focuses primarily on interest rate risk..  

# 9.4.1 Sequential-Pay CMO  

We take our hypothetical pool CL201107B4 defined in Tables 8.2 and 8.3 and divide its cash flows into three sequential tranches. The total principal outstanding at the outset is $\$300$ million; the underlying pool is already seasoned by 11 months; the WAC is $6.5\%$ and the pass-through coupon is $6.0\%$ . We create three tranches: A, with a principal of $\$125$ million; B, with $\$100$ million; and C, with. $\$75$ million. Each tranche has a stated pass-through coupon of  

$6.0\%$ . Each tranche also has a stated maturity, A being the shortest, but the actual maturity is.   
unknown. The stated maturity on A is 7 years. We then project the cash flows of the tranches.  

Table 9.4 shows the cash flows at 175 PSA. In the early months, all scheduled and prepaid principal flows go to tranche A paying down its principal. Meanwhile B and C receive only interest cash flows. Once A's principal is returned and all cash flows to the A certificate holder stop in month 57, tranche B begins to receive scheduled and prepaid principal flows. When B is paid in month 134, C receives the principal flows.  

Table 9.5 shows the cash flows for the same CMO at 240 PSA. Again, all scheduled and prepaid principal flows go first to tranche A, then to B, then to C. Since the prepayments come in faster at 240 PSA, all classes pay down the principal sooner. Tranche A gets paid off in month 44 instead of month 57 at 175 PSA. Tranche B gets paid off in month 103 instead of month 134 at 175 PSA.  

Tranche C carries the greatest prepayment risk. We know that the total amount principal. it will receive is $\$75$ million. We don't know when its principal is going to be paid. At 175. PSA it starts being paid down in month 134; at 240 PSA it starts being paid down in month. 103. We don't know up front how much total interest the tranche will receive. Both interest and principal stretch out to 349 months with the very uncertain principal flows coming in later months. The cash flows are back-loaded more like those of a long-duration balloon bond. This makes present-valuing the cash flows very sensitive to the PSA assumption..  

In contrast, tranche A holders know that, under most reasonable interest rate scenarios and PSA assumptions, they will be paid off before the certificate's stated maturity of 84 months.. At medium 175 PSA speed, the final cash flows are in 57 months; at a faster 240 PSA speed,. in 44 months. At a high speed, the total cash flow is slightly smaller as the total amount of. interest shrinks, but it comes back sooner. The present value of the total does not vary much,. making class A certificates behave like a very short maturity bond..  

# 9.4.2 Planned Amortization Class CMO  

The senior class of the sequential-pay CMO is well protected from default risk, and quite well isolated from the prepayment risk, due to its priority status to the principal flow. Yet to some. investors, the cash flow, while exhibiting very short duration risk, may still be too variable. In our example above, the change in the prepayment speed from 175 to 240 PSA shortened the. maturity of the class A certificate by 13 months. The PAC design further restricts the range of the principal flow by fixing an artificial schedule of prepayments which is likely to be. adhered to.  

Let us start with a very simple exercise of structuring a two-tranche PAC CMO. Class A will have a planned amortization schedule. The "supporting" or "companion' tranche K's role will be to absorb the excess prepayment risk. Suppose we project the prepayments to the pool. to run at 175 PSA. We set the minimum prepayment schedule for tranche A to be 80 PSA, and the maximum prepayment speed to be 275 PSA. This is the \*"initial PAC collar band." The actual future prepayment speed is unknown and can be slower or faster than the 80-275 PSA band; it can also be variable, running very fast and slowing down, and vice versa. The objective of the PAC design is not simply to "sell the wings" and divert the prepayments in excess of 275 PSA to the companion class or somehow supplement the prepayments slower than 80. PSA with the flow from the companion class. The objective is to try to fix the prepayment schedule completely. This will not always succeed, as we have no control over the prepayment decisions.

Given the desired initial PAC collar of 80-275, we first compute the principal cash flow that can be delivered to class A if the prepayment speed stays within the band, and the principal of tranche A that can be supported by the band. Table 9.6 shows the design blueprint. We look at the entire $\$300$ million CL201107B4 pool, compute the total principal flow at 80 and 275 PSA, and take the lesser of the two for each month. There is a crossover point. For early months, we take the flow under the 80 PSA assumption and, for later months, under the 275 PSA assumption. This is because when prepayments are fast, they pay down the principal so rapidly that at some point there is not much of it left to pay even at a high speed, and the slower speed results in a higher flow. The PAC schedule is set as the month-by-month lesser of the two bands' principal flows.  

We determine the principal for tranche A by cumulating the principal under the PAC schedule. Toward the end of the schedule we set a cut-off point beyond which the balance is so small that, for practical reasons, it is paid off. We would like the starting principal balance for tranche A to be large in order to create the largest possible protected class. However, we have to balance that goal against the strength of the companion class. If the companion is too small, and the actual prepayments run in excess of the upper band, the companion might be extinguished very quickly and no longer be able to support the PAC tranche. This would result in a "broken"' or "busted' PAC. In Table 9.6, the total PAC schedule flow could be $\$185,942,356.73$ We set the principal for tranche A at $\$185,900,000$ Under the PAC schedule, this will repay the principal in month 346. The companion tranche K's principal is set at $\$114,100,000$ .The pass-through coupon rates for both tranches are set at $6.0\%$  

The PAC structure works perfectly for any prepayment speed within the initial collar.. Prepayments are always in excess of the PAC schedule (which is set to the minimum), and are sent to the supporting tranche K. Tranche A is completely insulated from the actual prepayments and follows the set PAC schedule. The PAC tranche A's weighted-average life. (WAL) is constant if the prepayment speed stays within the band, irrespective of what it. actually is. Tranche A behaves like a fixed cash flow security. Table 9.7 shows the cash flows to the two tranches for 175 PSA. The principal cash flow to tranche A is equal to the PAC schedule every month; tranche K absorbs the excess..  

Next we show two examples of broken PACs. In Table 9.8, prepayments come in at 350 PSA. The companion tranche K absorbs so much excess principal flow that it gets paid off in month 48 and is no longer available to support the PAC tranche A. Its WAL is under 3 years. Tranche A's WAL also shrinks. As soon as K is extinguished, the principal flow to A accelerates; A now has to take in all prepayments irrespective of its PAC schedule.  

Table 9.9 shows the opposite case. Prepayments are slow at 60 PSA. In the early months, all. the principal flow goes to A, but there is not enough flow to meet the PAC schedule. Tranche K receives no principal flow. In month 108, at the 60 PSA speed, the total principal flow from the pool starts to exceed the required PAC schedule. Tranche A receives the scheduled flow; tranche K gets the excess. However, since A did not amortize enough at the beginning, its. principal balance extends much further into the future, while K gets paid off first. The WAL of tranche A is longer than the PAC design's goal. Tranche K's WAL is actually even longer. as the excess prepayments it receives are very small until the final few years..  

# 9.4.3 Interest-only (IO) and Principal-only (PO) Classes  

Instead of organizing tranches according to priority over cash flows, interest and principal flows can simply be separated into two distinct classes: the interest-only (IO) tranche and the principal-only (PO) tranche. The idea is quite simple. What is interesting is the interest rate and prepayment speed sensitivity of the two tranches.  

Table 9.10 shows the PVs of the IO and PO tranches of the CL201107B4 pool for different PSA speeds. The cash flows are discounted at $5.5\%$ . The total PV of the pool pass-through is not super-sensitive to the PSA assumptions, but the PVs of the interest-only and principal-only. tranches are. They also move in the opposite way. The IO's value decreases with an increase. in the prepayment speed as the total amount of interest over the lifetime of the pool declines.. The PO value increases as prepayments speed up as the total is returned more quickly. The total cash flow that the PO holders receive is $\$300$ million no matter what the speed. If the prepayments run fast, the PO holders get their cash sooner. The numerator effect for IOs and. POs swamps any countervailing discounting effect when considering joint interest rate and. prepayment movements.  

Imagine an investor buying an IO strip when prepayments run at 175 PSA and interest rates. are at $5.5\%$ . If interest rates drop and prepayments speed up, the investor gains because the discount rate is lower, but the gain is likely to be completely offset and turned into a loss since. the total cash flow to be received over time decreases. If interest rates rise and prepayments. slow down, the investor loses because the discount rate is higher, but the loss is more than made up for by the increase in the total cash flow to be received over time. An IO holder has a negative duration instrument.

Imagine an investor buying a PO strip when prepayments run at 175 PSA and interest rates. are at $5.5\%$ . If interest rates drop and prepayments speed up, the investor gains twice: the. discount rate is lower and the principal is returned faster. If interest rates rise and prepayments slow down, the investor loses twice because the discount rate is higher and the principal is returned more slowly. A PO holder has a high positive duration instrument..  

Besides custom-designed servicing hedge swap arrangements, POs and short IOs are the. main hedging instrument for mortgage servicing companies. A mortgage servicer loses revenue when interest rates drop and prepayments speed up. While the change in the PV of a PO may. not offset the lost revenue exactly, its PV in general increases when interest rates drop. A short IO is an even closer hedge, since the servicer's cash flow is defined as a constant spread fee. times the remaining principal.  

# 9.5MULTICLASS AND NON-VANILLA CMOs  

Many CMOs have multiple classes of securities and combine PACs, IO/POs, floaters, etc., into one deal. Some classes naturally fit together, some do not. We examine briefly some common combinations.  

# 9.5.1  A Multiclass PAC Structure with a PAC I/O and a Floater/Inverse Coupon Split  

We take our CL201107B4 pool and create several PAC classes, some with sequential dependence, some with different initial collars. We also provide supporting tranches and attach IO and floating interest tranches. Let us look at a hypothetical structure.

The CMO in Table 9.11 offers four PAC tranches. Two of the most senior PAC tranches -- classes A and B  have support PAC tranches, KA and KB, which are essentially sequential. tranches that pay after A and B. There is one TAC (targeted amortization class) tranche which is a one-sided PAC. There is one PAC I/O class which is entitled to interest only and is applied to the PAC schedule with its rules on excess and insufficient prepayments. The last two classes are true support tranches, absorbing excess prepayments from all the others. They are structured as a floater and an inverse floater. The attraction of the floating structure is the elimination of the interest rate sensitivity (in exchange for refinance/liquidity risk). The attraction of the inverse floating structure is most often a high initial coupon in a low interest rate environment.  

# 9.5.2 Non-Accelerating Senior and Accrual Tranches in Sequential CMOs  

There are two common improvements on the sequential-pay design, both of which aim at increasing the stability of the cash flows of the senior classes. The non-accelerating senior (NAS) class is subject to a prepayment lockout, followed by a step-up prepayment participation.. In a sequential design, this means that class A does not receive prepayments for a specified period of 0-3 years, then the prepayments are phased in gradually, all the time with class A retaining priority to the principal cash flows. While this may extend the WAL of class A, it narrows down the prepayment scenarios. The objective is to define an almost fixed coupon-like bond, with all the principal coming back during a very narrow time window. This mitigates or eliminates the negative convexity of the prepayment risk.  

Sequential and NAS designs often include an "accrual tranche,"' also called a $^{\circ\circ}Z$ bond." In addition to the principal flow of the pool, the interest that would have been paid on the Z. bond's principal is diverted to prepay the senior sequential tranches. The "missing' interest is accrued to (increases) the starting principal of the Z bond until the $Z$ bond starts paying down. Table 9.12 shows an example of a sequential structure including a. $Z$ bond.  

Other variants include NAS sequential CMOs with several NAS tranches each with its own lockout. These are usually supported by the \*relatively unstable" sequential classes rather than. Z bonds.  

Accrual bonds, instead of companion classes, are used to support "very accurately defined. maturity" (VADM) bonds. These are PAC-like with two PSA bands. The Z bond support offers. tighter contraction and extension protection than a support class can. It provides interest cash flow to replenish missing prepayment flow (reducing extension risk). The increased principal. is able to absorb many prepayments.

# Collateralized Debt Obligations and Basket Credit Derivatives  

In April 2010, Goldman Sachs was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of misleading investors into buying designed-to-fail synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) in 2007. Goldman's executives were grilled by a US Senate subcommittee. The senators' lack of understanding of the basics of securitization and appreciation for the mix of market-making and supporting principal trading that dealers routinely perform was evident. Goldman officers struggled not to offend the law makers.  

CDOs are bond instruments backed by debt assets held by a special purpose trust or an asset manager. The debt assets backing the CDOs can be corporate loans, corporate bonds, or mortgage securities. These can be static, i.e. selected once when the CDO is structured and placed in the trust, or actively managed by a designated asset manager. The cash flows accruing from the assets can be passed through to the CDO investors, but most often are tranched into several categories of CDO certificates, according to their seniority or stated maturity. The objective of the CDO issuance is for one bank or fund entity to pass the risk of the underlying securities to another entity. For example, a holder of mortgage securities or corporate bonds, instead of selling them outright, can put them into a trust and sell partial or tranched interest in them to others. The buyer usually seeks to gain exposure to risks to which he normally has no easy access. By their nature, the CDOs are investment conduits to assets and risks carefully selected by someone trying to get rid of them, and carefully chosen by someone to buy into. This exposure can also be created synthetically through a combination of Treasuries and short default swaps.  

We start the chapter with the definition of the most common structure, the static cash CDO. We go through the cash flow mechanics of synthetic CDOs and basket credit derivatives with. exposures to multiple credits through first-to-default, last-to-default, or multiple-default pay-. outs. We delve into the pricing of CDOs and credit baskets which relies on the modeling of. multivariate defaults, consistent with the single issuer default modeling of the marginal distributions, but allowing for a default correlation structure of many issuers. The standard approach is to use a copula function, which is a multivariate function of correlated uniform random variables whose transforms have known marginal probability density functions. The objective is to have a parsimonious correlation parameterization that fits the observed market prices of. basket and single-issuer credit derivatives and corporate bond spreads. We then cover the issues of CDO cash flow tranching, and the difficulties of rating tranched CDOs. We briefly discuss the role of CDOs in the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and their general role in risk trading.
