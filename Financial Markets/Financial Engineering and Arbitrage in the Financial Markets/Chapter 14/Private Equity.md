# 14.1  PRIVATE EQUITY  

Private equity firms have generally two ways to raise funds when acquiring a company. One, common in taking a publicly traded company private, is to have the acquired

company issue debt. The other, common in venture start-ups, is to form a partnership fund, capitalized mostly by other investors, that makes equity investments in one or many. companies.  

# 14.1.1 Investment in Private Equity - Limited Partnership Funds  

ABC Capital forms ABC Explorer Fund, a limited partnership (LLP). ABC becomes a general partner (GP). ABC turns to several investors (pension funds, endowments, other private equity firms) to become limited partners (LPs) in the new fund. LPs first agree to commit capital over a specified period of time (up to 2-5 years). ABC Explorer Fund plans to make equity investments over that period. The GP calls capital from the LPs (drawdowns) when the investments become available. In the process, the potential investors (with capital call liability) become real (LP) investors in the Fund. They are issued limited partnership shares. Not all the committed capital is always called. Sometimes capital is called, but not immediately used. Over the following several years, the Fund finishes making investments and returns the capital back to the limited partners. For tax purposes, the returns can be in the form of interest, dividends, or partnership capital returns. Often there is an overlap period over which capital is still being called while some returns are already made.  

Figure 14.1 illustrates the typical process. As the Fund is formed, capital is drawn down over the first 3 years while very few investments are made. In the second phase, the majority of the capital is called and most investments are made. Some investments start paying. In the third phase, investments are liquidated and capital is returned; some additional capital may still be called if opportunities arise.  

Figure 14.1 also shows the so-called "J-curve.' If we compute the net asset value (NAV) and the return on investment in the Fund, in the early years it is negative and increasingly so, as expenses are incurred and no return is made. In the early years, the fund spends capital on new investments and on human capital it injects into the acquired firms. Later in life, returns turn positive, as appreciated investments are liquidated, the NAV increases, and the cash is returned to the investors.  

# 14.1.2 Leverage Buyouts  

The most common way of taking a public company private is a leverage buyout (LBO). An.   
interesting feature of the LBO is that the debt used to acquire the target company becomes the.   
target company's liability with non-recourse to the acquiring private equity limited partnership..   
An LBO is typically of a large established company generating large operating cash flows.   
Those cash flows are used to pay off the debt in order to increase the equity portion of.   
the company.  

The best way to understand a leverage buyout is to see it in the following stages:  

.A private equity firm identifies XYZ Corp. as a target company. XYZ is a consumer staples company and generates large operating cash flows. Its debt is. $\$50$ , equity is $\$45$ , and it generates $\$12$ in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation).. The private equity firm ABC Capital forms ABC Raider Fund, a limited partnership (funded by its own capital or with contributions by others). ABC Raider raises $\$16$   
ABC Raider Fund obtains a $\$64$ loan commitment from Granite Bank. Granite Bank's loan will become the senior debt of XYZ after the acquisition. The coupon is $6.625\%$ or $\$4$   
ABC Raider Fund also obtains mezzanine (subordinated) debt financing from Shark Bank.. Shark will lend $\$20$ at $10\%$   
ABC Raider makes a tender offer to the shareholders of XYZ at. $\$50$ total, i.e. at an $11\%$ premium to the current stock price to acquire the company and to pay off its existing. $\$50$ debt.   
XYZ's stock is delisted from the stock exchange and ABC Raider becomes its sole shareholder. ABC installs its own management.   
.XYZ's liabilities are $\$64$ to Granite Bank and $\$20$ to Shark Bank. Its equity is valued at $\$16$  

The acquisition process is complete. The annual operating cash flow $(\mathrm{EBITDA}=\$12$ of XYZ (the acquired company) is said to cover seven "turns of debt" $(\$84)$ . The process of improving efficiency, liquidating assets, or turning the company around starts as soon as the acquisition is complete. A new management is installed. The explicit objective is to pay off all the debt. Let us assume that we are able to increase EBITDA by about $\$1-3$ each year. Here is what happens in the first few years.  

Year 1: EBITDA of $\$14$ covers $\$6$ in interest ( $\$4$ to Granite and $\$2$ to Shark) and pays off $\$8$ of Granite Bank's debt. The remaining balance is $\$56$   
Year 2: EBITDA of $\$16.71$ covers $\$5.71$ in interest ( $\$3.71$ to Granite and $\$2$ to Shark) and pays off $\$11$ of Granite Bank's debt. The remaining balance is $\$45$   
Year 3: EBITDA of $\$18.98$ covers $\$4.98$ in interest ( $\$2.98$ to Granite and $\$2$ to Shark) and pays off $\$14$ of Granite Bank's debt. The remaining balance is $\$31$   
Year 4: EBITDA of $\$22.05$ covers $\$4.05$ in interest $\mathbb{S}2.05$ to Granite and $\$2$ to Shark) and pays off $\$18$ of Granite Bank's debt. The remaining balance is $\$13$   
Year 5: EBITDA of $\$24.86$ covers $\$2.86$ in interest ( $\$0.86$ to Granite and $\$2$ to Shark) and pays off the remaining $\$13$ of Granite Bank's debt and $\$9$ of Shark Bank's debt.   
Year 6: EBITDA of $\$23.90$ covers $\$0.90$ in interest (to Shark) and pays off the remaining $\$9$ of Shark Bank's debt. The remaining EBITDA is split between taxes $\$6$ and a $\$10$ dividend to ABC Raider Fund.   
Also in Year 6: XYZ goes through an IPO and the company is sold to the public. If the economic value-to-EBITDA multiple remains the same as prior to the buyout, i.e. $95/12=7.927$ , then XYZ is sold for $\$25.90\times7.927$ , or $\$205.04$ Including the $\$10$ dividend in Year 6, ABC Raider has earned a $54.19\%$ annual compound return on its $\$16$ investment over the 6-year period!  

Clearly, the risk is leverage and the interest liability burden. The success depends on increasing the EBITDA through efficiency gains or on asset sales. Also, ABC Raider Fund, and its investors, may not want to wait until Year 6 to see the first dividend. Splitting some of the EBITDA between debt relief and dividends would lengthen the repayment process, but reduce the risk for the fund. On the other hand, ABC Raider does not have to wait till Year 6 to sell its equity stake. The company could be sold back to the public with debt on its books.  

# 14.1.3 Private Equity Lending - Mezzanine Capital and Distressed Loans  

Instead of leading the LBO with a leveraged equity investment, the private equity firm can provide capital in the form of debt. Typically, senior debt carrying a relatively low interest rate is provided by banks. Junior, subordinated, debt is provided by private equity firms. In this case, the firm or a partnership formed by it is the supplier of leverage to the lead buyout firm. The capital is provided either in the form of high interest debt or preferred shares. In either case, in the capital structure of the firm that is being taken private, it sits between the senior debt and the equity stake, hence the "mezzanine' label. The buyout firm has every incentive to repay this debt before it can realize its own return on equity. The US government used the high coupon preferred structure in its 2008-9 bailouts of the banking and auto industries. The banks providing senior financing to the LBO may require some mezzanine financing to be used. On the other hand, the advantage of using some mezzanine debt by the LBO firm may be the ability to renegotiate the terms. This is not always easy with regulated banks that must satisfy capital ratio requirements and must report any impairment on the debt they hold. The private equity firm supplying the mezzanine debt can act more freely and simply agree to increase the interest rate when the newly privatized company's financial ratios fall outside specified ranges and it struggles to repay. The debt may carry conversion rights or equity warrants. In our example above, Shark Bank was the provider of mezzanine debt.  

Another way for a private equity firm to provide debt is "distressed financing.' In the USA, companies can file for bankruptcy with the objective of liquidation or restructuring. In the latter case, the bankruptcy judge works with the company's management on reducing the liabilities of the company by voiding labor and supplier contracts and restructuring bond and bank debt. In the process, the shareholders are wiped out and the equity is delisted, while current debt holders may be bought off with equity ownership. Private equity firms or limited partnerships can step in during this process and buy up the existing debt in the hope of owning the company when it re-emerges from bankruptcy. They can also provide new "turnaround' or "special situations' financing with the same objective..  

# 14.1.4 Other Forms of Private Equity  PIPEs  

An LBO takes a healthy public company private. Sometimes public companies need additional capital to grow or face temporary distress. In these cases, they can turn to private equity firms or sovereign funds for injections of private equity "growth capital' in the form of a minority stake in the company. What distinguishes these private investments in public equities (PIPEs) from simply buying up the company's stock above the $5\%$ control threshold is that it is a seasoned new capital offering going directly to the company which is dilutive to other shareholders, and it is often a private offering unregistered for 2 to 3 years or sold as a "registered direct' offering placed with a specific buyer. At the time of the capital injection, the public company issues either a convertible debt security or a preferred security. Its conversion feature is structured to be attractive to the investing fund (low conversion price) and thus potentially highly dilutive.  

# 14.1.5Venture Capital  

The venture capital industry provides equity capital and management services to newly formed business. Its raison d'etre is the fact that in some industries the time and capital required to. bring a new product to market is long/large. The product is past its fundamental research stage (done at universities, government, or private labs), but still in its commercial infancy.. The capital needed is very large: drug testing or large software development. The time to commercialization is long and the adoption is fraught with uncertainty. This risk cannot be borne by banks or lenders. The risk cannot be financed by public equity capital with its. insistence on short-term returns. Venture capital bridges that gap.  

The venture capital legal structure parallels private equity. Venture capital firms form limited partnerships in which they put some of their own capital and invite other investors to participate through capital commitments. The objective is different. Rather than taking cash-rich public companies private, injecting human capital to squeeze synergies out of them and reselling them in the public markets, venture capital firms help to form companies starting with a handful of employees/owners, supply management expertise, and guide them through several capital and product milestones. The final goal is still a sale in the public market or a resale to a large public company. Private equity is often viewed as ruthless and destructive, while venture capital is viewed as building companies. Yet there is an element of ruthlessness in both; the difference is the stage at which they take over the companies. Private equity takes already operating companies, but perhaps with entrenched managements or with faltering strategies. Venture capital takes new companies that perhaps lack large company management expertise or simply need large amounts of capital and patience. The equity money is not free. Often the owner-entrepreneurs end up with small stakes or lose control of their companies altogether.  

The venture capital process proceeds in several financing stages and frequently involves an employee option plan. Each stage dilutes the previous owner's stakes, but is necessary for the. ultimate success of the company. To save money on operating expenses, employees are offered a "venture"' stake of their own. Instead of full cash compensation, they are paid in long-term options on the company's stock, or less commonly in restricted stock. Options carry 5- to 10-year expiries and may be subject to vesting. Management expertise can also be purchased with options when talented individuals are given upfront allocations..  

It is often overlooked that the venture capital process starts with the entrepreneur first drawing on his or her own funds. The "seed stage" or the "proof of concept"' stage involves angel investors who put in up to. $\$500,000$ to enable the entrepreneur/inventor to file for patents,. finish the first code or produce a product prototype. The angels are found through informal networking, or through a public or private incubator. The angel investors and the entrepreneur become the founders of the company. Their investment is made through common stock or a convertible note; the latter converted into common at the same price as the next funding stage's investors minus a small discount up to. $20\%$ . The seed stage investment is very risky; there is. no product yet, nor is there an organization to develop a product. The expected return at this point is 20-30 times the investment.  

At the next "start-up' or "early stage" venture round, a consortium of angels or an early stage venture fund make investments of $\$1-5$ million in the form of common stock or most often in the form of preferred shares Series A with dividend, liquidation, and anti-dilution rights as well as first refusal on the sales of the shares by the owners/angels. The capital is used to develop the product, code, or drug, and to start marketing it. At this point, first critical employees are hired, and offices are opened. The employees participate in the stock option plan as part of their compensation. The investors in this stage look for 5-10 times returns.  

After the early stage round, there may be one or more "growth"' or "expansion' stage venture rounds with investments ranging from $\$5$ to $\$25$ million. During this time, the product is developed and the effort is placed on commercialization, marketing, and reaping network benefits if it is software or hardware. The product may not be profitable at this phase, but the plan to make it profitable must be clear. Investors receive common or preferred Series B or C with superior rights to the previous round. Of course, they pay more for those privileges. The investors look for 2-5 times returns. Sometimes when the growing company burns through cash from the previous round, but is not ready for the next, it may seek "bridge"' or "mezzanine" capital in the form of convertible debt or debt with warrants that automatically convert to preferred or common at the next round at a small discount.  

Before the company can be sold to a big corporate buyer or the public, sometimes it needs to. go through one more "buyout capital' round. It raises capital to buy smaller related or critical knowledge (software, hardware, drug delivery patents) companies and merge them into one organization fully able to achieve its product strategy objectives. It may also seek additional "bridge"' financing before it is sold. Often at this point, the management of the company is. replaced as the next public stage will require a different skill set..  

# 14.1.6Exit Strategies - IPOs and Secondary Sales  

The best exit scenario is an initial public offering (IPO) on a public stock exchange. The. venture capital investors are able to liquidate their holdings; founders may be subject to a partial lockout, but also generally can cash in on some of their holdings. The objective is a large P/E multiple and an oversubscribed offering. The second best exit is a sale to a large. public corporation. The standalone start-up firm may not have the requisite distribution or. brand recognition. Putting a large pharma firm's name and sales force to work can help..  

The third often forgotten exit is through a secondary sale to other private equity investors. In the 1990s, this exit channel mostly covered distressed sales. In the 2000s, secondary intermediaries emerged sometimes set up by major investment banks, and private equity funds not interested in early stage investing begun entering investments in smaller chunks and at later stages. This allowed them to diversify their private equity holding across stages and shorten the time to cash-out. As more buyers and sellers entered, the pricing improved and the transactions were no longer distress sale-driven. The 2008-9 crisis period saw a temporary price depression with liquidity-driven sales, but by 2010 the market returned to normal.  

In the secondaries market, what are traded are often the limited partner's holdings in the entire private equity fund. That is, the market is not trading in stakes in individual start-up firms, but in stakes in private equity limited partnerships, each perhaps funding 20-30 different start-ups in different stages of commercialization. The secondary sale can proceed in two ways. First, the selling limited partner can approach the general partner to assist in the sale, in finding an interested buyer or already having a buyer in mind. The second way is to conduct an auction. The auction can be an "open auction' to several interested buyers conducted by the limiter partner, or it can be a "targeted auction' conducted by a secondary intermediary. The auction itself can have two stages, with the first narrowing down the list of buyers to two to three. The main motivation of the sellers in the secondaries market is liquidity. The private equity partnership life may be quite long, with capital calls preceding any distributions by several years, tying up the capital for a long time (the "J-curve effect'). Another motivation may be. the so-called "denominator effect" When the total holding of a pension fund or a sovereign fund decline, and the fund is committed to maintain a certain percentage of investment in a particular asset class, it may happen that public holdings marked-to-market may decline in value faster than private holdings forcing the liquidation of the latter. The buyers' motivations are typically portfolio reallocation and diversification, early stage into later stage (moving. along the J curve), large stakes into smaller stakes, and across industries. Sometimes it is to get in with preferred general partners.  

The total amount of secondary transaction in private equity reached. $\$82$ billion. The amount. of capital raised for dedicated secondaries-only funds was over $\$20$ billion. Secondaries are. attractive to funds-of-funds; they account for. $30{-}40\%$ of all purchases in any given year..
