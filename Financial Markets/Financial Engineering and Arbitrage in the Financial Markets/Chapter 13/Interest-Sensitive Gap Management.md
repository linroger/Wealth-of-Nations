# 13.2  INTEREST-SENSITIVE GAP MANAGEMENT  

Let us step back and think broadly about analyzing the future prospects of any company.. If we were looking at Apple, we would want to know the product development mix: new. phones, music, and video players. The same would apply to any drug company or industrial manufacturing company, like Siemens. We would want to know not only Siemens' new equipment line-up, but also the long-term contract pipeline for power plant construction and large industrial installations. What about a bank such as Zions? The main drivers of future revenue, besides fees charged on deposit and loan servicing, would be the ability to generate. new loans and the interest rates earned on those new loans. The aim of the Interest-Sensitive (Maturity) Gap methods is to quantify the number of loans that come due in the near future, break them down by maturity, and assess the amount of revenue at risk..  

Let us introduce some terminology. First let us define the Net Interest Margin (NIM) and compute it for Zions (amounts in $\$1$ millions, we multiply by 4 to annualize):  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{N I M=\frac{I n t e r e s t i n c o m e-I n t e r e s t e x p e n s e}{T o t a l e a r n i n g a s s e t s}}}\ {{N I M=\frac{581.9-130.1}{472,41.6}\times4=3.83\%}}\end{array}
$$  

Conceptually, the bank as a whole can be viewed as earning the Net Interest Margin on the difference between loans and deposits, supplemented with fee income, with which to cover loan loss provisions and employee expenses. We see from Zions' statements that elevated post2008 crisis loss provisions in 2010 continued to eat away at NIM and employee/operating expenses took the rest. Despite the healthy NIM the management had very little room for error in managing interest rate risk. In late 2010, the US yield curve was upward sloping, resulting in a positive maturity gap for the bank: loans had longer maturities than deposits, and earned higher interest rates. But what if the yield curve were to flatten, or the cost of deposits rose due to another liquidity shock? To maintain the same NIM, the bank would have to significantly increase the amount of loans to deposits, taking on more liquidity and business risk. What if the yield curve steepened? New loans would earn higher rates, but old loans would lose market value.  

To examine the new business (revenue) tradeoffs, we turn attention to the maturities and. the repricing opportunities on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. What we want to know. is the difference between the dollar amount of repriceable assets and the dollar amount of the repriceable liabilities for each future time period. Repriceable assets are loans about to mature or to be renewed-short-term securities, variable-rate loans. Repriceable liabilities are maturing certificates of deposit (CDs), floating rate deposits, and short-term money market instruments. Instead of repriceable, we will call them interest sensitive. Non-repriceable assets. are cash and reserves, long-term loans, and long-term securities. Non-repriceable liabilities are non-interest-bearing demand deposits, long-term savings accounts, and equity..

We define the Dollar Interest-Sensitive Gap (ISGap) as:  

$$
I S G a p=I S A s s e t s-I S L i a b
$$  

The ISGap can be positive or negative. A bank with the positive gap is called asset sensitive; a bank with the negative gap is called liability sensitive. If interest rates rise, an asset-sensitive bank's net interest margin will rise and a liability-sensitive bank's net interest margin will decline. If interest rates decline, an asset-sensitive bank's net interest margin will decline and a liability-sensitive bank's net interest margin will rise. We define the Interest Sensitivity Ratio (ISRatio) as:  

$$
I S R a t i o=I S A s s e t s/I S L i a b
$$  

We can also define the gap relative to some measure of the bank's size, e.g. total assets, in order to compare it with other banks. We can define the Relative Interest-Sensitive Gap as:  

$$
R e l a t i\nu e I S G a p=I S G a p/T o t a l A s s e t s
$$  

Let us try to define these terms for Zions. We gather additional information contained in Zions' 10-Q Report for Q3 2010 filed with the SEC, and the management's presentations to various investors' groups. We find the information about the maturity of the securities shown on the balance sheet. We are forced to make some assumptions about the maturities of the various types of loans. Clearly, the details would be available to the management of the bank. The analysis here is for illustrative purposes only, and may not be reflective of the true position of Zions as of September 30, 2010.  

Nearly $80\%$ of the bank's portfolio is commercial lending;. $17.5\%$ are consumer loans. Commercial lending consists of general commercial and industrial business loans, owneroccupied loans, and commercial real estate loans. Business loans can be term or revolving; real estate loans tend to be term and intended either for new construction or for tenant rental or owner-occupied existing properties. In consumer loans, home equity and bank card loans tend to be revolving adjustable; the remainder are short (construction) or very long maturity. residential real estate loans..  

Based on the management discussion and the notes to the financial statements contained in the 10-Q Report, as well as from the management presentations to the investors' groups posted on the bank's website, we make the following assumptions about the maturity of the various types of loans contained in Table 13.7:.

Admittedly, our assumptions may not be perfect. The investor presentations contain detailed information about the commercial real estate portfolio, but not about the other categories. In consumer loans nearly half are revolving home equity lines, the rest are longer-term primary mortgage loans. In commercial lending, about half are general business loans, the other half are owner-occupied loans. We guess the first type might be shorter/riskier, none as long as mort gage loans.

Let us compute the ISAssets as those assets that are repriceable within 1 year. Using the. balance sheet quantities supplemented with the securities and loan maturity information, we have the following categories. To account for the fact that the supplemental securities information is for the final balance, and the loan estimates are based on prior quarters, while. we have the average balance sheet we use the percentages (1-year maturity relative to total) from the supporting information and multiply those by the dollar amounts in the average. balance sheet.  

In computing ISLiab we assume (no information) that $80\%$ of retail $(<\$100,000$ and wholesale $(>\$100,000$ time deposits, and $100\%$ of savings/NOW and foreign deposit accounts are repriceable within 1 year. Table 13.8 shows the computation of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities.  

The dollar ISGap, the ISRatio, and the Relative ISGap for Zions are:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{I S G a p=13,249,830-28,110,461=-\S14,860,631}}\ {{I S R a t i o=\displaystyle\frac{13,249,830}{28,110,461}=0.47}}\ {{R e l a t i\nu e I S G a p=\displaystyle\frac{-14,860,631}{51,778,872}=-0.29}}\end{array}
$$  

As of September 30, 2010, Zions is a liability-sensitive bank. A rise in interest rates will raise the cost of liabilities and erode the Net Interest Margin. The management discussion contained in the 10-Q Report and the main three near term goals in the investor presentations show the management's clear awareness of the bank's situation. They emphasize the efforts to maintain liquidity and the GAAP and Core Net Interest Margin (GAPP and Core NIM) by working through the loan portfolio of troubled credits to reduce existing loans, generate new loans especially in government-guaranteed programs and commercial and industrial lending (shorter term), and reduce excess cash balances.  

Regional banks have a variety of derivative-hedging techniques available to them. The most widely used and flexible are interest rate swaps. Unfortunately, they do not solve the problems of bad credits in the portfolio or the lack of growth of new loans. One stopgap solution for a liability-sensitive bank like Zions would be to pay fixed on a short-maturity interest rate swap. The floating rate receive side on the swap would offset the floating cost of the money-marketindexed liabilities. The fixed pay leg of the swap would fix the financing rate on short-term liabilities. On the asset side, the solution is not so simple. If interest rates rise and new loans cannot be generated, which is the main risk, the bank will not have repricing opportunities. This lack of new loan repricing can be supplemented by a program of receive fixed swaps put on over time. The fixed receive legs will act like the new loans. However, a significant part of the bank's interest margin comes from the credit spread earned on the new loans. The swaps would surely earn much lower rates eroding the margin.  

The gap analysis in Table 13.8 is crude and only for one maturity. While we don't have the information, the bank can most likely perform a much more detailed breakdown of repricing. maturities. For example, we could arrange all assets and liabilities in the increasing order of coming due in order to compute the intermediate gaps, net interest margins, and income risks. An illustration of the complete Interest-Sensitivity Gap Analysis for Zions, all with made-up. intermediate numbers, is shown in Table 13.9..  

The objectives of the gap analysis in Table 13.9 are many. We break down the ISGap for 1-year and under into several finer maturity buckets. We see that while we have a positive gap for the first week, months 4 through 12 contribute most to the large negative gap. We see the categories that contribute most to the overall gap. Money market-indexed liabilities with maturities of 4 to 12 months greatly outweigh the loans maturing or repriceable during that period. We see that the first week presents an important repricing opportunity for money market investments.  

While we are not showing that in the table, the detailed gap analysis of Table 13.9 allows one other important view of the bank's position. We can take the asset and liability amounts for each maturity bucket and multiply them by the average interest rates earned on them to produce the differences in the interest amounts earned for each maturity. Thus we can have a breakdown of the Net Interest Margin by the maturity buckets.  

The main drawback of the ISGap analysis comes not so much from the methodology itself, but the implicit philosophy of parallel interest rate movements. Since most of the risk for a typical bank comes from short-term liabilities, and the interest rates on the various types of liabilities often move independently of each other (some are stickier than others), lumping all the categories into uniform maturity buckets may produce a distorted picture. One way to deal with that is to allow for interest sensitivity weights attached to the actual asset and liability categories. For example, many of the depositors' savings and money market accounts' interest rates do not adjust as fast as the rates on fed funds or marketable securities. This may be written into the accounts' rules, for customer relationship reasons, or at the discretion of the bank. Those accounts would thus be assigned weights less than 1. Many of the money market investments on the asset side might be assigned weights greater than 1 as their rates might move more instantly and by disproportionately larger amount. In Zions' case, overall, this would result in the lower computed, weighted ISGap.
