# 13 Banks: Asset-Liability Management  

Banks play a very important role in the flow of funds in the economy. Capital received by households in the form of wages and investment returns is recycled back to business entities either through financial markets or through financial institutions. Consider the simplified model of the capital flow for the US economy in Figure 13.1.  

The relative size of the arrows varies across countries. Taxes are $24\%$ of GDP in the USA, but $49\%$ in Denmark and $42\%$ in France. Wages in the USA have historically been $60\text{\textperthousand}$ of the GDP, but have fallen to $58.5\%$ by Q3 of 2010.  

Chapters 11 and 12 dealt primarily with the first channel of the capital flow back from. households to business. There, individuals bought stocks and bonds issued by corporations directly, or mutual and hedge fund shares. The latter served as pooling vehicles and invested the received funds in bonds and stocks. In this chapter, we deal with the second channel of capital transfer through one type of a financial intermediary: the commercial bank. What is special about this channel is the capital transformation function performed by the intermediary. Banks do not simply pool capital. They take in deposits in the form of checking, savings, or CD accounts, and make real estate, consumer, and business loans. The deposits are mostly short term up to 1 year, very liquid and often accessible through an ATM or Internet transfer,. and small in size up to $\$100,000$ . The loans are long term up to 30 years, illiquid (rarely callable and with individualized terms), and come in large chunk sizes from a few thousand to a few billion dollars. (Insurance companies have similar asset-liability mismatches.) The second important role of the banks is the money and credit creation. Since the capital loaned to businesses by the banks is often redeposited (perhaps even many times) in the banking system, banks can create more than $\$1$ loans out of $\$1$ in deposits. This money multiplier effect depends on the reserve and capitalization requirements for banks as well as the velocity of money in the economy.  

The last 20 years have ushered in dramatic changes in the risk management of banks. Two factors are of note. First, certain national government and central bank policies have contributed to the rapid increase in leverage in the banking system, and moved away from the traditional deposit-driven banking to market financing and service fee revenue models. In the USA, home ownership financing and tax subsidies by the federal government, low interest rates, and the accelerated developments in securitization have pushed the role of the banks from market and credit risk bearing more into payment services and loan origination and resale. This decreased risk taking allowed them to lever up and reduce their capital base. Similar developments - real estate booms and loan origination and repackaging sophistication - took place in many European countries, and are making their way to emerging markets. The second factor is the evolution of bank regulation rules under Basel accords, starting with the. original flawed agreement in 1988, market risk amendments in 1996, the move to internal. models in Basel II (2004-6), updated in Basel III (2010). While the Basel accords emphasize several "pillars"' of sound bank management, they tend to emphasize the Value at Risk. (VaR) methodology for market and credit risk. There are, however, several issues with that approach. The move to quantitative methods in credit risk management makes sense, given the scale and volume of credit markets. The methodologies and their usages are not perfect. FICO scores, used in the consumer loan business, shift attention away from the qualitative factors that affect repayment prospects. Credit VaR necessarily relies on correlation assumptions which change in times of crises. Yet both of these techniques allow the quantification of credit exposure which, by itself, is a good thing. The main problems with the VaR methods come on the market and liquidity side. The commercial bank cannot be conceptually reduced to a set of market factors and sensitivities to those factors in the way that a mutual fund. can. This has to do with the capital transformation role of the banks. As the 2008 financial crisis made clear, banks are not retail funds or hedge funds with liquid assets. While their. funding can evaporate very quickly, their assets cannot be liquidated with the same speed.. Also, their incomes depend not only on the exposure to market price factors (interest rates and currencies), but on compensation for liquidity, credit, and maturity gap risk. Only belatedly, and prompted by the 2008 crisis, the regulators around the world started paying attention to the issues of leverage, capital, and liquidity sources. Yet all along, these have been covered in banking textbooks and bank examiner manuals. This chapter reintroduces the basic techniques of bank asset-liability management. We start with Interest-Sensitive (Maturity) Gap Management as the main tool for managing future profit risk (income statement focus). We present the Duration Gap Management as the main tool for equity capital risk (balance sheet). We contrast how VaR tools fit in with the latter for the largest financial institutions to enhance the risk management beyond yield curve factors to equities, commodities, etc., and to integrate it with credit risk. It is important to realize that the universal banks (i.e. those. combining investment banking and broker-dealing) are the only institutions that benefit from the VaR methods. The vast majority of banks around the world that offer traditional loan - deposit services (regional banks in the USA, mutual bank systems in Europe, postal and regional bank savings institutions around the world) should eschew VaR almost completely and. focus on sound gap and credit management.
