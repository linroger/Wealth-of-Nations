# 1.7 MARKET PLAYERS: HEDGERS VS SPECULATORS  

Without risk sharing, issuers and investors live and die with the markets. When prices increase,. investors who have bought, gain; when stock prices decline, they lose. New investors "buy high"' when prices rise, but "buy low" when prices decline. The decline benefits past issuers who "sold high.' The rise hurts them since they received little money and now have to deliver cash flows. In this view of the markets, both sides - the issuers and the investors - speculate. on the direction of stock prices and interest rates. The word investment is a euphemism for speculation. The logic does not change if we allow shorting of securities. The shorting. allows investors to become synthetic issuers and benefit from prices going down, but they still speculate. Investors manage risk, enhance or mitigate it, by concentrating or diversifying the types of assets held. An equity investor may hold shares of companies from different industrial. sectors; and a pension fund may diversify investments across domestic and foreign equities, or domestic and foreign bonds. The investor can also choose to be long or short an exposure..  

It is not always clear what is safe and what is risky. It is very important to realize that the. predictability of the cash flows does not imply low risk and the unpredictability does not imply high risk. Price uncertainty may be safer than future price certainty..  

Sparkasse savers in Germany, postal account holders in Japan, and investors in US Treasury Bills avoid default risk and are guaranteed a positive nominal return on their savings. T-Bill and CD investors in the US lock in the rates until maturity of the instruments they hold. Are they then risk-free investors and not speculators? They certainly can calculate in advance the exact dollar amount their investment will pay at maturity. After subtraction of the original investment, the computed percentage return will always be positive; yet, by locking in the cash flows, they are forgoing the chance to make more. If, while they are holding their CD, reinvestment rates increase, they will have lost the extra opportunity return they could have earned. We are hinting here at the notion of opportunity cost of capital which is common in finance.  

Let us consider another example. John Smith uses the $\$1,000$ he got from his uncle to purchase shares in XYZ Corp. After 1 year, he sells his shares for. $\$1,100$ . His annual return is $10\%$ . Adam Jones borrows $\$1,000$ at $5\%$ from his broker to purchase shares in XYZ Corp.. After 1 year, he sells his shares for $\$1,100$ . His annual return is $10\%$ on XYZ shares, but he has to pay $5\%$ or $\$50$ interest on the loan, so his net return is. $5\%$ . Should we praise John for earning. $10\%$ on his capital and scold Adam for earning only. $5\%2$ Obviously not.. Adam's cost of capital was $5\%$ . So was John's! His was the nebulous opportunity cost of. capital, or a shadow cost. He could have earned $5\%$ virtually risk free by lending to the broker instead of investing in risky shares. So his relative return, or excess return, was only. $5\%$ . In the T-Bill or CD example, one can argue that an investor in a fixed-rate CD is a speculator. as he gambles on the rates not increasing prior to the maturity of his CD. The fact that his net receipts from the CD at maturity are guaranteed to be positive is irrelevant. There is nothing special about a $0\%$ threshold for your return objective (especially if one takes inflation. into account).  

In the context of this book, all investors who take a position in a risky asset, whether by borrowing or using owned funds, will be considered speculators. The definition is relative to the cost of capital. In this sense, both Adam and John speculate by acquiring shares whose rate of return differs from their cost of capital of $5\%$ . An outright CD investment is speculative as the rate on the CD is not guaranteed to be the same as that obtained by leaving the investment in a variable rate money market account. A homeowner who takes out a fixed-rate mortgage to finance a house purchase is a speculator, even though he fixes his monthly payments for the next 30 years! When he refinances his loan, he cancels a prior bet on interest rates and places a new one. In contrast, an adjustable rate mortgage borrower pays the fair market rate every period equal to the short-term rate plus a fixed margin.  

Most financial market participants (Chapters 11 to 14) can be divided into two categories based on whether their capital is used (a) to place bets on the direction of the market prices or rates, or (b) to finance holdings of sets of transactions which largely offset each other's primary risks:  

Speculators - These are economic agents who take on explicit market risks in order to earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. The risks they are exposed to through their investments are not offset by simultaneous "hedge'" transactions.  

. Hedgers - These are economic agents who enter into simultaneous transactions designed to have offsetting market risks in such a way that the net returns they earn are in addition to their cost of capital.  

All arbitrageurs, whether pure or relative, are hedgers. They aim to earn nearly risk-free returns after paying all their financing costs. A pure arbitrageur's or strict hedger's returns are completely risk free. A relative arbitrageur's returns are not risk free; he is exposed to secondary market risks.  

Investors use their capital to speculate. The capital is in the form of an outside endowment. Mutual funds obtain funds by shareholders sending cash; pension funds obtain capital from payroll deductions into retirement accounts; insurance companies sell life or hazard policies and invest the premiums in stocks, bonds, and real estate; while individual investors deposit cash into their brokerage accounts in order to buy, sell, or short sell stocks and bonds. In all these cases, the investors use their funds (i.e. sacrifice their cost of capital) to bet on the direction of the market they invest in. Through the fees they pay, they buy the services of broker-dealers who facilitate their investment strategies. In order to help investors improve the precision of the bets they take, broker-dealers (who, themselves, are hedgers by nature) invent new products which they "sell' to the investors. These can be new types of bonds, warrants, and other derivatives; new classes of shares, or new types of trusts and annuities. The division of players into speculators and hedgers is often replaced by alternative, less precise terms:  

Buy-side participants Sell-side participants.  

Buy-side players are investors who do not originate the new investment vehicles. They select from a menu offered to them by the sell-side players. The sell-siders avoid gambling and use their capital to finance the hedge, i.e. to "manufacture"' the new products. As soon as they "sell' them, they enter into largely offsetting trades or relative arbitrage strategies. In the latter case, the sell-siders' hedge strategies are imperfect and take time to arrange, which is when sell-siders act as speculators. The hedger/speculator is not exactly equivalent to the sellside/buy-side division. Although sell-siders often act as both hedgers and speculators, their mindset is more tuned to that of the hedger ("to find the other side of the trade'). Buy-siders enter into transactions with sell-siders in order to become exposed to - or alter how they are exposed to - market risks ("to get in on a trade').  

Geographically, the sell-side resides in global financial centers such as New York or London and is represented by the largest global banks and broker-dealers. The buy-side is dispersed and includes all smaller banks with mostly commercial business, all mutual and pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies, and all finance corporations. Larger regional banks in the USA have traditionally been buy-side institutions, but some started their own institutional trading businesses. Since the 1990s, some insurance companies established sellside subsidiaries and used their capital strength and credit rating to compete vigorously with broker-dealers. Most of these have the phrase "Financial Products" inserted in their name, e.g.. Swiss Re Financial Products or AIG Financial Products..  

One type of company that can, by design, be both buy-side and sell-side is a hedge fund. Hedge funds are capitalized like typical speculators (read: investment companies). They are entrusted with partnership capital in order to "invest" Yet almost all hedge fund strategies are some form of relative value arbitrage, i.e. the strategies are hedges. The original capital is used only to acquire leverage and to replicate the hedge strategy as much as possible. In the early years of hedge funds (the mid-1990s), they were buy-siders. They innovated on what risks to take, but used contracts off-the-shelf from dealers. In the 2000s, hedge funds grew so. large that in many markets they are now able to wrest control of the demand and supply of the information flow from the dealers and are able to sell hedges to the dealers, effectively becoming sellers of innovative strategies. Dealers and asset management companies have,. however, begun to strike back with strategy index products and strategy ETFs which attempt to replicate the returns of hedge funds at lower costs (Chapter 12)..
