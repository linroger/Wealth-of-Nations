# 1.1 OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL MARKETS  

Financial markets play a major role in allocating excess savings to businesses in the economy. This desirable process takes various forms. Commercial banks take depositors' money and lend it to manufacturers, service firms, or home buyers who finance new construction or. improvements. Investment banks bring to market equity and debt offerings of newly formed or expanding corporations. Governments issue short- and long-term bonds to finance the. construction of new roads, schools, and transportation networks. Investors (bank depositors and securities buyers) supply their funds in order to shift their consumption into the future by earning interest, dividends, and capital gains.  

The process of transferring savings into investment involves various participants: individuals, pension and mutual funds, banks, governments, insurance companies, industrial corporations, stock exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) dealer networks, and others. All these. agents can, at different times, serve as demanders and suppliers of funds, or as intermediaries.. Economic theorists ponder the optimal design of securities and institutions, where "optimal"' implies the best outcomes - lowest cost, least disputes, fastest - for security issuers and investors, as well as for the society as a whole. Are stocks, bonds, or mortgage-backed securities, the outcomes of optimal design or happenstance? Do we need "greedy" investment bankers, securities dealers, or brokers? What role do financial exchanges play in today's economy?. Why do developing nations strive to establish stock exchanges even though they often have no stocks to trade on them? Once we answer these basic questions, it will not be difficult to see why all the financial markets are organically the same. In product markets, the four-cycle. radiator-cooled engine-powered car and the RAM memory-bus-hard disk personal computer have withstood the test of time. And so has the spot-futures-options, primary-secondary, risk transfer-driven design of the financial market. In the wake of the 2008 crisis we have seen very. limited tweaks to the design, because it is so robust..  

All markets have two separate segments: original issue and resale. These are characterized by different buyers, sellers, and different intermediaries, and they perform different timing. functions. The first transfers capital from the suppliers of funds (investors) to the demanders. of capital (businesses); the second transfers capital from the suppliers of capital (investors) to other suppliers of capital (investors). The two segments are:.  

. Primary markets (issuer-to-investor transactions with investment banks as intermediaries in the securities markets, and banks, insurance companies and others in the loan markets); Secondary markets (investor-to-investor transactions with broker-dealers and exchanges as intermediaries in the securities markets, and mostly banks in the loan markets).  

All markets have the originators, or issuers, of the claims traded in them (the original demanders of funds) and two distinctive groups of agents operating as investors, or suppliers of funds. The two groups of funds suppliers have completely divergent motives. The first group aims to eliminate the undesirable risks of the traded assets and earn money on repackaging, the other actively seeks to take on those risks in exchange for uncertain compensation. The two groups are:  

.Hedgers (dealers who aim to offset primary risks, be left with short-term or secondary risks, and earn spread from dealing);   
Speculators (investors who hold positions for longer periods without simultaneously holding positions which offset primary risks).  

The claims traded in all financial markets can be delivered in three ways. The first is an immediate exchange of an asset for cash. The second is an agreement on the price to be paid with the exchange taking place at a predetermined time in the future. The last is a delivery in. the future, contingent upon an outcome of a financial event, e.g. level of stock price or interest. rate, with a fee paid up front for the right of delivery. The three market segments based on the delivery type are:  

.Spot or cash markets (immediate delivery) Forward markets (mandatory future delivery or settlement) .Options markets (contingent future delivery or settlement)  

We focus on these structural distinctions to bring out the fact that all markets not only transfer funds from suppliers to users, but they also transfer risk from users to suppliers. They allow risk transfer or risk sharing between investors. The majority of the trading activity in today's market is motivated by risk transfer with the acquirer of risk receiving some form of certain or contingent compensation. The relative price of risk in the market is governed by a web of relatively simple arbitrage relationships that link all the markets. These allow market participants to assess instantaneously the relative attractiveness of various investments within each market segment or across all of them. Understanding these relationships is mandatory for anyone trying to make sense of the vast and complex web of today's markets.
