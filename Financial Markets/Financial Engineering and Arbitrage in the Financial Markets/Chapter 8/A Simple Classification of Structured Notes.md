# 8.1  A SIMPLE CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURED NOTES  

According to Wikipedia, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 434 defines structured securities as "securities whose cash flow characteristics depend upon one or more indices or that have embedded forwards or options or securities where an investor's investment. return and the issuer's payment obligations are contingent on, or highly sensitive to, changes in the value of underlying assets, indices, interest rates, or cash flows."' The main characteristic of structured products is that they are created to meet specific needs that cannot be met from the standardized financial instruments available in the markets (like stocks and bonds). Many structured notes have implicit options embedded in them (contingent payout that depends on market movements). Yet while retail brokerage customers in the USA have to go through a stringent option-trading approval process, they can buy structured notes in their accounts as easily as any other bonds. Also, some structured notes or deposits are advertised with a "principal protected' label. The "protected' label refers to the fact that the payout formula may affect only the coupon, not the fact that the issuer or deposit holding bank may not default.  

The main appeal of structured notes to investors is access to risk. Investors receive compensation in the form of coupon or principal enhancement for risks not easily embedded in standard securities. The main disadvantages are: the credit risk of the issuer (an investor may want a currency bet, but not a bet on the Kingdom of Belgium issuing the unsecured note), the lack of daily pricing and liquidity, and the complexity of the terms which often hides the dealer fees.  

When attempting to classify structured notes, we often focus on how the risk comes into play in defining cash flows. A currency - or equity-linked note -- where the issuer takes the $\$100$ principal paid by the investor, buys a zero-coupon bond. $\$82$ , and spends the remaining $\$18$ minus the fees on an at- or out-of-the-money currency/equity call option expiring at maturity of the note - might be classified as principal-protected. The. $\$82$ spent on the zero coupon guarantees $\$100$ at maturity. Instead, we could also have sold currency/equity puts. expiring at maturity of the note (or entered into a forward), saving the $\$18$ to acquire some derivatives paying on coupon dates. We also could have simply used the entire $\$100$ to buy a bullet bond and enter into an equity swap. The bullet bonds coupon cash flows could be exchanged for equity-related flows. We would thus structure currency- or equity-linked coupon flows, principal-unprotected with the puts or forward and principal-protected with the swap. In all cases, we are trying to be compensated for bearing equity risk in the form of a bond.  

We adopt a different classification of structured products based on the type of risk to which the bond or note is exposed. This has great implications for who the issuers are, who the investors are, and how the structure is priced. Here are the main three categories of structured products:  

Interest rate and yield curve-based structured notes: the examples include capped/floored floaters, inverse floaters, range collars, callables, leveraged floaters, amortizing bonds Asset class-linked notes: the examples include non-interest rate asset classes: equity-, currency- and commodity-linked notes and deposits, rainbow (best of, horse race, lookback) and hybrid-linked notes and deposits; credit-linked notes and quanto variations; both with coupon and principal-embedded payout formulas Economic variable and insurance risk transfer notes: the examples include inflation; GDP and corporate event-driven bonds as well as reinsurance aimed bonds like catastrophe (CAT) bonds linked to earthquake or hurricane risk; or pooled reinsurance notes  

The first category is investor-demand driven. Investors seek income or yield enhancement. through inverse floaters when interest rates are low; they want ranges when interest rates are. low and volatile; they want fixed coupons or callables when the yield curve is steep. The issuer is irrelevant to the success of the bond here: a sovereign or an SPV as long as the coupon. formula is attractive. The valuation relies on standard interest rate modeling and pricing interest. rate options.  

The second category is driven by customized access to an asset class. An equity participation rate of less than $100\%$ may mean a less-volatile exposure to equity. Spot currency trading is volatile and cheapest at the wholesale bank level. A quarterly-reset currency-linked structured note with averaging features may be more appealing. Commodity markets in general exhibit the greatest liquidity in futures contracts and may be inaccessible for spot trading; structured notes offer exposure to the commodity price movements without trading spot, complicated with quality and supply characteristics, or futures in margin accounts. The cash flow formula suppliers may be the structuring dealers, but can often be commodity (energy, chemical) companies and commodity funds looking to offload risk. The pricing can become complex as it may cut across asset classes, involve basis (correlation) risk, and be subject to non-hedgeable. risk (contango or backwardation in futures, basis swaps).  

The third category is driven by agents seeking to diminish economic and business risks.. They can be both sellers and buyers of cash flows. Inflation-linked note buyers want to hedge. the inflation risk. Insurers who lack reinsurance outlets sell catastrophe bonds in financial markets to transfer some of the largest concentrated risks (hurricanes in Florida, California earthquake, shipping through the Gulf of Aden) to investors. They also sell notes that act as. outright shares in their entire portfolio of risk. The pricing of the third category of structured notes is the most difficult and crosses over from financial option modeling into actuarial science, meteorological and seismic sciences, and economic forecasting. That crossover from financial options to physical science modeling implies almost complete unhedgeability and. actuarial (historic) calibration rather than market price (implied) calibration..
