# 12.1  HEDGE FUND STRATEGIES  

While global macro, fixed income and event-driven funds have often attracted press coverage, more than $50\%$ of all hedge funds employ strategies focused on equities. Figure 12.2 shows a breakdown compiled from various sources as of the end of the first quarter of 2010.  

In this section, we go through examples of some common strategies to get the flavor of hedge fund operations. We definitely do not cover all of them.  

# 12.1.1 Relative Asset Value Funds  

As a starting point, let us consider an example of a 130/30 long-short equity fund. The fund goes long $130\%$ of the invested funds, using the leverage from shorting. $30\%$ of the invested funds. This is a strategy pursued by some mutual funds that try to compete with hedge funds..

Of course, there is nothing constraining a hedge fund from using a much higher leverage and ratio of longs to shorts, or by using invested funds to create a short bias..  

Suppose it is December 2010 and we are starting a $\$100$ million fund. We have expertise in US financials, tech, and pharma. In each sector, we like one stock in particular: J.P. Morgan. Chase (JPM), currently trading at $\$38$ in financials, Cisco (CSCO) trading at $\$20$ in tech, and. Merck (MRK) trading at $\$34.50$ in pharma. The stock market has had a $10\%$ pullback recently and we want to have a positive bias on the market in general. In addition, we think that, in the market upturn, on a relative basis, CSCO is going to outperform Oracle (ORCL) trading at. $\$27$ , and MRK is going to outperform Pfizer (PFE) trading at $\$16$ , but while we like JPM in. financials, we think that Citigroup (C) - which is currently trading at $\$4.20$ , having recently gone through a significant restructuring - is going to outperform JPM..  

We allocate $40\%$ to financials, $30\%$ to tech, and $30\%$ to pharma. Our strategy is to short:  

315,800 shares of JPM at $\$38$ to receive $\$12,000,400$   
333,300 shares of ORCL at $\$27$ to receive $\$8,999,100$   
562,500 shares of PFE at $\$16$ to receive $\$9,000,000$  

and to use the $\$29,999,500$ received from the shorts, together, with the $\$100$ million of invested funds, to buy:  

12,381,000 shares of C at $\$4.20$ for $\$52,000,200$   
1,950,000 shares of CSCO at $\$20$ for $\$39,000,000$   
1,130,400 shares of MRK at $\$34.50$ for $\$38,998,800$  

We are assuming that our prime broker allows us to treat the longs in our account as sufficient margin for the shorts with no haircut. Net we have spent. $\$99,999,500$  

Suppose over the next quarter the stock market overall, and each sector separately, goes up $10\%$ . In a simple long fund, we would get a return of $10\%$ on $\$100$ million, or $\$10$ million. Suppose, as we had hoped, C in financials goes up by $14.3\%$ to $\$4.80$ while JPM goes up $7.9\%$ to $\$41$ ; CSCO in tech goes up by $12.5\%$ to $\$22.50$ while ORCL goes up $7.4\%$ to $\$29$ , and MRK in pharma goes up by $11.6\%$ to $\$38.50$ while PFE goes up $9.4\%$ to $\$17.50$ . Our longs are worth $\$146,824,200$  

12,381,000 shares of C at $\$4.80$ for $\$59,428,800$   
1,950,000 shares of CSCO at $\$22.50$ for $\$43,875,000$   
1,130,400 shares of MRK at $\$38.50$ for $\$43,520,400$  

We cover our shorts with $\$32,457,250$  

315,800 shares of JPM at $\$41$ to receive $\$12,947,800$   
333,300 shares of ORCL at $\$29$ to receive $\$9,665,700$   
562,500 shares of PFE at $\$17.50$ to receive $\$9,843,750$  

The net value of the fund is $\$114,366,950$ or a $14.4\%$ return. In this example, the 130/30 ratio acts like a specific security selection tilt in the construction of the equity portfolio. Most mutual funds, because they are always long-invested assets, are restricted from pursuing stronger tilts. Hedge funds are not.  

The more extreme version of the long/short strategy is pairs trading. Imagine all the same. before and after assumptions for our six stocks. This time, however, let us assume a $50\%$ margin requirement for shorting. We assume that the margin balance is all in cash, and long stock positions cannot be used as margin, i.e. are subject to a. $100\%$ haircut. (In reality, the.  

longs are likely to be marginable too, so we could increase our positions.) The fund uses the $\$100$ million in invested cash as margin to allow it to short $\$200$ million worth of stocks. So the strategy will be to go long $\$200$ million in stocks and go short $\$200$ million in stocks. It is. market-neutral on paper: without the pairs selection, we would expect a $0\%$ return irrespective of whether the stock market goes up or down. We retain the same 40/30/30 industry allocation and buy  

19,047,700 shares of C at $\$4.20$ for \$80,000,340   
3,000,000 shares of CSCO at $\$20$ for $\$60,000,000$   
1,739,100 shares of MRK at $\$34.50$ for $\$59,998,950$  

and short  

2,105,300 shares of JPM at $\$38$ to receive $\$80,001,400$   
2,222,200 shares of ORCL at $\$27$ to receive $\$59,999,400$   
3,750,000 shares of PFE at $\$16$ to receive $\$60,000,000$  

Our receipt from the short is $\$200,000,800$ We have $\$100,000,000$ of our own cash in the account. We spend $\$199,999,290$ on stock purchases, and thus we have minimally more than the $\$100,000,400$ in the account required to support the short position. Three months later our long stock holdings are worth $\$23,456$  

19,047,700 shares of C at $\$4.80$ for $\$91,428,960$   
3,000,000 shares of CSCO at $\$22.50$ for $\$67,500,000$   
1,739,100 shares of MRK at $\$38.50$ for \$66,955,350.  

Subtracting the shorts (worth $\$16,386,100)$ .  

2,105,300 shares of JPM at $\$41$ to receive $\$86,317,300$   
2,222,200 shares of ORCL at $\$29$ to receive \$64,443,800   
3,750,000 shares of PFE at $\$17.50$ to receive $\$65,625,000$  

we have a gain of $\$9,498,210$ , or a $9.5\%$ return, not including the interest that we could have. earned on the $\$100$ million cash balance in the account. The key here is that even if the overall market had gone down, but our pair had been correctly chosen, we would have had a positive return.  

The next variation in the long/short genre is a short bias fund. Without going through a. numerical example, we intuitively believe that, in this case, the market overall is going down and so we short more stock than we buy, i.e. we pursue a 30/130 ratio or even 0/100, using the invested cash as short-supporting margin.  

Structurally, a global macro fund is not very different. To a large extent, we use the invested cash to support margin buying and selling in the account. The philosophy and the covered markets are, of course, different. We go long and short the entire asset classes, e.g. long emerging markets stocks and short US stocks, or long German bonds and short UK bonds. The positions have residual currency exposures, and we can choose to leave them unhedged, or we can partially hedge them using currency swaps or forwards. A global macro fund can lever up even more by eschewing buying and shorting cash instruments in favor of futures or. OTC derivatives. Buying German bond futures and shorting UK gilt futures might eat up much. less cash for margin than the same position in cash bonds. That is not always necessarily the case, and the proper comparison between the two strategies actually requires a cash-and-carry calculation involving the repo financing cost/benefit on both sides..  

# 12.1.2 Relative Corporate/Credit Structure  

In this space, let us consider two distinct strategies: merger arbitrage and credit structure arbitrage. The first is a play on the prospects of a merger or a break-up of a company with profit coming from the correct assessment of the probability of the corporate event. The second is a play on the relative value of equity, preferred and debt in a company's structure, the relative values of the different forms of debt, or the price of debt in the corporate bond market and CDS market.  

Suppose Big Kahuna Corp. with 500 million shares outstanding, and currently trading at $\$50$ per share, announces a hostile takeover of Target Corp. through a tender offer on all 100 million shares of Target, currently trading at $\$40$ . The final date for the tender is 1 month away and Big Kahuna is offering a $25\%$ premium for Target's price, or $\$50$ per share. Target's management promises to fight the hostile takeover.  

Prior to the tender announcement, Big Kahuna was worth $\$25$ billion and Target was worth $\$4$ billion. Big Kahuna's management claims that post-merger synergies will slash several hundred million in annual costs off the combined company, so that the present value of the combined company's free cash flows will be $\$30$ billion and the new Super Kahuna Corp. will be able to compete more effectively. After the tender is announced, big Kahuna's stock drops to $\$48$ while Target's stock increases to $\$48$ . The market is thus skeptical about the synergy claims and is valuing the combined company at $\$23.8$ billion.  

The managers at the Happy River Merger Fund decide that perhaps the $\$48$ that Target is trading at is not about the cost savings, but more likely reflects the market's assessment of the probability that the merger will actually close. Target's management is very opposed to the idea and is contemplating strong defensive measures. The Happy River traders think all these will fail and the merger will close on time. They have several options: they can  

. buy Target shares for $\$48$ and short Big Kahuna's shares at $\$48$ if they think the merger. will close on time, but the synergies are unlikely;.   
buy Target shares for $\$48$ and Big Kahuna shares for $\$48$ if they think the merger will close. on time and the synergies are real and the drop in Big Kahuna's price reflect the market's unwarranted pessimism; or.   
. just buy Target shares at $\$48$  

The managers at the Dark Ocean Merger Fund see things differently. They decide that Target's management will be able to convince their local government to help to thwart the merger on the grounds of devastating job losses. They think that either the merger attempt will fail, or at least the perceived probability of it happening will diminish. This would drive the. current $\$48$ price for Target down toward $\$40$ or even below if the company is weakened in the battle. They also think that Big Kahuna will suffer as it will not be able to acquire Target's businesses that fit neatly into its business strategy. The Dark Ocean traders can:  

short Target shares at $\$48$ to unwind them prior to the merger's closing as the event's probability decreases, or after the failed closing date;   
short Target at $\$48$ and Big Kahuna at $\$48$ if they think the merger will not close at all; short Big Kahuna at. $\$48$ if they are unsure if the merger will happen, but the business outcome will be unhappy for the acquirer anyway.  

In December 2010, major US newspapers (see the WSJ on December 3) reported that the US regulators launched an insider-trading investigation into the pre-merger buying of shares by several hedge funds. The trading activity concerned three prior mergers in the pharma sector: AstraZeneca's April 23, 2007, announcement of the takeover of MedImmune, Pfizer's January 26, 2009, announcement of the takeover of Wyeth, and Merck's March 9, 2009, announcement of the takeover of Schering-Plough. In each case, based on the hedge fund's own insider-trading filings with the SEC, their holdings of the target companies went from zero or insignificant to hundreds of thousands of shares prior to the announcements. The interesting question here is whether the buying of the shares prior to the takeover was due to insider trading, and potential leaking of the information by the investment banks advising the acquiring and target companies, or due to a legitimate strategy on betting that the mergers will. be successful and the target company's price will increase to the tender offer level as the merger solidifies. The increases in the stock prices prior to earnings and merger the announcements had been well documented in event study articles researching the informational efficiency of market prices. The new issues here are related to the involvement of large well-capitalized and well-informed players like the hedge funds: insider cheating or superior analysis?  

Let us turn to credit (structure) arbitrage. This is a play on the relative seniority of the different claims on a company's assets and their relative pricing. We start with the general option-theoretic approach. We consider the simplified balance sheet of the Green Diamond Corp. Green Diamond is a commercial stage renewable energy spin-off of Black Diamond Energy, a utility company. Green Diamond specializes in wind turbines. At the time of the spin-off, it was financed with a transfer of the face value of $\$163.9$ million of cheap Black. Diamond debt and an equity IPO. The debt is currently worth $\$146$ million, and the total market. cap of equity is about $\$54$ million. Free cash flow valuation produces about. $\$200$ million as the value of the company's assets. The average maturity of debt is 3 years.  

The option theory comes in here in the following way. If we denote as $\tilde{V}$ the total value of. the company's assets and treat it as random, and we denote as $K$ the face value of the debt, then the equity value. $E$ is a call option on. $\tilde{V}$ with a strike price of. $K$ . The equity holders will get the discounted risk-neutral expected value $(E^{*})$ of the excess of the company's enterprise. value over the face value of debt, or:.  

$$
E=d f\times E^{*}m a x\left[\tilde{V}-K,0\right]
$$  

To apply the Black-Scholes model we need a volatility input. We observe the options on equity-financed competitors Wind Resources and Air Energy trading at. $40\%$ and $42\%$ implied volatilities. Green Diamond's business is a bit more mature and we choose. $\sigma=20\%$ as our input. We assume a continuously compounded risk-free interest rate. $r=3\%$ . Using software with a Black-Scholes $B S(\cdot)$ function, we get the value of the equity:  

$$
E=B S_{C a l l}\left(S=200,K=163.90,\sigma=20\%,r=3,T=3\right)=56.93\
$$  

A simple conclusion might be that the equity is undervalued by about. $\$2.93$ million. Of course, this is a chicken-and-egg situation. We don't know if the equity is undervalued, debt. overvalued, or perhaps the value of the assets is misvalued. To further gain insight, we use the put-call parity to break down the total enterprise value of the firm into equity plus debt:.  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\tilde{V}=E+D=C+P V(K)-P;}}\ {{E=C\mathrm{and}D=P V(K)-P}}\end{array}
$$  

The value of the equity is the value of the call on. $\tilde{V}$ with the strike $K$ . The value of the debt. is the present value of the strike minus the value of the put on $\tilde{V}$ with the strike $K$ . The debt holders' forward position is not simply. $K$ . If the value of the enterprise falls below the face value of the debt, they will not get the full principal back. Implicitly, they have written a put. option on the value of the firm. Thus if the equity is fairly priced, what is the value of debt including the Black-Scholes model put value? We solve:.  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{D=P V\left(K\right)-B S_{P u t}\left(S=200,K=163.90,\sigma=20\%,r=3,T=3\right)}\ &{\quad=163.90\times e^{-3\times0.03}-6.72=149.79-6.72=143.07}\end{array}}
$$  

We cannot be sure that our numbers are exactly right. We do know, however, that at higher volatility numbers, we would get an even greater undervaluation of equity given debt, and overvaluation of debt given equity. We zero in on the following relative value "hedge" strategy:  

short Green Diamond's debt (perhaps hedged with long Treasuries) buy Green Diamond's stock..  

This is not an arbitrage trade, but a bet that the relative values of debt and equity will. converge to their true values. We are computing a call value not fully priced into the value of the equity (\$56.93 vs $\$54$ million) and/or a put value embedded in debt that is not fully. reflected in the yield-to-maturity on debt. We are implying the risk-adjusted yield-to-maturity of  

$$
4.5\%=1/3\times\ln(163.90/143.07).
$$  

instead of the current  

$$
3.85\%=1/3\times\ln(163.90/146).
$$  

This option-theoretic approach can be pushed further to break up the different levels of debt. Suppose we believe that, as we computed, the total value of debt is overpriced by about $\$2.97$ million. Green Diamond has a $\$123.90$ million face of senior debt and $\$40$ million of subordinated debt. The senior debt trades at 110.88, implying a yield to maturity of $3.7\%$ ; the subordinated debt trades at 35.12, implying a yield to maturity of $4.33\%$ . We have two ways to evaluate the relative pricing of the two kinds of debt. Spread analysis: is the extra 63 bp in yield enough to cover the relative default risk of the two debt tranches? Or option-theoretic: assume little or no default risk on the senior debt and price the junior debt. Define $\tilde{V}-110.88$ as an asset with a strike of 40. Adjust the volatility of the new asset and price in an Asian option model. Asian options on prices of assets averaged over the time of the options have a component that has already been set (prices already observed) and a component that has not been set (the remaining asset prices to be observed till expiry). Here part of the asset is assumed to be known: the value of the senior debt. The rest is unknown and has the most optionality. The volatility adjustment is down and is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the unknown component to the total.  

# 12.1.3 Theoretical Relative Value  

In this space, the logic of most strategies is decomposition of securities into the sum of its pieces. In fixed income, coupon bonds are stripped into principal and coupon strips and some parts of them sold off. In asset classes, convertibles are divided into bullet bonds and options to convert into equity. In managed futures, the cash-and-carry is used to put together a convergence trade. Let us dissect the basics of each strategy.  

Let us start with fixed income arbitrage. It is most often posed as some kind of rich/cheap. yield curve pricing inefficiency, but the essence of the trade is always long a package of cash flows, and short a package of identical (or nearly identical) cash flows with the residual risk being a forward interest rate, volatility, or swap spread..  

In swap spread arbitrage, we take a long or short position on the swap spread:  

. If we think the swap spread for maturity $\tau$ is going to narrow, we receive fixed a swap rate $S$ against floating LIBOR $\tilde{L}$ , we short the corresponding maturity Treasury yielding the rate $T$ , and we earn the repo rate $\tilde{R}$ in the margin account. Effectively, we lock in the. swap spread $S-T$ against uncertain difference $\tilde{R}-\tilde{L}$ . If the swap spread narrows in the market, the locked-in difference has a positive PV.. If we think the swap spread for maturity $\tau$ is going to widen, we pay fixed a swap rate $S$ against floating LIBOR $\tilde{L}$ , and we buy the corresponding maturity Treasury yielding the. rate $T$ , financing the purchase at the repo rate $\tilde{R}$ in the margin account. Effectively, we lock. in to pay the swap spread $S-T$ against receiving the uncertain difference $\tilde{L}-\tilde{R}$ . If the swap spread widens in the market, then what we locked in to pay has a positive PV.  

In yield curve arbitrage, the strategies are close substitutes - long/shorts, butterflies, or steepeners/flatteners:  

. If we think the 29-year Treasury yielding. $5.15\%$ is very cheap relative to the on-the-run. 30-year Treasury yielding. $4.9\%$ , and the relative pricing is going to persist even after. the 30-year goes off-the-run and loses its liquidity, then we can buy the 29-year and short the 30-year as long as neither is subject to special repo.   
If we think the curve is too humped in the middle, we can pursue a duration-matched. butterfly: buy the 5-year and short the 2-year and the 10-year Treasury or agency, all price-value-of-a-basis-point matched to create a parallel rate move neutral trade.   
If we think the curve is about to flatten/steepen, we go short/long the short end and long/short the long end, again all PVBP matched.  

Volatility arbitrage can take various forms. Two regularities in volatility products are often examined:  

More often than not, short-term volatilities are higher than long-term volatilities - this is true in bond, caps, or swaption volatilities that are often in equities and currencies. There are many potential explanations, such as mean reversion, with the trade being on the relative point on the volatility curve. Implied volatilities tend to be higher than subsequently realized volatilities. This could be. an artifact of the demand for the liquidity or convenience of risk insurance, rather than self-insurance. The trade is to go long volatility and to delta hedge the exposure.  

The sources of profit in convertible bond arbitrage include:  

The (option model) theoretical underpricing of the conversion option included in the bond. The arbitrage trade is to buy the bond, short the stock, and short a bullet bond on the same company. The riskier version involving corporate spread risk is to buy several convertibles and short Treasuries or note/bond futures to establish an aggregate hedge. The long convert/short stock/bullet strategy allows the hedger to acquire a cheap equity option on the  

company. The relative value can also be monetized by not shorting stock, but instead selling call options matching the embedded options. The main risks are that the stripping of the convert of the interest rate risk is imperfect as most converts have long-term conversion rights during which interest rates, and therefore effective strike prices, change.. The severe underpricing of the conversion feature when the relative value is hard to monetize. If not enough liquid calls are traded on the stock and/or shares cannot be easily/cheaply borrowed for shorting, then the conversion right underpricing can persist. Buying the convert and shorting bullets may be possible, but locking in the equity side of the trade may not.  

Managed futures strategies, to a large extent, rely less on theory and more on technical analysis, but often blend both. Some common strategies involve:  

Trend following - Moving average and similar indicators signal the start or end of a. short-term trend. This is the most popular strategy.   
Countertrend trades - Identifying trend reversals.   
Spread trading - When implied volatility is high, write out-of-the-money calls and puts and take a residual position in futures to profit from range trading. The main risk for an investor here is to define the risk properly for funds that have experienced positive returns in the past.   
Basis trading - Trade subsequent expiry futures against each other, based on the cost-ofcarry and convergence criteria.  

# 12.1.4 Statistical Relative Value Arbitrage  

Statistical arbitrage is often driven by large computerized models relying on the historical. individual security return data. The trade signals are not at the market or sector level, and thus cannot be easily replicated by a small unsophisticated player. Let us give a somewhat. contrived index model example.  

Suppose we use the historical database of US stocks and we are convinced that individual stocks exhibit short-term (daily) momentum. That is, we believe in first-order autocorrelation. While our intuition may be right in some sense, a naive strategy of buying a stock at the end of the day on which it is going to profit from the subsequent upward likelihood of more than ${^1}/{_2}$ , is subject to directional risk that may swamp any momentum profits. We need an index model for two reasons:  

to separate the systematic beta factors from the idiosyncratic factors, to dissect the returns down to the "pure" momentum signals which may not be market but individual security. level;   
to properly identify the market-neutral long/short set-up we will pursue to strip the returns down to the momentum factors.  

Let us assume that we have read the academic literature on the three-factor Fama and French (1992) model; and we have not found much appeal in the Carhart (1997) four-factor model with the market-wide momentum factor. So, for each stock we intend to trade, we proceed by computing the factor loadings for the three factors: first beta on the market index return, second beta on the high/low book value sorted long/short portfolios factor, and the third beta on the small/large sorted long/short portfolios factor. We identify the factor trading vehicles: an index fund/futures and two sorted long/short portfolios. The factor loadings (betas) we have computed will serve as hedge ratios for all stocks relative to the factors. We analyze the index. model and compute the residuals of realized stock returns minus model returns. For example, if we found that GE's factor loadings are constants 1.25, 0.4, and. $-0.3$ , then for GE returns we compute:  

$$
\mathbf{\Pi}_{t}^{\cdot G E}=r_{G E}-\left[r_{F}+1.25\left(r_{M k t}-r_{F}\right)+0.4\left(r_{H i B V/M V}-r_{L o B V/M V}\right)-0.3\left(r_{S m}-r_{L g}\right)\right]
$$  

The first term in the model is the excess return on S&P 500 or Russell 2000, our chosen market index proxy; the second is the difference in returns between high and low book-tomarket sorted portfolios (highest decile minus the lowest decile); and the third is the small minus large cap sorted portfolios return differential. We compute these residuals for every stock. The real work begins now.  

We dig into the data to discover statistical momentum or reversal relationship. These are searched for on an aggregate basis by imposing some joint dependence form on the residuals, with autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), variance, etc., terms. For ease of exposition, we follow an example where we dissect the residuals for each stock independently.  

We choose to perform an $\mathrm{ARMA}(2,2)$ time series statistical analysis of the individual stock residuals and discover a momentum "signal"' for each stock in the first and second AR terms. The strength of the signal is measured by the first and second AR coefficients in the ARMA. specification. The direction will be indicated by the realizations of past residuals; since we did. not find significance in the MA terms, the error terms will not contribute. To summarize, we have estimated the coefficients $\gamma,\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$ $\beta_{1}$ , and $\beta_{2}$ in:  

$$
X_{t}^{G E}=\gamma+\varepsilon_{t}+\alpha_{1}X_{t-1}^{G E}+\alpha_{2}X_{t-2}^{G E}+\beta_{1}\varepsilon_{t-1}+\beta_{2}\varepsilon_{t-2}
$$  

We are ready to trade. We buy stocks with long momentum signals; we short stocks with sell momentum signals. The signals are $X_{t-1}^{G E}$ and $X_{t-2}^{G E}$ . If the strength coefficients $\alpha_{1}$ and $\alpha_{2}$ are positive, and the last 2 days (weeks) show positive residuals $X_{t-1}^{G E}$ and $X_{t-2}^{G E}$ , we buy GE. We do this for all our stocks. On any given day, some get included in the long portfolio, some get included in the short portfolio. Since we have computed the stock exposures to the factors, we can compute the net exposure to the factors and hedge the directional risk by trading in the factor vehicles. The expected net excess return we hope to generate from all the longs and. shorts over time is our model alpha.  

If we employ Carhart's four-factor model, then we have to include the market-wide momentum factor in the loadings calculations before computing the residuals. After the residual analysis, we may have to modify our individual momentum signals to include the momentum beta. The excess return generated from individual stock trades over time, in addition to the four-factor-hedged return, is our model alpha.  

The preceding discussion serves to show the amount of data and model sophistication required to investigate a statistical arbitrage idea. We need as much stock history as possible with all the details of dividends, splits, delistings, etc. Once a regularity is discovered, the model needs to be converted into a trading platform that updates the data, re-estimates factors and coefficients, and translates the signals into trade orders. It also must not fail at any given. time in computing the rebalancing orders. We are not engaging in a one-time gamble, but hope to earn a positive alpha over time, with many negative days along the way. After all, we are relying on the past repeating itself over a large number of short gamble experiments. We just trust that our decomposition of the past is much better than what others have attempted before.
