# 10.1  COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS  

CDO issuance grew from less than $\$150$ billion in 2003 to $\$520$ billion in 2006 and $\$481$ billion in 2007, then collapsing to just $\$61$ billion in 2008. The vast majority of CDOs, about. $80\%$ are cash CDOs. CDOs transfer the risks of corporate bonds, loans, or mortgage pass-throughs  

from one entity to another. This is done on a cash basis with the actual underlying securities put in a trust, or on a synthetic basis with high-quality collateral (e.g. Treasuries) put in the trust and the trust selling default protection to the originator of the CDO.  

# 10.1.1Cash CDO  

In a cash CDO, several similar assets called the CDO collateral are placed in a special purpose.   
vehicle (SPV) created by the sponsor-originator of the CDO and administered by a trustee.   
Sponsors are investment banks earning fees by underwriting the CDO. By 2008, the top.   
underwriters were Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of America.  

The SPV receives all the cash flows from the underlying assets, including interest and principal payments. The originator distributes to the buyers CDO certificates which are claims on the cash flows coming into the SPV minus the expenses associated with running the SPV. Those are retained by the trustee and the manager of the CDO. An institution like the Bank of New York, State Street Bank, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, or Deutsche Bank holds title to the assets on behalf of the investors. CDOs are often actively managed by a CDO manager. In that case the collateral changes over time at the discretion of the manager and the cash flows distributed to the CDO investor include the sales of the collateral. In 2009 there were approximately 300 CDO managers. Some of the top managers were Trust Company of the West (TCW), BlackRock, C-BASS Investment, Duke Funding or Ellington Management in the USA and Deutsche, Credit Suisse, West LB, and Rabobank in Europe. The role of the manager is to maintain the credit quality of the collateral throughout of the life of the CDO. But even before that, following issuance, the manager acquires the assets for the CDO during the ramp-up period by making capital calls to the senior tranche investors and buying the underlying assets into the SPV. The ramp-up period lasts several months. In the subsequent reinvestment or revolver period, the manager may make additional purchases of the collateral as specified in the transaction documents. The manager earns senior and subordinated fees for his services. Many CDOs are passively managed with the role of the manager limited simply to maintaining the portfolio. In these static cash CDOs investors know with certainty the composition of the collateral.  

While there are many motivations for sponsors and investors to participate in CDO deals,. e.g. sponsors wanting to reduce their balance sheet credit exposure or investors wanting access to certain risks, the main motivation is almost always arbitrage - that is, the creation of a wide spread between the high yield on the equity part of the deal and the relatively lower yield on the highly rated portion of the deal. The main goal is to be able to offer senior certificates that are of higher credit quality than the underlying assets themselves. To that end, the CDO is. typically tranched into senior, mezzanine, and subordinated (equity) tranches.  

Figure 10.1 shows an example of a static cash CDO in which $\$100$ million junk-rated ${\tt B B+}$ assets with a weighted average coupon of. $7.5\%$ are placed in the SPV. The rates on risk-free. and AAA-rated bonds are at $5\%$ . The cash flow from the. ${\tt B B+}$ collateral is tranched into three sets of CDO certificates. The senior tranche has a face value of $\$80$ million, carries a coupon. of $5.5\%$ , and is rated AAA. The mezzanine tranche has a face value of $\$15$ million, carries a. coupon of $9.17\%$ , and is rated BBB. The equity tranche has a face value of $\$5$ million, carries a coupon of $24.5\%$ , and is unrated. The custody and asset management fees are $0.5\%$  

If no defaults occur during the life of the CDO, then the $\$7,500,000$ annual coupon flow will cover the fees and the stated coupon rates of the different tranches: $5.5\%\times\%80$ million $=\$4.4$ million; $9.17\%\times\S15\mathrm{million}=\S1.375$ million; and $24.5\%\times\mathbb{\S}5\mathrm{million}=\mathbb{\S}1.225$ million. If all tranche holders purchase their certificates at par, then the senior tranche holders will make a return of $5.5\%$ , the mezzanine holders will make a return of $9.17\%$ , and the equity holders will make a return of $24.5\%$

Figure 10.1  A cash CDO  

If the bonds held by the SPV begin to default, then the returns on the equity and mezzanine. tranches will be drastically different, while the senior tranche will enjoy a cushion of protection,. because initially all default losses will be allocated to the equity tranche. If more than. $\$5$ million bonds default, then the losses will start to be allocated to the mezzanine tranche. More than $20\%$ of the underlying collateral has to default before the senior tranche is affected..  

Let us consider a scenario where $\$2.5$ million bonds default in year 3 and another. $\$7.5$ million bonds default in year 4. The actual return to equity holders (IRR) will be. $-23.01\%$ as they will receive the first two coupons, only half the coupon in year 3, and no principal back. The. return to mezzanine holders will be $4.45\%$ . They will receive full first three coupons, as the. loss in year 3 is fully absorbed by the equity holders. Of the default in year 4,. $\$2.5$ million will be absorbed by the equity holders, but the remainder $\$5$ million will reduce the mezzanine holders' cash flow by one-third. At maturity, they will also only receive. $\$10$ million of their principal. The IRR on their investment will be. $4.45\%$ . If there are no additional defaults, then the senior tranche holders will be unaffected and will have earned $5.5\%$ , a $0.5\%$ premium over comparable AAA investments. However, it is very likely that by year 3 or 4, the mezzanine tranche will be downgraded to junk, and the senior tranche perhaps to a single A, or lower. By then, the equity tranche is wiped out offering no protection to the mezzanine tranche, while. the collateral is only ${\tt B B+}$ and some securities in it are rated even lower than that. Also, by then, the protection cushion offered by the mezzanine tranche to the senior tranche will be severely depleted.  

Two important refinements are commonly found in cash CDO structures. First, there need not be only three tranches, as laid out in Figure 10.1. In fact, most CDOs created in the first decade of 2o00s had several investment-grade tranches, and the mezzanine and equity tranches were typically much thinner. Figure 10.2 illustrates how the same collateral could have been used to create five different tranches.

Figure 10.2 A cash CDO with multiple senior tranches  

The second common feature is the layering of securitization. The most senior and the. mezzanine tranches could be put into new SPVs and then tranched even more finely. This. creates a more skewed default protection structure and can produce even more senior tranches. Figure 10.3 shows an example of a CDO of a CDO.  

Two new SPVs are created, one from the most senior tranches and one from the mezzanine tranche. The first issues what would be called a high-grade CDO-backed CDO. The second issues a mezzanine CDO-backed CDO. Each has one or more AAA-rated tranches. The objective is to break up the proportional flow of default losses shared equally by all certificate holders of a given class into an ordinal flow with junior tranches being the first to absorb the losses. This second layer of securitization (and one can easily envision a third layer) allows the creation of a larger total principal of AAA-rated CDO certificates.  

For the senior AAA tranche holders of the high-grade CDO to suffer losses, the original collateral not only has to wipe out the original CDO's $\$3$ million equity tranche and the. $\$8$ million mezzanine tranche, but also the subordinated classes of the new high-grade CDO. In the mezzanine CDO, the senior AAA tranche holders are insulated from default losses by the original $\$3$ million equity tranche and by the. $\$5.5$ million worth of all the subordinated tranches of the new CDO, from the $\$0.5$ million equity class all the way up to the. $\$2$ million junior AAA class. While the original $\$8$ million of mezzanine was rated BBB, now $\$3.5$ million of it is re-rated senior AAA, and another $\$2$ million is rated junior AAA. The two would not carry the same yield, as the second is riskier than the first, but both may still qualify for an AAA rating based on their low expected default rate. Note that the model default rate critically depends on the speed and the correlation of defaults of all the credits in the original CDO.  

# 10.1.2 Synthetic CDO  

The objectives of a cash CDO, i.e. spread compensation for bearing the risk of default of one credit or a basket of credits, can be replicated synthetically through the use of credit default swaps (CDSs) or basket credit swaps. The $2.0\%$ coupon differential between the $7.5\%$ weighted average coupon of the collateral minus the fees of. $0.5\%$ and the risk-free rate of. $5\%$ can be earned by the SPV by selling credit default protection to an unrelated third party. The $\$100$ million proceeds from selling the CDO certificates can be used to purchase risk-free Treasuries yielding $5\%$  

![](33a1c960980ee8d9360bbc72a782e48f6ca69077b250b3dca3f0a197dbc722c1.jpg)  
Figure 10.3A CDO of a CDO  

Let us suppose that, as in the previous example (Figures 10.1 to 10.3), the underlying collateral is a single $7.5\%$ 10-year bond issued by the XYZ Corporation. In Chapter 7 we. argued that the premium for the CDS on a corporate bond should be approximately equal to the difference between the corporate bond's yield and the yield of a comparable maturity Treasury bond. If the 10-year default-free rate is $5\%$ , then the XYZ bond can be insured by paying. $2.5\%$ per annum in exchange for par minus the recovery rate if, or when, the bond defaults.  

Figure 10.4 shows how a synthetic CDO on the XYZ bond would work. Here the XYZ. bond serves as a reference collateral on a CDS sold by the SPV, rather than actual collateral being purchased by the SPV. The reference collateral is chosen by an asset selection agent (a credit analysis and sponsoring asset manager). The CDS is sold by the SPV to a third party, typically the sponsoring investment bank arranging the transaction. The SPV holds Treasuries. yielding $5\%$ and collects an additional $2.5\%$ in premiums on the CDS. The $\$7.5$ million cash

flow is then tranched into the same classes of CDO certificates as in our cash CDO example.   
If defaults occur, the SPV has to liquidate some of its Treasury holdings to pay claims on the.   
CDO. The equity and mezzanine tranches are first to absorb these losses..  

If the collateral consists of a basket of credits (ABC, CDE, SAF, etc.) as in our original example, then the CDS on a single XYZ bond is replaced by a basket of CDSs each with the correct notional principal on each of the bonds in the basket (\$8 million, $\$11$ million, $\$7$ million, etc.); the total notional principal is equal to $\$100$ million.  

A cash CDO is almost self-managing. As bonds begin to default, the principal losses get. fully allocated first to the equity and then to the mezzanine tranches, reducing their outstanding. principal amount. The coupon rate does not have to be changed, but the subsequent dollar coupon flow is diminished proportionately to the face value reduction. In a synthetic CDO, the manager of the CDO has to sell Treasuries out of the SPV to make payments to the CDS counterparty. This reduces the subsequent coupon flow and the principal amount of collateral, with the principal reduction again fully allocated first to equity and then to mezzanine holders.  

The raison d' etre of synthetic CDOs is the fact that neither the sponsor nor the manager of the CDO requires access to the reference collateral. In the cash CDO, the collateral securities must actually exist and be available for purchase into the SPV. In the synthetic CDO, the reference assets theoretically don't even have to exist or be easily tradeable. As long as a payout formula for the backing CDSs can be established, the CDO can be created and investors in it can receive coupon spread compensation for the default exposure to the reference collateral. The slightly negative aspect of the synthetic CDO is the additional credit exposure to the CDS counterparty for the CDS premium receipts.  

In May 2010, Goldman Sachs executives were grilled by US congressmen over the synthetic Abacus 2007-AC1 CDO referenced with sub-prime mortgage loans. According to the US lawmakers, Goldman was at fault at having not informed the buyer of the CDO (the German. bank IKB) that a hedge fund manager, John Paulson, was going short the mortgage loans. The congressmen failed to grasp that in a synthetic CDO, the SPV always sells a credit default swap to a third party in order to generate the spread income for the buyer of the CDO, so the fact that. Goldman owned protection on ("was massively short") a portfolio of sub-prime mortgages. was not a surprise. The congressmen drilled into the fact that something was not right if the 90 mortgage securities underlying the CDO had not been chosen by an independent portfolio selection agent or asset manager, ACA Management, but had been allegedly hand-picked by Paulson to fail. Goldman's pitch book touted ACA's expertise in credit evaluation and CDO collateral management to the investors. ACA decided to sue Goldman for "fraud and unjust. enrichment' in 2011.
