# 3.1 BASIC PRINCIPLES  

When an individual or company chooses to use futures markets to hedge a risk, the objective is often to take a position that neutralizes the risk as far as possible. Consider a company that knows it will gain $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent increase in the price of a commodity over the next 3 months and lose $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent decrease in the price during the same period. To hedge, the company's treasurer should take a short futures position that is designed to offset this risk. The futures position should lead to a loss of $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent increase in the price of the commodity over the 3 months and a gain of $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. If the price of the commodity goes down, the gain on the futures position offsets the loss on the rest of the company's business. If the price of the commodity goes up, the loss on the futures position is offset by the gain on the rest of the company's business.  

# Short Hedges  

A short hedge is a hedge, such as the one just described, that involves a short position in futures contracts. A short hedge is appropriate when the hedger already owns an asset and expects to sell it at some time in the future. For example, a short hedge could be used by a farmer who owns some hogs and knows that they will be ready for sale at the local market in two months. A short hedge can also be used when an asset is not owned right now but will be owned and ready for sale at some time in the future. Consider, for example, a U.S. exporter who knows that he or she will receive euros in 3 months. The exporter will realize a gain if the euro increases in value relative to the U.S. dollar and will sustain a loss if the euro decreases in value relative to the U.S. dollar. A short futures position leads to a loss if the euro increases in value and a gain if it decreases in value. It has the effect of offsetting the exporter's risk..  

To provide a more detailed illustration of the operation of a short hedge in a specific situation, we assume that it is May 15 today and that an oil producer has just negotiated a contract to sell 1 million barrels of crude oil. It has been agreed that the price that will apply in the contract is the market price on August 15. The oil producer is therefore in the position where it will gain. $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent increase in the price of oil over the next 3 months and lose. $\$10,000$ for each 1 cent decrease in the price during this period. Suppose that on May 15 the spot price is $\$50$ per barrel and the crude oil futures price for August delivery is. $\$49$ per barrel. Because each futures contract is for the delivery of 1,000 barrels, the company can hedge its exposure by shorting (i.e., selling) 1,000 futures contracts. If the oil producer closes out its position on August 15, the effect of the strategy should be to lock in a price close to $\$49$ per barrel.  

To illustrate what might happen, suppose that the spot price on August 15 proves to be $\$45$ per barrel. The company realizes $\$45$ million for the oil under its sales contract. Because August is the delivery month for the futures contract, the futures price on August 15 should be very close to the spot price of $\$45$ on that date. The company therefore gains approximately  

$$
\$49-\$45=\$4
$$  

per barrel, or $\$4$ million in total from the short futures position. The total amount. realized from both the futures position and the sales contract is therefore approximately $\$49$ per barrel, or $\$49$ million in total.  

For an alternative outcome, suppose that the price of oil on August 15 proves to be $\$55$ per barrel. The company realizes $\$55$ per barrel for the oil and loses approximately  

$$
\$55
$$  

per barrel on the short futures position. Again, the total amount realized is approximately $\$49$ million. It is easy to see that in all cases the company ends up with. approximately $\$49$ million.  

# Long Hedges  

Hedges that involve taking a long position in a futures contract are known as long hedges. A long hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase a certain asset in the future and wants to lock in a price now.  

Suppose that it is now January 15. A copper fabricator knows it will require 100,000 pounds of copper on May 15 to meet a certain contract. The spot price of copper is 340 cents per pound, and the futures price for May delivery is 320 cents per pound. The fabricator can hedge its position by taking a long position in four futures contracts offered by the CME Group and closing its position on May 15. Each contract is for the delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper. The strategy has the effect of locking in the price of the required copper at close to 320 cents per pound.  

Suppose that the spot price of copper on May 15 proves to be 325 cents per pound. Because May is the delivery month for the futures contract, this should be very close to the futures price. The fabricator therefore gains approximately.  

$$
100,000\times(\S3.25-\S3.20)=\S5,000
$$  

on the futures contracts. It pays $100.000\times\$3.25=43325.000$ for the copper, making the net cost approximately $\$325,000-\$55,000$ . For an alternative outcome, suppose that the spot price is 305 cents per pound on May 15. The fabricator then loses approximately  

$$
100,000\times(\S3.20-\S3.05)=\S15,000
$$  

on the futures contract and pays $100.000\times\$3.05=\$305.000$ for the copper. Again, the.   
net cost is approximately $\$320,000$ , or 320 cents per pound.  

Note that, in this case, it is clearly better for the company to use futures contracts than to buy the copper on January 15 in the spot market. If it does the latter, it will pay. 340 cents per pound instead of 320 cents per pound and will incur both interest costs. and storage costs. For a company using copper on a regular basis, this disadvantage. would be offset by the convenience of having the copper on hand.' However, for a. company that knows it will not require the copper until May 15, the futures contract alternative is likely to be preferred.  

The examples we have looked at assume that the futures position is closed out in the delivery month. The hedge has the same basic effect if delivery is allowed to happen. However, making or taking delivery can be costly and inconvenient. For this reason, delivery is not usually made even when the hedger keeps the futures contract until the delivery month. As will be discussed later, hedgers with long positions usually avoid any possibility of having to take delivery by closing out their positions before the delivery period.  

We have also assumed in the two examples that there is no daily settlement. In. practice, daily settlement does have a small effect on the performance of a hedge. As. explained in Chapter 2, it means that the payoff from the futures contract is realized day by day throughout the life of the hedge rather than all at the end..
