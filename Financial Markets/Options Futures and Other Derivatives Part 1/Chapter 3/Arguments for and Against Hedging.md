# 3.2 ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST HEDGING  

The arguments in favor of hedging are so obvious that they hardly need to be stated. Most nonfinancial companies are in the business of manufacturing, or retailing or. wholesaling, or providing a service. They have no particular skills or expertise in predicting variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices..  

(Indeed, even experts are often wrong when they make predictions about these variables.) It makes sense for them to hedge the risks associated with these variables as they. become aware of them. The companies can then focus on their main activities. By. hedging, they avoid unpleasant surprises such as sharp rises in the price of a commodity that is being purchased.  

In practice, many risks are left unhedged. In the rest of this section we will explore some of the reasons for this..  

# Hedging and Shareholders  

One argument sometimes put forward is that the shareholders can, if they wish, do the hedging themselves. They do not need the company to do it for them. This argument is, however, open to question. It assumes that shareholders have as much information as the company's management about the risks faced by a company. In most instances, this is not the case. The argument also ignores commissions and other transactions costs. These are less expensive per dollar of hedging for large transactions than for small transactions. Hedging is therefore likely to be less expensive when carried out by the company than when it is carried out by individual shareholders.  

One thing that shareholders can do far more easily than a corporation is diversify risk. A shareholder with a well-diversified portfolio may be immune to many of the risks faced by a corporation. For example, in addition to holding shares in a company that uses copper, a well-diversified shareholder may hold shares in a copper producer, so that there is very little overall exposure to the price of copper. If companies are acting. in the best interests of well-diversified shareholders, it can be argued that hedging is unnecessary in many situations. However, the extent to which managers are in practice influenced by this type of argument is open to question.  

# Hedging and Competitors  

If hedging is not the norm in a certain industry, it may not make sense for one. particular company to choose to be different from all others. Competitive pressures. within the industry may be such that the prices of the goods and services produced by the industry fluctuate to reflect raw material costs, interest rates, exchange rates, and so on. A company that does not hedge can expect its profit margins to be roughly constant. However, a company that does hedge can expect its profit margins to. fluctuate!  

To illustrate this point, consider two manufacturers of gold jewelry, SafeandSure Company and TakeaChance Company. We assume that most companies in the industry do not hedge against movements in the price of gold and that TakeaChance Company is no exception. However, SafeandSure Company has decided to be different from its competitors and to use futures contracts to hedge its purchase of gold over the next 18 months. If the price of gold goes up, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding increase in the wholesale price of jewelry,so that TakeaChance Company's. gross profit margin is unaffected. By contrast, SafeandSure Company's profit margin will. increase after the effects of the hedge have been taken into account. If the price of gold. goes down, economic pressures will tend to lead to a corresponding decrease in the. wholesale price of jewelry. Again, TakeaChance Company's profit margin is unaffected.. However, SafeandSure Company's profit margin goes down. In extreme conditions,  

Table 3.1 Danger in hedging when competitors do not hedge.

SafeandSure Company's profit margin could become negative as a result of the "hedging" carried out! The situation is summarized in Table 3.1..  

This example emphasizes the importance of looking at the big picture when hedging. All the implications of price changes on a company's profitability should be taken into account in the design of a hedging strategy to protect against the price changes.  

# Hedging Can Lead to a Worse Outcome  

It is important to realize that a hedge using futures contracts can result in a decrease or an increase in a company's profits relative to the position it would be in with no hedging. In the example involving the oil producer considered earlier, if the price of oil goes down, the company loses money on its sale of 1 million barrels of oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting gain. The treasurer can be congratulated for having had the foresight to put the hedge in place. Clearly, the company is better off than it would be with no hedging. Other executives in the organization, it is hoped, will appreciate the contribution made by the treasurer. If the price of oil goes up, the company gains from its sale of the oil, and the futures position leads to an offsetting loss. The company is in a worse position than it would be with no hedging. Although the hedging decision was perfectly logical, the treasurer may in practice have a difficult time justifying it. Suppose that the price of oil at the end of the hedge is $\$59$ , so that the company loses $\$10$ per barrel on the futures contract. We can imagine a conversation such as the following between the treasurer and the president:  

President:This is terrible. We've lost. $\$10$ million in the futures market in the space. of three months. How could it happen? I want a full explanation.   
Treasurer: The purpose of the futures contracts was to hedge our exposure to the price of oil, not to make a profit. Don't forget we made $\$10$ million from the favorable effect of the oil price increases on our business.   
President: What's that got to do with it? That's like saying that we do not need to worry when our sales are down in California because they are up in New York.   
Treasurer: If the price of oil had gone down.   
President: I don't care what would have happened if the price of oil had gone down. The fact is that it went up. I really do not know what you were doing playing the futures markets like this. Our shareholders will expect us to have done particularly well this quarter. I'm going to have to explain to them that your actions reduced profits by $\$10$ million. I'm. afraid this is going to mean no bonus for you this year.  

# Business Snapshot 3.1 Hedging by Gold Mining Companies  

It is natural for a gold mining company to consider hedging against changes in the. price of gold. Typically it takes several years to extract all the gold from a mine. Once a gold mining company decides to go ahead with production at a particular mine, it has a big exposure to the price of gold. Indeed a mine that looks profitable at the outset could become unprofitable if the price of gold plunges..  

Gold mining companies are careful to explain their hedging strategies to potential shareholders. Some gold mining companies do not hedge. They tend to attract shareholders who buy gold stocks because they want to benefit when the price of gold increases and are prepared to accept the risk of a loss from a decrease in the price of gold. Other companies choose to hedge. They estimate the number of ounces of gold they will produce each month for the next few years and enter into short futures or forward contracts to lock in the price for all or part of this.  

Suppose you are Goldman Sachs and are approached by a gold mining company. that wants to sell you a large amount of gold in 1 year at a fixed price. How do you set the price and then hedge your risk? The answer is that you can hedge by. borrowing the gold from a central bank, selling it immediately in the spot market, and investing the proceeds at the risk-free rate. At the end of the year, you buy the gold from the gold mining company and use it to repay the central bank. The fixed. forward price you set for the gold reflects the risk-free rate you can earn and the lease rate you pay the central bank for borrowing the gold..  

Treasurer: That's unfair. I was only ..   
President: Unfair! You are lucky not to be fired. You lost $\$10$ million.   
Treasurer: It all depends on how you look at it . .  

It is easy to see why many treasurers are reluctant to hedge! Hedging reduces risk for the company. However, it may increase risk for the treasurer if others do not fully understand what is being done. The only real solution to this problem involves ensuring that all senior executives within the organization fully understand the nature of hedging before a hedging program is put in place. Ideally, hedging strategies are set by a company's board of directors and are clearly communicated to both the company's management and the shareholders. (See Business Snapshot 3.1 for a discussion of hedging by gold mining companies.)
