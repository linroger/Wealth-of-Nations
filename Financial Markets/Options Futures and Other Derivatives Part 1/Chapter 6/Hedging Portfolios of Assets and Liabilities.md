# 6.5 HEDGING PORTFOLIOS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  

Financial institutions sometimes attempt to hedge themselves against interest rate risk by ensuring that the average duration of their assets equals the average duration of their liabilities. (The liabilities can be regarded as short positions in bonds.) This strategy is known as duration matching or portfolio immunization. When implemented, it ensures that a small parallel shift in interest rates will have little effect on the value of the portfolio of assets and liabilities. The gain (loss) on the assets should offset the loss (gain) on the liabilities.  

Duration matching does not immunize a portfolio against nonparallel shifts in the zero curve. This is a weakness of the approach. In practice, short-term rates are usually more volatile than, and are not perfectly correlated with, long-term rates. Sometimes it even happens that short- and long-term rates move in opposite directions to each other. Duration matching is therefore only a first step and financial institutions have developed other tools to help them manage their interest rate exposure. See Business Snapshot 6.3.  

# SUMMARY  

In the Treasury bond futures contracts, the party with the short position has a number of interesting delivery options:  

1. Delivery can be made on any day during the delivery month. 2. There are a number of alternative bonds that can be delivered. 3. On any day during the delivery month, the notice of intention to deliver at the $2{:}00\mathrm{p.m}$ settlement price can be made later in the day.  

These options all tend to reduce the futures price.  

The Eurodollar futures contract is a contract on the 3-month LIBOR interest rate two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. It is expected that as LIBOR is phased out this will be replaced by the 3-month SOFR futures contract. This is a futures contract on the rate obtained by compounding one-day SOFR rates over a three-month period.  

The concept of duration is important in hedging interest rate risk. It enables a hedger to assess the sensitivity of a bond portfolio to small parallel shifts in the yield curve. It also enables the hedger to assess the sensitivity of an interest rate futures price to small changes in the yield curve. The number of futures contracts necessary to protect the bond portfolio against small parallel shifts in the yield curve can therefore be calculated.  

The key assumption underlying duration-based hedging is that all interest rates change by the same amount. This means that only parallel shifts in the term structure are allowed for. In practice, short-term interest rates are generally more volatile than are long-term interest rates, and hedge performance is liable to be poor if the duration of the bond underlying the futures contract differs markedly from the duration of the asset being hedged.

# Swaps  

The birth of the over-the-counter swap market can be traced to a currency swap negotiated between IBM and the World Bank in 1981. The World Bank had borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars while IBM had borrowings denominated in German deutsche marks and Swiss francs. The World Bank (which was restricted in the deutsche mark and Swiss franc borrowing it could do directly) agreed to make interest payments on IBM's borrowings while IBM in return agreed to make interest payments on the World Bank's borrowings. Since that first transaction in 1981, the swap market has seen phenomenal growth.  

A swap is an over-the-counter agreement between two companies to exchange cash. flows in the future. The agreement defines the dates when the cash flows are to be paid and the way in which they are to be calculated. Usually the calculation of the cash flows involves the future value of an interest rate, an exchange rate, or other market variable. A forward contract can be viewed as a simple example of a swap. Suppose it is March 1, 2022, and a company enters into a forward contract to buy 100 ounces of gold for $\$1,700$ per ounce in one year. The company can sell the gold in one year as soon as it is received. The forward contract is therefore equivalent to a swap where the company agrees that on March 1, 2023, it will pay. $\$170,000$ and receive 100S, where $S$ is the market price of one ounce of gold on that date..  

Whereas a forward contract is equivalent to the exchange of cash flows on just one future date, swaps typically lead to cash-flow exchanges taking place on several future dates. In this chapter we examine how swaps are used and how they are valued. Our discussion centers on interest rate swaps and currency swaps. Other types of swaps are briefly reviewed at the end of this chapter and discussed in more detail in Chapter 34.
