# 6.2 TREASURY BOND FUTURES  

Table 6.1 shows interest rate futures quotes on May 21, 2020. Trading in the Ultra Tbond futures contract started in 2010. Any government bond with a maturity over 25 years can be delivered by the party with the short position under the terms of this contract. In the T-bond futures contract, any government bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years can be delivered.  

A Treasury note is a Treasury bond with maturity between one and ten years. As can be seen from the volume of trading, the 10-year, 5-year, and 2-year Treasury note futures contracts with short maturities are very popular. In the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, any note with a maturity between $\hat{6}{\frac{1}{2}}$ and 10 years can be delivered. In the 5-year and 2-year Treasury note futures contracts, the note delivered has a remaining life of about 5 years and 2 years, respectively, and the original life must be less than 5.25 years.  

The 30-day Fed Funds Rate contract has a settlement price equal to 100 minus the arithmetic average of the federal funds rate during the contract month. The Eurodollar and SOFR contracts will be discussed in Section 6.3.  

# Quotes  

Ultra T-bond futures and Treasury bond futures contracts are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar per $\$100$ face value. This is similar to the way the bonds are. quoted in the spot market. In Table 6.1, the settlement price of the June 2020 Treasury bond futures contract is specified as 179-20. This means $179{\frac{20}{32}}$ , or 179.625. The settlement price of the 10-year Treasury note futures contract is quoted to the nearest half of a thirty-second. Thus the settlement price of 139-025 for the June 2020 contract should be interpreted as. $139{\frac{2.5}{32}}$ , or 139.078125. The 5-year and 2-year Treasury note contracts are quoted even more precisely, to the nearest quarter of a thirty-second. Thus the opening price of 125-132 for the September 2020 5-year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as. $125{\frac{13.25}{32}}$ , or 125.4140625. Similarly, the settlement price of 110- 127 for September 2020 2-year Treasury note contract should be interpreted as $110{\frac{12.75}{32}}$ or 110.3984375.  

# Conversion Factors  

When a particular bond is delivered in a CME group bond futures contract, a parameter known as its conversion factor defines the price received for the bond by the party with the short position. The applicable quoted price for the bond delivered is the product of the conversion factor and the most recent settlement price for the futures contract. Taking accrued interest into account (see Section 6.1), the cash received for each $\$100$ face value of the bond delivered is  

(Most recent settlement price $\times$ Conversion factor) $^+$ Accrued interest  

Each contract is for the delivery of $\$100,000$ face value of bonds. Suppose that the most recent settlement price is 120-00, the conversion factor for the bond delivered is 1.3800, and the accrued interest on this bond at the time of delivery is $\$3$ per $\$100$ face value.

The cash received by the party with the short position (and paid by the party with the long position) is then  

$$
(1.3800\times120.00)+3.00=\S168.60
$$  

per $\$100$ face value.A party with the short position in one contract would deliver bonds with a face value of $\$100,000$ and receive $\$168,600$  

The conversion factor for a bond is set equal to the quoted price the bond would have per dollar of principal on the first day of the delivery month on the assumption that the. interest rate for all maturities equals $6\%$ per annum (with semiannual compounding). In the case of the first three contracts in Table 6.1, the bond maturity and the times to the coupon payment dates are rounded down to the nearest 3 months for the purposes of the calculation. The practice enables the exchange to produce comprehensive tables. If,. after rounding, the bond lasts for an exact number of 6-month periods, the first coupon. is assumed to be paid in 6 months. If, after rounding, the bond does not last for an exact number of 6-month periods (i.e., there are an extra 3 months), the first coupon is. assumed to be paid after 3 months and accrued interest is subtracted.  

As a first example of these rules, consider a $10\%$ coupon bond with 20 years and. 2 months to maturity that is deliverable in the T-bond futures contract. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 20 years to maturity. The first coupon payment is assumed to be made after 6 months. Coupon payments are then assumed to be made at 6-month intervals until the end of the 20 years when the principal payment is made. Assume that the face value is $\$100$ When thee discount rate is $6\%$ per annum with semiannual compounding (or $3\%$ per 6 months), the. value of the bond is.  

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{40}\frac{5}{1.03^{i}}+\frac{100}{1.03^{40}}=\S146.23
$$  

Dividing by the face value gives a conversion factor of 1.4623.  

As a second example of the rules, consider an. $8\%$ coupon bond with 18 years and. 4 months to maturity. For the purposes of calculating the conversion factor, the bond is assumed to have exactly 18 years and 3 months to maturity. Discounting all the payments back to a point in time 3 months from today at. $6\%$ per annum (compounded semiannually) gives a value of.  

$$
4+\sum_{i=1}^{36}\frac{4}{1.03^{i}}+\frac{100}{1.03^{36}}=\S125.8323
$$  

The interest rate for a 3-month period is $\sqrt{1.03}-1$ ,or $1.4889\%$ . Hence, discounting back to the present gives the bond's value as $125.8323/1.014889=\S123.99.$ Subtracting the accrued interest of 2.0 gives $\$121.99$ The conversion factor is therefore 1.2199.  

In the case of the 2-year and 5-year note futures contract, a similar calculation is used to determine the conversion factor except that the time to maturity is rounded to the nearest month.  

# Cheapest-to-Deliver Bond  

At any given time during the delivery month, there are many bonds that can be delivered in bond futures contracts. These vary widely as far as coupon and maturity are concerned. The party with the short position can choose which of the available bonds  

is "cheapest" to deliver. Because the party with the short position receives (Most recent settlement price $\times$ Conversion factor) $^+$ Accrued interest and the cost of purchasing a bond is  

Quoted bond price $^+$ Accrued interest  

the cheapest-to-deliver bond is the one for which  

Quoted bond price - (Most recent settlement price $\times$ Conversion factor)  

is least. Once the party with the short position has decided to deliver, it can determine the cheapest-to-deliver bond by examining each of the deliverable bonds in turn.  

# Example 6.1  

The party with the short position has decided to deliver and is trying to choose. between the three bonds in the table below. Assume the most recent settlement price is 93-08, or 93.25.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Bond</td><td>Quotedbond price ($)</td><td>Conversion factor</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>99.50</td><td>1.0382</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>143.50</td><td>1.5188</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>119.75</td><td>1.2615</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The cost of delivering each of the bonds is as follows:  

Bond 1 $:99.50-(93.25\times1.0382)=\S2.69$ Bond 2: $143.50-(93.25\times1.5188)=\S1.87$ ${\mathrm{Bond}}3{\mathrm{:~}}119.75-(93.25\times1.2615)=\S2.12$  

The cheapest-to-deliver bond is Bond 2.  

A number of factors determine the cheapest-to-deliver bond. When bond yields are in excess of $6\%$ , the conversion factor system tends to favor the delivery of low-coupon long-maturity bonds. When yields are less than $6\%$ , the system tends to favor the delivery of high-coupon short-maturity bonds. Also, when the yield curve is upwardsloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a long time to maturity to be favored, whereas when it is downward-sloping, there is a tendency for bonds with a short time to maturity to be delivered.  

In addition to the cheapest-to-deliver bond option, the party with a short position. has an option known as the wild card play. This is described in Business Snapshot 6.2.  

# Determining the Futures Price  

An exact theoretical futures price for the Treasury bond contract is difficult to determine because the short party's options concerned with the timing of delivery and choice of the bond that is delivered cannot easily be valued. However, if we assume that both the cheapest-to-deliver bond and the delivery date are known, the Treasury  

# Business Snapshot 6.2 The Wild Card Play  

The settlement price in the CME Group's Treasury bond futures contract is the price at $2{:}00~\mathrm{p.m}$ . Chicago time. However, Treasury bonds continue trading in the spot market beyond this time and a trader with a short position can issue to the clearing house a notice of intention to deliver later in the day. If the notice is. issued, the invoice price is calculated on the basis of the settlement price that day, that is, the price at $2{:}00\mathrm{p.m}$  

This practice gives rise to an option known as the wild card play. If bond prices decline after $2{:}00~\mathrm{p.m}$ . on the first day of the delivery month, the party with the short position can issue a notice of intention to deliver at, say, 3:45 p.m. and proceed to buy bonds in the spot market for delivery at a price. calculated from the $2{:}00~\mathrm{p.m}$ . futures price. If the bond price does not decline, the party with the short position keeps the position open and waits until the. next day when the same strategy can be used.  

As with the other options open to the party with the short position, the wild card play is not free. Its value is reflected in the futures price, which is lower than it would be without the option..  

bond futures contract is a futures contract on a traded security (the bond) that provides the holder with known income.' Equation (5.2) then shows that the futures price, $F_{0}$ , is related to the spot price, $S_{0}$ , by  

$$
F_{0}=(S_{0}-I)e^{r T}
$$  

where $I$ is the present value of the coupons during the life of the futures contract, $T$ is the time until the futures contract matures, and $r$ is the risk-free interest rate applicable to a time period of length $T$  

# Example 6.2  

Suppose that, in a Treasury bond futures contract, it is known that the cheapestto-deliver bond will be a $12\%$ coupon bond with a conversion factor of 1.6000. Suppose also that it is known that delivery will take place in 270 days. Coupons. are payable semiannually on the bond. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, the last coupon date was 60 days ago, the next coupon date is in 122 days, and the coupon date thereafter is in 305 days. The term structure is flat, and the rate of interest (with continuous compounding) is $10\%$ per annum. Assume that the current quoted bond price is $\$115$ The cash price of the bond is obtained by adding to this. quoted price the proportion of the next coupon payment that accrues to the holder. The cash price is therefore.  

![](images/9a25c06630986021efd41da2c38c2b258197904b35bde2b7914e27a1924bf909.jpg)  
Figure 6.1 Time chart for Example 6.2.  

$$
115+{\frac{60}{60+122}}\times6=116.978
$$  

A coupon of $\$6$ will be received after 122 days $'=0.3342$ years). The present value of this is  

$$
6e^{-0.1\times0.3342}=5.803
$$  

The futures contract lasts for 270 days $(=0.7397$ years). The cash futures price, if the contract were written on the $12\%$ bond, would therefore be  

$$
(116.978-5.803)e^{0.1\times0.7397}=119.711
$$  

At delivery, there are 148 days of accrued interest. The quoted futures price, if the contract were written on the $12\%$ bond, is calculated by subtracting the accrued. interest  

$$
119.711-6\times{\frac{148}{148+35}}=114.859
$$  

From the definition of the conversion factor, 1.6000 standard bonds are considered equivalent to each $12\%$ bond. The quoted futures price should therefore be  

$$
\frac{114.859}{1.6000}=71.79
$$
