# 6.3 EURODOLLAR AND SOFR FUTURES  

A very popular interest rate futures contract in the United States has historically been the three-month Eurodollar futures contract traded by the CME group. The underlying interest rate is three-month (90-day) U.S. dollar LIBOR and the maturities offered by. the CME for this contract extend ten years into the future. Table 6.1 indicates that the volume of trading in Eurodollar futures was still quite high in May 2020. This is a little surprising given that LIBOR is being phased out at the end of 2021 (see Section 4.2). The expectation is that Eurodollar futures will over time be replaced by SOFR futures and this is slowly happening. The volume of trading and open interest for Eurodollar futures has been declining while that for SOFR futures has been increasing. In this. section, we explain how both contracts work..  

# Eurodollar Futures  

Eurodollar futures trade until two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month. At that point, there is a final settlement equal to. $100-R$ , where $R$ is the threemonth U.S. dollar LIBOR fixing on that day expressed with a quarterly compounding and an actual/360 day count convention. Thus, if three-month LIBOR proved to be $0.75\%$ two days before the third Wednesday of the delivery month, the final settlement. price would be 99.250. Once a final settlement has taken place all contracts are declared closed. Table 6.1 indicates that there is trading in contracts that mature well after 2021. As explained in Section 4.2, it may well be that banks will stop providing the estimates necessary to determine LIBOR at the end of 2021. If that happens, the CME has indicated that it will base the final settlement on SOFR with appropriate adjustments for the spread between the two rates.  

The contract is designed so that a one-basis-point $(=0.01\$ ) move in the futures quote corresponds to a gain or loss of $\$25$ per contract. When a Eurodollar futures quote increases by one basis point, a trader who is long one contract gains $\$25$ and a trader who is short one contract loses $\$25$ . Similarly, when the quote decreases by one basis point a trader who is long one contract loses $\$25$ and a trader who is short one contract gains $\$25$ . Suppose, for example, the settlement price for the September 2020 contract changes from 99.725 to 99.685 between May 21 and May 22, 2020. Traders with long positions lose $4\times25=\$100$ per contract; traders with short positions gain $\$100$ per contract.A one-basis-point change in the futures quote corresponds to a $0.01\%$ change in the underlying interest rate. This in turn leads to a  

$$
1,000,000\times0.0001\times0.25=25
$$  

or $\$25$ change in the interest that will be earned on $\$1$ million in three months. The $\$25$ per basis point rule is therefore consistent with the underlying interest rate applying to $\$1$ million of principal.  

The futures quote is 100 minus the futures interest rate. A trader who is long gains. when interest rates fall and one who is short gains when interest rates rise. Table 6.2 shows a possible set of outcomes for the September 2020 contract in Table 6.1 for a trader who takes a long position on May 21, 2020, at the last trade price of 99.720..  

The contract in Table 6.2 could be used as a hedge if LIBOR-based payments were. due to be received on a principal of. $\$1$ million for the three-month period starting on September 14, 2020. The contract locks in a LIBOR rate of $100\textrm{--}99.720$ , or $0.28\%$ per year. The LIBOR rate on September 14, 2020, in Table 6.2 proves to be. $100\mathrm{~-~}99.810$ or $0.19\%$ per year. The interest received will be. $0.25\times0.0019\times\S1\mathrm{,000,000}=\S475$ When the $\$23$ gain on the contract is taken into account, the amount received is. $\$700$ which corresponds to a LIBOR rate of. $0.28\%$ $(0.25\times0.0028\times\S1.000,000=\S700)$ The hedge works well, but it should be noted that it is not perfect. One reason is that the futures contract is settled daily rather than all at the end. The other is that settlement is on September 14, 2020, while interest is paid three months later.2.

# SOFR Futures  

Table 6.1 shows futures quotes for one-month and three-month SOFR futures. The one-month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the federal. funds rate futures contract. The settlement at the end of a contract month equals 100 minus the arithmetic average of SOFR one-day rates during the month (with rates on a weekend or a holiday being assumed to be the same as the rate on the most recent business day). It can be seen that the May 2020 contract still traded on May 21, 2020, even though the rate on about two thirds of the days in the month had already been observed. The settlement futures rate implied by the May, June, and July futures. contracts are $0.0475\%$ $0.055\%$ and $0.55\%$ , respectively. The rates implied by the corresponding federal funds futures contracts are similar. (In theory, they should be slightly higher because the federal funds rate is an unsecured rate while SOFR is secured, but in practice the difference is so small that it is not noticeable in the quotes.) A one-month SOFR contract is designed to hedge a $\$5,000,000$ position. In this respect, it is similar to the federal funds rate contract. When the rate implied by the contract changes by one basis point, the gain or loss per contract is $\$41.67$ . (This is consistent with the $\$5,000,000$ size because $\$000,00000$ Contracts trade for the 13 months following the current month.  

The three-month SOFR futures contract is designed to be as similar as possible to the Eurodollar futures contract. The settlement is on the third Wednesday of a month. It equals 100 minus the result of compounding one-day SOFR rates over the previous three months in the way described in Section 4.2. The contract month specified in Table 6.1 is the beginning of the three-month period. The delivery month is three months later. The June 2020 contract was therefore settled on September 16, 2020. The settlement price equaled $100-R$ where $R$ is the rate obtained by compounding the one-day SOFR rates observed on days between June 17, 2020, and September 15, 2020. (The rate observed on the final day of the period is not included in the compounding calculation.)  

Three-month SOFR futures trade for the contract months of March, June, September, and December. Perhaps optimistically, the CME offers a total of 39 contract. months so that traders can hedge or speculate on SOFR rates as far in the future as. 10 years. The contract is designed to hedge a. $\$1$ million position (similarly to the. Eurodollar futures contract). When the quote changes by one basis point, the gain or. loss per contract is $\$25$ . Three-month SOFR futures and Eurodollar futures contracts. are therefore structurally very similar. The main difference is that the Eurodollar futures. contract is settled at the beginning of the three-month period to which the rate applies. whereas the three-moth SOFR futures contract is settled at the end of the three-month period (after all the underlying one-day rates have been observed)..  

# Example 6.3  

Suppose that on May 21, 2020, an investor has agreed to pay the three-month SOFR rate plus 200 basis points on $\$100$ million of borrowings for three months.  

beginning on December 16, 2021. From Table 6.1, the December 2021 three-. month SOFR futures is 99.990. The futures markets are therefore indicating a. SOFR rate of only $0.01\%$ (one basis point) for the period of the borrowings. The investor thinks that rates may increase and so would like to use futures to lock in a borrowing rate of $2.01\%$ . The investor can do this by shorting 100 December contracts. If rates increase, the futures quote will decline and there will be a gain to compensate for the extra interest paid; if rates decrease, the quote will increase. and there will be a loss on the futures, but this will be compensated for by less. interest being paid.  

For example, suppose that the final settlement proves to be 99.200, which corresponds to a rate of $0.8\%$ per annum. The rate paid on the loan would then. be $2.8\%$ per annum and the total interest would be. $0.25\times\S100,000,000\times0.028$ $=\$700,000$ However, the futures contract has declined by 79 basis points (from 99.990 to 99.200). The gain is $\$25$ per basis point or $100\times\mathbb{8}25\times79=\mathbb{\mathbb{8}}197{,}500$ on 100 contracts. When this is taken into account, the amount paid is $\$700,000$ which corresponds to a rate of. $2.01\%$ (that is, $\$02,500=0.25\times\S100,000,000\times0.0201$  

On May 21, 2020, negative SOFR rates were considered a possibility. (The Federal Reserve Board was taking steps to stimulate the economy by reducing interest rates following the Covid-19 crisis and the interest rates in some other countries were negative.) Suppose that the final settlement is 100.400. The SOFR rate applicable to the borrowings is then $-0.4\%$ and the investor will pay. $2\%-0.4\%=1.6\%$ The interest payment will be. $0.25\times\S100,000,000\times0.016$ $=\$400,000$ However, the futures contract has increased by 41 basis points, leading to a loss of. $100\times\mathbb{S}25\times41=\mathbb{S}102{\cdot}250$ and bringing the total payment to. $\$502,250$ , as before.  

# Convexity Adjustments  

In Chapter 5 we argued that for most contracts it is not necessary to distinguish. between futures and forward prices because the two are very similar. When the futures. contracts we have just considered last longer than about two years, it does become important to distinguish between futures and forward. What is termed a convexity. adjustment is made so that  

$$
\mathrm{ForwardRate}=\mathrm{FuturesRate}-c
$$  

where $c$ is the convexity adjustment.  

One reason for the convexity adjustment is daily settlement. Consider two traders.. Trader A has entered into a futures contract where there will be a gain if rates increase. and a loss if rates decrease. (Trader A could be the investor in Example 6.3.) Trader B. has entered into a similar forward contract. The contracts are the same except that. Trader A's contract is settled daily, while Trader B's contract is settled at the end of its life. The daily settlement will tend to favor Trader A. When rates increase, Trader A. makes an immediate gain and, because rates have just increased, the gain will tend to be invested at a relatively high interest rate. When rates decrease, Trader A takes an. immediate loss but because rates have just decreased this will tend to be financed at. a relatively low rate. To put this another way, Trader A will tend to have more funds in his or her margin account when rates are high than when rates are low. Trader B, who has entered into an FRA does not benefit from day-to-day changes in rates in this way. To compensate for this, Trader B's forward quote should be more attractive than Trader A's futures quote. In this case, a more attractive quote corresponds to a lower forward rate, so that we should expect to see a positive value for the convexity adjustment, c.  

In the case of Eurodollar futures contracts, there is another consideration. The futures contracts are settled at the beginning of the time period to which the rate applies. In an FRA, as explained in Section 4.9,settlement reflects the fact the interest is normally paid at the end of a period rather than the beginning. Consider again Trader A and Trader B who will gain if rates increase and lose if rates decrease. When rates prove to be high, the impact of delaying settlement on the value of Trader B's gain is relatively high. When rates prove to be low, the impact of delaying settlement on Trader B's loss is relatively low. As a result, the difference in the timing of the settlement favors Trader A and, like daily settlement, leads to forward rates being lower than futures rates.  

The convexity adjustment,. $c$ , is therefore positive. It increases as the life of the. contract increases and the volatility of interest rates increase.  

# Calculating Zero Curves  

Futures contracts (with the convexity adjustments we have just mentioned being applied as appropriate) can be used to provide estimates of forward interest rates. These can. then be used to determine zero rates. From equation (4.5) the forward rate applicable to the period between times $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ is  

$$
R_{F}=\frac{R_{2}T_{2}-R_{1}T_{1}}{T_{2}-T_{1}}
$$  

where $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$ are the zero rates for maturities. $T_{1}$ and $T_{2}$ , respectively. (All rates are assumed be continuously compounded.) It follows from this that  

$$
R_{2}=\frac{R_{F}(T_{2}-T_{1})+R_{1}T_{1}}{T_{2}}
$$  

This equation can be used to bootstrap LIBOR or SOFR zero curves.  

Consider first LIBOR. Its zero curve is known for maturities up to one year. (providing banks continue to provide submissions estimating their borrowing rates). Equation (6.2) can be used extend this zero curve, as we will now show..  

# Example 6.4  

A 300-day LIBOR zero rate has been calculated (using interpolation between the 6-month and 12-month rate) as $2.80\%$ with continuous compounding. From Eurodollar futures quotes, it has been calculated that (a) the forward rate for a. 90-day period beginning in 300 days is. $3.30\%$ with continuous compounding, (b) the forward rate for a 90-day period beginning in 391 days is $3.50\%$ with continuous compounding, and (c) the forward rate for the 90-day period beginning in 489 days is $3.60\%$ with continuous compounding. We can use equation (6.2) to obtain the 391 rate as  

$$
\frac{0.033\times91+0.028\times300}{391}=0.02916
$$  

or $2.916\%$ . Similarly we can use the second forward rate to determine to 489-day rate as  

$$
{\frac{0.035\times98+0.02916\times391}{489}}=0.03033
$$  

or $3.033\%$ . The next forward rate would be used to extend the zero curve for a further three months, and so on. Note that even though the the rate underlying the Eurodollar futures contract is a 90-day rate, it is assumed to apply to the 91 or 98 days between contract maturities to facilitate the bootstrapping.  

Determining short-maturity SOFR rates requires a little more work. We illustrate this vith another example.  

# Example 6.5  

It is October and the current three-month SOFR futures contract has two months until the December delivery date. Suppose further that compounding the over-. night rates (already observed) for the first month of the contract gives a rate of. $2\%$ per year and that the futures quote gives a rate for the whole three-month period of $2.5\%$ per year. If all rates are expressed with continuous compounding, the. implied zero rate, $R$ , for the next two months is given by solving.  

$$
0.02\times(1/12)+R\times(2/12)=0.025\times(3/12)
$$  

It is 0.0275, or $2.75\%$ . The forward rate calculated from the contract covering the December to March period can be used in conjunction with this estimate and equation (6.2) to obtain the 5-month zero rate as in Example 6.4. The contract covering the March to June period can similarly determine the 8-month zero rate, and so on.
