# 15.10 WARRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS  

The exercise of a regular call option on a company has no effect on the number of the company's shares outstanding. If the writer of the option does not own the company's shares, he or she must buy them in the market in the usual way and then sell them to the option holder for the strike price. As explained in Chapter 10, warrants and employee stock options are different from regular call options in that exercise leads to the company issuing more shares and then selling them to the option holder for the strike price. As the strike price is less than the market price, this dilutes the interest of the existing shareholders.  

How should potential dilution affect the way we value outstanding warrants and employee stock options? The answer is that it should not! Assuming markets are efficient the stock price will reflect potential dilution from all outstanding warrants and employee stock options. This is explained in Business Snapshot 15.3.9  

Consider next the situation a company is in when it is contemplating a new issue of warrants (or employee stock options). We suppose that the company is interested in calculating the cost of the issue assuming that there are no compensating benefits. We assume that the company has. $N$ shares worth $S_{0}$ each and the number of new options contemplated is $M$ , with each option giving the holder the right to buy one share for $K$ The value of the company today is. $N S_{0}$ . This value does not change as a result of the warrant issue. Suppose that without the warrant issue the share price will be $S_{T}$ at the warrant's maturity. This means that (with or without the warrant issue) the total value of the equity and the warrants at time. $T$ will $N S_{T}.$ If the warrants are exercised, there is a. cash inflow from the strike price increasing this to $N S_{T}+M K$ This value is distributed  

# Business Snapshot 15.3 Warrants, Employee Stock Options, and Dilution  

Consider a company with 100,000 shares each worth $\$50.$ It surprises the market with an announcement that it is granting 100,000 stock options to its employees with a strike price of. $\$50$ . If the market sees little benefit to the shareholders from the. employee stock options in the form of reduced salaries and more highly motivated. managers, the stock price will decline immediately after the announcement of the. employee stock options. If the stock price declines to. $\$45$ , the dilution cost to the current shareholders is $\$5$ per share or $\$500,000$ in total.  

Suppose that the company does well so that by the end of three years the share price is $\$100$ . Suppose further that all the options are exercised at this point. The. payoff to the employees is. $\$50$ per option. It is tempting to argue that there will be. further dilution in that 100,000 shares worth. $\$100$ per share are now merged with 100,000 shares for which only. $\$50$ is paid, so that (a) the share price reduces to. $\$75$ and (b) the payoff to the option holders is only. $\$25$ per option. However, this. argument is flawed. The exercise of the options is anticipated by the market and already reflected in the share price. The payoff from each option exercised is $\$50$  

This example illustrates the general point that when markets are efficient the impact of dilution from executive stock options or warrants is reflected in the stock price as soon as they are announced and does not need to be taken into account again when the options are valued.  

among $N+M$ shares, so that the share price immediately after exercise becomes  

$$
\frac{N S_{T}+M K}{N+M}
$$  

Therefore the payoff to an option holder if the option is exercised is  

$$
\frac{N S_{T}+M K}{N+M}-K
$$  

or  

$$
{\frac{N}{N+M}}\left(S_{T}-K\right)
$$  

This shows that the value of each option is the value of  

$$
\frac{N}{N+M}
$$  

regular call options on the company's stock. Therefore the total cost of the options is.   
$M$ times this. Since we are assuming that there are no benefits to the company from the.   
warrant issue, the total value of the company's equity will decline by the total cost of.   
the options as soon as the decision to issue the warrants becomes generally known. This means that the reduction in the stock price is.  

$$
\frac{M}{N+M}
$$  

times the value of a regular call option with strike price $K$ and maturity $T$  

# Example 15.7  

A company with 1 million shares worth $\$40$ each is considering issuing 200,000 warrants each giving the holder the right to buy one share with a strike price of $\$60$ in 5 years. It wants to know the cost of this. The interest rate is $3\%$ per annum, and the volatility is $30\%$ per annum. The company pays no dividends. From equation (15.20), the value of a 5-year European call option on the stock is $\$7.04$ . In this case, $N=1,000,000$ and $M=200{,}000$ , so that the value of each warrant is  

$$
\frac{1,000,000}{1,000,000+200,000}\times7.04=5.87
$$  

or $\$5.87$ . The total cost of the warrant issue is $200{,}000\times5{.}87=\S1{.}17$ million. Assuming the market perceives no benefits from the warrant issue, we expect the stock price to decline by. $\$1.17$ to $\$38.83$
