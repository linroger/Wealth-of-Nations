# 15.2  THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATE OF RETURN  

The lognormal property of stock prices can be used to provide information on the probability distribution of the continuously compounded rate of return earned on a stock between times 0 and $T.$ If we define the continuously compounded rate of return per annum realized between times 0 and $T$ as $x$ , then  

$$
S_{T}=S_{0}e^{x T}
$$  

so that  

$$
x=\frac{1}{T}\mathrm{ln}\frac{S_{T}}{S_{0}}
$$  

From equation (15.2), it follows that  

$$
x\sim\phi\bigg(\mu-{\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}},{\frac{\sigma^{2}}{T}}\bigg)
$$  

Thus, the continuously compounded rate of return per annum is normally distributed with mean. $\mu-\sigma^{2}/2$ and standard deviation $\sigma/{\bar{\sqrt{T}}}$ As $T$ increases, the standard deviation of. $x$ declines. To understand the reason for this, consider two cases:. $T=1$ and $T=20.$ We are more certain about the average return per year over 20 years than. we are about the return in any one year..  

# Example 15.3  

Consider a stock with an expected return of. $17\%$ per annum and a volatility of. $20\%$ per annum. The probability distribution for the average rate of return (continuously compounded) realized over 3 years is normal, with mean  

$$
0.17-{\frac{0.2^{2}}{2}}=0.15
$$  

or $15\%$ per annum, and standard deviation  

$$
\sqrt{\frac{0.2^{2}}{3}}=0.1155
$$  

or $11.55\%$ per annum. Because there is a $95\%$ chance that a normally distributed variable will lie within 1.96 standard deviations of its mean, we can be $95\%$ confident that the average continuously compounded return realized over 3 years will be between. $15-1.96\times11.55=-7.6\%$ and $15+1.96\times11.55=+37.6\%$ per annum.
