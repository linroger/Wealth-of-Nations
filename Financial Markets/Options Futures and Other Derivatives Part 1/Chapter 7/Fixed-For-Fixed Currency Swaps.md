# 7.8 FIXED-FOR-FIXED CURRENCY SWAPS  

Another popular type of swap is a fixed-for-fixed currency swap. This involves exchang-. ing principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in one currency for principal and interest payments at a fixed rate in another currency..  

A currency swap agreement requires the principal to be specified in each of the two currencies. The principal amounts in each currency are usually exchanged at the beginning and at the end of the life of the swap. Usually the principal amounts are chosen to be approximately equivalent using the exchange rate at the swap's initiation. But when they are exchanged at the end of the life of the swap, their values may be quite different.  

# Ilustration  

Consider a hypothetical five-year currency swap agreement between British Petroleum and Barclays entered into on February 1, 2022. We suppose that British Petroleum pays a fixed rate of interest of $3\%$ in dollars to Barclays and receives a fixed rate of interest of  

Figure 7.10 A currency swap.

$4\%$ in British pounds (sterling) from Barclays. Interest rate payments are made once a. year and the principal amounts are. $\$15$ million and 10 million. This is termed a fixedfor-fixed currency swap because the interest rate in both currencies is fixed. The swap is. shown in Figure 7.10. Initially, the principal amounts flow in the opposite direction to. the arrows in Figure 7.10. The interest payments during the life of the swap and the final principal payment flow in the same direction as the arrows. Thus, at the outset of the swap, British Petroleum pays. $\pounds10$ million and receives $\$15$ million. Each year during the. life of the swap contract, British Petroleum receives $\pounds0.40$ million $(=4\%$ of f10 million) and pays $\$0.45$ million ( $(=3\%$ of $\$15$ million). At the end of the life of the swap, it pays $\$15$ million and receives 10 million. These cash flows are shown in Table 7.6. The cash flows to Barclays are the opposite to those shown..  

# Use of a Currency Swap to Transform Liabilities and Assets  

A swap such as the one just considered can be used to transform borrowings in one. currency to borrowings in another currency. Suppose that British Petroleum can borrow. f10 million at $4\%$ interest. The swap has the effect of transforming this loan into one where it has borrowed $\$15$ million at $3\%$ interest. The initial exchange of principal. converts the amount borrowed from sterling to dollars. The subsequent exchanges in. the swap have the effect of swapping the interest and principal payments from sterling to dollars.  

The swap can also be used to transform the nature of assets. Suppose that British Petroleum can invest $\$15$ million to earn $3\%$ in U.S. dollars for the next five years, but feels that sterling will strengthen (or at least not depreciate) against the dollar and prefers a U.K.-denominated investment. The swap has the effect of transforming the U.S. investment into a 10 million investment in the U.K. yielding $4\%$

# Comparative Advantage  

Currency swaps can be motivated by comparative advantage. To illustrate this, we consider another hypothetical example. Suppose the five-year fixed-rate borrowing costs. to General Electric and Qantas Airways in U.S. dollars (UsD) and Australian dollars (AUD) are as shown in Table 7.7. The data in the table suggest that Australian rates are higher than U.S. interest rates. Also, General Electric is more creditworthy than Qantas Airways, because it is offered a more favorable rate of interest in both currencies. From the viewpoint of a swap trader, the interesting aspect of Table 7.7 is that the spreads. between the rates paid by General Electric and Qantas Airways in the two markets are not the same. Qantas Airways pays $2\%$ more than General Electric in the USD market and only $0.4\%$ more than General Electric in the AUD market.  

This situation is analogous to that in Table 7.5. General Electric has a comparative advantage in the UsD market, whereas Qantas Airways has a comparative advantage in the AUD market. In Table 7.5, where a plain vanilla interest rate swap was considered, we argued that comparative advantages are largely illusory. Here we are. comparing the rates offered in two different currencies, and it is more likely that the comparative advantages are genuine. One possible source of comparative advantage is tax. General Electric's position might be such that UsD borrowings lead to lower taxes on its worldwide income than AUD borrowings. Qantas Airways' position might be the reverse. (Note that we assume that the interest rates in Table 7.7 have been adjusted to reflect these types of tax advantages.)  

We suppose that General Electric wants to borrow 20 million AUD and Qantas. Airways wants to borrow 15 million USD and that the current exchange rate (USD per AUD) is 0.7500. This creates a perfect situation for a currency swap. General Electric. and Qantas Airways each borrow in the market where they have a comparative advantage; that is, General Electric borrows UsD whereas Qantas Airways borrows AUD. They then use a currency swap to transform General Electric's loan into a AUD loan and Qantas Airways' loan into a UsD loan..  

As already mentioned, the difference between the dollar interest rates is $2\%$ , whereas the difference between the AUD interest rates is $0.4\%$ . By analogy with the interest rate swap case, we expect the total gain to all parties to be $2.0-0.4=1.6\%$ per annum.  

There are many ways in which the swap can be arranged. Figure 7.11 shows one way a swap might be brokered by a financial institution. General Electric borrows USD and Qantas Airways borrows AUD. The effect of the swap is to transform the USD interest rate of. $5\%$ per annum to an AUD interest rate of $6.9\%$ per annum for. General Electric. As a result, General Electric is $0.7\%$ per annum better off than it would be if it went directly to AUD markets. Similarly, Qantas exchanges an AUD loan at $8\%$ per annum for a UsD loan at $6.3\%$ per annum and ends up $0.7\%$ per annum better off than it would be if it went directly to USD markets. The financial institution gains $1.3\%$ per annum on its USD cash flows and loses $1.1\%$ per annum on its AUD flows. If we ignore the difference between the two currencies, the financial institution makes a net gain of. $0.2\%$ per annum. As predicted, the total gain to all parties is $1.6\%$ per annum.

Figure 7.13Alternative arrangement for currency swap: General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk.  

Each year the financial institution makes a gain of UsD 195,000 $(=1.3\%$ of 15 million) and incurs a loss of AUD 220,000 $(=1.1\%$ of 20 million). The financial institution can avoid any foreign exchange risk by buying AUD 220,000 per annum in the forward market for each year of the life of the swap, thus locking in a net gain in USD.  

It is possible to redesign the swap so that the financial institution does not need to. hedge. Figures 7.12 and 7.13 present two alternatives. These alternatives are unlikely to. be used in practice because they do not lead to General Electric and Qantas being free of foreign exchange risk. In Figure 7.12, Qantas bears some foreign exchange risk because. it pays $1.1\%$ per annum in AUD and pays $5.2\%$ per annum in USD. In Figure 7.13, General Electric bears some foreign exchange risk because it receives. $1.1\%$ per annum in USD and pays $8\%$ per annum in AUD.
