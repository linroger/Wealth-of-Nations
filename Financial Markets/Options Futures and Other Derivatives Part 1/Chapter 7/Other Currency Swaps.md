# 7.10 OTHER CURRENCY SWAPS  

Two other popular currency swaps are:  

1. Fixed-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a fixed interest rate in another currency   
2. Floating-for-floating where a floating interest rate in one currency is exchanged for a floating interest rate in another currency.  

An example of the first type of swap would be an exchange where a floating rate on a principal of 7 million is paid and $3\%$ on a principal of $\$10$ million is received with payments being made semiannually for 10 years. Similarly to a fixed-for-fixed currency swap, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap's life. A fixed-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-for-fixed currency swap and a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where $3\%$ on a principal of $\$10$ million is received and (say) $4\%$ on a principal of 7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where $4\%$ is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of 7 million.  

To value the swap we are considering we can calculate the value of the dollar payments in dollars by discounting them at the dollar risk-free rate. We can calculate the value of the sterling payments by assuming that floating forward rates will be. realized and discounting the cash flows at the sterling risk-free rate. The value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.  

An example of the second type of swap would be the exchange where floating on a principal of 7 million is paid and floating on a principal of $\$10$ million is received. As in the other cases we have considered, this would involve an initial exchange of principal in the opposite direction to the interest payments and a final exchange of principal in the same direction as the interest payments at the end of the swap's life. A floating-for-floating swap can be regarded as a portfolio consisting of a fixed-forfixed currency swap and two interest rate swaps, one in each currency. For instance, the swap in our example can be regarded as (a) a swap where $3\%$ on a principal of $\$10$ million is received and $4\%$ on a principal of 7 million is paid plus (b) an interest rate swap where $4\%$ is received and floating is paid on a notional principal of $\pounds7$ million plus (c) an interest rate swap where $3\%$ is paid and floating is received on a notional principal of $\$10$ million.  

A floating-for-floating swap can be valued by assuming that forward interest rates in each currency will be realized and discounting the cash flows at risk-free rates. The value of the swap is the difference between the values of the two sets of payments using current exchange rates.
