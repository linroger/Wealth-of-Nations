# 7.1 MECHANICS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS  

An interest rate swap is a swap where interest at a predetermined fixed rate, applied to a certain principal, is exchanged for interest at a floating reference rate, applied to the same principal, with regular exchanges being made for an agreed period of time. Historically, the most common floating reference interest rate in an interest rate swap.  

has been LIBOR. For example, a swap negotiated in the past might be an agreement to.   
exchange interest at $2\%$ on a principal of $\$50$ million for interest at three-month LIBOR.   
on the same principal for the next five years with exchanges every three months.  

As explained in Chapter 4, LIBOR has proved to be an unsatisfactory reference rate. because it is based on estimates made by banks, not on actual transactions. The plan in financial markets is to phase out the use of LIBOR and replace it by a reference rate based on overnight transactions between banks. The transition period will be tricky for the swaps market. Many LIBOR-for-fixed swaps have been negotiated in the past with long lives and will continue to be in existence after the use of LIBOR has been discontinued. For example, a 20-year swap negotiated at the end of 2013 will still have 12 years to run at the end of 2021 (which was the original date chosen for the end of LIBOR). If banks. stop providing LIBOR estimates after the end of 2021,it will be necessary for the market to agree on a way of estimating LIBOR from the new reference rates. For example, threemonth U.S. LIBOR is likely to be estimated as three-month SOFR plus. $x$ , where $x$ is some average of the difference between the two rates observed in the past..  

At this point,it is worth reviewing the differences between LIBOR and the overnight reference rates that are replacing it:  

. LIBOR rates are the borrowing rates estimated by banks in the interbank market for periods between one day and one year..   
Overnight rates such as SOFR and SONIA are based on actual transactions between banks.   
The overnight rates are converted to longer reference rates using what might be termed an "averaging process.' Usually the averaging involves daily compounding as described in Section 4.2, but occasionally a simple arithmetic average is used (as for CME's one-month SOFR futures).   
LIBOR rates for a period are known at the beginning of the period to which they apply, whereas the result of the averaging process for overnight rates is known only at the end of the period..   
LIBOR rates incorporate some credit risk, whereas rates based on overnight rates such as SOFR and SONIA are considered to be risk-free rates.  

As LIBOR is phased out, swaps based on overnight rates are becoming more popular These are referred to as overnight indexed swaps (OISs).  

An OIS is an agreement to exchange a fixed rate of interest for a reference rate of. interest that is calculated from realized overnight rates. A simple example of an OIS is a swap lasting for three months. This leads to a single exchange at the end of the three months. The fixed rate of interest applied to a certain principal is exchanged for the. reference rate applied to the same principal. Other similar OISs that last for one month, six months, and one year lead to a single exchange calculated in a similar way. When the life of the OIS is greater than one year, it is typically divided into three-month. subperiods, with the fixed rate being exchanged at the end of each three-month period for the three-month reference rate that is calculated for that period from one-day rates. OISs lasting ten years or longer are now traded..  

Consider a hypothetical two-year OIS initiated on March 8, 2022, between Apple and Citigroup. We suppose Apple agrees to pay to Citigroup interest at the rate of $3\%$ per annum every three months on a notional principal of $\$100$ million, and in return Citgroup agrees to pay Apple the three-month SOFR floating reference rate on the same notional principal. Apple is the fixed-rate payer; Citigroup is the floating-rate payer. For ease of exposition, we assume that rates are quoted with quarterly compounding and we ignore the impact of day count conventions and holiday conventions (which are explained later in this chapter). The swap is shown in Figure 7.1.

In total there are eight exchanges on the swap. One possible outcome is shown in Table 7.1. The first exchange of payments would take place on June 8, 2022. Apple. would pay Citigroup $\$750,000$ (one quarter of $3\%$ applied to $\$100$ million). Citigroup would pay Apple the three-month rate calculated from daily SOFR rates over the previous three months. The 3-month SOFR rate calculated on June 8, 2022 (from overnight rates between March 8, 2022, and June 8, 2022) is assumed to be. $2.2\%$ per annum or $0.55\%$ per three months using the formula in Section 4.2. The floating payment from Citigroup to Apple is therefore $\$550,000$ . The fixed and floating payments are netted with the result that Apple pays Citigroup. $\$200,000$ on June 8, 2022. The second exchange of payments is on September 8, 2022. Again, the fixed payment. from Apple to Citigroup is $\$750,000$ . We assume that the 3-month SOFR rate on September 8, 2022 (calculated from overnight rates between June 8, 2022 and September 8, 2022) is $2.6\%$ per annum or $0.65\%$ per three months. The floating payment is therefore $\$650,000$ and the net payment from Apple to Citigroup is therefore $\$100,000$  

What is the difference between an OIS and a LIBOR swap? If the heading of the second column in Table 7.1 is changed to "LIBOR rate" the table could provide an example of a LIBOR swap. The difference is that the LIBOR rate for a period is known at the beginning of the period, whereas the overnight reference rate is not known until the end of the period. The $2.20\%$ floating rate applicable to the first exchange on June 8, 2002, if LIBOR, would be known at the beginning of the swap's life on March 8, 2022; the $2.60\%$ floating rate applicable to the second exchange on September 8, 2022, would be known on June 8, 2022; and so on.  

Table 7.1 Cash flows to Apple for one possible outcome of the OIS in Figure 7.1. The swap lasts two years and the notional principal is $\$100$ million.
