# 7.5 THE COMPARATIVE-ADVANTAGE ARGUMENT  

An explanation commonly put forward to explain the popularity of swaps concerns comparative advantages. In this context, a comparative advantage is advantage that leads to company being treated more favorably in one debt market than in another debt market. Consider the use of an interest rate swap to transform a liability. Some companies, it is argued, have a comparative advantage when borrowing in fixed-rate markets, whereas other companies have a comparative advantage when borrowing in. floating-rate markets. To obtain a new loan, it makes sense for a company to go to the market where it has a comparative advantage. As a result, the company may borrow fixed when it wants floating, or borrow floating when it wants fixed. The swap is used to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan, and vice versa.  

# Hlustration  

Suppose that two companies,AAACorp and BBBCorp, both wish to borrow $\$10$ million for five years and have been offered the rates shown in Table 7.5. AAACorp has a AAA credit rating; BBBCorp has a BBB credit rating.' We assume that BBBCorp wants to borrow at a fixed rate of interest, whereas AAACorp wants to borrow at a floating rate. Since BBBCorp has a worse credit rating than AAACorp,it pays a higher rate of interest in both fixed and floating markets.  

A key feature of the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp is that the difference between the two fixed rates is greater than that between the two floating rates. BBBCorp pays $1.2\%$ more than AAACorp in fixed-rate markets and only $0.7\%$ more than AAACorp in floating-rate markets. BBBCorp appears to have a comparative advantage in floating-rate markets, whereas AAACorp appears to have a comparative advantage in fixed-rate markets.4 It is this apparent anomaly that can lead to a swap being negotiated.. AAACorp borrows fixed-rate funds at. $4\%$ per annum. BBBCorp borrows funds at. floating plus $0.6\%$ per annum. They then enter into a swap agreement to ensure that. AAACorp ends up with floating-rate funds and BBBCorp with fixed-rate funds.  

To understand how the swap might work, we first assume (somewhat unrealistically) that AAACorp and BBBCorp get in touch with each other directly. The sort of swap.  

Table 7.5 Borrowing rates that provide a basis for the comparative-advantage argument. "Floating" is the floating reference rate.

they might negotiate is shown in Figure 7.7. AAACorp agrees to pay BBBCorp interest at a floating reference rate on $\$10$ million. In return, BBBCorp agrees to pay AAACorp. interest at a fixed rate of $4.35\%$ per annum on $\$10$ million.  

AAACorp has three sets of interest rate cash flows:  

1. It pays $4\%$ per annum to outside lenders.   
2. It receives $4.35\%$ per annum from BBBCorp.   
3. It pays floating to BBBCorp.  

The net effect of the three cash flows is that AAACorp pays floating minus $0.35\%$ per annum. This is $0.25\%$ per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to floatingrate markets.  

BBBCorp also has three sets of interest rate cash flows:  

1. It pays floating. $+0.6\%$ per annum to outside lenders.   
2. It receives floating from AAACorp.   
3. It pays $4.35\%$ per annum to AAACorp.  

The net effect of the three cash flows is that BBBCorp pays. $4.95\%$ per annum. This is.   
$0.25\%$ per annum less than it would pay if it went directly to fixed-rate markets.  

In this example, the swap has been structured so that the net gain to both sides is the same, $0.25\%$ . This need not be the case. However, the total apparent gain from this type of interest rate swap arrangement is always $a-b$ , where $a$ is the difference between the interest rates facing the two companies in fixed-rate markets, and $^b$ is the difference between the interest rates facing the two companies in floating-rate markets. In this case, $a=1.2\%$ and $b=0.7\%$ , so that the total gain is $0.5\%$  

If the transaction between AAACorp and BBBCorp were brokered by a financial. institution, an arrangement such as that shown in Figure 7.8 might result. In this case, AAACorp ends up borrowing at floating -. $0.33\%$ , BBBCorp ends up borrowing at $4.97\%$ , and the financial institution earns a spread of four basis points per year. The. gain to AAACorp is. $0.23\%$ ; the gain to BBBCorp is $0.23\%$ ; and the gain to the. financial institution is. $0.04\%$ . The total gain to all three parties is. $0.5\%$ as before.

# Criticism of the Comparative-Advantage Argument  

The comparative-advantage argument we have just outlined for explaining the attractiveness of interest rate swaps is open to question. Why in Table 7.5 should the spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp be different in fixed and floating markets? Now that the interest rate swap market has been in existence for a long time, we might reasonably expect these types of differences to have been arbitraged away.  

The reason that spread differentials appear to exist is due to the nature of the contracts available to companies in fixed and floating markets. Suppose that the. floating reference rate is a three-month rate. The $4.0\%$ and $5.2\%$ rates available to AAACorp and BBBCorp in fixed-rate markets are five-year rates (for example, the rates at which the companies can issue five-year fixed-rate bonds). The rates offered in floating-rate markets are three-month rates. In the floating-rate market, the lender usually has the opportunity to review the spread above the floating reference rate every. time rates are reset. (In our example, rates are reset quarterly.) If the creditworthiness of AAACorp or BBBCorp has declined, the lender has the option of increasing the spread over the floating reference rate that is charged. In extreme circumstances, the lender can refuse to continue the loan. The providers of fixed-rate financing do not have the option. to change the terms of the loan in this way.  

The spreads between the rates offered to AAACorp and BBBCorp are a reflection of the extent to which BBBCorp is more likely to default than AAACorp. During the next three months, there is very little chance that either AAACorp or BBBCorp will default. As we look further ahead, default statistics show that on average the probability of a default by a company with a BBB credit rating increases faster than the probability of a default by a company with a AAA credit rating. This is why the spread between the five-year rates is greater than the spread between the three-month floating rates.  

After negotiating a loan at floating $+~0.6\%$ and entering into the swap shown in Figure 7.8, BBBCorp appears to obtain a fixed-rate loan at $4.97\%$ . The arguments just presented show that this is not really the case. In practice, the rate paid is $4.97\%$ only if BBBCorp can continue to borrow floating-rate funds at a spread of $0.6\%$ over the floating reference rate. If, for example, the credit rating of BBBCorp declines so that the floating-rate loan is rolled over at floating $+1.6\%$ , the rate paid by BBBCorp increases to $5.97\%$ . The market expects that BBBCorp's spread over the floating reference rate will on average rise during the swap's life. BBBCorp's expected average borrowing rate when it enters into the swap is therefore greater than $4.97\%$  

The swap in Figure 7.8 locks in $0.33\%$ below the floating reference rate for AAACorp for the next five years, not just for the next three months. This appears to be a good deal for AAACorp. The downside is that unless collateral is posted it is bearing the risk of a default by the financial institution. If it borrowed floating-rate funds in the usual way,it would not be bearing this risk.
