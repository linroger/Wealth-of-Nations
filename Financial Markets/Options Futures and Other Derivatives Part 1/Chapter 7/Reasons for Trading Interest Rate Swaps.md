# 7.3 REASONS FOR TRADING INTEREST RATE SWAPS  

Swaps have proved to be very popular because they have many uses, as we will now. explain. Most of the discussion of interest rate swaps in the next few sections applies. regardless of the floating reference rate used. For ease of exposition we will therefore simply refer to the floating rate as "floating.'.  

# Using the Swap to Transform a Liability  

For Apple, the swap in Figure 7.1 could be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate loan, as indicated in Figure 7.3. Suppose that Apple has arranged to borrow $\$100$ million for two years at the floating rate plus 10 basis points. (One basis point is.

Figure 7.3 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings.  

$0.01\%$ , so the rate is floating plus $0.1\%$ .) After Apple has entered into the swap, it has three sets of cash flows:  

1. It pays floating plus $0.1\%$ to its outside lenders.   
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.   
3. It pays $3\%$ under the terms of the swap.  

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of $3.1\%$ . Thus, for Apple the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at the floating rate plus 10 basis points into borrowings at a fixed rate of $3.1\%$  

A company wishing to transform a fixed-rate loan into a floating-rate loan would enter into the opposite swap. Suppose that Intel has borrowed $\$100$ million at $3.2\%$ for two years and wishes to switch to the floating rate. Like Apple, it contacts Citigroup. We assume that it agrees to enter into a swap where it pays the floating rate and receives $2.97\%$ . Its position would then be as indicated Figure 7.4. It has three sets of cash flows:  

1. It pays $3.2\%$ to its outside lenders.   
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap.   
3. It receives $2.97\%$ under the terms of the swap.  

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate payment of floating plus $0.23\%$ (or floating plus 23 basis points). Thus, for Intel the swap could have the effect of transforming borrowings at a fixed rate of $3.2\%$ into borrowings at the floating rate plus 23 basis points.  

# Using the Swap to Transform an Asset  

Swaps can also be used to transform the nature of an asset. Consider Apple in our example. The swap in Figure 7.1 could have the effect of transforming an asset earning a fixed rate of interest into an asset earning a floating rate of interest. Suppose that Apple owns $\$100$ million in bonds that will provide interest at $2.7\%$ per annum over the next two years. After Apple has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in Figure 7.5. It has three sets of cash flows:.

Figure 7.5 Apple uses the swap in Figure 7.1 to convert a fixed-rate investment into a floating-rate investment..  

1. It receives $2.7\%$ on the bonds.   
2. It receives floating under the terms of the swap.   
3. It pays $3\%$ under the terms of the swap..  

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of floating minus 30 basis points. The swap has therefore transformed an asset earning $2.7\%$ into an asset earning floating minus 30 basis points.  

Consider next the swap entered into by Intel in Figure 7.4. The swap could have the effect of transforming an asset earning a floating rate of interest into an asset earning a fixed rate of interest. Suppose that Intel has an investment of $\$100$ million that yields floating minus 20 basis points. After it has entered into the swap, it is in the position shown in Figure 7.6. It has three sets of cash flows:  

1. It receives floating minus 20 basis points on its investment.   
2. It pays floating under the terms of the swap..   
3. It receives $2.97\%$ under the terms of the swap..  

These three sets of cash flows net out to an interest rate inflow of $2.77\%$ . Thus, one possible use of the swap for Intel is to transform an asset earning floating minus 20 basis points into an asset earning $2.77\%$
