# 7.11 CREDIT RISK  

When swaps and other derivatives are cleared through a central counterparty there is.   
very little credit risk. As has been explained, standard swap transactions between a.   
nonfinancial corporation and a derivatives dealer can be cleared bilaterally. Both sides are then potentially subject to credit risk. Consider the bilaterally cleared transaction.   
between Intel and Citigroup in Figure 7.4. This would be netted with all other.   
bilaterally cleared derivatives between Intel and Citigroup. If Intel defaults when the.   
net value of the outstanding transactions to Citigroup is greater than the collateral (if.   
any) posted by Intel, Citigroup will incur a loss. Similarly, if Citigroup defaults when.   
the net value of the outstanding transactions to Intel is greater than the collateral (if any) posted by Citigroup, Intel will incur a loss..  

It is important to distinguish between the credit risk and market risk to a financial institution in any contract. The credit risk arises from the possibility that a loss will be incurred because of a default by the counterparty. The market risk arises from the possibility that market variables such as interest rates, equity prices, and exchange rates will move in such a way that the value of a contract to the financial institution becomes negative. Market risks can be hedged by entering into offsetting contracts; credit risks are less easy to hedge.  

One of the more bizarre stories in swap markets is outlined in Business Snapshot 7.2. It concerns a British Local Authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, and shows that, in addition to bearing market risk and credit risk, banks trading swaps also sometimes bear legal risk.
