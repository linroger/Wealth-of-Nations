# 7.13 OTHER TYPES OF SWAPS  

Many other types of swaps are traded. We will discuss some of them in Chapter 34. At this stage we provide an overview.  

# Variations on the Standard Interest Rate Swap  

In fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, the frequency of payments on the two sides can. be different. For example, a three-month floating rate might be exchanged for a sixmonth fixed rate with the first being paid every three months and the second being paid. every six months. Floating rates such as the commercial paper (CP) rate are occasionally used. Sometimes floating-for-floating interest rates swaps (known as basis swaps) are negotiated. For example, the three-month CP rate minus 10 basis points might be. exchanged for an overnight reference rate with both being applied to the same principal. (This deal would allow a company to hedge its exposure when assets and liabilities are. subject to different floating rates.)  

The principal in a swap agreement can be varied throughout the term of the swap to. meet the needs of a counterparty. In an amortizing swap, the principal reduces in a predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to the amortization schedule on a loan.) In a step-up swap, the principal increases in a predetermined way. (This might be designed to correspond to drawdowns on a loan agreement.) Forward swaps. (sometimes referred to as deferred swaps) where the parties do not begin to exchange interest payments until some future date are also sometimes arranged. Sometimes swaps. are negotiated where the principal to which the fixed payments are applied is different from the principal to which the floating payments are applied..  

In a compounding swap, interest on one or both sides is compounded forward to the end of the life of the swap according to preagreed rules and there is only one payment date at the end of the life of the swap. In an accrual swap, the interest on one side of the swap accrues only when the floating reference rate is in a certain range.  

# Quantos  

Sometimes a rate observed in one currency is applied to a principal amount in another currency. One such deal would be where a U.S. floating rate is exchanged for a U.K. floating rate with both principals being applied to a principal of 10 million British pounds. This type of swap is referred to as a diff swap or a quanto.  

# Equity Swaps  

An equity swap is an agreement to exchange the total return (dividends and capital gains) realized on an equity index for either a fixed or a floating rate of interest. For example, the total return on the S&P 500 in successive six-month periods might be exchanged for $3\%$ with both being applied to the same principal. Equity swaps can be used by portfolio managers to convert returns from a fixed or floating investment to the returns from investing in an equity index, and vice versa.  

# Options  

Sometimes there are options embedded in a swap agreement. For example, in an.   
extendable swap, one party has the option to extend the life of the swap beyond the.   
specified period. In a puttable swap, one party has the option to terminate the swap.   
early. Options on swaps, or swaptions, are also available. These provide one party with.   
the right at a future time to enter into a swap where a predetermined fixed rate is exchanged for floating.  

# Commodity, Volatility, and Other Swaps  

Commodity swaps are in essence a series of forward contracts on a commodity with different maturity dates and the same delivery prices. In a volatility swap, there are a. series of time periods. At the end of each period, one side pays a preagreed volatility while the other side pays the historical volatility realized during the period. Both. volatilities are multiplied by the same notional principal in calculating payments..  

Swaps are limited only by the imagination of financial engineers and the desire of corporate treasurers and fund managers for exotic structures. In Chapter 34 we will describe the famous $5/30$ swap entered into between Procter and Gamble and Bankers  

Trust where payments depended in a complex way on the 30-day commercial paper rate, a 30-year Treasury bond price, and the yield on a 5-year Treasury bond.  

# SUMMARY  

The two most common types of swaps are interest rate swaps and currency swaps. In an. interest rate swap, one party agrees to pay the other party interest at a fixed rate on a. notional principal for a number of years. In return, it receives interest at a floating rate on the same notional principal for the same period of time. In a currency swap, one. party agrees to pay interest on a principal amount in one currency. In return, it receives interest on a principal amount in another currency..  

Principal amounts are not exchanged in an interest rate swap. In a currency swap, principal amounts are usually exchanged at both the beginning and the end of the life of the swap. For a party paying interest in the foreign currency, the foreign principal is received, and the domestic principal is paid at the beginning of the life of the swap. At the end of the life of the swap, the foreign principal is paid and the domestic principal is received.  

An interest rate swap can be used to transform a floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate. loan, or vice versa. It can also be used to transform a floating-rate investment to a fixed-. rate investment, or vice versa. A currency swap can be used to transform a loan in one. currency into a loan in another currency. It can also be used to transform an investment denominated in one currency into an investment denominated in another currency..  

The interest rate and currency swaps considered in main part of the chapter can be. regarded portfolios of forward contracts. They can be valued by assuming the. forward interest rates and exchange rates observed in the market today will occur in the future.

# Practice Questions  

7.11. Companies A and B have been offered the following rates per annum on a $\$20$ million five-year loan:   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Fixedrate</td><td>Floatingrate</td></tr><tr><td>Company A</td><td>5.0%</td><td>SOFR + 0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>Company B</td><td>6.4%</td><td>SOFR + 0.6%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Company A requires a floating-rate loan; Company B requires a fixed-rate loan. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, $0.1\%$ per annum and that will appear equally attractive to both companies.  

7.12. A $\$100$ million interest rate swap has a remaining life of 10 months. Under the terms of the swap, six-month LIBOR is exchanged for $4\%$ per annum (compounded semiannually). Six-. month LIBOR forward rates for all maturities are $3\%$ (with semiannual compounding). The six-month LIBOR rate was. $2.4\%$ two months ago. OIS rates for all maturities are $2.7\%$ with continuous compounding. What is the current value of the swap to the party paying floating? What is the value to the party paying fixed?  

7.13. Company X wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of interest. Company Y wishes to borrow Japanese yen at a fixed rate of interest. The amounts required by the two companies are roughly the same at the current exchange rate. The companies have been quoted the following interest rates, which have been adjusted for the impact of taxes:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Yen</td><td>Dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Company X</td><td>5.0%</td><td>9.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Company Y</td><td>6.5%</td><td>10.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, 50 basis points per annum.   
Make the swap equally attractive to the two companies and ensure that all foreign.   
exchange risk is assumed by the bank.  

7.14. A currency swap has a remaining life of 15 months. It involves exchanging interest at $10\%$ on 20 million for interest at. $6\%$ on $\$30$ million once a year. The term structure of risk-free interest rates in the United Kingdom is flat at $7\%$ and the term structure of risk-. free interest rates in the United States is flat at $4\%$ (both with annual compounding). The. current exchange rate (dollars per pound sterling) is 1.5500. What is the value of the swap to the party paying sterling? What is the value of the swap to the party paying dollars?  

7.15. Explain the difference between the credit risk and the market risk in a swap.  

7.16. A corporate treasurer tells you that he has just negotiated a five-year loan at a competitive fixed rate of interest of. $5.2\%$ . The treasurer explains that he achieved the $5.2\%$ rate by borrowing at a six-month floating reference rate plus 150 basis points and swapping the floating reference rate for. $3.7\%$ . He goes on to say that this was possible. because his company has a comparative advantage in the floating-rate market. What has the treasurer overlooked?.  

7.17. A bank enters into an interest rate swap with a nonfinancial counterparty using bilaterally clearing where it is paying a fixed rate of $3\%$ and receiving floating. No collateral is posted and no other transactions are outstanding between the bank and the counterparty. What credit risk is the bank subject to? Discuss whether the credit risk is greater when the yield curve is upward sloping or when it is downward sloping.  

7.18. Companies X and Y have been offered the following rates per annum on a $\$5$ million 10-year investment:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Fixedrate</td><td>Floatingrate</td></tr><tr><td>Company X</td><td>8.0%</td><td>LIBOR</td></tr><tr><td>Company Y</td><td>8.8%</td><td>LIBOR</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Company X requires a fixed-rate investment; company Y requires a floating-rate investment. Design a swap that will net a bank, acting as intermediary, $0.2\%$ per annum and will appear equally attractive to X and Y.  

7.19. A financial institution has entered into an interest rate swap with company X. Under the terms of the swap, it receives. $4\%$ per annum and pays six-month LIBOR on a principal of $\$10$ million for five years. Payments are made every six months. Suppose that company X defaults on the sixth payment date (end of year 3) when six-month forward LIBOR rates for all maturities are $2\%$ per annum. What is the loss to the financial institution? Assume that six-month LIBOR was. $3\%$ per annum halfway through year 3 and that at the time of the default all OIS rates are. $1.8\%$ per annum. OIS rates are expressed with continuous compounding; other rates are expressed with semiannual compounding.  

7.20. A financial institution has entered into a 10-year currency swap with company Y. Under the terms of the swap, the financial institution receives interest at $3\%$ per annum in Swiss. francs and pays interest at. $8\%$ per annum in U.S. dollars. Interest payments are exchanged once a year. The principal amounts are 7 million dollars and 10 million francs. Suppose that company Y declares bankruptcy at the end of year 6, when the exchange rate is $\$0.80$ per franc. What is the cost to the financial institution? Assume that, at the end of year 6, risk-free interest rates are. $3\%$ per annum in Swiss francs and $8\%$ per annum in U.S.. dollars for all maturities. All interest rates are quoted with annual compounding.  

7.21. Companies A and B face the following interest rates (adjusted for the differential impact of taxes):   


<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Company A</td><td>Company B</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. dollars</td><td>Floating +0.5%</td><td>Floating +1 1.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Canadian dollars</td><td>5.0%</td><td>6.5%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Assume that A wants to borrow U.S. dollars at a floating rate of interest and B wants to. borrow Canadian dollars at a fixed rate of interest. A financial institution is planning to. arrange a swap and requires a 50-basis-point spread. If the swap is equally attractive to A and B, what rates of interest will A and B end up paying?.  

7.22. After it hedges its foreign exchange risk using forward contracts, is the financial institution's average spread in Figure 7.11 likely to be greater than or less than 20 basis points? Explain your answer.  

7.23. "Nonfinancial companies with high credit risks are the ones that cannot access fixed-rate markets directly. They are the companies that are most likely to be paying fixed and receiving floating in an interest rate swap." Assume that this statement is true. Do you think it increases or decreases the risk of a financial institution's swap portfolio? Assume that companies are most likely to default when interest rates are high.  

7.24. Why is the expected loss to a bank from a default on a swap with a counterparty less than. the expected loss from the default on a loan to the counterparty when the loan and swap. have the same principal? Assume that there are no other derivatives transactions between the bank and the counterparty, that the swap is cleared bilaterally, and that no collateral. is provided by the counterparty in the case of either the swap or the loan..  

7.25. A bank finds that its assets are not matched with its liabilities. It is taking floating-rate deposits and making fixed-rate loans. How can swaps be used to offset the risk?.  

7.26. Explain how you would value a swap that is the exchange of a floating rate in one currency for a fixed rate in another currency..  

7.27. OIS rates are $3.4\%$ for all maturities. What is the value of an OIS swap with two years to maturity where $3\%$ is received and the floating reference rate is paid. Assume annual compounding, annual payments, and. $\$100$ million principal.  

7.28. A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to make quarterly payments at a rate of $3\%$ per annum and receive the SOFR three-month reference rate on a notional principal of $\$100$ million. The swap now has a remaining life of 7.5 months. Assume the. risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 1.5, 4.5, and 7.5 months are $2.8\%$ $3.0\%$ , and $3.1\%$ , respectively. Assume also that the continuously. compounded risk-free rate observed for the last 1.5 months is. $2.7\%$ . Estimate the value Of the swap.  

7.29. (a) Company A has been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for three. years at $3.45\%$ . What floating rate can it swap this fixed rate into? (b) Company B has. been offered the swap quotes in Table 7.4. It can borrow for five years at floating plus 75 basis points. What fixed rate can it swap this rate into? (c) Explain the rollover risks. that Company B is taking.  

7.30. The one-year LIBOR rates is $3\%$ , and the LIBOR forward rate for the 1- to 2-year period. is $3.2\%$ . The three-year swap rate for a swap with annual payments is. $3.2\%$ . What is the LIBOR forward rate for the 2- to 3-year period if OIS zero rates for maturities of one, two, and three years are $2.5\%$ $2.7\%$ , and $2.9\%$ , respectively. What is the value of a threeyear swap where $4\%$ is received and LIBOR is paid on a principal of $\$100$ million. All rates are annually compounded.  

7.31. A financial institution has entered into a swap where it agreed to receive quarterly payments at a rate of $2\%$ per annum and pay the SOFR three-month reference rate on. a notional principal of $\$100$ million. The swap now has a remaining life of 10 months.. Assume the risk-free rates with continuous compounding (calculated from SOFR) for 1 month, 4 months, 7 months, and 10 months are. $1.4\%$ $1.6\%$ $1.7\%$ , and $1.8\%$ respectively. Assume also that the continuously compounded risk-free rate observed for the last two months is $1.1\%$ . Estimate the value of the swap.  

7.32. Company A, a British manufacturer, wishes to borrow U.S. dollars at a fixed rate of interest. Company B, a U.S. multinational, wishes to borrow sterling at a fixed rate of interest. They have been quoted the following rates per annum:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Sterling</td><td>U.S. Dollars</td></tr><tr><td>Company A</td><td>11.0%</td><td>7.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Company B</td><td>10.6%</td><td>6.2%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(Rates have been adjusted for differential tax effects.) Design a swap that will net a bank.. acting as intermediary, 10 basis points per annum and that will produce a gain of 15 basis points per annum for each of the two companies..  

7.33. The five-year swap rate when cash flows are exchanged semiannually is. $4\%$ . A company wants a swap where it receives payments at $4.2\%$ per annum on a notional principal of $\$10$ million. The OIS zero curve is flat at $3.6\%$ . How much should a derivatives dealer charge the company. Assume that all rates are expressed with semiannual compounding and ignore bid-ask spreads.

# Securitizationd and the Financial Crisis of 2007-8  

Derivatives such as forwards, futures, swaps, and options are concerned with transferring risk from one entity in the economy to another. The first seven chapters of this book have focused on forwards, futures, and swaps. Before moving on to discuss options, we consider another important way of transferring risk in the economy: securitization.  

Securitization is of particular interest because of its role in the financial crisis that started in 2007. The crisis had its origins in financial products created from mortgages. in the United States, but rapidly spread from the United States to other countries and from financial markets to the real economy. Some financial institutions failed; others had to be rescued by national governments. There can be no question that the first. decade of the twenty-first century was disastrous for the financial sector..  

In this chapter, we examine the nature of securitization and its role in the crisis. In the course of the chapter, we will learn about the U.S. mortgage market, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, waterfalls, and the importance of incentives in financial markets.
