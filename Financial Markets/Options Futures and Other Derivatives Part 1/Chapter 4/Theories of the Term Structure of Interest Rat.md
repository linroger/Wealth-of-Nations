# 4.12 THEORIES OF THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES  

It is natural to ask what determines the shape of the zero curve. Why is it sometimes downward sloping, sometimes upward sloping, and sometimes partly upward sloping. and partly downward sloping? A number of different theories have been proposed. The simplest is expectations theory, which conjectures that long-term interest rates should reflect expected future short-term interest rates. More precisely,it argues that a forward interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero interest rate for that period. Another idea, market segmentation theory, conjectures that there need be no relationship between short-, medium-, and long-term interest rates. Under the theory, a major investor such as a large pension fund or an insurance company invests in bonds of a certain maturity and does not readily switch from one maturity to another. The short-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand. in the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is determined by supply. and demand in the medium-term bond market; and so on..  

The theory that is most appealing is liquidity preference theory. The basic assumption. underlying the theory is that investors prefer to preserve their liquidity and invest funds. for short periods of time. Borrowers, on the other hand, usually prefer to borrow at fixed rates for long periods of time. This leads to a situation in which forward rates are greater. than expected future zero rates. The theory is also consistent with the empirical result that yield curves tend to be upward sloping more often than they are downward sloping..  

# The Management of Net Interest Income  

To understand liquidity preference theory, it is useful to consider the interest rate risk faced by banks when they take deposits and make loans. The net interest income of the bank is the excess of the interest received over the interest paid and needs to be carefully managed.  

Consider a simple situation where a bank offers consumers a one-year and a five-year.   
deposit rate as well as a one-year and five-year mortgage rate. The rates are shown in.   
Table 4.7. We make the simplifying assumption that the expected one-year interest rate.   
for future time periods is equal the one-year rates prevailing in the market today..   
Loosely speaking this means that the market considers interest rate increases to be just.   
as likely as interest rate decreases. As a result, the rates in Table 4.7 are "fair" in that  

Table 4.7 Example of rates offered by a bank to its customers.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Deposit rate</td><td>Mortgage rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3%</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>3%</td><td>6%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Table 4.8 Five-year rates are increased in an attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Maturity (years)</td><td>Deposit rate</td><td>Mortgage rate</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>3%</td><td>6%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>4%</td><td>7%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

they reflect the market's expectations (i.e., they correspond to expectations theory). Investing money for one year and reinvesting for four further one-year periods give the same expected overall return as a single five-year investment. Similarly, borrowing money for one year and refinancing each year for the next four years leads to the same expected financing costs as a single five-year loan.  

Suppose you have money to deposit and agree with the prevailing view that interest. rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose to deposit your money for one year at. $3\%$ per annum or for five years at $3\%$ per annum? The chances are that you would choose one year because this gives you more financial flexibility. It ties up your funds for a shorter period of time..  

Now suppose that you want a mortgage. Again you agree with the prevailing view that interest rate increases are just as likely as interest rate decreases. Would you choose a one-year mortgage at $6\%$ or a five-year mortgage at $6\%^{\cdot}$ ? The chances are that you would choose a five-year mortgage because it fixes your borrowing rate for the next five years and subjects you to less refinancing risk.  

When the bank posts the rates shown in Table 4.7,it is likely to find that the majority of its depositors opt for one-year deposits and the majority of its borrowers opt for fiveyear mortgages. This creates an asset/liability mismatch for the bank and subjects it to risks. There is no problem if interest rates fall. The bank will find itself financing the five-year $6\%$ loans with deposits that cost less than. $3\%$ in the future and net interest. income will increase. However, if rates rise, the deposits that are financing these $6\%$ loans will cost more than. $3\%$ in the future and net interest income will decline. A. $3\%$ rise in interest rates would reduce the net interest income to zero.  

It is the job of the asset/liability management group to ensure that the maturities of the assets on which interest is earned and the maturities of the liabilities on which interest is paid are matched. One way it can do this is by increasing the five-year rate on both deposits and mortgages. For example, it could move to the situation in Table 4.8 where the five-year deposit rate is. $4\%$ and the five-year mortgage rate $7\%$ . This would make five-year deposits relatively more attractive and one-year mortgages relatively more attractive. Some customers who chose one-year deposits when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will switch to five-year deposits in the Table 4.8 situation. Some customers who chose five-year mortgages when the rates were as in Table 4.7 will choose one-year mortgages. This may lead to the maturities of assets and liabilities being matched. If there is still an imbalance with depositors tending to choose a one-year maturity and borrowers a five-year maturity, five-year deposit and mortgage rates could be increased even further. Eventually the imbalance will disappear..  

The net result of all banks behaving in the way we have just described is liquidity preference theory. Long-term rates tend to be higher than those that would be predicted by expected future short-term rates. The yield curve is upward sloping most  

During the financial crisis that started in July 2007 there was a "flight to quality,' where financial institutions and investors looked for safe investments and were less inclined than before to take credit risks. Financial institutions that relied on shortterm funding experienced liquidity problems. One example is Northern Rock in the United Kingdom, which financed much of its mortgage portfolio with wholesale deposits, some lasting only 3 months. Starting in September 2007, the depositors became nervous and refused to roll over the funding they were providing to Northern Rock, i.e., at the end of a 3-month period they would refuse to deposit their funds for a further 3-month period. As a result, Northern Rock was unable to finance its assets. It was taken over by the U.K. government in early 2008. In the United States, financial institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers experienced similar liquidity problems because they had chosen to fund part of their operations with short-term funds.  

of the time. It is downward sloping only when the market expects a steep decline in short-term rates.  

Many banks now have sophisticated systems for monitoring the decisions being made by customers so that, when they detect small differences between the maturities of the assets and liabilities being chosen by customers they can fine tune the rates they offer. Sometimes derivatives such as interest rate swaps are also used to manage their exposure. The result of all this is that net interest income is usually very stable. This has not always been the case. In the United States, the failure of Savings and Loan companies in the 1980s and the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984 were to a large extent a result of the fact that they did not match the maturities of assets and liabilities. Both failures proved to be very expensive for U.S. taxpayers.  

# Liquidity  

In addition to creating problems in the way that has been described, a portfolio where maturities are mismatched can lead to liquidity problems. Consider a financial institution that funds 5-year fixed rate loans with wholesale deposits that last only 3 months. It might recognize its exposure to rising interest rates and hedge its interest rate risk. (One way of doing this is by using interest rate swaps, as mentioned earlier.) However,it still has a liquidity risk. Wholesale depositors may, for some reason, lose confidence in the financial institution and refuse to continue to provide the financial institution with short-term funding. The financial institution, even if it has adequate equity capital, will. then experience a severe liquidity problem that could lead to its downfall. As described in Business Snapshot 4.2, these types of liquidity problems were the root cause of some of the failures of financial institutions during the crisis that started in 2007..  

# SUMMARY  

The compounding frequency used for an interest rate defines the units in which it is measured. The difference between an annually compounded rate and a quarterly. compounded rate is analogous to the difference between a distance measured in miles and a distance measured in kilometers. Traders frequently use continuous compounding when analyzing the value of options and more complex derivatives.  

Many different types of interest rates are quoted in financial markets and calculated by. analysts. The $n$ -year zero or spot rate is the rate applicable to an investment lasting for. $n$ years when all of the return is realized at the end. The par yield on a bond of a certain maturity is the coupon rate that causes the bond to sell for its par value. Forward rates are the rates applicable to future periods of time implied by today's zero rates..  

The method most commonly used to calculate zero rates is known as the bootstrap method. It involves starting with short-term instruments and moving progressively to longer-term instruments, making sure that the zero rates calculated at each stage are consistent with the prices of the instruments. It is used daily by trading desks to calculate a variety of zero curves.  

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an over-the-counter agreement where a floating. rate will be exchanged for a specified interest rate with both rates being applied to a predetermined principal over a predetermined period.  

An important concept in interest rate markets is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity of the value of a bond portfolio to a small parallel shift in the zero-coupon yield curve. Specifically,  

$$
\Delta B=-B D\Delta y
$$  

where $B$ is the value of the bond portfolio, $D$ is the duration of the portfolio, $\Delta y$ is the size of a small parallel shift in the zero curve, and $\Delta B$ is the resultant effect on the value of the bond portfolio..  

Liquidity preference theory can be used to explain the interest rate term structures that are observed in practice. The theory argues that most entities like to borrow long and lend short. To match the maturities of borrowers and lenders, it is necessary for financial institutions to raise long-term rates so that forward interest rates are higher than expected future spot interest rates.

# Determination of Forward and Futures Prices  

In this chapter we examine how forward prices and futures prices are related to the spot. price of the underlying asset. Forward contracts are easier to analyze than futures contracts because there is no daily settlement-only a single payment at maturity. We. therefore start this chapter by considering the relationship between the forward price. and the spot price. Luckily it can be shown that the forward price and futures price of an asset are usually very close when the maturities of the two contracts are the same. This is convenient because it means that results obtained for forwards can be assumed to be true for futures.  

In the first part of the chapter we derive some important general results on the relationship between forward (or futures) prices and spot prices. We then use the results to examine the relationship between futures prices and spot prices for contracts on stock indices, foreign exchange, and commodities. We will consider interest rate futures contracts in the next chapter.
