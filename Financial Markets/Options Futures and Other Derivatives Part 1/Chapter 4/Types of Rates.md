# 4.1 TYPES OF RATES  

An interest rate in a particular situation defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender. For any given currency, many different types of interest rates are regularly quoted. These include mortgage rates, deposit rates, prime borrowing rates, and so on. One important factor influencing interest rates is credit risk. This is the risk that there will be a default by the borrower of funds, so that the interest and principal are not paid to the lender as promised. The higher the credit risk, the higher the interest rate that is promised by the borrower. The extra amount added to a risk-free interest rate to allow for credit risk is known as a credit spread.  

Interest rates are often expressed in basis points. One basis point is $0.01\%$ per annum.  

# Treasury Rates  

Treasury rates are the rates an investor earns on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds. These are the instruments used by a government to borrow in its own currency. Japanese Treasury rates are the rates at which the Japanese government borrows in yen; U.S. Treasury rates are the rates at which the U.S. government borrows in U.S. dollars; and so on. It is usually assumed that there is no chance that the government of a developed country will default on an obligation denominated in its own currency. A developed country's Treasury rates are therefore regarded as risk-free in the sense that an investor who buys a Treasury bill or Treasury bond is certain that interest and principal payments will be made as promised.  

# Overnight Rates  

Banks are required to maintain a certain amount of cash, known as a reserve, with the central bank. The reserve requirement for a bank at any time depends on its outstanding assets and liabilities. At the end of a day, some financial institutions typically have surplus funds in their accounts with the central bank while others have requirements for funds. This leads to borrowing and lending overnight. A broker usually matches borrowers and lenders. In the United States, the central bank is the Federal Reserve (often referred to as the Fed) and the overnight rate is called the federal funds rate. The weighted average of the rates in brokered transactions (with weights being determined by the size of the transaction) is termed the effective federal funds rate.This overnight rate is monitored by the Federal Reserve, which may intervene with its own transactions in an attempt to raise or lower it. Other countries have similar systems to the United States. For example, in the United Kingdom, the average of brokered overnight rates is the sterling overnight index average (SONIA); in the eurozone,it is the euro short-term rate (ESTER); in Switzerland,it is the Swiss average rate overnight (SARON); in Japan,it is the Tokyo overnight average rate (TONAR).  

# Repo Rates  

Unlike the overnight federal funds rate, repo rates are secured borrowing rates. In a repo (or repurchase agreement), a financial institution that owns securities agrees to sell the securities for a certain price and buy them back at a later time for a slightly higher price. The financial institution is obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the difference between the price at which the securities are sold and the price at which they are repurchased. The interest rate is referred to as the repo rate.  

If structured carefully, a repo involves very little credit risk. If the borrower does not. honor the agreement, the lending company simply keeps the securities. If the lending company does not keep to its side of the agreement, the original owner of the securities keeps the cash provided by the lending company. The most common type of repo is an overnight repo, where funds are lent overnight. However, longer-term arrangements, known as term repos, are sometimes used. Because it is a secured rate, a repo rate is theoretically very slightly below the corresponding fed funds rate..  

The secured overnight financingrate (SOFR) is an important volume-weighted median average of the rates on overnight repo transactions in the United States..
