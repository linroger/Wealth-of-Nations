# 4.9 FORWARD RATE AGREEMENTS  

A forward rate agreement (FRA) is an agreement to exchange a predetermined fixed. rate for a reference rate that will be observed in the market at a future time. Both rates  

# Business Snapshot 4.1 Orange County's Yield Curve Plays  

Suppose a large investor can borrow or lend at the rates given in Table 4.5 and thinks. that 1-year interest rates will not change much over the next 5 years. The investor can borrow 1-year funds and invest for 5-years. The 1-year borrowings can be rolled over for further 1-year periods at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth years. If. interest rates do stay about the same, this strategy will yield a profit of about. $2.3\%$ per year, because interest will be received at. $5.3\%$ and paid at $3\%$ . This type of trading strategy is known as a yield curve play.The investor is speculating that rates in the future will be quite different from the forward rates observed in the market today. (In our example, forward rates observed in the market today for future 1-year periods are $5\%$ $5.8\%$ $6.2\%$ , and $6.5\%$ .)  

Robert Citron, the Treasurer at Orange County, used yield curve plays similar to the one we have just described very successfully in 1992 and 1993. The profit from Mr. Citron's trades became an important contributor to Orange County's budget and he was re-elected. (No one listened to his opponent in the election, who said his trading strategy was too risky.)  

In 1994 Mr. Citron expanded his yield curve plays. He invested heavily in inverse floaters. These pay a rate of interest equal to a fixed rate of interest minus a floating rate. He also leveraged his position by borrowing in the repo market. If short-term interest rates had remained the same or declined he would have continued to do well. As it happened, interest rates rose sharply during 1994. On December 1, 1994, Orange County announced that its investment portfolio had lost $\$1.5$ billion and several days later it filed for bankruptcy protection.  

are applied to a specified principal, but the principal itself is not exchanged. Historically, the reference rate has usually been LIBOR. Consider an agreement to exchange $3\%$ for three-month LIBOR in two years with both rates being applied to a principal of $\$100$ million. One side (Party A) would agree to pay LIBOR and receive the fixed rate of $3\%$ . The other side (Party B) would agree to receive LIBOR and pay the fixed rate of $3\%$ . Assume all rates are compounded quarterly (as would usually be the case). If three-month LIBOR proved to be $3.5\%$ in two years, Party A would receive.

\S100,000,000\times(0.035-0.030)\times0.25=\S125,000
$$  

and Party B would pay this amount. The payment would be due at time 2.25 years.4  

As LIBOR is phased out, we can expect to see more FRAs based on floating rates. such as three-month SOFR and three-month SONIA. FRAs are a way of locking in the. rate that will be paid or received in the future. For example, a trader who is due to receive a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future. time period can lock in the rate by entering into an FRA where SOFR is paid and a fixed rate is received. Similarly, a trader who is due to pay a rate based on three-month SOFR on a certain principal during a certain future time period can lock in the rate by. entering into an FRA where SOFR is received and a fixed rate is paid..  

When the fixed rate equals the relevant forward rate the value of an FRA is zero. For example, when the reference rate is three-month SOFR, an FRA would be worth zero when the fixed rate equals the forward three-month SOFR rate. When an FRA is first set up the fixed rate is normally equal to the forward rate, so that its value is zero. As time passes, the forward rate is liable to change. Suppose that, at a particular time, we define:  

$R_{K}$ : the fixed rate agreed to in the FRA   
$R_{F}\dot{}$ the current forward rate for the reference rate $\tau$ : the period of time to which the rates apply (three months in the above example)   
$L$ : the principal in the contract.  

We can compare  

1. the FRA under consideration.   
2. a similar FRA where the fixed rate is the forward rate, $R_{F}$  

For the party receiving the fixed rate, the only difference between the two FRAs is that the cash flow at maturity for the first FRA is. $\tau(R_{K}-R_{F})L$ more than that for the. second FRA. (This amount can be positive or negative.) We know that the second FRA is worth zero. It follows that the first FRA is worth the present value of. $\tau(R_{K}-R_{F})L$ Similarly, for the party that pays the fixed rate, the FRA is worth the present value of $\tau(R_{F}-R_{K})L$  

An important implication of these results is that an FRA can be valued by assuming that the forward interest rate for the underlying reference rate will be the one that determines the exchange.  

# Example 4.3  

Suppose that the forward SOFR rate for the period between time 1.5 years and time 2 years in the future is. $5\%$ (with semiannual compounding) and that some time ago a company entered into an FRA where it will receive $5.8\%$ (with semiannual compounding) and pay SOFR on a principal of $\$100$ million for the. period. The 2-year (SOFR) risk-free rate is $4\%$ (with continuous compounding).. The value of the FRA is.

100,000,000\times(0.058-0.050)\times0.5e^{-0.04\times2}=\S369,200
