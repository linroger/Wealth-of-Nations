# 4.5 ZERO RATES  

The $n$ -year zero-coupon interest rate is the rate of interest earned on an investment that starts today and lasts for $n$ years. All the interest and principal is realized at the end of $n$ years. There are no intermediate payments. The. $n$ -year zero-coupon interest rate is. sometimes also referred to as the $n$ -year spot rate, the $n$ -year zero rate, or just the $n$ -year zero. Suppose a 5-year zero rate with continuous compounding is quoted as $5\%$ per annum. This means that $\$100$ , if invested for 5 years, grows to.  

$$
100\times e^{0.05\times5}=128.40
$$  

Most of the interest rates we observe directly in the market are not pure zero rates. Consider a 5-year risk-free bond that provides a $6\%$ coupon (i.e., it pays interest at a rate of $6\%$ per year). The price of this bond does not by itself determine the 5-year riskfree zero rate because some of the return on the bond is realized in the form of coupons prior to the end of year 5. Later in this chapter we will discuss how we can determine zero rates from the market prices of coupon-bearing instruments..
