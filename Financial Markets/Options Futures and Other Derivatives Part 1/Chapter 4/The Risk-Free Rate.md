# 4.3 THE RISK-FREE RATE  

As we shall see, the usual approach to valuing derivatives involves setting up a riskless. portfolio and arguing that the return on the portfolio should be the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate therefore plays a central role in derivatives pricing. It might be thought. that derivatives traders would use the rates on Treasury bills and Treasury bonds as risk-free rates. In fact they do not do this. This is because there are tax and regulatory factors that lead to Treasury rates being artificially low. For example:.  

1. Banks are not required to keep capital for investments in a Treasury instruments,. but they are required to keep capital for other very low risk instruments..   
2. In the United States, Treasury instruments are given favorable tax treatment compared with other very low risk instruments because the interest earned by investors is not taxed at the state level.  

The risk-free reference rates created from from overnight rates (see Section 4.2) are the ones used in valuing derivatives.
