# 10.1 TYPES OF OPTIONS  

As mentioned in Chapter 1, there are two types of options. A call option gives the holder of the option the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price. The date specified in the contract is known as the expiration date or the maturity date. The price specified in the contract is known as the exercise price or the strike price.  

Options can be either American or European, a distinction that has nothing to do with geographical location. American options can be exercised at any time up to the. expiration date, whereas European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself. Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. However, European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some. of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its. European counterpart.

# Call Options  

Consider the situation of an investor who buys a European call option with a strike price of $\$100$ to purchase 100 shares of a certain stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $\$98$ , the expiration date of the option is in 4 months, and the price of an option to purchase one share is $\$5$ . The initial investment is $\$500$ . Because the option is European, the investor can exercise only on the expiration date. If the stock price on this date is less than. $\$100$ , the investor will clearly choose not to exercise. (There is no point in buying for. $\$100$ a share that has a market value of less than $\$100$ ) In these circumstances, the investor loses the whole of the initial investment of $\$500$ . If the stock price is above. $\$100$ on the expiration date, the option will be exercised. Suppose, for example, that the stock price is $\$115$ . By exercising the option, the investor is able to buy 100 shares for $\$100$ per share. If the shares are sold immediately, the investor makes a gain of $\$15$ per share, or. $\$1,500$ , ignoring transaction costs. When the initial cost of the option is taken into account, the net profit to the investor is $\$1,000$  

Figure 10.1 shows how the investor's net profit or loss on an option to purchase one share varies with the final stock price in this example. For instance, when the final stock price is $\$120$ the profit from an option to purchase one share is $\$15$ . It is important to realize that an investor sometimes exercises an option and makes a loss overall. Suppose that, in the example, the stock price is $\$102$ at the expiration of the option. The investor would exercise for a gain of $\$102-\S100=\S2$ per option and realize a loss overall of $\$3$ when the initial cost of the option is taken into account. It is tempting to argue that the investor should not exercise the option in these circumstances. However, not exercising would lead to a loss of $\$5$ , which is worse than the $\$3$ loss when the investor exercises. In general, call options should always be exercised at the expiration date if the stock price is above the strike price.  

# Put Options  

Whereas the purchaser of a call option is hoping that the stock price will increase, the. purchaser of a put option is hoping that it will decrease. Consider an investor who buys a European put option with a strike price of $\$70$ to sell 100 shares of a certain. stock. Suppose that the current stock price is $\$65$ , the expiration date of the option is in 3 months, and the price of an option to sell one share is $\$7$ The initial investment is. $\$700$ . Because the option is European, it will be exercised only if the stock price is below $\$70$ on the expiration date. Suppose that the stock price is $\$55$ on this date. The investor can buy 100 shares for $\$55$ per share and, under the terms of the put option, sell the same shares for. $\$70$ to realize a gain of. $\$15$ per share, oru. $\$1,500$ .(Again, transaction costs are ignored.) When the $\$700$ initial cost of the option is taken into account, the investor's net profit is $\$800$ . There is no guarantee that the investor will make a gain. If the final stock price is above $\$70$ , the put option expires worthless, and the investor loses $\$700$ Figure 10.2 shows the way in which the investor's profit or loss on an option to sell one share varies with the terminal stock price in this example.

# Early Exercise  

As mentioned earlier, exchange-traded stock options are usually American rather than European. This means that the investor in the foregoing examples would not have to wait. until the expiration date before exercising the option. We will see later that there are some. circumstances when it is optimal to exercise American options before the expiration date.
