# 10.5 TRADING  

Traditionally, exchanges have had to provide a large open area for individuals to meet and trade options. This has changed. Most derivatives exchanges are fully electronic, so traders do not have to physically meet. The International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com) launched the first all-electronic options market for equities in the United States in May 2000. Over $95\%$ of the orders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange are handled electronically. The remainder are mostly large or complex institutional orders that require the skills of traders.  

# Market Makers  

Most options exchanges use market makers to facilitate trading. A market maker for a certain option is an individual who, when asked to do so, will quote both a bid and an ask price on the option. The bid is the price at which the market maker is prepared to buy, and the ask (or offer) is the price at which the market maker is prepared to sell. At the time the bid and ask prices are quoted, the market maker does not know whether the trader who asked for the quotes wants to buy or sell the option. The ask is always higher than the bid, and the amount by which the ask exceeds the bid is referred to as the bid-ask spread. The exchange sets upper limits for the bid-ask spread. For example, it might specify that the spread be no more than $\$0.25$ for options priced at less than $\$0.50,\$0.50$ for options priced between $\$0.50$ and $\$10$ $\$0.75$ for options priced between $\$10$ and $\$20$ , and $\$1$ for options priced over $\$20$  

The existence of the market maker ensures that buy and sell orders can always be executed at some price without any delays. Market makers therefore add liquidity to the market. The market makers themselves make their profits from the bid-ask spread. They use methods such as those that will be discussed in Chapter 19 to hedge their risks.  

# Offsetting Orders  

An investor who has purchased options can close out the position by issuing an. offsetting order to sell the same number of options. Similarly, an investor who has written options can close out the position by issuing an offsetting order to buy the same number of options. (In this respect options markets are similar to futures markets.) If, when an option contract is traded, neither investor is closing an existing position, the. open interest increases by one contract. If one investor is closing an existing position. and the other is not, the open interest stays the same. If both investors are closing. existing positions, the open interest goes down by one contract..
