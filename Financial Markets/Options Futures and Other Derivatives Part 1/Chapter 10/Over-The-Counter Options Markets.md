# 10.12 OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTIONS MARKETS  

Most of this chapter has focused on exchange-traded options markets. The over-thecounter market for options has become increasingly important since the early 1980s and is now larger than the exchange-traded market. As explained in Chapter 1, the main participants in over-the-counter markets are financial institutions, corporate treasurers, and fund managers. There is a wide range of assets underlying the options. Over-the-counter options on foreign exchange and interest rates are particularly popular. The chief potential disadvantage of the over-the-counter market is that the option writer may default. This means that the purchaser is subject to some credit risk. In an attempt to overcome this disadvantage, market participants (and regulators) often require counterparties to post collateral. This was discussed in Section 2.5.  

The instruments traded in the over-the-counter market are often structured by financial institutions to meet the precise needs of their clients. Sometimes this involves choosing exercise dates, strike prices, and contract sizes that are different from those offered by an exchange. In other cases the structure of the option is different from standard calls and puts. The option is then referred to as an exotic option. Chapter 26 describes a number of different types of exotic options.  

# SUMMARY  

There are two types of options: calls and puts. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset for a certain price by a certain date. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. There are four possible positions in options markets: a long position in a call, a short position in a call, a long position in a put, and a short position in a put. Taking a short position in an option is known as writing it. Options are currently traded on stocks, stock indices, foreign currencies, futures contracts, and other assets.  

An exchange must specify the terms of the option contracts it trades. In particular, it must specify the size of the contract, the precise expiration time, and the strike price. In. the United States one stock option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares. The standard expiration of a stock option contract is the third Friday of the. expiration month. Options with several different expiration months trade at any given time. Strike prices are at $\$2$ $\$5$ , or $\$10$ intervals, depending on the stock price.  

The terms of a stock option are not normally adjusted for cash dividends. However, they are adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, and rights issues. The aim of the adjustment is to keep the positions of both the writer and the buyer of a contract unchanged.  

Most option exchanges use market makers. A market maker is an individual who is prepared to quote both a bid price (at which he or she is prepared to buy) and an ask price (at which he or she is prepared to sell). Market makers improve the liquidity of the market and ensure that there is never any delay in executing market orders. They themselves make a profit from the difference between their bid and ask prices (known as their bid-ask spread). The exchange has rules specifying upper limits for the bid-ask spread.  

Writers of options have potential liabilities and are required to maintain a margin. account with their brokers. If it is not a member of the Options Clearing Corporation,. the broker will maintain a margin account with a firm that is a member. This firm will. in turn maintain a margin account with the Options Clearing Corporation. The Options Clearing Corporation is responsible for keeping a record of all outstanding. contracts, handling exercise orders, and so on..  

Not all options are traded on exchanges. Many options are traded in the over-the-. counter (OTC) market. An advantage of over-the-counter options is that they can be. tailored by a financial institution to meet the particular needs of a corporate treasurer or fund manager.

# Properties of Stock Options  

In this chapter, we look at the factors affecting stock option prices. We use a number of different arbitrage arguments to explore the relationships between European option prices, American option prices, and the underlying stock price. The most important of these relationships is put-call parity, which is a relationship between the price of a European call option, the price of a European put option, and the underlying stock price.  

The chapter examines whether American options should be exercised early. It shows that it is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock prior to the option's expiration, but that under some circumstances the early exercise of an American put option on such a stock is optimal. When there are dividends, it can be optimal to exercise either calls or puts early.
