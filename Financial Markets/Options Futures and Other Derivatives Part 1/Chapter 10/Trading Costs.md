# 10.6 TRADING COSTS  

The types of orders that can be placed with a broker for options trading are similar to those for futures trading (see Section 2.8). A market order is executed immediately, a limit order specifies the least favorable price at which the order can be executed, and so on.  

When options are traded online, the broker will typically charge a fixed fee plus a percontract fee. For example, the base fee might be. $\$2.50$ and the per-contract fee $\$0.50$ There is also typically a fee charged for exercising an option, and an assignment fee when a trader is short an option and is the subject of an exercise. Sometimes it is cheaper to sell an option than pay the fee for exercising it. (See www.stockbrokers.com/guides /features-fees to compare the fees charged by 16 U.S. brokers.).  

A hidden cost in option trading (and in many other financial transactions) is the. market maker's bid-ask spread. Suppose that, in the example just considered, the bid. price was $\$4.00$ and the ask price was $\$4.50$ at the time the option was purchased. We. can reasonably assume that a "fair"' price for the option is halfway between the bid and the ask price, or $\$4.25$ . The cost to the buyer and to the seller of the market maker. system is the difference between the fair price and the price paid. This is. $\$0.25$ per option, or $\$25$ per contract.
