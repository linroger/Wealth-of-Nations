# 10.2 OPTION POSITIONS  

There are two sides to every option contract. On one side is the investor who has taken. the long position (i.e., has bought the option). On the other side is the investor who has. taken a short position (i.e., has sold or written the option). The writer of an option receives cash up front, but has potential liabilities later. The writer's profit or loss is the reverse of that for the purchaser of the option. Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the variation of the profit or loss with the final stock price for writers of the options considered in Figures 10.1 and 10.2.

There are four types of option positions:  

1. A long position in a call option   
2. A long position in a put option   
3. A short position in a call option   
4. A short position in a put option.  

It is often useful to characterize a European option in terms of its payoff to the purchaser of the option. The initial cost of the option is then not included in the calculation. If $K$ is the strike price and $S_{T}$ is the final price of the underlying asset, the payoff from a long position in a European call option is

Figure 10.5 Payoffs from positions in European options: (a) long call; (b) short call; (c) long put; (d) short put. Strike price. $=K$ ; price of asset at maturity $=S_{T}$  

$$
\mathrm{max}(S_{T}-K,0)
$$  

This reflects the fact that the option will be exercised if. $S_{T}>K$ and will not be exercised if $S_{T}\leq K$ . The payoff to the holder of a short position in the European call option is  

$$
-\mathrm{max}(S_{T}-K,0)=\mathrm{min}(K-S_{T},0)
$$  

The payoff to the holder of a long position in a European put option is  

$$
\operatorname*{max}(K-S_{T},0)
$$  

and the payoff from a short position in a European put option is  

$$
-\mathrm{max}(K-S_{T},0)=\mathrm{min}(S_{T}-K,0)
$$  

Figure 10.5 illustrates these payoffs.
