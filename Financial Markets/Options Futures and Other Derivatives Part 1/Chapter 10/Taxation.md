# 10.10 TAXATION  

Determining the tax implications of option trading strategies can be tricky, and an investor who is in doubt about this should consult a tax specialist. In the United States,. the general rule is that (unless the taxpayer is a professional trader) gains and losses from the trading of stock options are taxed as capital gains or losses. The way that capital gains and losses are taxed in the United States was discussed in Section 2.10. For both the holder and the writer of a stock option, a gain or loss is recognized when (a) the option expires unexercised or (b) the option position is closed out. If the option is exercised, the gain or loss from the option is rolled into the position taken in the. stock and recognized when the stock position is closed out. For example, when a call. option is exercised, the party with a long position is deemed to have purchased the stock at the strike price plus the call price. This is then used as a basis for calculating. this party's gain or loss when the stock is eventually sold. Similarly, the party with the short call position is deemed to have sold the stock at the strike price plus the call price. When a put option is exercised, the seller of the option is deemed to have bought the stock for the strike price less the original put price and the purchaser of the option is deemed to have sold the stock for the strike price less the original put price..  

# Wash Sale Rule  

One tax consideration in option trading in the United States is the wash sale rule. To understand this rule, imagine an investor who buys a stock when the price is $\$60$ and plans to keep it for the long term. If the stock price drops to $\$40$ , the investor might be tempted to sell the stock and then immediately repurchase it, so that the $\$20$ loss is realized for tax purposes. To prevent this practice, the tax authorities have ruled that when the repurchase is within 30 days of the sale (i.e., between 30 days before the sale and 30 days after the sale), any loss on the sale is not deductible. The disallowance also applies where, within the 61-day period, the taxpayer enters into an option or similar contract to acquire the stock. Thus, selling a stock at a loss and buying a call option within a 30-day period will lead to the loss being disallowed.  

# Constructive Sales  

Prior to 1997, if a United States taxpayer shorted a security while holding a long. position in a substantially identical security, no gain or loss was recognized until the  

# Business Snapshot 10.1 Tax Planning Using Options  

As a simple example of a possible tax planning strategy using options, suppose that Country A has a tax regime where the tax is low on interest and dividends and high on capital gains, while Country B has a tax regime where tax is high on interest and dividends and low on capital gains. It is advantageous for a company to receive the income from a security in Country A and the capital gain, if there is one, in Country B. The company would like to keep capital losses in Country A, where they can be used to offset capital gains on other items. All of this can be accomplished by arranging for a subsidiary company in Country A to have legal ownership of the security and for a subsidiary company in Country B to buy a call option on the security from the company in Country A, with the strike price of the option equal to the current value of the security. During the life of the option, income from the security is earned in Country A. If the security price rises sharply, the option will be exercised and the capital gain will be realized in Country B. If it falls sharply, the option will not be exercised and the capital loss will be realized in Country A.  

short position was closed out. This means that short positions could be used to defer recognition of a gain for tax purposes. The situation was changed by the Tax Relief Act of 1997. An appreciated property is now treated as "constructively sold" when the owner does one of the following:  

1. Enters into a short sale of the same or substantially identical property   
2. Enters into a futures or forward contract to deliver the same or substantially identical property   
3. Enters into one or more positions that eliminate substantially all of the loss and opportunity for gain.  

It should be noted that transactions reducing only the risk of loss or only the opportun-. ity for gain should not result in constructive sales. Therefore an investor holding a long. position in a stock can buy in-the-money put options on the stock without triggering a constructive sale.  

Tax practitioners sometimes use options to minimize tax costs or maximize tax benefits (see Business Snapshot 10.1). Tax authorities in many jurisdictions have proposed legislation designed to combat the use of derivatives for tax purposes. Before entering into any tax-motivated transaction, a corporate treasurer or private individual should explore in detail how the structure could be unwound in the event of legislative change and how costly this process could be.
