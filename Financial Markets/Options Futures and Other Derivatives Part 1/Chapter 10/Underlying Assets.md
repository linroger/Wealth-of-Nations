# 10.3 UNDERLYING ASSETS  

This section provides a first look at how options on stocks, currencies, stock indices, and futures are traded on exchanges.  

# Stock Options  

Most trading in stock options is on exchanges. In the United States, the exchanges include the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com), NYsE Euronext (www.euronext.com), which acquired the American Stock Exchange in 2008, the International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com), and the Boston Options Exchange (www. bostonoptions.com). Options trade on several thousand different stocks. One contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares at the specified strike price. This contract size is convenient because the shares themselves are usually traded in lots of 100.  

# ETP Options  

The CBOE trades options on many exchange-traded products (ETPs). ETPs are listed on an exchange and traded like a share of a company's stock. They are designed to replicate the performance of a particular market, often by tracking an underlying benchmark index. ETPs are sometimes also referred to a exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). The most common ETP is an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is usually designed to track an equity index or a bond index. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF trust is designed to provide investors with the return they would earn if they invested in the 500 stocks that constitute the S&P 500 index. Other ETPs are designed to track the performance of commodities or currencies.  

# Foreign Currency Options  

Most currency options trading is now in the over-the-counter market, but there is some exchange trading. Exchanges trading foreign currency options in the United States include NASDAQ OMX (www.nasdaqtrader.com), which acquired the Philadelphia Stock Exchange in 2008. This exchange offers European-style contracts on a variety of different currencies. One contract is to buy or sell 10,000 units of a foreign currency. (1,000,o00 units in the case of the Japanese yen) for U.S. dollars. Foreign currency. options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 17..  

# Index Options  

Many different index options currently trade throughout the world in both the over-the-. counter market and the exchange-traded market. The most popular exchange-traded. contracts in the United States are those on the S&P 500 Index (SPX), the S&P 100 Index (OEX), the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX), and the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJX). All of these trade on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Most of the contracts are European. An exception is the OEX contract on the S&P 100, which is American. One. contract is usually to buy or sell 100 times the index at the specified strike price. Settlement is always in cash, rather than by delivering the portfolio underlying the index. Consider, for example, one call contract on an index with a strike price of 980. If it is exercised when the value of the index is 992, the writer of the contract pays the. holder $(992-980)\times100=\S1{,}200.$ Index options are discussed further in Chapter 17.  

# Futures Options  

When an exchange trades a particular futures contract, it often also trades American. options on that contract. The life of a futures option normally ends a short period of time before the expiration of trading in the underlying futures contract. When a call option is exercised, the holder's gain equals the excess of the futures price over the strike price. When a put option is exercised, the holder's gain equals the excess of the strike price over the futures price. Futures options contracts are discussed further in Chapter 18.
