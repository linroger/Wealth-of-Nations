# 16.5 THE BACKDATING SCANDAL  

No discussion of employee stock options would be complete without mentioning a. backdating scandal. Backdating is the practice of marking a document with a date that precedes the current date.  

Suppose that a company decides to grant at-the-money options to its executives on. April 30 when the stock price is $\$50$ If the stock price was $\$42$ on April 3, it is tempting to behave as if those the options were granted on April 3 and use a strike price of. $\$42$ . This is legal provided that the company reports the options as. $\$8$ in the money on the date when the decision to grant the options is made, April 30. But it is illegal for the company to report the options as at-the-money and granted on April 3. The value on April 3 of an. option with a strike price of $\$42$ is much less than its value on April 30. Shareholders are. misled about the true cost of the decision to grant options if the company reports the options as granted on April 3..  

Prior to 2002, it appears that backdating was not uncommon. Early research by Yermack shows that stock prices tend to increase after reported grant dates.1o Lie extended Yermack's work, showing that stock prices also tended to decrease before reported grant dates.11 The period covered by this research was 1993 to 2002. The research clearly shows that stock prices tended to be at a low point on reported grant dates. The stock price on a reported grant date was on average lower than that on each. of the 30 days before the grant date and lower than that on each of the 30 days after the grant date. Statistical tests carried out by the researchers showed that this could not have happened by chance. The research led regulators to conclude that backdating was occurring. In August 2002, the SEC required option grants by public companies to be reported within two business days. Heron and Lie showed that this led to a dramatic change in the stock price patterns around the grant date-particularly for those companies that complied with the SEC rule.12 Reported grant dates were no longer low-stock-price dates. It might be argued that the patterns observed by Yermack and Lie can be explained by managers choosing grant dates after bad news or before good news, but Heron and Lie's research shows that, although there might been a tendency for this to happen, it is not the major explanation of the Yermack and Lie results.  

Estimates of the number of companies that illegally backdated stock option grants in the United States vary widely. Tens and maybe hundreds of companies seem to have engaged in the practice. Many companies seem to have adopted the view that it was acceptable to backdate up to one month. Some CEOs resigned when their backdating practices came to light. In August 2007, Gregory Reyes of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., became the first CEO to be tried for backdating stock option grants. Allegedly, Mr. Reyes said to a human resources employee: "It is not illegal if you do not get caught." In June 2010, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $\$15$ million.  

Companies involved in backdating have had to restate past financial statements and have been defendants in class action suits brought by shareholders who claim to have lost money as a result of backdating. For example, McAfee announced in December  

2007 that it would restate earnings between 1995 and 2005 by $\$1237.4$ million. In 2006, it.   
set aside $\$13.8$ million to cover lawsuits..  

# SUMMARY  

Until 2005, at-the-money stock option grants were a very attractive form of compensation. They had no impact on the income statement and were very valuable to employees. Accounting standards now require options to be expensed..  

There are a number of different approaches to valuing employee stock options. A. common approach is to use the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the life of the option set equal to the expected time to exercise or expiry of the option. Another. approach is to assume that options are exercised as soon as the ratio of the stock price. to the strike price reaches a certain barrier. A third approach is to try and estimate the. relationship between the probability of exercise, the ratio of the stock price to the strike price, and the time to option maturity. A fourth approach is to create a market for securities that replicate the payoffs on the options..  

Academic research has shown beyond doubt that many companies have engaged in the illegal practice of backdating stock option grants in order to reduce the strike price,. while still contending that the options were at the money. The first prosecutions for this. illegal practice were in 2007.

# Options on Stock Indices and Currencies  

Options on stock indices and currencies were introduced in Chapter 10. This chapter. discusses them in more detail. It explains how they work and reviews some of the ways they can be used. In the second half of the chapter, the valuation results in Chapter 15 are extended to cover European options on a stock paying a known dividend yield. It is then argued that both stock indices and currencies are analogous to stocks paying. dividend yields. This enables the results for options on a stock paying a dividend yield. to be applied to these types of options as well.
