# 16.2 DO OPTIONS ALIGN THE INTERESTS OF SHAREHOLDERS AND MANAGERS?  

For investors to have confidence in capital markets, it is important that the interests of.   
shareholders and managers are reasonably well aligned. This means that managers.   
should be motivated to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.   
Managers are the agents of the shareholders and, as mentioned in Chapter 8, economists.   
use the term agency costs to describe the losses experienced when the interests of agents.   
and principals are not aligned.  

Do employee stock options help align the interests of employees and shareholders? The answer to this question is not straightforward. There can be little doubt that they serve a useful purpose for a start-up company. The options are an excellent way for the main shareholders, who are usually also senior executives, to motivate employees to work long hours. If the company is successful and there is an IPO, the employees will do very well; but if the company is unsuccessful, the options will be worthless.  

It is the options granted to the senior executives of publicly traded companies that are most controversial. Executive stock options are sometimes referred to as an executive's "pay for performance." If the company's stock price goes up, so that shareholders make gains, the executive is rewarded. However, this overlooks the asymmetric payoffs of options. If the company does badly then the shareholders lose money, but all that happens to the executives is that they fail to make a gain. Unlike the shareholders, they do not experience a loss.? Many people think that a better type of pay for performance is a restricted stock unit. This entitles the executive to own a share of the company's stock at a particular future time (the vesting date). The gains and losses of the executives then mirror those of other shareholders. It is sometimes argued that the asymmetric payoffs of options can lead to senior executives taking risks they would not otherwise take. This may or may not be in the interests of the company's shareholders.  

What temptations do stock options create for a senior executive? Suppose an executive plans to exercise a large number of stock options in three months and sell the stock. He or she might be tempted to time announcements of good news--or even move earnings from one quarter to another-so that the stock price increases just before the options are exercised. Alternatively, if at-the-money options are due to be granted to the executive in three months, the executive might be tempted to take actions that reduce the stock price just before the grant date. The type of behavior we are talking about here is of course totally unacceptable-and may well be illegal. But the backdating scandals, which are discussed later in this chapter, show that the way some executives have handled issues related to stock options leaves much to be desired.  

Even when there is no impropriety of the type we have just mentioned, executive stock options are liable to have the effect of motivating executives to focus on shortterm profits at the expense of longer-term performance. Managers of large funds worry that, because stock options are such a huge component of an executive's compensation, they are liable to be a big source of distraction. Senior management may spend too much time thinking about all the different aspects of their compensation and not enough time running the company.  

A manager's inside knowledge and ability to affect outcomes and announcements is always liable to interact with his or her trading in a way that is to the disadvantage of other shareholders. One radical suggestion for mitigating this problem is to require. executives to give notice to the market-perhaps one week's notice-of an intention to buy or sell their company's stock.' (Once the notice of an intention to trade had been given, it would be binding on the executive.) This allows the market to form its own conclusions about why the executive is trading. As a result, the price may increase. before the executive buys and decrease before the executive sells..
