# 16.1 CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS  

Employee stock options often last as long as 10 to 15 years. Very often the strike price is.   
set equal to the stock price on the grant date so that the option is initially at the money.  

The following are common features of employee stock option plans:  

1. There is a vesting period during which the options cannot be exercised. This vesting period can be as long as four years.   
2. When employees leave their jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily) during the vesting period, they forfeit their options.   
3. When employees leave (voluntarily or involuntarily) after the vesting period, they. forfeit options that are out of the money and they have to exercise vested options that are in the money almost immediately.   
4. Employees are not permitted to sell the options.   
5. When an employee exercises options, the company issues new shares and sells them to the employee for the strike price.  

# The Early Exercise Decision  

The fourth feature of employee stock option plans noted above has important implications. If employees, for whatever reason, want to realize a cash benefit from options that have vested, they must exercise the options and sell the underlying shares. They cannot sell the options to someone else. This leads to a tendency for employee stock options to be exercised earlier than similar exchange-traded or over-the-counter call options.  

Consider a call option on a stock paying no dividends. In Section 11.5 we showed that, if it is a regular call option, it should never be exercised early. The holder of the option will always do better by selling the option rather than exercising it before the end of its life. However, the arguments we used in Section 11.5 are not applicable to employee stock options because they cannot be sold. The only way employees can realize a cash benefit from the options (or diversify their holdings) is by exercising the options and selling the stock. It is therefore not unusual for an employee stock option to be exercised well before it would be optimal to exercise the option if it were a regular exchange-traded or over-the-counter option.  

Should an employee ever exercise his or her options before maturity and then keep. the stock rather than selling it? Assume that the option's strike price is constant during the life of the option and the option can be exercised at any time. To answer the question we consider two options: the employee stock option and an otherwise identical regular option that can be sold in the market. We refer to the first option as option A and the second as option B. If the stock pays no dividends, we know that option B should never be exercised early. It follows that it is not optimal to exercise option A and keep the stock. If the employee wants to maintain a stake in his or her company, a better strategy is to keep the option. This delays paying the strike price and maintains the insurance value of the option, as described in Section 11.5. Only when it is optimal to exercise option B can it be a rational strategy for an employee to exercise option A before maturity and keep the stock. As discussed in Section 15.12, it is optimal to. exercise option B only when a relatively high dividend is imminent..  

In practice the early exercise behavior of employees varies widely from company to. company. In some companies, there is a culture of not exercising early; in others, employees tend to exercise options and sell the stock soon after the end of the vesting. period, even if the options are only slightly in the money..
