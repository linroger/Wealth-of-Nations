# 11.2 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION  

In this chapter, we will make assumptions similar to those made when deriving forward and futures prices in Chapter 5. We assume that there are some market participants, such as large investment banks, for which the following statements are true:  

1. There are no transaction costs..   
2. All trading profits (net of trading losses) are subject to the same tax rate.   
3. Borrowing and lending are possible at the risk-free interest rate.  

We assume that these market participants are prepared to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they arise. As discussed in Chapters 1 and 5, this means that any available arbitrage opportunities disappear very quickly. For the purposes of our analysis, it is therefore reasonable to assume that there are no arbitrage opportunities.  

We will use the following notation:  

$S_{0}$ : Current stock price   
$K$ : Strike price of option   
$T$ : Time to expiration of option   
$S_{T}$ : Stock price on the expiration date. r: Continuously compounded risk-free rate of interest for an investment maturing in time $T$   
$C$ : Value of American call option to buy one share.   
$P$ : Value of American put option to sell one share. $c$ : Value of European call option to buy one share.   
$p$ : Value of European put option to sell one share.  

It should be noted that $r$ is the nominal risk-free rate of interest, not the real risk-free rate of interest.2 The proxies used by the market for the risk-free rate of interest were discussed in Chapter 4. A simple arbitrage argument suggests that $r>0$ and this is the assumption we make in deriving results in this chapter. However, during some periods. the monetary policies of governments have led to interest rates being negative in some. currencies such as the euro, Swiss franc, and Japanese yen. Problem 11.27 considers the impact of negative interest rates on the results in this chapter..
