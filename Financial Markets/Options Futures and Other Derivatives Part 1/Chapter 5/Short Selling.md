# 5.2 SHORT SELLING  

Some of the arbitrage strategies presented in this chapter involve short selling. This trade, usually simply referred to as "shorting", involves selling an asset that is not owned. It is something that is possible for some-but not all--investment assets. We will illustrate how it works by considering a short sale of shares of a stock..  

Suppose an investor instructs a broker to short 500 shares of company X. The broker will carry out the instructions by borrowing the shares from someone who owns them and. selling them in the market in the usual way. At some later stage, the investor will close out the position by purchasing 500 shares of company X in the market. These shares are then used to replace the borrowed shares so that the short position is closed out. The investor takes a profit if the stock price has declined and a loss if it has risen. If at any time while the contract is open the broker has to return the borrowed shares and there are no other shares that can be borrowed, the investor is forced to close out the position, even if not ready to do so. Often a fee is charged for lending the shares to the party doing the shorting.  

An investor with a short position must pay to the broker any income, such as dividends or interest, that would normally be received on the securities that have been shorted. The broker will transfer this income to the account of the client from whom the securities have been borrowed. Consider the position of an investor who shorts 500 shares in April when the price per share is $\$120$ and closes out the position by. buying them back in July when the price per share is $\$100$ . Suppose that a dividend of. $\$1$ per share is paid in May. The investor receives $500\times\S120=\S60{,}000$ in April when. the short position is initiated. The dividend leads to a payment by the investor of $500\times\$1=\$500$ in May. The investor also pays. $500\times\S100=\S50{,}000$ for shares when. the position is closed out in July. The net gain, therefore, is

when any fee for borrowing the shares is ignored. Table 5.1 illustrates this example and shows that the cash flows from the short sale are the mirror image of the cash flows from purchasing the shares in April and selling them in July. (Again, the fee for. borrowing the shares is not considered.).

The investor is required to maintain a margin account with the broker. The margin. account consists of cash or marketable securities deposited by the investor with the broker to guarantee that the investor will not walk away from the short position if the share price increases. It is similar to the margin account discussed in Chapter 2 for futures contracts. An initial margin is required and if there are adverse movements (i.e., increases) in the price of the asset that is being shorted, additional margin may be. required. If the additional margin is not provided, the short position is closed out. The. margin account does not represent a cost to the investor. This is because interest is usually paid on the balance in margin accounts and, if the interest rate offered is. unacceptable, marketable securities such as Treasury bills can be used to meet margin. requirements. The proceeds of the sale of the asset belong to the investor and normally. form part of the initial margin..  

From time to time regulations are changed on short selling. In 1938, the uptick rule. was introduced. This allowed shares to be shorted only on an "uptick"-that is, when. the most recent movement in the share price was an increase. The SEC abolished the. uptick rule in July 2007, but introduced an "alternative uptick" rule in February 2010. Under this rule, when the price of a stock has decreased by more than. $10\%$ in one day, there are restrictions on short selling for that day and the next. These restrictions are that the stock can be shorted only at a price that is higher than the best current bid. price. Occasionally there are temporary bans on short selling. This happened in a. number of countries in 2008 because it was considered that short selling contributed to the high market volatility that was being experienced..
