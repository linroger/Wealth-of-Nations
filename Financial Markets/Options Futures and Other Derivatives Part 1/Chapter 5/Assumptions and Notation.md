# 5.3 ASSUMPTIONS AND NOTATION  

In this chapter we will assume that the following are all true for some market participants:  

1. The market participants are subject to no transaction costs when they trade.   
2. The market participants are subject to the same tax rate on all net trading profits.   
3. The market participants can borrow money at the same risk-free rate of interest as   
they can lend money.   
4. The market participants take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they occur.  

Note that we do not require these assumptions to be true for all market participants. All that we require is that they be true-or at least approximately true-for a few key. market participants such as large derivatives dealers. It is the trading activities of these key market participants and their eagerness to take advantage of arbitrage opportun-. ities as they occur that determine the relationship between forward and spot prices..  

The following notation will be used throughout this chapter:  

$T$ : Time until delivery date in a forward or futures contract (in years) $S_{0}$ : Price of the asset underlying the forward or futures contract today $F_{0}$ : Forward or futures price today $r$ : Zero-coupon risk-free rate of interest per annum, expressed with continuous compounding, for an investment maturing at the delivery date (i.e., in $T$ years).  

The risk-free rate, $r$ , is the interest rate at which money is borrowed or lent when there is no credit risk, so that the borrowed money is certain to be repaid. As discussed in Chapter 4, participants in derivatives markets use overnight rates and rates derived from overnight rates as risk-free rates.
