# 5.1 INVESTMENT ASSETS vs. CONSUMPTION ASSETS  

When considering forward and futures contracts, it is important to distinguish between investment assets and consumption assets. An investment asset is an asset that is held. solely for investment purposes by at least some traders. Stocks and bonds are clearly investment assets. Gold and silver are also examples of investment assets. Note that investment assets do not have to be held exclusively for investment. (Silver, for. example, has a number of industrial uses.) However, they do have to satisfy the. requirement that they are held by some traders solely for investment. A consumption asset is an asset that is held primarily for consumption. It is not normally held for investment. Examples of consumption assets are commodities such as copper, crude oil, corn, and pork bellies.  

As we shall see later in this chapter, we can use arbitrage arguments to determine the forward and futures prices of an investment asset from its spot price and other. observable market variables. We cannot do this for consumption assets..
