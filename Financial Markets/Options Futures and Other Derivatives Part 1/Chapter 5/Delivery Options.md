# 5.13 DELIVERY OPTIONS  

Whereas a forward contract normally specifies that delivery is to take place on a. particular day, a futures contract often allows the party with the short position to choose to deliver at any time during a certain period. (Typically the party has to give a few days' notice of its intention to deliver.) The choice introduces a complication into the determination of futures prices. Should the maturity of the futures contract be assumed to be the beginning, middle, or end of the delivery period? Even though most futures contracts are closed out prior to maturity, it is important to know when delivery. would have taken place in order to calculate the theoretical futures price..  

If the futures price is an increasing function of the time to maturity, it can be seen from equation (5.19) that $c>y$ , so that the benefits from holding the asset (including convenience yield and net of storage costs) are less than the risk-free rate. It is usually optimal in such a case for the party with the short position to deliver as early as possible, because the interest earned on the cash received outweighs the benefits of holding the asset. As a rule, futures prices in these circumstances should be calculated on the basis that delivery will take place at the beginning of the delivery period. If futures prices are decreasing as time to maturity increases $(c<y)$ , the reverse is true. It is then usually optimal for the party with the short position to. deliver as late as possible, and futures prices should, as a rule, be calculated on this. assumption.
