# 5.12 THE COST OF CARRY  

The relationship between futures prices and spot prices can be summarized in terms of. the cost of carry. This measures the storage cost plus the interest that is paid to finance the asset less the income earned on the asset. For a non-dividend-paying stock, the cost of carry is $r$ , because there are no storage costs and no income is earned; for a stock index, it is $r\mathrm{~-~}q$ , because income is earned at rate $q$ on the asset. For a currency, it is $r-r_{f}$ ; for a commodity that provides income at rate $q$ and requires storage costs at rate $u$ , it is $r-q+u$ ; and so on.  

Define the cost of carry as. $c$ . For an investment asset, the futures price is  

$$
F_{0}=S_{0}e^{c T}
$$  

For a consumption asset, it is  

$$
F_{0}=S_{0}e^{(c-y)T}
$$  

where $y$ is the convenience yield.
