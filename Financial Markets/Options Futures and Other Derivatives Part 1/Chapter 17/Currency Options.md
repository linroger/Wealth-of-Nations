# 17.2 CURRENCY OPTIONS  

Currency options are primarily traded in the over-the-counter market. The advantage of this market is that large trades are possible, with strike prices, expiration dates, and other features tailored to meet the needs of corporate treasurers. Although currency options do trade on NASDAQ OMX in the United States, the exchange-traded market for these options is much smaller than the over-the-counter market.  

An example of a European call option is a contract that gives the holder the right to buy one million euros with U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of. $1.1000~{\mathrm{U}}.{\mathrm{S}}.$ dollars per euro. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 1.1500, the payoff is.  

$1,000,000\times(1.1500-1.1000)=\S50,000.$ Similarly, an example of a European put option is a contract that gives the holder the right to sell ten million Australian dollars for U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of $0.7000~\mathrm{U}.\mathrm{S}.$ dollars per Australian dollar. If the actual exchange rate at the maturity of the option is 0.6700, the payoff is $10,000,000\times(0.7000-0.6700)=\S300,000$  

For a corporation wishing to hedge a foreign exchange exposure, foreign currency options are an alternative to forward contracts.A U.S. company due to receive sterling at a known time in the future can hedge its risk by buying put options on sterling that mature at that time. The hedging strategy guarantees that the exchange rate applicable to the sterling will not be less than the strike price, while allowing the company to benefit from any favorable exchange-rate movements. Similarly, a U.S. company due to pay sterling at a known time in the future can hedge by buying calls on sterling that mature at that time. This hedging strategy guarantees that the cost of the sterling will not be greater than a certain amount while allowing the company to benefit from favorable exchangerate movements. Whereas a forward contract locks in the exchange rate for a future transaction, an option provides a type of insurance. This is not free. It costs nothing to enter into a forward transaction, but options require a premium to be paid up front.  

# Range Forwards  

A range forward contract is a variation on a standard forward contract for hedging. foreign exchange risk. Consider a U.S. company that knows it will receive one million pounds sterling in three months. Suppose that the three-month forward exchange rate is. 1.3200 dollars per pound. The company could lock in this exchange rate for the dollars. it receives by entering into a short forward contract to sell one million pounds sterling. in three months. This would ensure that the amount received for the one million pounds is $\$1,320,000$  

An alternative is to buy a European put option with a strike price of $K_{1}$ and sell a European call option with a strike price. $K_{2}$ , where $K_{1}<1.3200<K_{2}$ This is known as a. short position in a range forward contract. The payoff is shown in Figure 17.1a. Both options are on one million pounds. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less than $K_{1}$ , the put option is exercised and as a result the company is able to sell the.

one million pounds at an exchange rate of $K_{1}$ . If the exchange rate is between $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ neither option is exercised and the company gets the current exchange rate for the one million pounds. If the exchange rate is greater than $K_{2}$ , the call option is exercised against the company and the one million pounds is sold at an exchange rate of $K_{2}$ . The exchange rate realized for the one million pounds is shown in Figure 17.2.  

If the company knew it was due to pay rather than receive one million pounds in three months, it could sell a European put option with strike price $K_{1}$ and buy a European call option with strike price $K_{2}$ . This is a long position in a range forward contract and the payoff is shown in Figure 17.1b. If the exchange rate in three months proves to be less than $K_{1}$ , the put option is exercised against the company and as a result the company buys the one million pounds it needs at an exchange rate of $K_{1}$ . If the exchange rate is between $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ , neither option is exercised and the company buys the one million pounds at the current exchange rate. If the exchange rate is greater than $K_{2}$ , the call option is exercised and the company is able to buy the one million pounds at an. exchange rate of $K_{2}$ . The exchange rate paid for the one million pounds is the same as that received for the one million pounds in the earlier example and is shown in Figure 17.2.  

In practice, a range forward contract is set up so that the price of the put option. equals the price of the call option. This means that it costs nothing to set up the range forward contract, just as it costs nothing to set up a regular forward contract. Suppose that the U.S. and British interest rates are both. $2\%$ , so that the spot exchange rate is 1.3200 (the same as the forward exchange rate). Suppose further that the exchange rate volatility is $14\%$ . We can use DerivaGem to show that a European put with strike price. 1.3000 to sell one pound has the same price as a European call option with a strike price of 1.3414 to buy one pound. (Both are worth 0.0273.) Setting $K_{1}=1.3000$ and $K_{2}=1.3414$ therefore leads to a contract with zero cost in our example..  

As the strike prices of the call and put options in a range forward contract are moved together, the range forward contract becomes a regular forward contract. The (short) range forward contract in Figure 17.1a becomes a short forward contract and the (long) range forward contract in Figure 17.1b becomes a long forward contract.
