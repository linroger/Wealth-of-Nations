# 2.2 SPECIFICATION OF A FUTURES CONTRACT  

When developing a new contract, the exchange must specify in some detail the exact nature of the agreement between the two parties. In particular, it must specify the asset, the contract size (exactly how much of the asset will be delivered under one contract), where delivery can be made, and when delivery can be made.  

Sometimes alternatives are specified for the grade of the asset that will be delivered or for the delivery locations. As a general rule, it is the party with the short position (the party that has agreed to sell the asset) that chooses what will happen when alternatives are specified by the exchange.? when the party with the short position is ready to deliver, it files a notice of intention to deliver with the exchange. This notice indicates any selections it has made with respect to the grade of asset that will be delivered and the delivery location.  

# The Asset  

When the asset is a commodity, there may be quite a variation in the quality of what is available in the marketplace. When the asset is specified,it is therefore important that the exchange stipulate the grade or grades of the commodity that are acceptable. The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has specified the asset in its orange juice futures contract as frozen concentrates that are U.S. Grade A with Brix value of not less than 62.5 degrees.  

For some commodities a range of grades can be delivered, but the price received. depends on the grade chosen. For example, in the CME Group's corn futures contract,. the standard grade is "No. 2 Yellow,' but substitutions are allowed with the price being. adjusted in a way established by the exchange. No. 1 Yellow is deliverable for 1.5 cents per bushel more than No. 2 Yellow. No. 3 Yellow is deliverable for 2 to 4 cents per. bushel less than No. 2 Yellow depending on indicators of quality..  

The financial assets in futures contracts are generally well defined and unambiguous. For example, there is no need to specify the grade of a Japanese yen. However, there are some interesting features of the Treasury bond and Treasury note futures contracts traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. For example, the underlying asset in the Treasury bond contract is any U.S. Treasury bond that has a maturity between 15 and 25 years; in the 10-year Treasury note futures contract, the underlying asset is any Treasury note with a maturity of between 6.5 and 10 years. The exchange has a formula for adjusting the price received according to the coupon and maturity date of the bond delivered. This is discussed in Chapter 6.  

# The Contract Size  

The contract size specifies the amount of the asset that has to be delivered under one contract. This is an important decision for the exchange. If the contract size is too large, many traders who wish to hedge relatively small exposures or who wish to take relatively small speculative positions will be unable to use the exchange. On the other hand, if the contract size is too small, trading may be expensive as there is a cost associated with each contract traded.  

The correct size for a contract clearly depends on the likely user. Whereas the value of what is delivered under a futures contract on an agricultural product might be $\$10,000$ to $\$20,000$ , it is much higher for some financial futures. For example, under the Treasury bond futures contract traded by the CME Group, instruments with a face value of $\$100,000$ are delivered.  

In some cases exchanges have introduced "mini" contracts to attract smaller traders.. For example, the CME Group's Mini Nasdaq 100 contract is on 20 times the Nasdaq 100 index, whereas the regular contract is on 100 times the index. (We will cover futures on indices more fully in Chapter 3.).  

# Delivery Arrangements  

The place where delivery will be made must be specified by the exchange. This is particularly important for commodities that involve significant transportation costs. In the case of the ICE frozen concentrate orange juice contract, delivery is to exchangelicensed warehouses in Florida, New Jersey, or Delaware.  

When alternative delivery locations are specified,the price received by the party with. the short position is sometimes adjusted according to the location chosen by that party.. The price tends to be higher for delivery locations that are relatively far from the main sources of the commodity.  

# Delivery Months  

A futures contract is referred to by its delivery month. The exchange must specify the precise period during the month when delivery can be made. For many futures contracts, the delivery period is the whole month..  

The delivery months vary from contract to contract and are chosen by the exchange to meet the needs of market participants. For example, corn futures traded by the CME Group have delivery months of March, May, July, September, and December. At any given time, contracts trade for the closest delivery month and a number of subsequent delivery months. The exchange specifies when trading in a particular month's contract will begin. The exchange also specifies the last day on which trading can take place for a given contract. Trading generally ceases a few days before the last day on which delivery can be made.  

# Price Quotes  

The exchange defines how prices will be quoted. For example, crude oil futures prices are quoted in dollars and cents. Treasury bond and Treasury note futures prices are quoted in dollars and thirty-seconds of a dollar.  

# Price Limits and Position Limits  

For most contracts, daily price movement limits are specified by the exchange. If in a day the price moves down from the previous day's close by an amount equal to the daily price limit, the contract is said to be limit down. If it moves up by the limit, it is said to be limit up. A limit move is a move in either direction equal to the daily price limit. Normally, trading ceases for the day once the contract is limit up or limit down. However, in some instances the exchange has the authority to step in and change the limits.  

The purpose of daily price limits is to prevent large price movements from occurring. because of speculative excesses. However, limits can become an artificial barrier to trading when the price of the underlying commodity is advancing or declining rapidly. Whether price limits are, on balance, good for futures markets is controversial..  

Position limits are the maximum number of contracts that a speculator may hold. The purpose of these limits is to prevent speculators from exercising undue influence on. the market.
