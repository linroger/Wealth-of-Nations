# 2.11 FORWARD vs. FUTURES CONTRACTS  

The main differences between forward and futures contracts are summarized in Table 2.3.   
Both contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset for a certain price at a certain future.   
time. A forward contract is traded in the over-the-counter market and there is no standard contract size or standard delivery arrangements.A single delivery date is usually.   
specified and the contract is usually held to the end of its life and then settled. A futures.   
contract is a standardized contract traded on an exchange. A range of delivery dates is.   
usually specified. It is settled daily and usually closed out prior to maturity..  

# Profits from Forward and Futures Contracts  

Suppose that the sterling exchange rate for a 90-day forward contract is 1.2000 and that this rate is also the futures price for a contract that will be delivered in exactly 90 days. What is the difference between the gains and losses under the two contracts?.  

Under the forward contract, the whole gain or loss is realized at the end of the life of the contract. Under the futures contract, the gain or loss is realized day by day. because of the daily settlement procedures. Suppose that trader A is long 1 million in.  

Table 2.3 Comparison of forward and futures contracts.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Forward</td><td>Futures</td></tr><tr><td>Private contract between two parties</td><td>Traded on an exchange</td></tr><tr><td>Notstandardized</td><td>Standardized contract</td></tr><tr><td>Usually one specified delivery date</td><td>Range of delivery dates</td></tr><tr><td>Settled at end of contract</td><td>Settled daily</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery or final cash settlement</td><td>Contract is usually closed out</td></tr><tr><td>usuallytakesplace</td><td>prior to maturity</td></tr><tr><td>Some credit risk</td><td>Virtually no credit risk</td></tr></table></body></html>  

a 90-day forward contract and trader B is long 1 million in 90-day futures contracts. (Because each futures contract is for the purchase or sale of $\pm62{,}500$ , trader B must purchase a total of 16 contracts.) Assume that the spot exchange rate in 90 days. proves to be 1.4000 dollars per pound. Trader A makes a gain of $\$200,000$ on the 90th day. Trader B makes the same gain--but spread out over the 90-day period. On some. days trader B may realize a loss, whereas on other days he or she makes a gain. However, in total, when losses are netted against gains, there is a gain of. $\$200,000$ over the 90-day period.  

# Foreign Exchange Quotes  

Both forward and futures contracts trade actively on foreign currencies. However, there is sometimes a difference in the way exchange rates are quoted in the two markets. For example, futures prices where one currency is the U.S. dollar are always quoted as the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency or as the number of U.S. cents per unit of the foreign currency. Forward prices are always quoted in the same way as spot prices. This means that, for the British pound, the euro, the Australian dollar, and the New Zealand dollar, the forward quotes show the number of U.S. dollars per unit of the foreign currency and are directly comparable with futures quotes. For other major currencies, forward quotes show the number of units of the foreign currency per U.S. dollar (UsD). Consider the Canadian dollar (CAD).A futures price quote of 0.7500 USD per CAD corresponds to a forward price quote of 1.3333 CAD per USD $(1.3333=1/0.7500)$  

# SUMMARY  

A very high proportion of the futures contracts that are traded do not lead to the delivery of the underlying asset. Traders usually enter into offsetting contracts to close. out their positions before the delivery period is reached. However,it is the possibility of final delivery that drives the determination of the futures price. For each futures contract, there is a range of days during which delivery can be made and a well-defined delivery procedure. Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying asset..  

The specification of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two. sides to any contract must know what can be delivered, where delivery can take place,. and when delivery can take place. They also need to know details on the trading hours, how prices will be quoted, maximum daily price movements, and so on. New contracts must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading. starts.  

Margin accounts are an important aspect of futures markets. A trader keeps a margin. account with his or her broker. The account is adjusted daily to reflect gains or losses,. and from time to time the broker may require the account to be topped up if adverse. price movements have taken place. The broker either must be a clearing house member or must maintain a margin account with a clearing house member. Each clearing house member maintains a margin account with the exchange clearing house. The balance in the account is adjusted daily to reflect gains and losses on the business for which the. clearing house member is responsible.  

In over-the-counter derivatives markets, transactions are cleared either bilaterally or centrally. When bilateral clearing is used, collateral frequently has to be posted by one. or both parties to reduce credit risk. When central clearing is used, a central counter-. party (CCP) stands between the two sides. It requires each side to provide margin and. performs much the same function as an exchange clearing house..  

Forward contracts differ from futures contracts in a number of ways. Forward. contracts are private arrangements between two parties, whereas futures contracts are traded on exchanges. There is generally a single delivery date in a forward contract,. whereas futures contracts frequently involve a range of such dates. Because they are not traded on exchanges, forward contracts do not need to be standardized. A forward contract is not usually settled until the end of its life, and most contracts do in fact lead to delivery of the underlying asset or a cash settlement at this time..  

In the next few chapters we shall examine in more detail the ways in which forward and futures contracts can be used for hedging. We shall also look at how forward and. futures prices are determined.

# Hedging Strategies Using Futures  

Many of the participants in futures markets are hedgers. Their aim is to use futures markets to reduce a particular risk that they face. This risk might relate to fluctuations in the price of oil, a foreign exchange rate, the level of the stock market, or some other variable. A perfect hedge is one that completely eliminates the risk. Perfect hedges are rare. For the most part, therefore, a study of hedging using futures contracts is a study of the ways in which hedges can be constructed so that they perform as close to perfectly. as possible.  

In this chapter we consider a number of general issues associated with the way hedges are set up. When is a short futures position appropriate? When is a long futures position appropriate? Which futures contract should be used? What is the optimal size of the futures position for reducing risk? At this stage, we restrict our attention to what might be termed hedge-and-forget strategies. We assume that no attempt is made to adjust the hedge once it has been put in place. The hedger simply takes a futures position at the beginning of the life of the hedge and closes out the position at the end. of the life of the hedge. In Chapter 19 we will examine dynamic hedging strategies in which the hedge is monitored closely and frequent adjustments are made.  

The chapter initially treats futures contracts as forward contracts (that is, it ignores daily settlement). Later it explains adjustments that are necessary to take account of the difference between futures and forwards.
