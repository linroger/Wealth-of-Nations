# 2.5 OTC MARKETS  

Over-the-counter (OTC) markets, introduced in Chapter 1, are markets where compan-. ies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange. Credit risk has traditionally been a feature of OTC derivatives markets. Consider two companies, A. and B, that have entered into a number of derivatives transactions. If A defaults when the net value of the outstanding transactions to B is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by B. Similarly, if B defaults when the net value of outstanding transactions to A is positive, a loss is likely to be taken by company A. In an attempt to reduce credit risk,. the OTC market has borrowed some ideas from exchange-traded markets. We now. discuss this.  

# Central Counterparties  

We briefly mentioned CCPs in Section 1.2. These are clearing houses for standard OTC transactions that perform much the same role as exchange clearing houses. Members of the CCP, similarly to members of an exchange clearing house, have to provide both initial margin and daily variation margin. Like members of an exchange clearing house, they are also required to contribute to a guaranty fund.  

Once an OTC derivative transaction has been agreed between two parties A and B, it can be presented to a CCP. Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house of a futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade.) For example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to  

1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and   
2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.  

It takes on the credit risk of both A and B.  

All members of the CCP are required to provide initial margin to the CCP.. Transactions are valued daily and there are daily variation margin payments to or. from the member. If an OTC market participant is not itself a member of a CCP, it can arrange to clear its trades through a CCP member. It will then have to provide margin to the CCP member. Its relationship with the CCP member is similar to the relationship. between a broker and a futures exchange clearing house member..  

Following the financial crisis that started in 2007, regulators have become more concerned about systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). One result of this, mentioned in Section 1.2, has been legislation requiring that most standard OTC transactions between financial institutions be handled by CCPs.  

# Bilateral Clearing  

Those OTC transactions that are not cleared through CCPs are cleared bilaterally. In.   
the bilaterally cleared OTC market, two companies A and B usually enter into a master agreement covering all their trades.' This agreement usually includes an annex,referred.   
to as the credit support annex or CSA, requiring A or B, or both, to provide collateral..   
The collateral is similar to the margin required by exchange clearing houses or CCPs.   
from their members.  

Collateral agreements in CSAs usually require transactions to be valued each day. A. simple two-way agreement between companies A and B might work as follows. If, from one day to the next, the transactions between A and B increase in value to A by X (and therefore decrease in value to B by X), B is required to provide collateral worth X to A.. If the reverse happens and the transactions increase in value to B by X (and decrease in value to A by X), A is required to provide collateral worth. $\boldsymbol{\mathrm X}$ to B. (To use the terminology of exchange-traded markets, X is the variation margin provided.) Collateral. agreements and the way counterparty credit risk is assessed for bilaterally cleared transactions is discussed further in Chapter 24.  

# Business Snapshot 2.2 Long-Term Capital Management's Big Loss  

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund formed in the mid-1990s, always collateralized its bilaterally cleared transactions. The hedge fund's investment strategy was known as convergence arbitrage.A very simple example of what it might do is the following. It would find two bonds, X and Y, issued by the same company that promised the same payoffs, with X being less liquid (i.e., less actively traded) than Y. The market places a value on liquidity. As a result the price of. $\boldsymbol{\mathrm X}$ would be less than the price of Y. LTCM would buy X, short Y, and wait, expecting the prices of the two bonds to converge at some future time..  

When interest rates increased, the company expected both bonds to move down in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it paid on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it received on bond Y. Similarly, when interest rates decreased, LTCM expected both bonds to move up in price by about the same amount, so that the collateral it received on bond X would be about the same as the collateral it paid on bond Y. It therefore expected that there would be no significant outflow of funds as a result of its collateralization agreements.  

In August 1998, Russia defaulted on its debt and this led to what is termed a "flight to quality" in capital markets. One result was that investors valued liquid. instruments more highly than usual and the spreads between the prices of the liquid and illiquid instruments in LTCM's portfolio increased dramatically. The prices of the bonds LTCM had bought went down and the prices of those it had shorted increased. It was required to post collateral on both. The company experienced difficulties because it was highly leveraged. Positions had to be closed out and LTCM lost about $\$4$ billion. If the company had been less highly leveraged, it would. probably have been able to survive the flight to quality and could have waited for. the prices of the liquid and illiquid bonds to move back closer to each other.  

It has historically been relatively rare for a CSA to require initial margin. This is changing. Starting in 2016, regulations were introduced to require both initial margin and variation margin for bilaterally cleared transactions between financial institutions.4 The initial margin is posted with a third party.  

Collateral significantly reduces credit risk in the bilaterally cleared OTC market (and so the use of CCPs for standard transactions between financial institutions and regulations requiring initial margin for other transactions between financial institutions should reduce risks for the financial system). Collateral agreements were used by hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) for its bilaterally cleared derivatives in the 1990s. The agreements allowed LTCM to be highly levered. They did provide credit. protection, but as described in Business Snapshot 2.2, the high leverage left the hedge. fund exposed to other risks.  

Figure 2.2 illustrates the way bilateral and central clearing work. (It makes the simplifying assumption that there are only eight market participants and one CCP). Under bilateral clearing there are many different agreements between market participants, as indicated in Figure 2.2a. If all OTC contracts were cleared through a single CCP, we would move to the situation shown in Figure 2.2b. In practice, because not all OTC transactions are routed through CCPs and there is more than one CCP, the market. has elements of both Figure $2.2\mathrm{a}$ and Figure 2.2b.5

# Futures Trades vs. OTC Trades  

Regardless of how transactions are cleared, initial margin when provided in the form of cash usually earns interest. The daily variation margin provided by a clearing house. member for futures contracts does not earn interest. This is because the variation margin constitutes the daily settlement. Transactions in the OTC market, whether cleared through CCPs or cleared bilaterally, are usually not settled daily. For this reason, the daily variation margin that is provided by the member of a CCP or, as a result of a CSA, earns interest when it is in the form of cash..  

Securities can be often be used to satisfy margin/collateral requirements. The market. value of the securities is reduced by a certain amount to determine their value for margin purposes. This reduction is known as a haircut..
