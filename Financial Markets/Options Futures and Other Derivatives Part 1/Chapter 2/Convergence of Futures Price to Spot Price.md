# 2.3 CONVERGENCE OF FUTURES PRICE TO SPOT PRICE  

As the delivery period for a futures contract is approached, the futures price converges to the spot price of the underlying asset. When the delivery period is reached, the futures price equals--or is very close to--the spot price..  

To see why this is so, we first suppose that the futures price is above the spot price during the delivery period. Traders then have a clear arbitrage opportunity:  

1. Sell (i.e., short) a futures contract   
2. Buy the asset   
3. Make delivery.  

These steps are certain to lead to a profit equal to the amount by which the futures price exceeds the spot price. As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price will fall. Suppose next that the futures price is below the spot price during the delivery period. Companies interested in acquiring the asset will find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and then wait for delivery to be made. As they do so, the futures price will tend to rise.  

The result is that the futures price is very close to the spot price during the delivery. period. Figure 2.1 illustrates the convergence of the futures price to the spot price. In Figure 2.1a the futures price is above the spot price prior to the delivery period. In.

Figure 2.1 Relationship between futures price and spot price as the delivery period is approached: (a) Futures price above spot price; (b) futures price below spot price.   
Figure 2.1b the futures price is below the spot price prior to the delivery period. The circumstances under which these two patterns are observed are discussed in Chapter 5.
