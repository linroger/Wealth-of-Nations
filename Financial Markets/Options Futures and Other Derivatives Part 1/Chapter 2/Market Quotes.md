# 2.6 MARKET QUOTES  

Futures quotes are available from exchanges and several online sources. Table 2.2 is. constructed from quotes provided by the CME Group for a number of different. commodities on May 21, 2020. Quotes for index, currency, and interest rate futures are given in Chapters 3, 5, and 6, respectively..  

The asset underlying the futures contract, the contract size, and the way the price is. quoted are shown at the top of each section of Table 2.2. The first asset is gold. The. contract size is 100 ounces and the price is quoted as dollars per ounce. The maturity month of the contract is indicated in the first column of the table..  

# Prices  

The first three numbers in each row of Table 2.2 show the opening price, the highest price in trading so far during the day, and the lowest price in trading so far during the day. The opening price is representative of the prices at which contracts were trading immediately after the start of trading on a day. For the June 2020 gold contract, the opening price on May 21, 2020 was $\$1,751.7$ per ounce. The highest price during the day was also $\$1,751.7$ per ounce and the lowest price during the day was $\$1,713.3$ per ounce.  

# Settlement Price  

The settlement price is the price used for calculating daily gains and losses and margin requirements. It is usually calculated as the price at which the contract traded immediately before the end of a day's trading session. The fourth number in Table 2.2 shows the settlement price the previous day. The fifth number shows the most recent trading price, and the sixth number shows the price change from the previous day's settlement price. In the case of the June 2020 gold contract, the previous day's settlement price was $\$1,752.1$ . The most recent trade was at. $\$1,725.5$ $\$26.6$ lower than the previous day's settlement price. If. $\$1,725.5$ proved to be the settlement price on May 21, 2020, the margin account of a trader with a long position in one contract would lose 2,660 on May 21, 2020 and the margin account of a trader with a short position in one contract would gain this amount on that date.  

# Trading Volume and Open Interest  

The final column of Table 2.2 shows the trading volume. The trading volume is the number of contracts traded in a day. It can be contrasted with the open interest, which is the number of contracts outstanding, that is, the number of long positions or, equivalently, the number of short positions.  

If there is a large amount of trading by day traders (i.e., traders who enter into a. position and close it out on the same day), the volume of trading in a day can be greater than either the beginning-of-day or end-of-day open interest..  

# Patterns of Futures  

Futures prices can show a number of different patterns. They can increase with the. maturity of the futures contract, decrease with the maturity of the futures contract, or show a mixed pattern where the futures price sometimes increases and sometimes. decreases with maturity. A futures market where prices increase with maturity is known. as a normal market. A futures market where futures prices decrease with maturity is. known as an inverted market. Table 2.2 indicates that gold, crude oil, corn, and wheat. exhibited a normal market on May 21, 2020 for the range of maturities considered.. Soyabeans and live cattle exhibit a mixture of the two patterns: normal for some maturity ranges and inverted for others.
