# 2.10 ACCOUNTING AND TAX  

The full details of the accounting and tax treatment of futures contracts are beyond the scope of this book. A trader who wants detailed information on this should obtain professional advice. This section provides some general background information.  

# Accounting  

Accounting standards require changes in the market value of a futures contract to be recognized when they occur unless the contract qualifies as a hedge. If the contract does qualify as a hedge, gains or losses are generally recognized for accounting purposes in. the same period in which the gains or losses from the item being hedged are recognized.. The latter treatment is referred to as hedge accounting.  

Consider a company with a December year end. In September 2020 it buys a March. 2021 corn futures contract and closes out the position at the end of February 2021.. Suppose that the futures prices are 350 cents per bushel when the contract is entered into, 370 cents per bushel at the end of 2020, and 380 cents per bushel when the contract is closed out. The contract is for the delivery of 5,o00 bushels. If the contract does not qualify as a hedge, the gains for accounting purposes are.  

$$
5,000\times(3.70-3.50)=\S1.000
$$  

in 2020 and  

$$
5,000\times(3.80-3.70)=\S500
$$  

in 2021. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021 so that the contract qualifies for hedge accounting, the entire gain of. $\$1,500$ is realized in 2021 for accounting purposes.  

The treatment of hedging gains and losses is sensible. If the company is hedging the purchase of 5,000 bushels of corn in February 2021, the effect of the futures contract is to ensure that the price paid (inclusive of the futures gain or loss) is close to 350 cents per bushel. The accounting treatment reflects that this price is paid in 2021.  

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued FAS 133 and ASC 815. explaining when companies can and cannot use hedge accounting. The International Accounting Standards Board has similarly issued IAS 39 and IFRS 9..  

# Tax  

Under the U.S. tax rules, two key issues are the nature of a taxable gain or loss and the timing of the recognition of the gain or loss. Gains or losses are either classified as capital gains or losses or alternatively as part of ordinary income.  

For a corporate taxpayer, capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, and the ability to deduct losses is restricted. Capital losses are deductible only to the extent of capital gains. A corporation may carry back a capital loss for three years and carry it forward for up to five years. For a noncorporate taxpayer, short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, but long-term capital gains are subject to a maximum capital gains tax rate of $20\%$ . (Long-term capital gains are gains from the sale of a capital asset held for longer than one year; short-term capital gains are the gains from the sale of a capital asset held one year or less.) Taxpayers earning income above certain thresholds pay an additional $3.8\%$ on all investment income. For a noncorporate taxpayer, capital losses are deductible to the extent of capital gains plus ordinary income up to $\$3,000$ and can be carried forward indefinitely.  

Generally, positions in futures contracts are treated as if they are closed out on the last day of the tax year. For the noncorporate taxpayer, this gives rise to capital gains. and losses that are treated as if they were. $60\%$ long term and $40\%$ short term without regard to the holding period. This is referred to as the $\mathrm{^{\circ}60/40^{\circ}}$ rule. A noncorporate taxpayer may elect to carry back for three years any net losses from the. $60/40$ rule to offset any gains recognized under the rule in the previous three years..  

Hedging transactions are exempt from this rule. The definition of a hedge transaction for tax purposes is different from that for accounting purposes. The tax regulations define a hedging transaction as a transaction entered into in the normal course of business primarily for one of the following reasons:  

1. To reduce the risk of price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to property that is held or to be held by the taxpayer for the purposes of producing. ordinary income   
2. To reduce the risk of price or interest rate changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made by the taxpayer. A hedging transaction must be clearly identified in a timely manner in the company's.   
records as a hedge. Gains or losses from hedging transactions are treated as ordinary.   
income. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses from hedging transactions.   
generally matches the timing of the recognition of income or expense associated with the transaction being hedged.
