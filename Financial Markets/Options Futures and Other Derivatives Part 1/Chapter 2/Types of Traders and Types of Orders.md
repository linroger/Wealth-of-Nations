# 2.8 TYPES OF TRADERS AND TYPES OF ORDERS  

There are two main types of traders executing trades: futures commission merchants (FCMs) and locals. FCMs are following the instructions of their clients and charge a commission for doing so; locals are trading on their own account.  

Individuals taking positions, whether locals or the clients of FCMs, can be categor-. ized as hedgers, speculators, or arbitrageurs, as discussed in Chapter 1. Speculators can be classified as scalpers, day traders, or position traders. Scalpers are watching for very. short-term trends and attempt to profit from small changes in the contract price. They usually hold their positions for only a few minutes. Day traders hold their positions for less than one trading day. They are unwilling to take the risk that adverse news will occur overnight. Position traders hold their positions for much longer periods of time. They hope to make significant profits from major movements in the markets..  

# Orders  

The simplest type of order placed with a broker is a market order. It is a request that a trade be carried out immediately at the best price available in the market. However, there are many other types of orders. We will consider those that are more commonly used.  

A limit order specifies a particular price. The order can be executed only at this price or at one more favorable to the trader. Thus, if the limit price is $\$30$ for a trader wanting to buy, the order will be executed only at a price of $\$30$ or less. There is, of course, no guarantee that the order will be executed at all, because the limit price may never be reached.  

A stop order or stop-loss order also specifies a particular price. The order is executed. at the best available price once a bid or ask is made at that particular price or a lessfavorable price. Suppose a stop order to sell at $\$30$ is issued when the market price. is $\$35$ It becomes an order to sell when and if the price falls to $\$30$ In effect, a stop order becomes a market order as soon as the specified price has been hit. The purpose. of a stop order is usually to close out a position if unfavorable price movements take place. It limits the loss that can be incurred.  

A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The order. becomes a limit order as soon as a bid or ask is made at a price equal to or less favorable. than the stop price. Two prices must be specified in a stop-limit order: the stop price and the limit price. Suppose that at the time the market price is. $\$35$ , a stop-limit order to buy is issued with a stop price of $\$40$ and a limit price of $\$41$ As soon as there is a bid or ask at $\$40$ , the stop-limit becomes a limit order at. $\$41$ If the stop price and the limit price are the same, the order is sometimes called a stop-and-limit order..  

A market-if-touched (MIT) order is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price. In effect, an MIT becomes a market order once the specified price has been hit. An MIT is also known as a board order. Consider a trader who has a long position in a futures contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract. A stop order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable price movements. By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur.  

A discretionary order or market-not-held order is traded as a market order except that execution may be delayed at the broker's discretion in an attempt to get a better price.  

Some orders specify time conditions. Unless otherwise stated, an order is a day order and expires at the end of the trading day. A time-of-day order specifies a particular period of time during the day when the order can be executed.An open order or a goodtill-canceled order is in effect until executed or until the end of trading in the particular contract. A fill-or-kill order, as its name implies, must be executed immediately on receipt or not at all.
