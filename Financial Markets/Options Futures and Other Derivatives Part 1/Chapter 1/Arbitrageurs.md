# 1.9 ARBITRAGEURS  

Arbitrageurs are a third important group of participants in futures, forward, and. options markets. Arbitrage involves locking in a riskless profit by simultaneously. entering into transactions in two or more markets. In later chapters we will see how arbitrage is sometimes possible when the futures price of an asset gets out of line with. its spot price. We will also examine how arbitrage can be used in options markets. This section illustrates the concept of arbitrage with a very simple example..  

Let us consider a stock that is traded on both the New York Stock Exchange (www.nyse.com) and the London Stock Exchange (www.londonstockexchange.com). Suppose that the stock price is $\$120$ in New York and 100 in London at a time when the exchange rate is $\$1.2300$ per pound. An arbitrageur could simultaneously buy 100 shares of the stock in New York and sell them in London to obtain a risk-free profit of  

$$
100\times[(\S1.23\times100)-\S120]
$$  

or $\$300$ in the absence of transactions costs. Transactions costs would probably.   
eliminate the profit for a small trader. However, a large investment bank faces very.   
low transactions costs in both the stock market and the foreign exchange market. It would find the arbitrage opportunity very attractive and would try to take as much.   
advantage of it as possible.  

Arbitrage opportunities such as the one just described cannot last for long. As. arbitrageurs buy the stock in New York, the forces of supply and demand will cause the dollar price to rise. Similarly, as they sell the stock in London, the sterling price will be driven down. Very quickly the two prices will become equivalent at the current exchange rate. Indeed, the existence of profit-hungry arbitrageurs makes it unlikely that a major disparity between the sterling price and the dollar price could ever exist in the first place. Generalizing from this example, we can say that the very existence of arbitrageurs means that in practice only very small arbitrage opportunities are observed. in the prices that are quoted in most financial markets. In this book most of the arguments concerning futures prices, forward prices, and the values of option contracts will be based on the assumption that no arbitrage opportunities exist..
