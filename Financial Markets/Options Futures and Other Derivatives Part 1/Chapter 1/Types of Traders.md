# 1.6 TYPES OF TRADERS  

Derivatives markets have been outstandingly successful. The main reason is that they. have attracted many different types of traders and have a great deal of liquidity. When a trader wants to take one side of a contract, there is usually no problem in finding. someone who is prepared to take the other side..  

Three broad categories of traders can be identified: hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs. Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable. Speculators use them to bet on the future direction of a market variable. Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit. As described in Business Snapshot 1.3, hedge funds have become big users of derivatives for all three purposes.  

In the next few sections, we will consider the activities of each type of trader in more detail.  

# Business Snapshot 1.3 Hedge Funds.  

Hedge funds have become major users of derivatives for hedging, speculation, and arbitrage. They are similar to mutual funds in that they invest funds on behalf of clients. However, they accept funds only from professional fund managers or financially sophisticated individuals and do not publicly offer their securities. Mutual funds are subject to regulations requiring that the shares be redeemable at any time, that investment policies be disclosed, that the use of leverage be limited, and so on. Hedge funds are relatively free of these regulations. This gives them a great deal of freedom to develop sophisticated, unconventional, and proprietary investment strategies. The fees charged by hedge fund managers are dependent on the fund's performance and are relatively high-typically 1 to $2\%$ of the amount invested plus $20\%$ of the profits. Hedge funds have grown in popularity, with about $\$2$ trillion being invested in them throughout the world. "Funds of funds" have been set up to invest in a portfolio of hedge funds.  

The investment strategy followed by a hedge fund manager often involves using derivatives to set up a speculative or arbitrage position. Once the strategy has been defined, the hedge fund manager must:  

1. Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed.   
2. Decide which risks are acceptable and which will be hedged.   
3. Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives) to hedge the unacceptable risks.  

Here are some examples of the labels used for hedge funds together with the trading strategies followed:  

Long/Short Equities: Purchase securities considered to be undervalued and short those considered to be overvalued in such a way that the exposure to the overall direction of the market is small.   
Convertible Arbitrage: Take a long position in a thought-to-be-undervalued convertible bond combined with an actively managed short position in the underlying equity. Distressed Securities: Buy securities issued by companies in, or close to, bankruptcy. Emerging Markets: Invest in debt and equity of companies in developing or emerging countries and in the debt of the countries themselves.   
Global Macro: Carry out trades that reflect anticipated global macroeconomic trends. Merger Arbitrage: Trade after a possible merger or acquisition is announced so that a profit is made if the announced deal takes place.
