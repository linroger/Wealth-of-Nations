# 1.3 FORWARD CONTRACTS  

A relatively simple derivative is a forward contract. It is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price. It can be contrasted with a spot. contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset almost immediately. A forward. contract is traded in the over-the-counter market-usually between two financial institutions or between a financial institution and one of its clients..  

One of the parties to a forward contract assumes a long position and agrees to buy the underlying asset on a certain specified future date for a certain specified price. The other party assumes a short position and agrees to sell the asset on the same date for the same price.  

Forward contracts on foreign exchange are very popular. Most large banks employ both spot and forward foreign-exchange traders. As we shall see in Chapter 5, there is a relationship between forward prices, spot prices, and interest rates in the two currencies. Table 1.1 provides quotes for the exchange rate between the British pound (GBP) and the U.S. dollar (UsD) that might be made by a large international bank on May 21, 2020. The quote is for the number of USD per GBP. The first row indicates that the bank is prepared to buy GBP (also known as sterling) in the spot market (i.e., for virtually immediate delivery) at the rate of $\$1.2317$ per GBP and sell sterling in the spot. market at $\$1.2320$ per GBP. The second, third, and fourth rows indicate that the bank is prepared to buy sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at. $\$1.2318$ $\$1.2320$ , and $\$1.2324$ per GBP, respectively, and to sell sterling in 1, 3, and 6 months at. $\$1.2322$ $\$1.2325$ , and $\$1.230$ per GBP, respectively.  

Table 1.1 Spot and forward quotes for the exchange rate between USD and GBP on May 21,2020 (GBP $=$ British pound; $\mathrm{USD}=$ U.S. dollar; quote is number of USD per GBP).

1 When a CCP stands between two sides in an OTC transaction, two transactions are considered to have been created for the purposes of the BIS statistics.. $^2\mathrm{~A~}$ contract that is worth $\$1$ million to one side and $-\$1$ million to the other side would be counted as having a gross market value of $\$1$ million.  

Forward contracts can be used to hedge foreign currency risk. Suppose that, on May 21, 2020, the treasurer of a U.S. corporation knows that the corporation will pay 1 million in 6 months (i.e., on November 21, 2020) and wants to hedge against exchange rate moves. Using the quotes in Table 1.1, the treasurer can agree to buy 1 million 6 months forward at an exchange rate of 1.2230. The corporation then has a long forward contract on GBP. It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will buy 1 million from the bank for. $\$1.230$ million. The bank has a short forward contract on. GBP. It has agreed that on November 21, 2020, it will sell 1 million for $\$1.230$ million. Both sides have made a binding commitment..  

# Payoffs from Forward Contracts  

Consider the position of the corporation in the trade we have just described. What are the possible outcomes? The forward contract obligates the corporation to buy 1 million for $\$1,223,000$ If the spot exchange rate rose to, say, 1.3000, at the end of the 6 months,. the forward contract would be worth $\$77,000$ $(=\$1,300,0000-$ to thee corporation. It would enable 1 million to be purchased at an exchange rate of 1.2230 rather than 1.3000. Similarly, if the spot exchange rate fell to 1.2000 at the. end of the 6 months, the forward contract would have a negative value to the corporation of $\$23,000$ because it would lead to the corporation paying. $\$23,000$ more than the market price for the sterling..  

In general, the payoff from a long position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is  

$$
S_{T}-K
$$  

where $K$ is the delivery price and. $S_{T}$ is the spot price of the asset at maturity of the. contract. This is because the holder of the contract is obligated to buy an asset worth $S_{T}$ for $K$ . Similarly, the payoff from a short position in a forward contract on one unit of an asset is  

$$
K-S_{T}
$$  

These payoffs can be positive or negative. They are illustrated in Figure 1.2. Because it. costs nothing to enter into a forward contract, the payoff from the contract is also the trader's total gain or loss from the contract..  

In the example just considered, $K=1.2230$ and the corporation has a long contract. When $S_{T}=1.3000$ , the payoff is $\$0.077$ per f1; when $S_{T}=1.2000$ , it is $-\$0.023$ per f1.  

# Forward Prices and Spot Prices  

We shall be discussing in some detail the relationship between spot and forward prices in Chapter 5. For a quick preview of why the two are related, consider a stock that pays no dividend and is worth $\$60$ . You can borrow or lend money for 1 year at $5\%$ . What should the 1-year forward price of the stock be?

Figure 1.2 Payoffs from forward contracts: (a) long position, (b) short position. Delivery price $=K$ ; price of asset at contract maturity $=S_{T}$  

The answer is $\$60$ grossed up at. $5\%$ for 1 year, or $\$63$ . If the forward price is more than this, say $\$67$ you could borrow $\$60$ , buy one share of the stock, and sell it forward for $\$67.$ After paying off the loan, you would net a profit of $\$4$ in 1 year. If the forward price is less than $\$63$ , say $\$58$ , an investor owning the stock as part of a portfolio would sell the stock for $\$60$ and enter into a forward contract to buy it back for $\$58$ in 1 year. The proceeds of investment would be invested at $5\%$ to earn $\$3.$ The investor would end up $\$5$ better off than if the stock were kept in the portfolio for the year.
