# 1.2 OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKETS  

Not all derivatives trading is on exchanges. Many trades take place in the over-thecounter (OTC) market. Banks, other large financial institutions, fund managers, and corporations are the main participants in OTC derivatives markets. Once an OTC trade has been agreed, the two parties can either present it to a central counterparty. (CCP) or clear the trade bilaterally. A CCP is like an exchange clearing house. It stands between the two parties to the derivatives transaction so that one party does not have to bear the risk that the other party will default. When trades are cleared. bilaterally, the two parties have usually signed an agreement covering all their trans-. actions with each other. The issues covered in the agreement include the circumstances under which outstanding transactions can be terminated, how settlement amounts are calculated in the event of a termination, and how the collateral (if any) that must be posted by each side is calculated. CCPs and bilateral clearing are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.  

Large banks often act as market makers for the more commonly traded instruments. This means that they are always prepared to quote a bid price (at which they are prepared to take one side of a derivatives transaction) and an ask price (at which they are prepared to take the other side).  

# Business Snapshot 1.1 The Lehman Bankruptcy  

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history and its ramifications were felt throughout derivatives markets. Almost until the end, it seemed as though there was a good chance that Lehman would survive. A number of companies (e.g., the Korean Development Bank, Barclays Bank in the United Kingdom, and Bank of America) expressed interest in buying it, but none of these was able to close a deal. Many people thought that Lehman was "too big to fail' and that the U.S. government would have to bail it out if no purchaser could be found. This proved not to be the case.  

How did this happen? It was a combination of high leverage,risky investments, and liquidity problems. Commercial banks that take deposits are subject to regulations on the amount of capital they must keep. Lehman was an investment bank and not subject to these regulations. By 2007, its leverage ratio had increased to 31:1, which means that a $3{-}4\%$ decline in the value of its assets would wipe out its capital. Dick Fuld, Lehman's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, encouraged an aggressive deal-making, risk-taking culture. He is reported to have told his executives: "Every day is a battle. You have to kill the enemy"' The Chief Risk Officer at Lehman was competent, but did not have much influence and was even removed from the executive committee in 2007. The risks taken by Lehman included large positions in the instruments created from subprime mortgages, which will be described in Chapter 8. Lehman funded much of its operations with short-term debt. When there was a loss of confidence in the company, lenders refused to renew this funding, forcing it into bankruptcy.  

Lehman was very active in the over-the-counter derivatives markets. It had over a million transactions outstanding with about 8,000 different counterparties. Lehman's. counterparties were often required to post collateral and this collateral had in many. cases been used by Lehman for various purposes. Litigation aimed at determining. who owes what to whom continued for many years after the bankruptcy filing..  

Prior to the financial crisis, which started in 2007 and is discussed in some detail in Chapter 8, OTC derivatives markets were largely unregulated. Following the financial crisis and the failure of Lehman Brothers (see Business Snapshot 1.1), we have seen the development of many new regulations affecting the operation of OTC markets. The main objectives of the regulations are to improve the transparency of OTC markets and reduce systemic risk (see Business Snapshot 1.2). The over-the-counter market in some respects is being forced to become more like the exchange-traded market. Three important changes are:  

1. Standardized OTC derivatives between two financial institutions in the United States must, whenever possible, be traded on what are referred to a swap execution facilities (SEFs). These are platforms similar to exchanges where market participants can post bid and ask quotes and where market participants can trade by accepting the quotes of other market participants.   
2. There is a requirement in most parts of the world that a CCP be used for most standardized derivatives transactions between financial institutions..   
3. All trades must be reported to a central repository.  

# Business Snapshot 1.2 Systemic Risk  

Systemic risk is the risk that a default by one financial institution will create a "ripple effect" that leads to defaults by other financial institutions and threatens the stability of the financial system. There are huge numbers of over-the-counter transactions between banks. If Bank A fails, Bank B may take a huge loss on the transactions it has with Bank A. This in turn could lead to Bank B failing. Bank C that has many outstanding transactions with both Bank A and Bank B might then take a large loss and experience severe financial difficulties; and so on.  

The financial system has survived defaults such as Drexel in 1990 and Lehman. Brothers in 2008, but regulators continue to be concerned. During the market turmoil of 2007 and 2008, many large financial institutions were bailed out, rather than being. allowed to fail, because governments were concerned about systemic risk..  

# Market Size  

Both the over-the-counter and the exchange-traded market for derivatives are huge. The number of derivatives transactions per year in OTC markets is smaller than in exchangetraded markets, but the average size of the transactions is much greater. Although the statistics that are collected for the two markets are not exactly comparable, it is clear that the volume of business in the over-the-counter market is much larger than in the exchange-traded market. The Bank for International Settlements (www.bis.org) started collecting statistics on the markets in 1998. Figure 1.1 compares (a) the estimated total principal amounts underlying transactions that were outstanding in the over-the-counter markets between June 1998 and December 2019 and (b) the estimated total value of the assets underlying exchange-traded contracts during the same period. Using these measures, the size of the over-the-counter market in December 2019 was $\$558.5$ trillion and the size of the exchange-traded market was $\$96.5$ trillion. Figure 1.1 shows that the OTC market grew rapidly up to 2007, but has seen very little net growth since then. One reason for the lack of growth is the popularity of compression. This is a procedure where two or more counterparties restructure transactions with each other with the result that the underlying principal is reduced.

Figure 1.1 Size of over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivatives markets.  

In interpreting Figure 1.1, we should bear in mind that the principal underlying an over-the-counter transaction is not the same as its value. An example of an over-thecounter transaction is an agreement to buy 100 million U.S. dollars with British pounds at a predetermined exchange rate in 1 year. The total principal amount underlying this transaction is $\$100$ million. However, the value of the transaction might be only $\$1$ million. The Bank for International Settlements estimates the gross market value of all over-the-counter transactions outstanding in December 2019 to be about. $\$11.6$ trillion.2
