# 1.1 EXCHANGE-TRADED MARKETS  

A derivatives exchange is a market where individuals and companies trade standardized contracts that have been defined by the exchange. Derivatives exchanges have existed for a long time. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) was established in 1848 to bring farmers and merchants together. Initially its main task was to standardize the quantities and qualities of the grains that were traded. Within a few years, the first futures-type contract was developed. It was known as a to-arrive contract. Speculators soon became interested in the contract and found trading the contract to be an attractive alternative to trading the grain itself. A rival futures exchange, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), was established in 1919. Now futures exchanges exist all over the world. (See table at the end of the book.) The CME and CBOT have merged to form the CME Group (www.cmegroup.com), which also includes the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), and the Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT).  

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE, www.cboe.com) started trading call option contracts on 16 stocks in 1973. Options had traded prior to 1973, but the CBOE succeeded in creating an orderly market with well-defined contracts. Put option contracts started trading on the exchange in 1977. The CBOE now trades options on thousands of stocks and many different stock indices. Like futures, options have proved to be very popular contracts. Many other exchanges throughout the world now trade options. (See table at the end of the book.) The underlying assets include foreign currencies and futures contracts as well as stocks and stock indices.  

Once two traders have agreed to trade a product offered by an exchange,it is handled by the exchange clearing house. This stands between the two traders and manages the. risks. Suppose, for example, that trader A enters into a futures contract to buy. 100 ounces of gold from trader B in six months for $\$1,750$ per ounce. The result of this trade will be that A has a contract to buy 100 ounces of gold from the clearing. house at $\$1,750$ per ounce in six months and B has a contract to sell 100 ounces of gold. to the clearing house for $\$1,750$ per ounce in six months. The advantage of this arrangement is that traders do not have to worry about the creditworthiness of the people they are trading with. The clearing house takes care of credit risk by requiring. each of the two traders to deposit funds (known as margin) with the clearing house to ensure that they will live up to their obligations. Margin requirements and the operation. of clearing houses are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.  

# Electronic Markets  

Traditionally derivatives exchanges have used what is known as the open outcry system.. This involves traders physically meeting on the floor of the exchange, shouting, and. using a complicated set of hand signals to indicate the trades they would like to carry. out. Exchanges have largely replaced the open outcry system by electronic trading. This involves traders entering their desired trades at a keyboard and a computer being used to match buyers and sellers. The open outcry system has its advocates, but, as time passes, it is becoming less and less used..  

Electronic trading has led to a growth in high-frequency trading. This involves the use of algorithms to initiate trades, often without human intervention, and has become an important feature of derivatives markets.
