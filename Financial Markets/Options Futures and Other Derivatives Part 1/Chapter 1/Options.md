# 1.5 OPTIONS  

Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. There are two types of option. A call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price. The price in the contract is known as the exercise price or strike price; the date in the contract is known as the expiration date or maturity. American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date. European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself.? Most of the options that are traded on exchanges are American. In the exchange-traded equity option market, one contract is usually an agreement to buy or sell 100 shares. European options are generally easier to analyze than American options, and some of the properties of an American option are frequently deduced from those of its European counterpart.  

It should be emphasized that an option gives the holder the right to do something.. The holder does not have to exercise this right. This is what distinguishes options from forwards and futures, where the holder is obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset. Whereas it costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, except for margin requirements which will be discussed in Chapter 2, there is a cost to acquiring an option..  

The largest exchange in the world for trading stock options is the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE; www.cboe.com). Table 1.2 gives the bid and ask quotes for some of the call options trading on Apple (ticker symbol: AAPL), on May 21, 2020. Table 1.3 does the same for put options trading on Apple on that date. The quotes are taken from the CBOE website. The Apple stock price at the time of the quotes was bid 316.23, ask 316.50. The bid-ask spread for an option (as a percent of the price) is usually much greater than that for the underlying stock and depends on the volume of trading. The option strike prices in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are $\$290$ $\$300$ $\$310$ $\$320$ $\$330$ , and $\$340$ The maturities are June 2020, September 2020, and December 2020. The precise expiration day is the third Friday of the expiration month. The June options expire on June 19, 2020, the September options on September 18, 2020, and the December options on December 18, 2020.

The tables illustrate a number of properties of options. The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases. These properties of options will be discussed further in Chapter 11.  

Suppose a trader instructs a broker to buy one December call option contract on. Apple with a strike price of. $\$340$ . The broker will relay these instructions to a trader at. the CBOE and the deal will be done. The (ask) price indicated in Table 1.2 is $\$20.30$ This is the price for an option to buy one share. In the United States, an option contract is a contract to buy or sell 100 shares. Therefore, the trader must arrange for. $\$2,030$ to be remitted to the exchange through the broker. The exchange will then arrange for this amount to be passed on to the party on the other side of the transaction.  

In our example, the trader has obtained at a cost of. $\$2,030$ the right to buy 100 Apple. shares for $\$340$ each. If the price of Apple does not rise above $\$340$ by December 18, 2020, the option is not exercised and the trader loses $\$2,030$ 4 But if Apple does well and the option is exercised when the bid price for the stock is $\$400$ , the trader is able to. buy 100 shares at $\$340$ and immediately sell them for. $\$400$ for a profit of $\$6,000$ , or $\$3,970$ when the initial cost of the option contract is taken into account.5.  

An alternative trade would be to sell one September put option contract with a strike. price of $\$290$ at the bid price of $\$12.70$ . The trader receives. $100\times12.70=\$1,270.$ If the Apple stock price stays above. $\$290$ , the option is not exercised and the trader makes a. $\$1,270$ profit. However, if stock price falls and the option is exercised when the stock price is $\$250$ , there is a loss. The trader must buy 100 shares at. $\$290$ when they are worth. only $\$250$ . This leads to a loss of. $\$4,000$ , or $\$2,730$ when the initial amount received for the option contract is taken into account.

Figure 1.3 Net profit from (a) purchasing a contract consisting of 100 Apple December call options with a strike price of $\$340$ and (b) selling a contract consisting of 100 Apple September put options with a strike price of $\$290$  

The stock options trading on the CBOE are American. If we assume for simplicity that they are European, so that they can be exercised only at maturity, the trader's profit. as a function of the final stock price for the two trades we have considered is shown in Figure 1.3.  

Further details about the operation of options markets and how prices such as those in Tables 1.2 and 1.3 are determined by traders are given in later chapters. At this stage we note that there are four types of participants in options markets:.  

1. Buyers of calls   
2. Sellers of calls   
3. Buyers of puts   
4. Sellers of puts.  

Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.
