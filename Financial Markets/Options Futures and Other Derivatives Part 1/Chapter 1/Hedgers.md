# 1.7 HEDGERS  

In this section we illustrate how hedgers can reduce their risks with forward contracts and options.  

# Hedging Using Forward Contracts  

Suppose that it is May 21, 2020, and ImportCo, a company based in the United States, knows that it will have to pay 10 million on August 21, 2020, for goods it has purchased from a British supplier. The GBP/USD exchange rate quotes made by a financial institution are shown in Table 1.1. ImportCo could hedge its foreign exchange risk by buying pounds (GBP) from the financial institution in the 3-month forward market at 1.2225. This would have the effect of fixing the price to be paid to the British exporter at $\$12,225,000$  

Consider next another U.S. company, which we will refer to as ExportCo, that is exporting goods to the United Kingdom and, on May 21, 2020, knows that it will receive 30 million 3 months later. ExportCo can hedge its foreign exchange risk by selling. 30 million in the 3-month forward market at an exchange rate of 1.2220. This would. have the effect of locking in the U.S. dollars to be realized for the sterling at. $\$36,460,000$  

Note that a company might do better if it chooses not to hedge than if it chooses to hedge. Alternatively, it might do worse. Consider ImportCo. If the exchange rate is 1.2000 on August 21 and the company has not hedged, the 10 million that it has to pay will cost $\$12,000,000$ , which is less than. $\$12,225,000$ . On the other hand, if the exchange rate is 1.3000, the. $\pounds10$ million will cost. $\$13,000,000$ and the company will wish that it had hedged! The position of ExportCo if it does not hedge is the reverse. If the exchange rate in August proves to be less than 1.2220, the company will wish that it had hedged; if the rate is greater than 1.2220, it will be pleased that it has not done so.  

This example illustrates a key aspect of hedging. The purpose of hedging is to reduce risk. There is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging.  

# Hedging Using Options  

Options can also be used for hedging. Consider an investor who in May of a particular year owns 1,000 shares of a particular company. The share price is $\$28$ per share. The investor is concerned about a possible share price decline in the next 2 months and wants protection. The investor could buy ten July put option contracts on the company's stock with a strike price of $\$27.50$ . Each contract is on 100 shares, so this. would give the investor the right to sell a total of 1,000 shares for a price of $\$27.50$ . If the quoted option price is. $\$1$ , then each option contract would cost. $100\times\$1=\$100$ and the total cost of the hedging strategy would be. $10\times\S100=\S1{,}000$

Figure 1.4 Value of the stock holding in 2 months with and without hedging.  

The strategy costs $\$1,000$ but guarantees that the shares can be sold for at least $\$27.50$ per share during the life of the option. If the market price of the stock falls below $\$27.50$ the options will be exercised, so that $\$27,500$ is realized for the entire holding. When the cost of the options is taken into account, the amount realized is. $\$26,500$ . If the market price stays above $\$27.50$ , the options are not exercised and expire worthless. However, in. this case the value of the holding is always above $\$27,500$ (or above $\$26,500$ when the cost of the options is taken into account). Figure 1.4 shows the net value of the portfolio (after. taking the cost of the options into account) as a function of the stock price in 2 months. The dotted line shows the value of the portfolio assuming no hedging.  

# A Comparison  

There is a fundamental difference between the use of forward contracts and options for hedging. Forward contracts are designed to neutralize risk by fixing the price that the hedger will pay or receive for the underlying asset. Option contracts, by contrast, provide insurance. They offer a way for investors to protect themselves against adverse price movements in the future while still allowing them to benefit from favorable price movements. Unlike forwards, options involve the payment of an up-front fee.
