# 1.8 SPECULATORS  

We now move on to consider how futures and options markets can be used by specu-. lators. Whereas hedgers want to avoid exposure to adverse movements in the price of an asset, speculators wish to take a position in the market. Either they are betting that the. price of the asset will go up or they are betting that it will go down..  

# Speculation Using Futures  

Consider a U.S. speculator who in May thinks that the British pound will strengthen relative to the U.S. dollar over the next 2 months and is prepared to back that hunch to the tune of 250,000. One thing the speculator can do is purchase 250,000 in the spot market in the hope that the sterling can be sold later at a higher price. (The sterling once purchased would be kept in an interest-bearing account.) Another possibility is to take a long position in four CME July futures contracts on sterling. (Each futures contract is for the purchase of 62,500 in July.) Table 1.4 summarizes the two alternatives on the assumption that the current exchange rate is 1.2220 dollars per pound and the July futures price is 1.2223 dollars per pound. If the exchange rate turns out to be 1.3000 dollars per pound in July, the futures contract alternative enables the speculator to realize a profit of $(1.3000-1.2223)\times250.000=\$19.425.$ The spot market alternative leads to 250,000 units of an asset being purchased for $\$1.2320$ in May and sold for $\$1.3000$ in July, so that a profit of $(1.3000-1.2220)\times250,000=\$19,500$ is made. If the exchange rate falls to 1.2000 dollars per pound, the futures contract gives rise to a $(1.2223-1.2000)\times250.000=\$5.575$ loss, whereas the spot market alternative gives rise to a loss of $(1.2220-1.2000)\times250.000=\S5.500.$ The futures market alternative. appears to give rise to slightly worse outcomes for both scenarios. But this is because the calculations do not reflect the interest that is earned or paid..

What then is the difference between the two alternatives? The first alternative of. buying sterling requires an up-front investment of $250,000\times1.2220=\S305,500$ In contrast, the second alternative requires only a small amount of cash to be deposited by the speculator in what is termed a "margin account". (The operation of margin. accounts is explained in Chapter 2.) In Table 1.4, the initial margin requirement is. assumed to be $\$5,000$ per contract, or $\$20,000$ in total. The futures market allows the speculator to obtain leverage. With a relatively small initial outlay, a large speculative. position can be taken.  

# Speculation Using Options  

Options can also be used for speculation. Suppose that it is October and a speculator considers that a stock is likely to increase in value over the next 2 months. The stock price is currently. $\$20$ , and a 2-month call option with a $\$23.50$ strike price is currently. selling for $\$1$ Table 1.5 illustrates two possible alternatives, assuming that the specu-. lator is willing to invest. $\$2,000$ . One alternative is to purchase 100 shares; the other. involves the purchase of 2,000 call options (i.e., 20 call option contracts). Suppose that. the speculator's hunch is correct and the price of the stock rises to. $\$27$ by December. The first alternative of buying the stock yields a profit of.  

$$
100\times(\mathbb{S}27-\mathbb{S}20)=\mathbb{S}700
$$  

However, the second alternative is far more profitable. A call option on the stock with a strike price of $\$22.50$ gives a payoff of $\$4.50$ , because it enables something worth. $\$27$ to

be bought for $\$23.50$ . The total payoff from the 2,000 options that are purchased under the second alternative is  

$$
2,000\times\mathbb{\S}4.50=\mathbb{\S}9,000
$$  

Subtracting the original cost of the options yields a net profit of  

$$
\$9,000
$$  

The options strategy is, therefore, 10 times more profitable than directly buying the stock. Options also give rise to a greater potential loss. Suppose the stock price falls to $\$15$ by December. The first alternative of buying stock yields a loss of  

$$
100\times(\mathbb{\S}20-\mathbb{\S}15)=\mathbb{\S}500
$$  

Because the call options expire without being exercised, the options strategy would lead to a loss of $\$2,000$ --the original amount paid for the options. Figure 1.5 shows the profit or loss from the two strategies as a function of the stock price in 2 months.  

Options like futures provide a form of leverage. For a given investment, the use of options magnifies the financial consequences. Good outcomes become very good, while bad outcomes result in the whole initial investment being lost..  

# A Comparison  

Futures and options are similar instruments for speculators in that they both provide a way in which a type of leverage can be obtained. However, there is an important difference between the two. When a speculator uses futures, the potential loss as well as the potential gain is very large. When options are purchased, no matter how bad things get, the speculator's loss is limited to the amount paid for the options.
