# 1.4 FUTURES CONTRACTS  

Like a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy or.   
sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are normally traded on an exchange. To make trading possible, the.   
exchange specifies certain standardized features of the contract. As the two parties to the.   
contract do not necessarily know each other, the exchange clearing house stands between.   
them as mentioned earlier.  

Two large exchanges on which futures contracts are traded are the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which have now merged to form the CME Group. On these and other exchanges throughout the world, a very wide range of commodities and financial assets form the underlying assets in the various contracts. The commodities include pork bellies, live cattle, sugar, wool, lumber, copper, aluminum, gold, and tin. The financial assets include stock indices, currencies, and Treasury bonds. Futures prices are regularly reported in the financial press. Suppose that, on September 1, the December futures price of gold is quoted as. $\$1,750$ This is the price, exclusive of commissions, at which traders can agree to buy or sell gold for December delivery. It is determined in the same way as other prices (i.e., by the laws of supply and demand). If more traders want to go long than to go short, the price goes up; if the reverse is true, then the price goes down..  

Further details on issues such as margin requirements, daily settlement procedures, delivery procedures, bid-ask spreads, and the role of the exchange clearing house are given in Chapter 2.
