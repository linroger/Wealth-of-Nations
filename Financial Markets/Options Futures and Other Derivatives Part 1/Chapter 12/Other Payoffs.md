# 12.5 OTHER PAYOFFS  

This chapter has demonstrated just a few of the ways in which options can be used to produce an interesting relationship between profit and stock price. If European options expiring at time $T$ were available with every single possible strike price, any payoff function at time $T$ could in theory be obtained. The easiest illustration of this involves. butterfly spreads. Recall that a butterfly spread is created by buying options with strike prices $K_{1}$ and $K_{3}$ and selling two options with strike price $K_{2}$ , where $K_{1}<K_{2}<K_{3}$ and $K_{3}-K_{2}=K_{2}-K_{1}$ Figure 12.13 shows the payoff from a butterfly spread. The pattern could be described as a spike. As $K_{1}$ and $K_{3}$ move closer together, the spike becomes smaller. Through the judicious combination of a large number of very small spikes, any. payoff function can in theory be approximated as accurately as desired..

# SUMMARY  

Principal-protected notes can be created from a zero-coupon bond and a European call option. They are attractive to some investors because the issuer of the product guarantees that the purchaser will receive his or her principal back regardless of the performance of the asset underlying the option.  

A number of common trading strategies involve a single option and the underlying. stock. For example, writing a covered call involves buying the stock and selling a call option on the stock; a protective put involves buying a put option and buying the stock.. The former is similar to selling a put option; the latter is similar to buying a call option..  

Spreads involve either taking a position in two or more calls or taking a position in two or more puts. A bull spread can be created by buying a call (put) with a low strike price and selling a call (put) with a high strike price. A bear spread can be created by buying a put (call) with a high strike price and selling a put (call) with a low strike price. A butterfly spread involves buying calls (puts) with a low and high strike price and selling two calls (puts) with some intermediate strike price. A calendar spread involves selling a call (put) with a short time to expiration and buying a call (put) with a longer time to expiration. A diagonal spread involves a long position in one option and a short position in another option such that both the strike price and the expiration date are different.  

Combinations involve taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. A straddle combination involves taking a long position in a call and a long position in a put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strip consists of a long position in one call and two puts with the same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two calls and one put with the same strike price and expiration date. A strangle consists of a long position in a call and a put with different strike prices and the same expiration date. There are many other ways in which options can be used to produce interesting payoffs. It is not surprising that option trading has steadily increased in popularity and continues to fascinate investors.

# Binomial Trees  

A useful and very popular technique for pricing an option involves constructing a. binomial tree. This is a diagram representing different possible paths that might be followed by the stock price over the life of an option. The underlying assumption is that the stock price follows a random walk. In each time step, it has a certain probability of. moving up by a certain percentage amount and a certain probability of moving down by. a certain percentage amount. In the limit, as the time step becomes smaller, this model is the same as the Black-Scholes-Merton model we will be discussing in Chapter 15.. Indeed, in the appendix to this chapter, we show that the European option price given. by the binomial tree converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton price as the time step. becomes smaller.  

The material in this chapter is important for a number of reasons. First, it explains the nature of the no-arbitrage arguments that are used for valuing options. Second, it explains the binomial tree numerical procedure that is widely used for valuing American options and other derivatives. Third, it introduces a very important principle known as risk-neutral valuation.  

The general approach to constructing trees in this chapter is the one used in an. important paper published by Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein in 1979. More details on numerical procedures using binomial trees are given in Chapter 21..
