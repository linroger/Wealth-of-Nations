# 12.4 COMBINATIONS  

A combination is an option trading strategy that involves taking a position in both calls and puts on the same stock. We will consider straddles, strips, straps, and strangles.  

# Straddle  

One popular combination is a straddle, which involves buying a European call and put. with the same strike price and expiration date. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.10.. The strike price is denoted by $K.$ If the stock price is close to this strike price at expiration. of the options, the straddle leads to a loss. However, if there is a sufficiently large move in either direction, a significant profit will result. The payoff from a straddle is calculated in Table 12.5.  

A straddle is appropriate when an investor is expecting a large move in a stock price but does not know in which direction the move will be. Consider an investor who feels that the price of a certain stock, currently valued at. $\$69$ by the market, will move significantly in the next 3 months. The investor could create a straddle by buying both a put and a call with a strike price of. $\$70$ and an expiration date in 3 months. Suppose that the call costs $\$4$ and the put costs $\$3$ If the stock price stays at $\$69$ , it is easy to see that the strategy costs the investor. $\$6$ (An up-front investment of $\$7$ is required, the call expires worthless, and the put expires worth. $\$1$ ) If the stock price moves to. $\$70$ , a loss of $\$7$ is experienced. (This is the worst that can happen.) However, if the stock price. jumps up to $\$90$ , a profit of $\$13$ is made; if the stock moves down to. $\$55$ , a profit of $\$8$ is made; and so on. As discussed in Business Snapshot 12.2 an investor should carefully consider whether the jump that he or she anticipates is already reflected in option prices before putting on a straddle trade..  

The straddle in Figure 12.10 is sometimes referred to as a bottom straddle or straddle purchase. A top straddle or straddle write is the reverse position. It is created by selling a call and a put with the same exercise price and expiration date. It is a highly risky strategy..

# Business Snapshot 12.2 How to Make Money from Trading Straddles  

Suppose that a big move is expected in a company's stock price because there is a takeover bid for the company or the outcome of a major lawsuit involving the company is about to be announced. Should you trade a straddle?.  

A straddle seems a natural trading strategy in this case. However, if your view of the company's situation is much the same as that of other market participants, this view will be reflected in the prices of options. Options on the stock will be significantly more expensive than options on a similar stock for which no jump is expected. The V-shaped profit pattern from the straddle in Figure 12.10 will have moved downward, so that a. bigger move in the stock price is necessary for you to make a profit..  

For a straddle to be an effective strategy, you must believe that there are likely to be. big movements in the stock price and these beliefs must be different from those of most other investors. Market prices incorporate the beliefs of market participants. To make money from any investment strategy, you must take a view that is different from. most of the rest of the market--and you must be right!.  

If the stock price on the expiration date is close to the strike price, a profit results.   
However, the loss arising from a large move is unlimited..  

# Strips and Straps  

A strip consists of a long position in one European call and two European puts with the same strike price and expiration date. A strap consists of a long position in two European calls and one European put with the same strike price and expiration date. The profit patterns from strips and straps are shown in Figure 12.11. In a strip the investor is betting that there will be a big stock price move and considers a decrease in the stock price to be more likely than an increase. In a strap the investor is also betting that there will be a big stock price move. However, in this case, an increase in the stock price is considered to be more likely than a decrease.

# Strangles  

In a strangle, sometimes called a bottom vertical combination, an investor buys a European put and a European call with the same expiration date and different strike prices. The profit pattern is shown in Figure 12.12. The call strike price,. $K_{2}$ , is higher than the put strike price, $K_{1}$ . The payoff function for a strangle is calculated in Table 12.6..  

A strangle is a similar strategy to a straddle. The investor is betting that there will be a large price move, but is uncertain whether it will be an increase or a decrease. Comparing Figures 12.12 and 12.10, we see that the stock price has to move farther. in a strangle than in a straddle for the investor to make a profit. However, the downside risk if the stock price ends up at a central value is less with a strangle..  

The profit pattern obtained with a strangle depends on how close together the strike prices are. The farther they are apart, the less the downside risk and the farther the stock price has to move for a profit to be realized.  

The sale of a strangle is sometimes referred to as a top vertical combination. It can be appropriate for an investor who feels that large stock price moves are unlikely. However, as with sale of a straddle, it is a risky strategy involving unlimited potential loss to the investor.
