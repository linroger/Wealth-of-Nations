# 8.2 THE U.S. HOUSING MARKET  

Figure 8.4 gives the S&P/Case-Shiller composite-10 index for house prices in the United States between January 1987 and February 2020. This tracks house prices for ten metropolitan areas of the United States. It shows that, in about the year 2o00, house prices started to rise much faster than they had in the previous decade. The very low level of interest rates between 2002 and 2005 was an important contributory factor, but the bubble in house prices was also fueled by mortgage-lending practices.  

The 2000 to 2006 period was characterized by a huge increase in what is termed subprime mortgage lending. Subprime mortgages are mortgages that are considered to be significantly more risky than average. Before 2000, most mortgages classified as subprime were second mortgages. After 2000, this changed as financial institutions became more comfortable with the notion of a subprime first mortgage.  

# The Relaxation of Lending Standards  

The relaxation of lending standards and the growth of subprime mortgages made house purchase possible for many families that had previously been considered to be not sufficiently creditworthy to qualify for a mortgage. These families increased the demand. for real estate and prices rose. To mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders, it was. attractive to make more loans, particularly when higher house prices resulted. More lending meant bigger profits. Higher house prices meant that the lending was well covered by the underlying collateral. If the borrower defaulted, it was less likely that the resulting foreclosure would lead to a loss..

Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders naturally wanted to keep increasing their. profits. Their problem was that, as house prices rose, it was more difficult for first-time buyers to afford a house. In order to continue to attract new entrants to the housing. market, they had to find ways to relax their lending standards even more-and this is exactly what they did. The amount lent as a percentage of the house price increased. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMS) were developed where there was a low "teaser" rate of interest that would last for two or three years and be followed by a rate that was much higher.3 A typical teaser rate was about $6\%$ and the interest rate after the end of the teaser rate period was typically six-month LIBOR plus. $6\%$ .4 However, teaser rates as low as $1\%$ or $2\%$ have been reported. Lenders also became more. cavalier in the way they reviewed mortgage applications. Indeed, the applicant's income and other information reported on the application form were frequently not checked.  

# Subprime Mortgage Securitization  

Subprime mortgages were frequently securitized in the way indicated in Figures 8.1 to 8.3. The investors in tranches created from subprime mortgages usually had no.  

guarantees that interest and principal would be paid. Securitization played a part in the crisis. The behavior of mortgage originators was influenced by their knowledge that. mortgages would be securitized. When considering new mortgage applications, the. question was not "Is this a credit risk we want to assume?" Instead it was "Is this a mortgage we can make money on by selling it to someone else?".  

When a portfolio of mortgages was securitized, the buyers of the products that were created felt they had enough information if they knew, for each mortgage in the portfolio, the loan-to-value ratio (i.e., the ratio of the size of the loan to the assessed. value of the house) and the borrower's FICO score. Other information on the mortgage application forms was considered irrelevant and, as already mentioned, was often not even checked by lenders. The most important thing for the lender was whether the mortgage could be sold to others-and this depended largely on the loan-to-value ratio and the applicant's FICO score.  

It is interesting to note in passing that both the loan-to-value ratio and the FICO score were of doubtful quality. The property assessors who determined the value of a house at the time of a mortgage application sometimes succumbed to pressure from the lenders to come up with high values. Potential borrowers were sometimes counseled to take certain actions that would improve their FICO scores.7  

Why was the government not regulating the behavior of mortgage lenders? The answer is that the U.S. government had since the 1990s been trying to expand home ownership and had been applying pressure to mortgage lenders to increase loans to lowand moderate-income people. Some state legislators, such as those in Ohio and Georgia, were concerned about what was going on and wanted to curtail predatory lending. However, the courts decided that national standards should prevail.  

A number of terms have been used to describe mortgage lending during the period. leading up to the 2007-8 crisis. One is "liar loans" because individuals applying for a. mortgage, knowing that no checks would be carried out, sometimes chose to lie on the application form. Another term used to describe some borrowers is "NINJA"' (no. income, no job, no assets).  

# The Bubble Bursts  

All bubbles burst eventually and this one was no exception. In 2007, many mortgage holders found they could no longer afford their mortgages when the teaser rates ended. This led to foreclosures and large numbers of houses coming on the market, which in turn led to a decline in house prices. Other mortgage holders, who had borrowed $100\%$ or close to $100\%$ , of the cost of a house found that they had negative equity.  

One of the features of the U.S. housing market is that mortgages are nonrecourse in many states. This means that, when there is a default, the lender is able to take possession of the house, but other assets of the borrower are off-limits. Consequently, the borrower has a free American-style put option. He or she can at any time sell the house to the lender for the principal outstanding on the mortgage. This feature encouraged speculative activity and was partly responsible for the bubble. Market participants realized belatedly how costly and destabilizing the put option could be. If the borrower had negative equity, the optimal decision was to exchange the house for the outstanding principal on the mortgage. The house was then sold by the lender, adding to the downward pressure on house prices.  

It would be a mistake to assume that all mortgage defaulters were in the same position. Some were unable to meet mortgage payments and suffered greatly when they had to give up their homes. But many of the defaulters were speculators who bought multiple homes as rental properties and chose to exercise their put options. It was their tenants who suffered. There are also reports that some house owners (who were not speculators) were quite creative in extracting value from their put options. After handing the keys to their houses to the lender, they turned around and bought (sometimes at a bargain price) other houses that were in foreclosure. Imagine two people owning identical houses next to each other. Both have mortgages of $\$230,000$ . Both houses are worth $\$200,000$ and in foreclosure can be expected to sell for. $\$170,000$ . What is the owners' optimal strategy? The answer is that each person should exercise the put option and buy the neighbor's house..  

The United States was not alone in having declining real estate prices. Prices declined. in many other countries as well. Real estate prices in the United Kingdom were particularly badly affected. As Figure 8.4 indicates, average house prices in the United. States did recover after 2012.  

# The Losses  

As foreclosures increased, the losses on mortgages also increased. It might be thought that a $35\%$ reduction in house prices would lead to at most a $35\%$ loss of principal on defaulting mortgages. In fact, the losses were far greater than that. Houses in foreclosure were often in poor condition and sold for a small fraction of their value prior to the financial crisis. In 2008 and 2009, losses as high $75\%$ of the mortgage principal were reported for mortgages on houses in foreclosure in some cases.  

Investors in tranches that were formed from the mortgages incurred big losses. The. value of the ABS tranches created from subprime mortgages was monitored by a series. of indices known as ABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated. BBB had lost about $80\%$ of their value by the end of 2007 and about $97\%$ of their value by mid-2009. The value of the ABS CDO tranches created from BBB tranches was monitored by a series of indices known as TABX. These indices indicated that the tranches originally rated AAA lost about. $80\%$ of their value by the end of 2007 and. were essentially worthless by mid-2009.  

Financial institutions such as UBS, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup had big positions. in some of the tranches and incurred huge losses, as did the insurance giant AIG, which. provided protection against losses on ABS CDO tranches that had originally been rated. AAA. Many financial institutions had to be rescued with government funds. There have been few worse years in financial history than 2008. Bear Stearns was taken over by JP Morgan Chase; Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America; Goldman Sachs. and Morgan Stanley, which had formerly been investment banks, became bank holding. companies with both commercial and investment banking interests; and Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail (see Business Snapshot 1.1).  

# Credit Spreads  

The losses on securities backed by residential mortgages led to a severe financial crisis. In 2006, banks were reasonably well capitalized, loans were relatively easy to obtain, and credit spreads (the excess of the interest rate on a loan over the risk-free interest rate) were low. By 2008, the situation was totally different. The capital of banks had been badly eroded by their losses. They had become much more risk-averse and were reluctant to lend. Creditworthy individuals and corporations found borrowing difficult. Credit spreads had increased dramatically. The world experienced its worst recession in several generations. The three-month LIBOR-OIS spread briefly reached 364 basis points in October 2008, indicating an extreme reluctance of banks to lend to each other for longer periods than overnight. Another measure of the stress in financial markets is the TED spread. This is the excess of the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate over the threemonth Treasury interest. In normal market conditions, it is 30 to 50 basis points. It reached over 450 basis points in October 2008.
