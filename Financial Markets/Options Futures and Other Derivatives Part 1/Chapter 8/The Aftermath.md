# 8.4 THE AFTERMATH  

Prior to the crisis, over-the-counter derivatives markets were largely unregulated. This has changed. As mentioned in earlier chapters, there is now a requirement that most. standardized over-the-counter derivatives be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs). This means that they are treated similarly to derivatives such as futures that trade on exchanges. Banks are usually members of one or more CCPs. When trading standardized derivatives, they are required to post initial margin and variation margin with the CCP and are also required to contribute to a default fund. For transactions between financial institutions that continue to be cleared bilaterally, collateral arrangements are now regulated rather than chosen by the parties involved.  

The bonuses paid by banks have come under more scrutiny and in some jurisdictions there are limits on the size of the bonuses that can be paid. The way bonuses are paid is changing. Before the crisis it was common for a trader's bonus for a year to be paid in full at the end of the year with no possibility of the bonus having to be returned. It is now more common for this bonus to be spread over several years so that part of the bonus can be clawed back if results are not as good as expected.  

# Business Snapshot 8.1 The Basel Committee  

As the activities of banks became more global in the 1980s, it became necessary for regulators in different countries to work together to determine an international regulatory framework. As a result the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed. In 1988, it published a set of rules for the capital banks were required to keep for credit risk. These capital requirements have become known as Basel I. They were modified to accommodate the netting of transactions in 1995. In 1996 a new capital requirement for market risk was published. This capital requirement was implemented in 1998. In 1999 significant changes were proposed for the calculation of the capital requirements for credit risk and a capital requirement for operational risk was introduced. These rules are referred to as Basel II. Basel II is considerably more complicated than Basel I and its implementation was delayed until 2007 (later in some countries). During the financial crisis and afterwards, the Basel committee introduced new regulatory requirements known as Basel II.5, which increased capital for market risk. This was followed by Basel III, which tightened capital requirements and introduced liquidity requirements. Basel IV, which will be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises Basel III, placing more emphasis on standardized approaches developed by the Basel committee for determining capital requirements.  

The Dodd-Frank Act in the United States and similar legislation in the United Kingdom and European Union provide for more oversight of financial institutions and include much new legislation affecting financial institutions. For example, in the United States proprietary trading and other similar activities of deposit-taking institutions are being restricted. (This is known as the "Volcker rule" because it was proposed by. former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker.) An independent committee in the United Kingdom chaired by Sir John Vickers has proposed that the retail operations of. banks be ring-fenced. The Liikanen committee in the European Union similarly recommends that proprietary trading and other high-risk activities be separated from other banking activities.  

Banks throughout the world are regulated by the Basel Committee on Banking. Supervision.1o Prior to the crisis, the committee implemented regulations known as. Basel I and Basel II. These are summarized in Business Snapshot 8.1. Following the. crisis, it has implemented what is known as "Basel II.5.' This increases the capital requirements for market risk. Basel III was published in 2010 has been implemented over a period lasting until 2019. It increases the amount of capital and quality of capital. that banks are required to keep. It also requires banks to satisfy certain liquidity requirements. As discussed in Business Snapshot 4.2, one cause of problems during the crisis was the tendency of banks to place too much reliance on the use of short-term liabilities for long-term funding needs. The liquidity requirements are designed to make it more difficult for them to do this. Basel IV, to be implemented between 2022 and 2027, revises some of the rules in Basel III and reduces the extent to which banks can. use their own internal models to determine their capital requirements..  

# SUMMARY  

Securitization is a process used by banks to create securities from loans and other. income-producing assets. The securities are sold to investors. This removes the loans from the banks' balance sheets and enables the banks to expand their lending faster than would otherwise be possible. The first loans to be securitized were mortgages in the. United States in the 1960s and 1970s. Investors who bought the mortgage-backed. securities were not exposed to the risk of borrowers defaulting because the loans were backed by the Government National Mortgage Association. Later automobile loans,. corporate loans, credit card receivables, and subprime mortgages were securitized. In. many cases, investors in the securities created from these instruments did not have a guarantee against defaults.  

Securitization played a part in the financial crisis that started in 2007. Tranches were created from subprime mortgages and new tranches were then created from these. tranches. The origins of the crisis can be found in the U.S. housing market. The U.S. government was keen to encourage home ownership. Interest rates were low. Mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders found it attractive to do more business by relaxing their lending standards. Securitization meant that the investors bearing the credit risk were not usually the same as the original lenders. Rating agencies gave AAA ratings to the. senior tranches that were created. There was no shortage of buyers for these AAA-rated tranches because their yields were higher than the yields on other AAA-rated securities. Banks thought the "good times" would continue and, because compensation plans. focused their attention on short-term profits, chose to ignore the housing bubble and its potential impact on some very complicated products they were trading..  

House prices rose as both first-time buyers and speculators entered the market. Some. mortgages had included a low "teaser rate" for two or three years. After the teaser rate. ended, there was a significant increase in the interest rate for some borrowers. Unable to meet the higher interest rate they had no choice but to default. This led to foreclosures and an increase in the supply of houses be sold. The price increases between 2000 and 2006 began to be reversed. Speculators and others who found that the amount owing. on their mortgages was greater than the value of their houses (i.e., they had negative. equity) defaulted. This accentuated the price decline.  

Banks are paying a price for the crisis. New legislation and regulation will reduce their. profitability. For example, capital requirements are being increased, liquidity regulations are being introduced, and OTC derivatives are being much more tightly regulated..

8.20. Suppose that the principal assigned to the senior, mezzanine, and equity tranches is $70\%$ $20\%$ , and $10\%$ for both the ABS and the ABS CDO in Figure 8.3. What difference does this make to Table 8.1?   
8.21. "Resecuritization was a badly flawed idea. AAA tranches created from the mezzanine tranches of ABSs are bound to have a higher probability of default than the AAA-rated tranches of ABSs." Discuss this point of view..   
8.22. Suppose that mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDOs, similar to those in Figure 8.3, are resecuritized to form what is referred to as a "CDO squared.' As in the case of tranches created from ABSs in Figure 8.3, $65\%$ of the principal is allocated to a AAA tranche,. $25\%$ to a BBB tranche, and $10\%$ to the equity tranche. How high does the loss percentage. have to be on the underlying assets for losses to be experienced by a AAA-rated tranche that is created in this way? (Assume that every portfolio of assets that is used to create ABSs experiences the same loss rate.)

XVAs  

Before moving on to discuss how options and other more complex derivatives are valued, we consider various price adjustments that have become important in derivatives markets. These are the credit valuation adjustment (CVA),the debit (or debt) valuation adjustment (DVA), the funding valuation adjustment (FVA), the margin valuation adjustment (MVA), and the capital valuation adjustment (KVA). Collectively the. adjustments are known as XVAs. Some of the adjustments have a stronger theoretical. basis than others. As we shall see, financial economists have no problem with CVA and DVA, but have reservations about FVA, MVA, and KVA..
