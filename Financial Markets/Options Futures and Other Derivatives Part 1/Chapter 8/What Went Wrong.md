# 8.3 WHAT WENT WRONG?  

"Irrational exuberance" is a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal. Reserve Board, to describe the behavior of investors during the bull market of the 1990s. It can also be applied to the period leading up to the financial crisis. Mortgage lenders, the investors in tranches of ABSs and ABS CDOs that were created from residential mortgages, and the companies that sold protection on the tranches assumed that the good times would last for ever. They thought that U.S. house prices would continue to increase. There might be declines in one or two areas, but the possibility of the. widespread decline shown in Figure 8.4 was a scenario not considered by most people..  

Many factors contributed to the crisis that started in 2007. Mortgage originators used lax lending standards. Products were developed to enable mortgage originators to profitably transfer credit risk to investors. Rating agencies moved from their traditional business of rating bonds, where they had a great deal of experience, to rating structured products, which were relatively new and for which there were relatively little historical. data. The products bought by investors were complex and in many instances investors. and rating agencies had inaccurate or incomplete information about the quality of the underlying assets. Investors in the structured products that were created thought they had found a money machine and chose to rely on rating agencies rather than forming their own opinions about the underlying risks. The return offered by the products rated AAA was high compared with the returns on bonds rated AAA.  

Structured products such as those in Figures 8.1 and 8.3 are highly dependent on the default correlation between the underlying assets. Default correlation measures the tendency for different borrowers to default at about the same time. If the default correlation between the underlying assets in Figure 8.1 is low, the AAA-rated tranches are very unlikely to experience losses. As this default correlation increases, they become more vulnerable. The tranches of ABS CDOs in Figure 8.3 are even more heavily dependent on default correlation.  

If mortgages exhibit moderate default correlation (as they do in normal times), there. is very little chance of a high overall default rate and the AAA-rated tranches of both ABSs and ABS CDOs that are created from mortgages are fairly safe. However, as.  

many investors found to their cost, default correlations tend to increase in stressed market conditions. This makes very high default rates possible.  

There was a tendency to assume that a tranche with a particular rating could be. equated to a bond with the that rating. The rating agencies published the criteria they. used for rating tranches. S&P and Fitch rated a tranche so as to ensure that the probability of the tranche experiencing a loss was the same as the probability of a similarly rated bond experiencing a loss. Moody's rated a tranche so that the expected loss from the tranche was the the same as the expected loss from a similarly rated bond.9. The procedures used by rating agencies were therefore designed to ensure that one aspect of the loss distributions of tranches and bonds were matched. However, other aspects of the distributions were liable to be quite different..  

The differences between tranches and bonds were accentuated by the fact tranches were often quite thin. The AAA tranches often accounted for about $80\%$ of the principal as in Figure 8.1, but it was not unusual for there to be 15 to 20 other tranches. Each of these tranches would be. $1\%$ or $2\%$ wide. Such thin tranches are. likely to either incur no losses or be totally wiped out. The chance of investors recovering part of their principal (as bondholders usually do) is small. Consider, for example, a BBB tranche that is responsible for losses in the range $5\%$ to $6\%$ , If losses on the underlying portfolio are less than. $5\%$ , the tranche is safe. If losses are greater. than $6\%$ , the tranche is wiped out. Only in the case where losses are between $5\%$ and $6\%$ is a partial recovery made by investors..  

The difference between a thin BBB-rated tranche and a BBB-rated bond was over-. looked by many investors. The difference makes the tranches of ABS CDOs created from the BBB-rated tranches of ABSs much riskier than tranches created in a similar way from BBB bonds. Losses on a portfolio of BBB bonds can reasonably be assumed. to be unlikely to exceed $25\%$ in even the most severe market conditions. Table 8.1 shows that $100\%$ losses on a portfolio of BBB tranches can occur relatively easily--and. this is even more true when the tranches are only $1\%$ or $2\%$ wide.  

# Regulatory Arbitrage  

Many of the mortgages were originated by banks and it was banks that were the main investors in the tranches that were created from the mortgages. Why would banks choose to securitize mortgages and then buy the securitized products that were created? The answer concerns what is termed regulatory arbitrage. The regulatory capital banks were required to keep for the tranches created from a portfolio of mortgages was much less than the regulatory capital that would be required for the mortgages themselves.  

# Incentives  

One of the lessons from the crisis is the importance of incentives. Economists use the term "agency costs' to describe the situation where incentives are such that the interests. of two parties in a business relationship are not perfectly aligned. The process by which.  

mortgages were originated, securitized, and sold to investors was unfortunately riddled with agency costs.  

The incentive of the originators of mortgages was to make loans that would be acceptable to the creators of the ABS and ABS CDO tranches. The incentive of the individuals who valued the houses on which the mortgages were written was to please. the lender by providing as high a valuation as possible so that the loan-to-value ratio. was as low as possible. (Pleasing the lender was likely to lead to more business from that. lender.) The main concern of the creators of tranches was how the tranches would be rated. They wanted the volume of AAA-rated tranches that they created to be as high as possible and found ways of using the published criteria of rating agencies to achieve this. The rating agencies were paid by the issuers of the securities they rated and about half their income came from structured products.  

Another source of agency costs concerns the incentives of the employees of financial institutions. Employee compensation falls into three categories: regular salary, the endof-year bonus, and stock or stock options. Many employees at all levels of seniority in financial institutions, particularly traders, receive much of their compensation in the form of end-of-year bonuses. This form of compensation is focused on short-term performance. If an employee generates huge profits one year and is responsible for severe losses the next, the employee will often receive a big bonus the first year and will not have to return it the following year. (The employee might lose his or her job as a result of the second year losses, but even that is not a disaster. Financial institutions seem to be surprisingly willing to recruit individuals with losses on their resumes.)  

Imagine you are an employee of a financial institution in 2006 responsible for investing in ABS CDOs created from mortgages. Almost certainly you would have recognized that there was a bubble in the U.S. housing market and would expect that bubble to burst sooner or later. However, it is possible that you would decide to continue with your ABS CDO investments. If the bubble did not burst until after the end of 2006, you would still get a nice bonus at the end of 2006.
