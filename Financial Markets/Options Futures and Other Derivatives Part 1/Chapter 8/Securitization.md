# 8.1 SECURITIZATION  

Traditionally, banks have funded their loans primarily from deposits. In the 1960s, U.S. banks found that they could not keep pace with the demand for residential mortgages. with this type of funding. This led to the development of the mortgage-backed security (MBS) market. Organizations that were active in this market are:.  

The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae)   
The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae)   
The Federal Home Loan Mortagage Corporation (FHLMC, also known as Freddie Mac).  

These organizations bought portfolios of mortgages from the originating banks and. packaged them as securities that were sold to investors. They guaranteed (for a fee) the interest and principal payments on the mortgages..  

Thus, although banks originated the mortgages, they did not keep them on their. balance sheets. Securitization allowed them to increase their lending faster than their deposits were growing. The guarantees provided by GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC protected MBS investors against defaults by borrowers.1.  

In the 1980s, the securitization techniques developed for the mortgage market were applied to asset classes such as automobile loans and credit card receivables in the. United States. Securitization also become popular in other parts of the world. As the. securitization market developed, investors became comfortable with situations where they did not have a guarantee against defaults by borrowers..  

# ABSs  

A securitization arrangement of the type used during the 2000 to 2007 period (with no. guarantees against default) is shown in Figure 8.1. This is known as an asset-backed. security or ABs. A portfolio of income-producing assets such as loans is sold by the originating banks to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and the cash flows from the assets. are then allocated to tranches. Figure 8.1 is simpler than the structures that were typically created because it has only three tranches (in practice, many more tranches were used). These are the senior tranche, the mezzanine tranche, and the equity tranche..  

The portfolio in Figure 8.1 has a principal of $\$100$ million. This is divided as follows:. $\$80$ million to the senior tranche,. $\$15$ million to the mezzanine tranche, and $\$5$ million to the equity tranche. The senior tranche's return is LIBOR plus 60 basis points, the mezzanine tranche's return is LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and the equity tranche's. return is LIBOR plus 2,000 basis points.

Figure 8.2 The waterfall in an asset-backed security.  

It sounds as though the equity tranche has the best deal, but this is not necessarily the. case. The payments of interest and principal are not guaranteed. The return is like the yield on a bond. It is the return that will be realized if there are no defaults affecting the. tranche. As we will see, the equity tranche is more likely to lose part of its principal, and. less likely to receive the promised interest payments on its outstanding principal, than the. other tranches.  

Cash flows are allocated to tranches by specifying what is known as a waterfall. The. general way a waterfall works is illustrated in Figure 8.2. A separate waterfall is applied to principal and interest payments. Principal payments are allocated to the senior tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. They are then allocated to mezzanine tranche until its principal has been fully repaid. Only after this has happened do principal. repayments go to the equity tranche. Interest payments are allocated to the senior tranche until the senior tranche has received its promised return on its outstanding principal.. Assuming that this promised return can be made, interest payments are then allocated to the mezzanine tranche. If the promised return to the mezzanine tranche can be made and cash flows are left over, they are allocated to pay interest on the equity tranche..  

The extent to which the tranches get their principal back depends on losses on the underlying assets. The effect of the waterfall is roughly as follows. The first $5\%$ of losses are borne by the equity tranche. If losses exceed $5\%$ , the equity tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the mezzanine tranche. If losses exceed $20\%$ , the mezzanine tranche loses all its principal and some losses are borne by the principal of the senior tranche.  

There are therefore two ways of looking at an ABs. One is with reference to the waterfall in Figure 8.2. Cash flows go first to the senior tranche, then to the mezzanine tranche, and then to the equity tranche. The other is in terms of losses. Losses of principal. are first borne by the equity tranche, then by the mezzanine tranche, and then by the senior tranche. Rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch played a key role in. securitization. The ABS in Figure 8.1 is likely to be designed so that the senior tranche is given the highest possible rating, AAA. The mezzanine tranche is typically rated BBB. (well below AAA, but still investment grade). The equity tranche is typically unrated..  

The description of ABSs that we have given so far is somewhat simplified. Typically,. more than three tranches with a wide range of ratings were created. In the waterfall rules,. as we have described them, the allocation of cash flows to tranches is sequential in that. they always flow first to the most senior tranche, then to the next most senior tranche, and so on. In practice, the rules are somewhat more complicated than this and are described in a legal document that is several hundred pages long. Another complication is that there. was often some overcollateralization where the total principal of the tranches was less than the total principal of the underlying assets. Also, the weighted average return. promised to the tranches was less than the weighted average return payable on the assets.2.  

# ABS CDOs  

Finding investors to buy the senior AAA-rated tranches of ABSs was usually not difficult, because the tranches promised returns that were very attractive when compared with the return on AAA-rated bonds. Equity tranches were typically retained by the originator of the assets or sold to a hedge fund.  

Finding investors for mezzanine tranches was more difficult. This led to the creation of. ABSs of ABSs. The way this was done is shown in Figure 8.3. Many different mezzanine. tranches, created in the way indicated in Figure 8.1, are put in a portfolio and the risks associated with the cash flows from the portfolio are tranched out in the same way as the risks associated with cash flows from the assets are tranched out in Figure 8.1. The resulting structure is known as an $A B S C D O$ or $M e z z~A B S~C D O.$ (CDO is short for collateralized debt obligation.) In the example in Figure 8.3, the senior tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for $65\%$ of the principal of the ABS mezzanine tranches, the. mezzanine tranche of the ABS CDO accounts for $25\%$ of the principal, and the equity tranche accounts for the remaining $10\%$ of the principal. The structure is designed so. that the senior tranche of the ABS CDO is given the highest credit rating of AAA. This means that the total of the AAA-rated instruments created in the example that is considered here is about $90\%$ $80\%$ plus $65\%$ of $15\%$ ) of the principal of the underlying portfolios. This seems high but, if the securitization were carried further with an ABS being created from tranches of ABS CDOs (and this did happen), the percentage would be pushed even higher.

In the example in Figure 8.3, the AAA-rated tranche of the ABS can expect to receive. its promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying portfolio of. assets is less than. $20\%$ because all losses of principal would then be absorbed by the. more junior tranches. The AAA-rated tranche of the ABS CDO in Figure 8.3 is more. risky. It will receive the promised return and get its principal back if losses on the underlying assets are. $10.25\%$ or less. This is because a loss of. $10.25\%$ means that mezzanine tranches of ABSs have to absorb losses equal to. $5.25\%$ of the ABS principal. As these tranches have a total principal equal to. $15\%$ of the ABS principal, they lose $5.25/15$ or $35\%$ of their principal. The equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO are then wiped out, but the senior tranche just manages to survive intact.  

The senior tranche of the ABS CDO suffers losses if losses on the underlying. portfolios are more than. $10.25\%$ . Consider, for example, the situation where losses are $17\%$ on the underlying portfolios. Of the $17\%$ $5\%$ is borne by the equity tranche. of the ABS and $12\%$ by the mezzanine tranche of the ABS. Losses on the mezzanine. tranches are therefore $12/15$ or $80\%$ of their principal. The first. $35\%$ is absorbed by the. equity and mezzanine tranches of the ABS CDO. The senior tranche of the ABS CDO therefore loses $45/65$ or $69.2\%$ of its value. These and other results are summarized in. Table 8.1. Our calculations assume that all ABS portfolios have the same default rate..
