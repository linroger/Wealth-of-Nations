# 19.1 ILLUSTRATION  

In the next few sections we use as an example the position of a financial institution that has sold for. $\$300,000$ a European call option on 100,o00 shares of a non-dividendpaying stock. We assume that the stock price is $\$49$ , the strike price is. $\$50$ , the risk-free. interest rate is. $5\%$ per annum, the stock price volatility is $20\%$ per annum, the time to maturity is 20 weeks (0.3846 years), and the expected return from the stock is $13\%$ per annum.1 With our usual notation, this means that  

$$
S_{0}=49,K=50,r=0.05,\sigma=0.20,T=0.3846,\mu=0.13
$$  

The Black-Scholes-Merton price of the option is about $\$240,000$ . (This is because the  

value of an option to buy one share is. $\$2.40.$ ) The financial institution has therefore. sold a product for $\$60,000$ more than its theoretical value. But it is faced with the problem of hedging the risks.2
