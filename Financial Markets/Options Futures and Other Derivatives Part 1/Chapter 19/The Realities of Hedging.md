# 19.10 THE REALITIES OF HEDGING  

In an ideal world, traders working for financial institutions would be able to rebalance their portfolios very frequently in order to maintain all Greeks equal to zero. In practice, this is not possible. When managing a large portfolio dependent on a single. underlying asset, traders usually make delta zero, or close to zero, at least once a day by trading the underlying asset. Unfortunately, a zero gamma and a zero vega are less easy. to achieve because it is difficult to find options or other nonlinear derivatives that can be traded in the volume required at competitive prices. Business Snapshot 19.1 provides a discussion of how dynamic hedging is organized at financial institutions..  

As already mentioned, there are big economies of scale in trading derivatives. Maintaining delta neutrality for a small number of options on an asset by trading daily is usually not economically feasible because the trading costs per option hedged are high.11 But when a derivatives dealer maintains delta neutrality for a large portfolio of options on an asset, the trading costs per option hedged are more reasonable.
