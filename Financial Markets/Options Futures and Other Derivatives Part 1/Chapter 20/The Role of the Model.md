# 20.7  THE ROLE OF THE MODEL  

How important is the option-pricing model if traders are prepared to use a different volatility for every option? It can be argued that the Black-Scholes-Merton model is. no more than a sophisticated interpolation tool used by traders for ensuring that an option is priced consistently with the market prices of other actively traded options. If traders stopped using Black-Scholes-Merton and switched to another plausible model, then the volatility surface and the shape of the smile would change, but arguably the. dollar prices quoted in the market would not change appreciably. Greek letters and therefore hedging strategies do depend on the model used. An unrealistic model is liable to lead to poor hedging.  

Models have most effect on the pricing of derivatives when similar derivatives do not trade actively in the market. For example, the pricing of many of the nonstandard exotic derivatives we will discuss in later chapters is model-dependent.
