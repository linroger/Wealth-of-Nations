# Elementary Review of Probability for Finance

probability and statistics. Corporate cash flows, exchange rates, commodity prices,. stock prices, and interest rates are all random variables that can be usefully modeled by using probability and statistics. Unfortunately, you never have the luxury of observing the. actual, objective probability distribution in the social science field of finance. The closest alternative is your perceived, subjective probability distribution. Historical frequencies of an event are never an exact representation of future outcome. Thus, we must be. cognizant of the well-known disclaimer, "Please remember that past performance may. not be indicative of future results." Market participants learn from the past and make. behavioral adjustments that influence future observations..

This chapter provides a brief introductory review of the key foundational concepts in. probability that have proven useful in financial analysis. More depth is found in almost any good book on probability.1.
