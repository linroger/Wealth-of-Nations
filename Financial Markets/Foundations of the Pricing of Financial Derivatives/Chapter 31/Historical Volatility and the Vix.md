Although there are several volatility indexes, VIX is the term given to the Chicago Board Options Exchange reported volatility index. VIX is based on 30-day S&P 500 index. options.1 Figure 31.1 illustrates the VIX along with the 21-day rolling standard deviation based on the daily returns of the S&P 500 index ETF with ticker symbol SPY. Panel A shows the long history (12/31/2010 through 6/12/2023) of these values whereas Panel B shows the two years roughly starting with the onset of the COvID pandemic. In both panels, we observed that the two measures track closely with each other and the VIX is higher on average.
