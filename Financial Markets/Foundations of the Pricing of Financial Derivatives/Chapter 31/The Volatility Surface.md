# 31.3 THE VOLATILITY SURFACE

In the prior section, we focus on options with approximately one month to expiration and documented various volatility smiles and skews. Volatility smiles and skews are based on various measures relating to only the exercise price. We now illustrate the three-dimensional perspective of the implied volatilities, known as the volatility surface, where we address the exercise price as well as the time to expiration.

Figure 31.6 illustrates two volatility surfaces for McDonalds: Panel A when markets were relatively normal and Panel B when markets are stressed during the COvID pandemic. Note the vertical axis is fixed between $15\%$ and $85\%$ implied volatility to ease

comparison between the two surfaces. The time to expiration is expressed in years and moneyness is expressed as a percentage of the stock price. During normal markets, the volatility surface is relatively flat with a pronounced smile for short maturity options. During stressed markets, the volatility surface is dramatically higher overall and dramatically skewed for short maturity options.

Thus, analyzing volatility surface changes over time often provides a perspective on. option participants' market views. Further, analyzing volatility surfaces across assets provides a perspective on the relative riskiness of different assets.
