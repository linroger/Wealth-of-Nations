# 31.6 HOW PRACTITIONERS USE THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY SURFACE

Practitioners seem capable of operating in a world of complex volatility smiles and volatil-. ity surfaces. They even use the surface to simplify how they trade. That is, they oftentimes quote option prices not in terms of the actual price but in terms of the implied volatility. For. example, a dealer might indicate an intention to sell a January 50 call by quoting a volatility of 45. This statement is interpreted to mean that the actual price of this option that expires in January and has an exercise price of 50 is derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton model using a volatility of 45, technically 0.45. By quoting prices this way, traders can immediately see which options are truly more expensive, that is, after accounting for moneyness, time to expiration, and whether the option is a call or a put.

Table 31.3 Panel A illustrates mid-market call option quotes for McDonalds during stressed markets (see Figure 31.6 Panel B and related discussion). Panel B illustrates the implied volatilities related to the call prices. Due to the variation in exercise prices (expressed as a percentage of the $\$158.77$ stock price), it is difficult to appraise the relative valuations.16 with implied volatilities, however, one can opine that short-dated options (1 week) are more expensive than longer time to expiration options.

Traders also will often express the smile in terms of the implied volatility associated with the option's delta. For example, an at-the-money call has a delta of about O.50. Traders would often then refer to this as a 50 delta call. The volatilities are then graphed with the deltas on the horizontal axis. The resulting smile would be like the images we have seen.

But in general, traders use the smile as a way of determining the values of options relative to each other, after taking into account obvious differences related to moneyness, time to expiration, and the type of option, call or put. They give traders insights into which options are the most and least expensive, after accounting for the obvious distinguishing. factors.
