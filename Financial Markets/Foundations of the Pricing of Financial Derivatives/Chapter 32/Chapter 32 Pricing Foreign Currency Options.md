# Boundaries, Limits, and Conditions on Option Prices

Before one can begin to examine models for option prcig itis ncesry to understand do not give specific option prices except in a very limited sense; rather, they define the bounds within which option prices must lie. In addition, they define relationships among. different options, such as those differing by exercise price and those differing by time to expiration. Some of these principles also define relationships between the prices of puts and calls that have the same exercise prices and expiration dates. Finally, some option principles define relationships between options that can be exercised before expiration versus those that can be exercised only at expiration..

An option is a derivative that grants the buyer, who is called the long, the right to either buy or sell the underlying at a fixed price either at or before a specific date. The buyer is also said to be the owner or holder of the option because they own and hold the right to buy or sell the underlying. This right is granted by the seller, who is called the short or the writer. We stated that an option provides either the right to buy the underlying or the right to sell. Be sure you understand that it is one or the other. The right to buy is referred to as a call, and the right to sell is referred to as a put. The buyer and the seller decide on whether the option will be a call or a put.

The definition of an option specifies that the holder can either buy the underlying if a. call, or sell the underlying if a put, at a fixed price. This fixed price is called the exercise price and sometimes the strike price, strike, or striking price..

The option has an expiration date, beyond which the right to buy or sell the underlying no longer exists. When the holder of the option decides to pay the exercise price and acquire the underlying if a call, or deliver the underlying and receive the exercise price if a put, the buyer is said to be exercising the option. Note in the definition of an option that we specified that the right to buy or sell exists either at the expiration date or before the expiration. In other words, some options can be exercised only at the expiration, and some can be exercised any time up to the expiration. The former is called a European or European-style option, and the latter is called an American or American-style option. These terms reflected the places where these types of options traded in the early 1900s. Today, both types of options trade on both continents and around the world.

So, let us now begin our examination of the basic boundaries, limits, and conditions on option prices. These boundaries are like the ground rules, akin to the edges of a sports. playing field and the regulations that govern the game. They also enable us to build toward understanding how options are priced..
