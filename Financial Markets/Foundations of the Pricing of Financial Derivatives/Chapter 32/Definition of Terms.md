# 32.1 DEFINITION OF TERMS

Let us start by giving a clear definition of the terms we shall use:

$S_{0}$ $S_{T}=$ spot exchange rate at times 0 or $T.$ quoted in the domestic currency, that is,. units of the domestic currency or quote currency per unit of the foreign currency, or base currency
$R_{0}=1/S_{0}$ and $R_{T}=1/S_{T}$ , the spot exchange rate at times 0 or $T$ quoted in the foreign currency, that is, units of the foreign currency per unit of domestic currency, or the reciprocal of the spot exchange rate
$X=$ exercise price, sometimes called the exercise rate, expressed in the quote currency of a call option to buy one unit of the foreign currency
$T=$ expiration date
$\sigma=$ volatility of the log return on the quote currency
$r_{D}=$ domestic risk-free interest rate; note that we have often used the symbol $r_{f},$ but we do not wish to suggest that the $f$ represents the foreign currency
$r_{F}=$ foreign risk-free interest rate; note that the subscript is capitalized.
