# 30.3 VOLATILITIES OF OPTIONS

Of course, one naturally thinks of volatility as important for an option, but the volatility we refer to in that context is the volatility of the asset. Now we are interested in the volatility of the option. Using the expression created previously for the return on the option as a function of the return on the asset, we take the variance of the option return:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{var}\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta c}{c}\right)=\mathrm{var}\left\{r+\left[\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta S}{S}\right)-r\right]\Omega\right\}}\ &{\qquad=\mathrm{var}\left\{\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta S}{S}\right)\Omega\right\}}\ &{\qquad=\Omega^{2}\mathrm{var}\left(\displaystyle\frac{\Delta S}{S}\right).}\end{array}
$$

Expressing this result in terms of the standard deviation results in

$$
\sigma_{c}=\Omega\sigma_{S}.
$$

And we can also express it as

$$
\sigma_{c}=b\left(\frac{S}{c}\right)\sigma_{S}.
$$

We see that the volatility of the option is the volatility of the asset times the elasticity. Thus,.
the risk of the option is the risk of the asset times the risk of the option relative to the asset.
This result should seem intuitive..

These results concerning expected returns and volatilities of options apply regardless. of how expected returns are determined on the underlying asset. In the special case that the CAPM explains expected returns on assets, we can obtain some further insights..
