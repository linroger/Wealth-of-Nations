# 30.4 OPTIONS AND THE CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

Recall that the CAPM is a model for the pricing of all risky assets. An option is a risky asset. Therefore, if the CAPM holds for all risky assets, the expected return on the option must also be governed by the CAPM. Hence, the following equation applies:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{E\big(R_{c}\big)=r+\big[E\big(R_{m}\big)-r\big]\beta_{c},}\end{array}
$$

where $\beta_{c}$ is the beta of the call and is recognized as its risk with respect to the market portfolio. Substituting our CAPM equation for the expected return on the asset into the CAPM for the expected return on the option gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{E\big(R_{c}\big)=r+\big[E\big(R_{s}\big)-r\big]\Omega}\ &{\qquad=r+\big(\big\{r+\big[E\big(R_{m}\big)-r\big]\beta_{s}\big\}-r\big)\Omega}\ &{\qquad=r+\big[E\big(R_{m}\big)-r\big]\beta_{s}\Omega.}\end{array}
$$

Hence, the option beta is given as

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{c}=\beta_{s}\Omega,}\end{array}
$$

indicating that the beta of the option is the beta of the asset times the elasticity. Once again, we see the role that elasticity plays. As we noted, elasticity is a relative measure, that is, the percentage change in the option return divided by the percentage change in the asset return. Because beta is a relative measure, naturally elasticity plays an important part in the relationship of the beta of the option to the beta of the asset.
