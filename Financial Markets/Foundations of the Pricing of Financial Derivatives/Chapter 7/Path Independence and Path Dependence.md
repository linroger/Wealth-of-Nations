# 7.7 PATH INDEPENDENCE AND PATH DEPENDENCE

European options are one family of a class of options that are described by a characteristic we call path independence. Path independence is when it does not matter which path was taken to get to a point. For example, in a two-period model, one could end up in the middle point by going up and then down or down and then up. For a European option and indeed all path-independent options, it does not matter which path was taken. You arrive at the same final asset price, the option payoff is determined by that asset price, and the path the asset took to get there is irrelevant. Hence, we can ignore the intermediate steps and, as such, use formulas such as Equation (7.22).

Path-dependent options are an entirely different story. American options are path-. dependent, provided there is a nonzero probability of early exercise. For example, if we had an American put, it might be exercised when the asset goes down as previously illustrated.. Hence, for the asset to go down and then up does not produce the same result as when it. goes up and then down. As noted, there are a number of other types of path-dependent. options that are the subjects of advanced topics in options..

For example, with a typical home mortgage, homeowners have the option to refinance. whenever they wish. They are often motivated to do so when interest rates decline. Thus, the home mortgage value is based, in part, on this early exercise option. When interest rates. fall, the homeowner may choose to refinance, whereas if interest rates rise, the homeowner. is likely not to refinance.
