# 6.3 IDENTICAL ASSETS AND THE LAW OF ONE PRICE

Suppose there is another asset trading in a different market. If a good economy occurs, the asset will be worth 200, and if a bad economy occurs, it will be worth 100. Remember that the first asset pays 100 and 50 in the two outcomes. Notice that this second asset pays exactly two times the payoff of the good asset. Suppose that the first asset is trading for the price of 70, and the second asset is trading for 148. This situation creates an unstable condition that will bring out arbitrageurs who trade to earn risk-free profits without committing any of their own money.3

These arbitrageurs will execute a very simple strategy. They will sell short the second asset, thereby collecting 148 while promising to buy that asset back at 200 if the good economy occurs or 100 if the bad one occurs.4 Now, they have 148 in cash up front. They take 140 and buy two shares of the first asset. They keep the remaining $148-140=8$ 5. Let us see what happens for both possible outcomes.

A good economy occurs: They are holding two shares of the first asset, which are collectively worth 200. They take the 200 and buy one share of the second asset, which they then deliver to cover their short position..

A bad economy occurs: They are holding two shares of the first asset, which are col-. lectively worth 100. They take the 100 and buy one share of the second asset, which they then deliver to cover their short position..

In both outcomes, the shares they own will be precisely enough to repurchase the shares they have sold short. Thus, they are immune to the risk. They do not care which outcome occurs, because in either case they simply end up with 8 and the interest on it. They have, in effect, manufactured money without taking any risk, which is what arbitrage is.

Naturally many investors will rush to do this transaction, which will put downward. pressure on the price of the second asset or upward pressure on the price of the first asset,. or a combination of both. Very quickly the two asset prices must align themselves so that the second asset price is twice that of the first. Under the principle of arbitrage, prices are. in equilibrium relative to each other. We do not know or care if the first asset is priced correctly or the second asset is priced correctly. We simply care whether the two prices are properly aligned, in this case such that the second asset is worth twice the price of the first, so that an opportunity to make an arbitrage profit no longer exists.

The principle of arbitrage also brings to light a result called the law of one price:. Identical assets cannot sell for different prices. These assets may not appear to be identical. assets, but their returns are perfectly synchronized. Regardless of which outcome occurs,. the value of the second asset has to be twice that of the first. For an excellent treatment of arbitrage at an introductory level, see Billingsley (2006), and for more advanced coverage. that will parallel most of the topics in the rest of this book, see Bjork (1998)..
