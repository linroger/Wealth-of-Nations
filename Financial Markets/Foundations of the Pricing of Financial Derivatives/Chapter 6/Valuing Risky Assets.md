# 6.1 VALUING RISKY ASSETS

Suppose there is an asset that will have a value of either 100 if a good economy occurs or 50 if a bad economy occurs one period later. The risk-free interest rate,. $r_{\mathrm{{i}}}$ , for the period. is $5\%$ . Further, suppose we somehow know the probability of the good economy is. $60\%$ and the probability of the bad economy is $40\%$ . What should be the current price of the asset?

First, we have to start by finding the expected value of the asset, $E(S_{1})$ , one period later:

$$
E(S_{1})=\S100(0.6)+\S50(0.4)=\S80.
$$

An investor who is indifferent to risk, referred to as being risk neutral, would value the asSet $(S_{0})$ at

$$
S_{0}=\frac{E(S_{1})}{1+r}=\frac{\S80}{1.05}=\S76.19.
$$

Let us denote this risk-neutral investor simply RNI. If RNI made this investment many times over, they would receive an average payoff of 80. If they paid 76.19 each time, they would effectively break even, being paid only a $5\%$ return to be compensated for the time value of money. The distinguishing characteristic of RNI investors is that they do not demand compensation for the risk. They are perfectly happy to make a certain amount of money one time and lose that same amount of money another time. Over the long run, their offsetting gains and losses leave them as content as they were before they made the investments. They earn the risk-free rate in spite of assuming risk.

A risk-averse investor, identified as RAI, however, would not be satisfied to make an. investment many times and earn an average return that compensates only for the time value of money. If RAI made an investment that earned. $x\%$ one time and lost $x\%$ another time, RAI would wish the investment had not been made at all. The dissatisfaction from the loss is more painful than the satisfaction of a gain of equivalent magnitude. As such,. an RAI would pay less than 76.19. In that case, in the long run the gains would offset the. losses by more than the risk-free rate. The important question is, how much less would. an RAI pay? The answer depends on how the RAI addresses risk. The more risk averse they are, the less they would pay. Thus, the more risk averse they are, the more they will discount the expected value to obtain the price they will pay. People vary in their degrees of. risk aversion. Some are highly risk averse and some only moderately risk averse. A given person may also vary in their risk aversion, based on their stage of life or accumulated wealth.

Let us assume that the investor believes a price of 70 would be appropriate. What does this imply about their risk aversion? At a price of 70, they have an expected return of.

$$
{\frac{80}{70}}-1=0.1429.
$$

Thus, their expected return is $14.29\%$ . If they make this investment many times, they will earn on average $14.29\%$ . Given a $5\%$ risk-free rate, they will earn a risk premium of $9.29\%$ $(=14.29\%-5\%)$ . Thus, they are pricing the investment such that they expect a $9.29\%$ risk premium. Of course, they may make the investment only one time, in which case they will either earn $100-70=30$ , which is $42.9\%$ $(=30/70)$ , or lose $70-50=20\$ which is $-28.6\%$ $(=-20/70)$ . Note that the probability-weighted average of $42.9\%$ and $-28.6\%$ is $14.29\%$ :1

$$
(30/70)(0.6)+(-20/70)(0.4)=0.1429.
$$

Or they might make the investment only a few times and make or lose an average of some value other than the expected return of $14.29\%$ . But their long-run expectation is to earn a return of $14.29\%$ , and this rate will compensate them for taking the risk, based on their pricing the investment at 70.
