# 8.4 DIVIDENDS

As explained in Chapter 7, dividends pose a significant problem with the multiplicative. binomial model. The binomial Greeks presented here would require the binomial lat-. tice to be adjusted based on the escrow method. Once the dividend-adjusted binomial

lattice was constructed, the computation of binomial Greeks would proceed as described in this chapter.
