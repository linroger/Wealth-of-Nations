# 29.1 PURE ASSETS IN THE MARKET

Suppose we face a risky situation, which could be as basic as a commitment of capital to. an investment in the stock market. Let us define the possible outcomes in terms of three states in which the market goes down. $2\%$ (state 1), the market is unchanged (state 2), or. the market goes up $2\%$ (state 3). Of course, in reality, the possible outcomes are infinite. and cannot be reduced to such simple statements, but the framework provided by this. simplification is, nonetheless, useful and generalizes to the case of a continuous spectrum of states.

Consider a complex asset that will be worth 110 in state 1, 100 in state 2, and 90 in state 3. Consider another complex asset that will be worth 105 in state 1, 101 in state 2, and 98 in state 3. Suppose the risk-free rate is $2\%$ . Then a risk-free asset worth 100 today will have a value of 102 in each state.

Now consider a pure asset, which pays 1.0 in state 1 and zero in all other states.. Another pure asset pays 1.0 in state 2 and zero in all other states. A third pure asset pays 1.0 in state 3 and zero in all other states. Our first complex asset, whose three possible. future values are 110, 100, and 90, can be viewed as a portfolio of 110 units of the first pure asset, 100 units of the second pure asset, and 90 units of the third pure asset. Our. second complex asset can be viewed as a portfolio of 105 units of the first pure asset, 101 units of the second pure asset, and 98 units of the third pure asset. A risk-free asset worth 100 today can be viewed as 102 units of all three pure assets. The price of a pure asset is called a state price. A particular pure asset pays off 1.0 if a particular state occurs and zero. otherwise. The price of that pure asset, thus, is the amount of money you would need to pay to receive a fixed payoff in that state of the world..

It follows that the price of each complex asset must be the value today of the equivalent portfolio of pure assets. In other words, if we know the state prices, we can determine the prices of all complex assets. Alternatively, if we know the prices of the complex assets, we can determine the state prices. We shall see how this is done in this chapter.

These pure assets are the fundamental assets in the market. We cannot see them or trade them, but they are there, similar to financial atoms in the market. Let us now develop a formal framework for understanding these concepts.
