# 2.3 THE VALUE OF AN AMERICAN OPTION RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF A EUROPEAN OPTION

Because an American option permits the holder to exercise the option at expiration as well as any time prior to expiration, its value must be at least as great as that of the. corresponding European option:

$$
C_{t}\geq c_{t}\quad\mathrm{and}\quad P_{t}\geq p_{t}.
$$
