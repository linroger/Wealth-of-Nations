# Interest Rate Contracts: Forward Rate Agreements, Swaps, and Options  

n Chapter 22, we introduced forward and futures contracts. In those cases, however, the forward and futures were on assets. One of the most popular types of derivative contracts is based on an interest rate, and an interest rate is not an asset. An asset is something that can be purchased and held in a portfolio.1 One cannot purchase and hold an interest rate. One can, however, purchase and hold an instrument that pays an interest rate, but the difference must be accounted for when pricing a derivative off of an interest rate. In this chapter, we shall take a look at interest rate forward contracts, called forward rate agreements, or FRAs, interest rate swaps, and interest rate options. We shall see how we account for this important difference in which there is a payoff based on an underlying but the underlying cannot be held as an asset. For more details, there are many excellent references on this subject, among which are Buetow and Fabozzi (2001) and Corb (2012).  

Before we begin looking at these instruments, however, let us set up the structure of the problem and identify the key variables. To start, we must understand how loans are done. There are a variety of ways of creating loans. Some are fixed rate, in which the interest rate is set at the start. Others are variable or floating, usually called floating rate, where the interest rate is set and then resets periodically. To see how this is done, let us divide the loan into interest payment periods, sometimes called settlement periods. For example, let us say that each period is one month. So, at the start of the loan, set the rate at the current one-month rate in the market. The interest then accrues for a month, at which time the interest is paid, and the rate resets to the then-current one-month rate. The loan continues in that manner until the final interest payment and principal are made.  

These types of loans use what is called add-on interest. Let $B_{0}$ denote the amount borrowed. Letting $L$ be the loan rate expressed in decimal terms, $q$ be the number of days of the loan, and $B_{q}$ denote the amount required to be repaid, the payback at the maturity of the loan is  

$$
B_{q}=B_{0}\left[1+L\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)\right].
$$  

Note that the convention in this type of market is to divide the interest rate by 360. This is simply a convenience arising from an era in which calculators did not exist and loans commonly used rates such as $6\%$ and the interest payment periods would be 30, 60, 180 days, and so on, in which case the interest could be calculated in one’s head.  

The rate on this type of loan is typically tied to a commonly used rate benchmark. Historically, the most popular one was LIBOR, which stood for the London interbank offered rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend dollars and sometimes other currencies primarily in London. There was significant controversy over the accuracy of LIBOR during some historical periods due to evidence that the official published rate had been manipulated by unscrupulous traders in rate-setting banks. At the time of this writing, there is much debate over the appropriate replacement for LIBOR. Note that any alternative would still likely be used in the same manner discussed next. The lead candidate is the secured overnight financing rate and related term reference rates. LIBOR data ceased being produced on June 30, 2023.  

# 26.1 INTEREST RATE FORWARDS  

As noted, we referred to interest rate forwards as forward rate agreements, or FRAs. They are forward contracts that pay off based on what the interest rate is on the expiration date of the contract. To understand them, we shall need to add some additional specifications. There are two forms of FRAs: advanced set, settled in arrears, and advanced set, advanced settled. Advanced set, settled in arrears, assumes that the FRA cash settlement is made at the end of the embedded interest rate period $\overset{\cdot}{q}$ in Figure 26.1), whereas advanced set, advanced settled, assumes that the FRA cash settlement is made at the beginning of the embedded interest rate period. When first learning the mechanics of FRAs, it is easier to focus on advanced set, settled in arrears. For credit risk reasons, FRAs are typically advanced set, advanced settled. Recall FRAs are unlike loans so there is no repayment of principal. Thus, once the floating rate is set, the settlement amount can be computed. For example, an advanced set, settled in arrears, that mimics a typical loan may require settlement in three months of say 2,000,000 (e.g., receive floating FRA and rates rose). The counterparty due the 2,000,000 would prefer to receive the present value of the settlement amount now so as not to incur the risk that the counterparty owing the money defaults in three months (e.g., due to a credit crisis).  

Let us assume that the forward contract expires in m days. On day m, the payoff of the forward contract will be based on the $q$ -day interest rate. Figure 26.1 illustrates our notation. Rather than maturity time being measured in years, with FRAs, it is typically measured in days. Note here $T$ is simply $m+q$ . In the next section, we will value FRAs at some future time $t$ (prior to expiration). For example, suppose the underlying is a 90-day loan rate. Then $q=90$ . If the forward contract expires in 30 days, then $m=30$ . We shall need notation for the rate on a 90-day loan on day 30 relative to the initiation date of the contract, day 0. This would be $L_{30}(90)$ . In general, we shall write this rate as $L_{m}(q)$ , the $q$ -day rate on day $m$ . Thus, $T=m+q=$ $30+90=120\$ . In addition, the figure shows a date $t_{:}$ , referred to as an evaluation date. We will later value the FRA at that point in time. For now, we focus on the initiation date, 0.

FIGURE 26.1 Interest Rate FRA Maturity Time Notation  

We assume that on day 0, an FRA maturing on day m is created. We assume that the rate that the parties agree will be paid by the long to the short on day $m$ is $R_{0}(m,q)$ . This rate can be thought of as the forward price, in much the same manner that we think of a forward price in a standard forward contract on an asset, as described in Chapter 22.  

On day m, the payoff to the long is the value of the contract at expiration, and is given as follows:  

$$
V F R A_{m}(m,q)=\frac{\left[L_{m}(q)-R_{0}\left(m,q\right)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)},
$$  

where we will use the term $V F R A_{m}(m,q)$ as the value of an FRA expiring on day m where the underlying is a $q$ -day loan rate. This amount is paid from the short to the long and represents the payment per 1.0 notional.2 First, note the numerator, which is partly composed of the difference between the rate realized on day $m$ , $L_{m}(q)$ , and the rate the long agreed to pay, $R_{0}(m,q)$ . This payment can be positive, in which case the short pays the long, or negative, in which case the long pays the short. These rates, however, are quoted as annual rates so they must be adjusted to reflect the fact that they apply to a $q$ -day transaction in precisely the same manner that the rate on the loan is adjusted for the number of days, as in Equation (26.1). That is, we multiply by $q/360$ .  

Now, take a look at the denominator. It might be surprising that there even is a denominator. Notice that the denominator results in discounting the payoff over $q$ days. And yet, the payment occurs on day m. Why do we do this discounting? The answer lies in the fact that the rate on which the payment is made, $L_{m}(q)$ , is the $q$ -day interest rate on day m as determined in the money market. It is the rate that a bank would expect to pay or receive if it made a loan on day m and the loan were paid back on day $m+q$ . Because the FRA pays off on day $m$ , the buyer is receiving the money before it technically should. Hence, it is appropriate to discount it. Note that if the FRA buyer were to hold on to the money and accrue interest at the rate $L_{m}(q)$ for $q$ days, they would have the amount $L_{m}(q)$ . Thus, it does not really matter if the FRA pays off on day $m$ or day $m+q$ . If it paid off on day $m+q$ , it would pay $L_{m}(q)$ . By paying off on day $m$ , it pays $L_{m}(q)/{\left(1+L_{m}(q)\right)}.$ These are effectively the same amounts of money.  

Finally, let us again note that in Equation (26.2), the payoff amount can be positive or negative. So, if $R_{0}(m,q)>(<)L_{m}(q)$ , the payoff will be negative (positive), and the buyer (seller) must pay the seller (buyer).  

So, we know how the payoff of an FRA is determined. In keeping with our previous coverage of forward contracts, there are two things we need to derive: the forward price, which is the rate $R_{0}(m,q)$ that is established at the start, and the value of the FRA.  

# 26.1.1 Pricing FRAs  

In order to determine the fixed rate, or price, there is an important concept in valuation that we must know. First, let us establish the notation for valuation. Let $V F R A_{t}(m,q)$ be the value at time $t$ of an FRA that expires at time m in which the underlying is a $q$ -day rate. It should not be surprising that when $t=0$ , the date of initiation of the contract, the value is zero. This result is consistent with the fact that no money changes hands when the contract is initiated. What we want to know is how to set the price of the contract at time 0. In this context, price is the fixed rate we agree to pay in exchange for receiving the floating rate. Let us first establish that the payoff at $m$ , as given in Equation (26.2), is equivalent to the following value at $m+q$ ∶  

$$
\left[L_{m}(q)-R_{0}(m,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right),
$$  

as we simply compounded the payoff at $m$ to the point $m+q$ at the rate $L_{m}(q)$ .3 Thus, the value of an FRA is the present value of this expression. Now, let us do one simple trick that will facilitate our derivation: We add and subtract a 1 in the above equation:  

$$
\left[1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)\right]-\left[1+R_{0}(m,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)\right].
$$  

That is, we add 1 to the floating payment and fixed payments and thus they offset. We can easily find the value of the fixed component, $1+R_{0}(m,q)(q/360)$ , by discounting it to the present at the $m+q$ -day rate.  

$$
\frac{1+R_{0}(m,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m+q)\left(\frac{m+q}{360}\right)}.
$$  

Now we wish to value the floating component, $1+L_{m}(q)(q/360)$ . Remember that this value is positioned at time $m+q$ and we want to discount it back to time m. So we discount for $q$ days at the rate $L_{m}(q)$ . Its value at time $m$ is easily found as  

$$
\frac{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}=1.
$$  

So the discounted value back to time $m$ is 1. Therefore, the discounted value back to time 0 is  

$$
\frac{1}{1+L_{0}(m)\left(\frac{m}{360}\right)}.
$$  

So now discounting the fixed and floating payments as indicated previously, the value of the FRA at time 0 is  

$$
V F R A_{0}\left(m,q\right)=\frac{1}{1+L_{0}(m)\left(\frac{m}{360}\right)}-\frac{1+R_{0}\left(m,q\right)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m+q)\left(\frac{m+q}{360}\right)}.
$$  

Because the FRA must have a value of zero at time 0, we set this equation to zero,  

$$
V F R A_{0}(m,q)=\frac{1}{1+L_{0}(m)\left(\frac{m}{360}\right)}-\frac{1+R_{0}(m,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m+q)\left(\frac{m+q}{360}\right)}=0.
$$  

Solving for the fixed rate gives us our desired result,  

$$
R_{0}(m,q)=\left[\frac{1+L_{0}(m+q)\left(\frac{m+q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m)\left(\frac{m}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{q}.
$$  

This result is simply the forward rate for a $q$ -day transaction to start at time m. It is the rate that the long agrees to pay the short on day $m$ in return for receiving the floating rate This rate guarantees that neither party can earn an arbitrage profit against the other.  

For example, suppose the 270-day loan rate is $3\%$ and the 360-day loan rate is $4\%$ . Calculate the fixed rate on an FRA expiring in 270 days for a 90-day deposit. In this case, the FRA fixed rate is found by solving  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{0}(m,q)=\left[{\displaystyle{\frac{1+L_{0}(m+q)\left(\frac{m+q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m)\left(\frac{m}{360}\right)}}-1}\right]\frac{360}{q}}}\\ {{=\left[{\displaystyle{\frac{1+0.04\left(\frac{360}{360}\right)}{1+0.03\left(\frac{270}{360}\right)}}-1}\right]\frac{360}{90}=\left({\displaystyle{\frac{1+0.04}{1+0.0225}}-1}\right)4=0.06846.}}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, the fixed rate is $6.846\%$ .  

There is a useful approximation when estimating forward rates that market participants find helpful, especially when making decisions in chaotic markets. Suppose you view the longer rate as simply a weighted arithmetic average of the shorter rate with weights based on time to maturity. In this case, we have $3\%$ for three 90-day periods and $4\%$ for four 90-day periods. Thus, to achieve a $4\%$ average the missing fourth number would be 7 or $3+3+3+\_=4(4)$ . Note that $7\%$ is higher than the correct answer of $6.846\%$ . Thus, the arithmetic average is a useful starting point although slightly high. With today’s computer technologies, this approximation is not as useful.  

# 26.1.2 Valuing FRAs  

From Equation (26.2) we know the value of the contract at expiration, and from Equation (26.3) we know the fixed loan rate so the value of the contract at initiation is zero. What we need to know is the value of the contract during its life. So, let us position ourselves at an arbitrary point, time $t$ , which is between time 0 and time m. In order to value the contract, we need to create a transaction that essentially sells the contract. In other words, we need to create an offsetting contract. Keep in mind that we do not actually have to execute this new contract. We just need to be able to execute it and to know at what price it would be executed.4  

So here at time $t_{:}$ , we look into the market and determine that a new forward contract on the $q$ -day day rate expiring at m has a rate of $R_{t}(m,q)$ . If we held a long position in the original contract, we would need to go short this contract. The payoffs of the two contracts would yield an overall payoff at time $m$ of  

$$
\left[\frac{L_{m}(q)-R_{0}(m,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}\right]-\left[\frac{L_{m}(q)-R_{t}(m,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}\right].
$$  

The first large bracketed term is the payoff from the contract we are long, the one we actually own. The second large bracketed term is the payoff from the contract we hypothetically sell. Let us rearrange this equation as follows:  

$$
\frac{\left[R_{t}(m,q)-R_{0}(m,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{m}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}.
$$  

And this is the guaranteed payoff at time $T$ discounted to time m. Note that the rate at time $m$ , $L_{m}(q)$ , is not in the numerator. We have resolved that uncertainty by hypothetically selling the new contract. Hence, the uncertainty is gone. We can thus value the FRA by discounting this amount from day m back to day $t.$ . What we see in this equation is that the amount is discounted according to the standard payoff formula for an FRA, Equation (26.2). Recall how the denominator discounts the payoff that occurs at time $m$ but is based on a rate in which the interest is paid at time $m+q$ . As we did previously, we can simply compound that payoff forward to date $m+q$ by multiplying by $1+L_{m}(q)(q/360)$ to remove the denominator from the equation. We now simply discount this amount from time $m+q$ to the present, time $t$ by the rate at time $t$ for the period $m+q-t$ as follows:  

$$
V F R A_{t}(m,q)=\frac{\Big[R_{t}(m,q)-R_{0}(m,q)\Big]\Big(\frac{q}{360}\Big)}{1+L_{t}(m+q-t)\Big(\frac{m+q-t}{360}\Big)},
$$  

where  

$$
R_{t}(m,q)=\left[\frac{1+L_{0}(m+q-t)\left(\frac{m+q-t}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m-t)\left(\frac{m-t}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{q}.
$$  

And this is the value of the FRA at time $t$ . In other words, the contract we created at time zero that obligates us to pay $R_{0}(m,q)$ at time $m$ is worth the above at time t. Based on the results of the previous example, suppose after 90 days, the 180-day loan rate is $2\%$ and the 270 day rate is $3\%$ . Calculate the value of the receive-floating FRA entered at time 0. Assume 1,000,000 notional. We first compute the new equilibrium FRA fixed rate as  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{R_{90}(270,90)=\left[\frac{1+L_{0}(m+q-t)\left(\frac{m+q-t}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}(m-t)\left(\frac{m-t}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{q}}\\ {=\left[\frac{1+0.03\left(\frac{270}{360}\right)}{1+0.02\left(\frac{180}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{90}=0.049505.}\end{array}
$$  

Now we compute the current value from the receive-floating counterparty (paying initial fixed rate and receiving the later fixed rate) as  

$$
V F R A_{90}(270,90)=\S1,000,000\left[{\frac{(0.049505-0.06846)\left({\frac{90}{360}}\right)}{1+0.03\left({\frac{270}{360}}\right)}}\right]=-\S4,634.40.
$$  

In this case, the fixed FRA rate fell from $6.846\%$ to $4.9505\%$ . In this particular case, the receive-floating counterparty is now in the hole 4,634.40.  

# 26.1.3 Off-Market FRAs  

As we discussed with forward contracts in general in Chapter 22, it is possible to create an FRA that is not set at a zero value at the start. If the fixed rate is set according to Equation (26.3), then the contract has zero value at the start and neither party pays anything to the other. If we set the fixed rate higher than that given in Equation (26.3), the buyer has agreed to pay an above-market fixed rate. Thus, the contract would have a negative value at the start, and the seller would have to pay the buyer the market value at the start. If we set the fixed rate lower than Equation (26.3), the buyer has agreed to pay a below-market fixed rate. Thus, the contract would have a positive value at the start, and the buyer would have to pay the seller the market value at the start. These versions of FRAs are called off-market FRAs, and although they are not common, they are implicitly embedded in interest rate swaps, as we shall see.  

# 26.2 INTEREST RATE SWAPS  

Interest rate swaps are a variation of FRAs, but they have some important distinctions. An interest rate swap is an agreement for one party to pay another a set of payments at one rate and the latter to pay the former a set of payments at another rate. Typically, one of these rates is fixed and one is variable and, thereby, floats according to a benchmark rate in the market. This standard type of swap is usually called a vanilla swap or sometimes plain vanilla swap. It is also possible to have both rates be floating, but the two rates would clearly have to be different floating rates.  

Interest rate swaps are the most widely used derivative.5 The most common application is when a company has a floating-rate loan but would prefer a fixed-rate loan. Because lenders very commonly make floating-rate loans, but borrowers prefer fixed-rate loans, lenders will usually offer a swap to enable the borrower to convert the loan from floating to fixed. That is, with the loan the borrower will be making a series of interest payments to the lender at rates that adjust periodically according to a market benchmark rate. A swap can then be attached so that the borrower receives an interest payment that is floating and makes an interest payment that is fixed. The floating interest payment the borrower makes on the loan is offset by the floating interest payment it receives on the swap, leaving a net of a fixed interest payment.  

# 26.2.1 Pricing Interest Rate Swaps  

Let us set up the problem of pricing the swap. Our objective is to determine the fixed rate the swap buyer would agree to pay in return for receiving the floating rate. We shall assume that the swap makes payments on the following dates, $j=1,2,\dots,J$ . Thus, at maturity, it has made the final and $\dot{J}^{t h}$ payment. The number of days to each payment is designated as $T_{j}.$ Thus, for example, a swap that makes payments in 180, 360, 540, and 720 days will have $J=4$ , and $j=1,2,3,4$ , with the number of days to each payment being $T_{1}=180$ , $T_{2}=360$ , $T_{3}=540$ , and $T_{4}=720$ . We refer to these dates as settlement dates, reset dates, or rate-reset dates.  

We shall assume that the underlying is the rate $\boldsymbol{L}_{t}(\boldsymbol{q})$ , meaning the rate on day $t$ for a $q$ -day loan. In the example here with four payments spaced 180 days apart, $q=180$ . This is the same type of underlying that we used to illustrate FRAs. One party agrees to pay a fixed rate of $R S_{0}(J,q)$ , which means the fixed rate on a swap set at time 0 in which there are $J$ payments and each payment is based on the $q$ -day rate. The standard terms of vanilla swaps call for the rate, $L_{j}(q)$ , to be set at the beginning of the settlement period, and the payment to be made at the end. This structure is different from the way FRAs are paid, but it is the way loan interest payments are made. With floating-rate loans, the rate is set at the beginning of the settlement period, the interest accrues through the period, and the interest is paid at the end of the period, at which time the rate is reset. The payoff determined on day $j$ is, thus,6  

$$
\left[L_{j}(q)-R S_{0}(J,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right),
$$  

and this amount is paid at date $j+1$ , meaning $q$ days later. It should be apparent that the first floating rate on the first swap payment, $j=1$ , is known when the swap is initiated. It is known as the stub rate or the current $q$ -day rate, $L_{0}(q)$ . So, the first swap floating payment, which will be made at $j=1$ , is known for certain. All remaining payments from $j=2$ onward are unknown, because they will be determined by the $q$ -day rates on $j=1$ , $j=2,...,j=J-1$ . Despite this uncertainty, we shall be able to value these payments, as we show here.  

First, let us make a slight alteration to the swap payments that has no net economic effect but serves a useful purpose in facilitating valuation. Usually in an interest rate swap, the parties exchange only the interest rates based on the notional. The notionals themselves are not exchanged. For example, if party A agrees to pay party B the swap fixed rate, and party B agrees to pay party A the floating rate, with both based on the same 50 million notional, there is no exchange of 50 million between the parties, because this would serve no purpose. That is, there would be no reason for A to pay 50 million to B at the start and for B to pay 50 million to A and for the two parties to again exchange 50 million at expiration. The parties simply exchange, that is, “swap” interest payments. But no harm will be done if, for valuation purposes, we simply add a notional to both the fixed and floating sides. To keep things simple, we shall set this notional at 1.0. This amount will theoretically be exchanged at the start and at the end, which is why it is called the notional, meaning to exist only in theory, not in reality. Thus, the last fixed payment will be $\left(1+R S_{0}\left(J,q\right)q/360\right)$ , and the last floating payment will be $\left(1+L_{J-1}(q)\overline{{q}}/360\right)$ . We shall also refer to this notional as hypothetical.7  

Let us now find the present value at time 0 of the floating payments. First, let us start with the last floating payment, at time $J_{:}$ , which as we said is $\left(1+L_{J-1}(q)q/360\right).$ . Let us find its present value back to time $J-1$ . So, we are at time $J-1$ and we are looking ahead to time $J$ . What is the present value at $J-1$ of the payment of $\left(1+L_{J-1}(q)q/360\right)$ that will occur at $J{\boldsymbol{\?}}$ This is a simple calculation:  

$$
{\frac{1+L_{J-1}(q)\left({\frac{q}{360}}\right)}{1+L_{J-1}(q)\left({\frac{q}{360}}\right)}}=1.
$$  

In other words, discounting the upcoming payment at the rate of that payment gives a present value of 1, provided the principal is added. In what follows, we shall need to remember that 1 is the present value of the remaining payment plus the hypothetical notional.8  

So, now we step back to $J-2$ and value the next payment of $L_{J-2}(q)(q/360)$ plus the value of the remaining payments plus hypothetical notional beyond $J-2$ , which is 1. This valuation will equal  

$$
\frac{1+L_{J-2}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{J-2}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}=1.
$$  

It should now be apparent that we can continue to step back recursively to time 0, and we shall always obtain a value of 1 at each of the settlement dates. Hence, the present value at time 0 of the floating payments, plus the hypothetical notional of 1 at expiration, equals 1.  

By adding the hypothetical notional at expiration, we have effectively treated the series of floating payments like a floating-rate loan whereby the principal is repaid. We see that its value is 1 at any settlement date. This result is not a magical result. It is consistent with the purpose of a floating rate loan: the reduction of interest rate risk to the lender. Remember that when a lender makes a fixed-rate loan, it assumes interest rate risk. If rates go up, the fixed rate loan is worth less. If rates go down, the fixed rate loan is worth more. A floating-rate loan reduces this uncertainty by having the floating rate periodically reset to the current market rate. Of course, rates can adjust only periodically and not continuously, so the value of the floating-rate loan will deviate slightly from its par value, which we set here at 1. But on each settlement date, the loan rate catches up with the market rate, and the loan value returns to its par value. What we have done here is to take the floating side of the swap and make it behave like a floating-rate loan. We have also taken the fixed side of the swap and made it behave like a fixed-rate loan.  

Similar to FRAs, the swap involves no net payment at the start, so it has zero value when initiated,  

$$
V S_{0}(J,q)=0.
$$  

Thus, we should set the present value of the floating payments, plus hypothetical notional, to the present value of the fixed payments, plus hypothetical notional, equal to each other. The present value of the floating payments plus hypothetical notional is, as we just showed,  

equal to 1. Thus, we set the present value of the fixed payments, plus the hypothetical notional of 1, equal to 1,  

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left[\frac{R S_{0}(J,q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j}\right)\left(\frac{t_{j}}{360}\right)}\right]+\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{J}\right)\left(\frac{t_{J}}{360}\right)}=1.
$$  

Solving for the fixed rate, $R S_{0}(J,q)$ , gives  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{R S_{0}(J,q)=\left\{\frac{1-\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{J}\right)\left(\frac{t_{J}}{360}\right)}}{\displaystyle\frac{J}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left[\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j}\right)\left(\frac{t_{j}}{360}\right)}\right]}}\right\}\frac{360}{q}.}\end{array}
$$  

This rather complex looking equation is actually quite simple. Inside the large parentheses is a numerator and a denominator. The numerator is simply one minus the present value of 1.0 paid at the last payment date. The denominator is the sum of the present values of 1.0 at each payment date. In other words, the denominator is simply the present value of a 1.0 annuity. The ratio of numerator to denominator is then annualized by the factor $360/q$ . The result is the fixed rate on the swap that equates the present value of the fixed payments to the present value of the floating payments at the start. Hence, it is the arbitrage-free fixed rate on the swap.  

To facilitate finding the present value of something, as we have seen before we sometimes use the term structure of spot rates to calculate the price of a zero-coupon bond and multiply that price by the item we are discounting. Suppose the spot rates for all maturities are all $3\%$ . The example given in Table 26.1 illustrates this process in calculating a swap rate.  

With a $3\%$ spot rate, the 1.0 par zero-coupon bond price can be found based on  

$$
\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j}\right)\left(\frac{t_{j}}{360}\right)}.
$$  

TABLE 26.1 Spot Rates, Zero-Coupon Bond Prices, and Equilibrium Swap Rate   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Days</td><td>Spot Rate (%)</td><td>Zero-Coupon Bond Price</td></tr><tr><td>90</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.992556</td></tr><tr><td>180</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.985222</td></tr><tr><td>270</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.977995</td></tr><tr><td>360</td><td>3.0</td><td>0.970874</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sum</td><td>3.926646</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Quarterly Swap Rate</td><td>0.741758%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Annual Swap Rate</td><td>2.967032%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

For example, 1.0 received on day 180 is worth  

$$
\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j}\right)\left(\frac{t_{j}}{360}\right)}=\frac{1}{1+0.03\left(\frac{180}{360}\right)}=0.985222.
$$  

The quarterly swap rate is  

$$
\left(\frac{1-0.970844}{0.992556+0.985222+0.977995+0.970874}\right)=0.00741758,
$$  

and the annualized swap rate, based on Equation (26.8), is simply  

$$
\begin{array}{c l l}{{R S_{0}(360,90)=\displaystyle\left(\frac{1-0.970844}{0.992556+0.985222+0.977995+0.970874}\right)\frac{360}{90}}}\\ {{=\displaystyle(0.00741758)4=0.02967.}}\end{array}
$$  

An alternative approach to pricing an interest rate swap is based on a portfolio of off-market FRAs. With this approach, we evaluate each periodic cash flow related to the swap. The risk related to each floating cash flow is offset with an off-market FRA. Recall each cash flow determined at time $j-1$ and paid $q$ days later based on 1.0 notional for a receive-floating swap is expressed as  

$$
\left[L_{j-1}(q)-R S_{0}(J,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right).
$$  

By entering a receive-fixed FRA, the combined cash flow occurring at $t_{j-1}+q$ can be expressed as  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle\left[L_{j-1}(q)-R S_{0}(J,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)+\left[R_{0}\left(t_{j-1},q\right)-L_{j-1}(q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}}\\ {{\displaystyle~=\left[R_{0}\left(t_{j-1},q\right)-R S_{0}(J,q)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right).}}\end{array}
$$  

We seek the fixed swap rate such that the current swap value is zero or  

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left\{\frac{\left[R_{0}\left(t_{j-1},q\right)-R S_{0}\left(J,q\right)\right]\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j-1}+q\right)\left(\frac{t_{j-1}+q}{360}\right)}\right\}=0.
$$  

Solving for the equilibrium fixed swap rate, we have  

$$
R S_{0}\left(J,q\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{J}w_{j}R_{0}\big(t_{j-1},q\big),
$$  

where  

$$
w_{j}=\frac{D F_{j}}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J}D F_{j}}=\frac{\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j-1}+q\right)\left(\frac{t_{j-1}+q}{360}\right)}}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left[\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j-1}+q\right)\left(\frac{t_{j-1}+q}{360}\right)}\right]}.
$$  

Note that the inverse of the accrual period, $q/360$ , simply converts the periodic swap rate to an annual rate. For example, if $q=90$ , then the summation part of Equation (26.11) is the quarterly swap rate. Thus, we see that the fixed rate of an interest rate swap is simply a weighted average of discount factors, where each discount factor is expressed as  

$$
D F_{j}=\frac{1}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{j-1}+q\right)\left(\frac{t_{j-1}+q}{360}\right)}.
$$  

Again, as before, suppose the spot rates for all maturities are all $3\%$ . Table 26.2 illustrates both methods for finding the equilibrium swap rate, which again turns out to be about $2.967\%$ .  

The forward rates are based on Equation (26.3). For example, the 270-day forward rate is  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{0}(m_{3},q)=\left[\frac{1+L_{0}\left(t_{3}+q\right)\left(\frac{t_{3}+q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{0}\left(t_{3}\right)\left(\frac{t_{3}}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{q}}}\\ {{=\left[\frac{1+0.03\left(\frac{270}{360}\right)}{1+0.03\left(\frac{180}{360}\right)}-1\right]\frac{360}{90}=0.029557.}}\end{array}
$$  

TABLE 26.2 Two Approaches to Solving for the Equilibrium Swap Rate

Each discount factor is simply the zero-coupon bond price (DF) divided by the sum of several zero-coupon bond prices. For example, the 270-day discount factor is  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{w_{3}=\displaystyle\frac{D F_{3}}{4}=\displaystyle\frac{1}{4L_{0}(t_{2}+90)\big(\frac{t_{2}+90}{360}\big)}}}\\ {{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}D F_{j}\sum_{j=1}^{4}\left[\frac{1}{1+L_{0}(t_{2}+90)\big(\frac{t_{2}+90}{360}\big)}\right]}}\\ {{\displaystyle=\frac{0.97799S}{3.926646}=0.249066.}}\end{array}
$$  

Note that for flat spot rates, the weights are declining. Further, the weighting scheme is present value weights so near-maturity forward rates receive greater weights.  

# 26.2.2 Valuing Interest Rate Swaps  

Now we wish to determine the value of an interest rate swap at some arbitrary point in its life, denoted t. We will assume that we are between payment dates. At this point we know the next upcoming floating payment because it was set at the last payment date. Let us denote the upcoming floating payment that was set at the last date, $L_{k}(q)$ . From the results obtained in the previous section, we know that at the next settlement date the present value of the remaining floating payments plus the hypothetical notional is 1. Thus, we can value the receive-floating swap as  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V S_{t}(J,q)=\left[\frac{1+L_{k}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{t}\left(t_{k+1}-t\right)\left(\frac{t_{k+1}-t}{360}\right)}\right]}}\\ {{-\left\{\displaystyle\sum_{j=k+1}^{J}\left[\frac{R S_{0}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}{1+L_{t}\left(t_{j}-t\right)\left(\frac{t_{k+1}-t}{360}\right)}\right]+\frac{1}{1+L_{t}\left(t_{J}-t\right)\left(\frac{t_{j}-t}{360}\right)}\right\}.}}\end{array}
$$  

Note that the receive-fixed swap value is simply the negation of Equation (26.15). The first term on the right-hand side (in brackets $[]$ ) is the current value of a floating rate bond and the second term (in curly brackets $\{\}$ ) is the current value of the fixed-rate bond, where the fixed rate is based on the previously established fixed swap rate.  

Let us take a closer look at each of these terms. The first term on the right-hand side is the present value of the floating payments plus hypothetical 1.0 notional discounted back from time $k+1$ to time $t$ , that is, over $t_{k+1}-t$ days at the rate that is applicable at time $t$ for $t_{k+1}-t$ days. The second term is the present value of the fixed payments where the discounting is from each of the upcoming payment dates at the appropriate rate for day $t_{j}$ to day $t$ for $j=k+1$ to $J$ plus hypothetical 1.0 notional discounted from the last payment date.  

Recall from Table 26.2 that the fixed swap rate was $2.967032\%$ for a quarterly reset one-year swap. Now suppose 90 days have past and interest rates have fallen significantly. We assume the first swap payment has just been made. Table 26.3 reports the interim calculations involved in computing the current swap value. Note that all but the last row involve similar calculations as previously covered. We assume a receive floating swap. Because we are at a reset date, the present value of the floating payments equals 1.0. Substituting into Equation (26.15), we have  

TABLE 26.3 Illustrating the Swap Value for an Existing Swap

$$  

Note also in Table 26.3 that we provide the new swap rate based on the new term structure. This rate, $1.990115\%$ , would be the rate on a new swap with three payments spaced 90 days apart. As it turns out, we can also value the swap by assuming that we offset the old swap with this new swap. The floating rates cancel, leaving the swap value equal to the present value of the difference in the new fixed rate and the old fixed rate:  

$$
(0.01990115-0.02967032)\left({\frac{90}{360}}\right)(2.970347)=-0.00725445.
$$  

The use of a new hypothetical offsetting contract is how we valued FRAs, so this approach is broadly applicable.  

In this problem we positioned ourselves an instant after the first swap payment, but we could have positioned ourselves completely between swap payment dates. The procedure would be the same.  

Before leaving interest rate swaps, we dive into some important technical details related to understanding swaps as they are actually used in practice.  

# 26.2.3 Technical Details Related to Actual Interest Rate Swaps  

In this section, we deal with some technical aspects related to managing swaps, such as day counting and accrual periods. We elaborate further on viewing swaps as a portfolio of off-market FRAs. For example, consider a swap with payments in 90, 180, 270, and 360 days. Assume the swap is on-market, that is, it has zero value and no exchange of cash at the start, the fixed rate on this swap will come from Equation (26.8).  

Now let us show how we value the swap as a series of off-market FRAs. Assume settlement dates of 90, 180, 270, and 360 days. Create an FRA expiring at each date. If each FRA is a standard FRA, it will have a different fixed rate, but the swap will have the same fixed rate. If, however, we force an FRA to have the swap fixed rate as its fixed rate, the FRA will be off-market. That is not a problem, however, and is one reason we covered off-market FRAs. Some of these FRAs will have positive values, and some will have negative values, but the values must add up to zero at the start. If they did not, it would be possible to execute a swap, hedge it with a series of FRAs, and earn an arbitrage profit.  

We now examine this approach with specific notation to incorporate important practical factors. We assume 1.0 notional and the same accrual period for both legs of the swap. Each accrual period, however, can be different. For example, one accrual period may be for 90 days and another accrual period is for 92 days. Assuming a 360-day year, these two accrual periods are 90∕360 and 92∕360. Because the forward rate is the current market rate to lock in funds for some future period, the value of the receive-floating swap can be expressed as  

$$
V S_{0}\left(J,q\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{J}D F_{F l t,j}A P_{F l t,j}r_{F R,j-1}-r_{F i x}\sum_{j=1}^{J}D F_{F i x,j}A P_{F i x,j},
$$  

where $D F_{F l t,j}\ (D F_{F i x,j})$ denotes the appropriate discount factor for the $j^{t b}$ floating (fixed) rate, $A P_{F l t,j}\left(A P_{F i x,j}\right)$ denotes the appropriate accrual period for the $j^{t b}$ floating (fixed) rate, and $r_{F R,j-1}$ denotes the equilibrium forward rate, which is equivalent to the fixed FRA rate. We use $j-1$ to remind us that the forward rate is set in advance of the period and paid at the end. Solving for the fixed rate that renders Equation (26.16) equal to zero is  

$$
r_{F i x}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}\frac{D F_{F l t,j}A P_{F l t,j}}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J}D F_{F i x,j}A P_{F i x,j}}r_{F R,j-1}=\sum_{j=1}^{J}w_{j}r_{F R,j-1},
$$  

where  

$$
w_{j}=\frac{D F_{F l t,j}A P_{F l t,j}}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{J}D F_{F i x,j}A P_{F i x,j}}.
$$  

Note if the accrual periods are the same, then appropriate weights can be computed solely with discount factors, as we have seen before. Further, notice that the numerator is based on floating payments and the denominator is based on fixed payments. Often, swap structures have different frequencies for both legs, resulting in these weights not summing to one. For example, the plain vanilla swap so widely used has semiannual fixed payments based on a 30∕360-day year, whereas the floating payments are often quarterly based on an actual∕360 -day year.  

Table 26.4 illustrates three different sets of spot rates: flat, upward, and downward. Note that the pattern of these spot rates can be influenced by a number of factors, including expectations of future interest rates and additional premium for perceptions of riskiness. As before, we assume the same accrual periods, we observe downward sloping forward rates resulting in the equilibrium swap rate being below the $2.5\%$ spot rate by just a few basis points. In Panel B, the upward sloping spot curve results in a steeper upward sloping forward curve. As expected, the fixed swap rate of $3.9175\%$ is much higher than the average spot rate of $2.5\%$ . Panel C illustrates the downward sloping spot curve with opposite results where the fixed swap rate is $1.0025\%$ , even though the average spot rate is again $2.5\%$ .  

All three panels demonstrate that a weighted average of forward rates yields exactly the same annual fixed rate as the solution based on zero-coupon bond prices or discount factors.

# 26.3 INTEREST RATE OPTIONS  

As with interest rate forwards and swaps, there are also options on interest rates. An interest rate option gives the right but not the obligation to make or receive a fixed payment at an upcoming date. An interest rate call is the right to make a fixed payment and receive a floating payment. An interest rate put is the right to receive a fixed payment and make a floating payment. As with swaps, the rate is determined on the settlement date, but the payment is made on the next settlement date, at which time the rate is reset.  

# 26.3.1 Interest Rate Option Values  

Using the same notation as with interest rate swaps, on day $J_{:}$ , the value at $J$ of the payoff of a call with strike rate $X$ is  

$$
V I R C_{J}(J,q)=\operatorname*{max}\left[0,\frac{L_{J}(q)-X}{1+L_{J}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}\right].
$$  

Of course, this amount is paid at $j+q$ , hence the discounting to obtain the value at $J.$ . The payoff of an interest rate put is  

$$
V I R P_{J}(J,q)=\operatorname*{max}\left[0,\frac{X-L_{J}(q)}{1+L_{J}(q)\left(\frac{q}{360}\right)}\right].
$$  

Valuing interest rate options prior to expiration, however, is much more difficult than valuing swaps or FRAs. As we have previously noted, options depend on the distribution of the underlying, in particular the volatility. Moreover, although we can typically value an option on an asset in isolation from the options on other assets, we cannot value an interest rate option in isolation from the other interest rate options on the same underlying interest rate but with different maturities and strikes. If we try to do so, we might admit arbitrage. Nonetheless, this procedure is commonly done in practice. For example, many practitioners use the Black model for pricing options on forwards and futures that we previously covered. The reasoning is that an option on an interest rate is really an option on a forward rate. So, to use the Black model one simply plugs in the forward rate as the underlying and the forward rate volatility as the volatility as required in the model. The problem with doing this, however, is that if other options on the same underlying are also offered for trading, these prices could admit arbitrage, because there is no linkage between prices from the Black model for options on the same underlying. That is, applying the Black model to two options on the same interest rate does not guarantee that one cannot arbitrage the one against the other. There is no binding force that connects the option prices, because the model is applied independently to the two options.  

The best method of dealing with this concern is to develop an arbitrage-free model of the term structure. There are many such models, and we shall cover one, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model, in Chapter 27. In Chapter 28 we shall show how to derive prices using a binomial version of that model.  

# 26.3.2 Interest Rate Option Parity Relationships  

There are some important parity relationships between interest rate options and interest rate swaps and forwards. Consider an interest rate call and an interest rate put both with an exercise rate of $X$ . For notational simplicity, let us disregard the adjustment $(q/360)$ and state the payoffs at time $j$ of a long call and short put as  

$$
\operatorname*{max}\bigl[0,L_{j}(q)-X\bigr]-\operatorname*{max}\bigl[0,X-L_{j}(q)\bigr].
$$  

Now, consider the various possible outcomes:  

If $L_{j}(q)>X$ ,   
Call pays $L_{j}(q)-X$ .   
Put pays nothing.   
If $L_{j}(q)<X$ ,   
Call pays nothing.   
Put pays $-\bigl(X-L_{j}(q)\bigr)=L_{j}(q)-X.$  

We can see that in all circumstances, the combination pays $L_{j}(q)-X$ . This makes this combination similar to a long FRA. There is, however, a more precise specification that makes this combination identical to an FRA: that the strike $X$ is the same as the FRA rate. In other words, if $X$ is not the FRA rate, then the call and put would not have the same prices, so going long a call and short a put would result in either the call costing more than the put or the put costing more than the call. There would, therefore, be either a net cash outflow or inflow at the start. Hence, this synthetic FRA would be off-market. An FRA priced at the appropriate arbitrage-free rate that is based on zero value at the start would have no initial cash inflow or outflow. So, if the exercise rate of the interest rate call and put is set at the FRA rate, there would be no net cash inflow or outflow. Then the put and the call have the same price, so buying a call and selling a put would cost nothing on net.  

# 26.3.3 Interest Rate Caps, Floors, and Collars  

A combination of interest rate calls expiring at different dates is called a $c a p$ , because it is often used by a borrower to cap the interest rate on a floating-rate loan. The borrower takes out the loan and buys a cap, which consists of interest rate call options that expire on the dates on which the loan rates are reset. The component call options are called caplets. When the underlying rate is above the cap exercise rate, the caplet pays off and effectively compensates the borrower for the increase in interest rates. When the loan rate is reset below the cap exercise rate, the caplet expires unexercised, and the borrower benefits from the lower rate. The total cost of the component caplets that make up the cap does effectively raise the loan rate, but it serves as insurance that limits the overall rate paid to a maximum, hence, a cap.  

A combination of interest rate puts is called a floor because it is often used by a lender to put a floor on the rate on a floating-rate loan. The individual put options are called floorlets. A lender in a floating-rate loan might buy a floor to put a minimum on the effective rate on a loan. Each floorlet would expire on the day on which the loan rate is reset.  

When the rate resets below the exercise rate, the floorlet pays off and the lender is compensated for the lower rate. The overall cost of the floor lowers the rate of return on the loan but effectively sets a minimum rate.  

A combination of long cap and short floor is called a collar because it is used by borrowers to contain the effective interest rate on a floating-rate loan within a range. The cap strike is chosen at a rate that effectively limits the loan rate to a maximum value. The borrower then sells a floor at a lower strike, which results in giving up gains when the rate falls below the lower exercise rate. The two rates are set such that the price of the cap is precisely offset by the price of the floor.9 The effective rate on the loan will vary between the cap exercise rate and the floor exercise rate. If the call and put exercise rates are both set to the swap rate, the call premium will also equal the put premium and there will be no net cash outflow or inflow at the start. Moreover, the combination will produce the same results as an interest rate swap.  

It is also possible to have forward contracts on swaps, which are called forward swaps, and options on swaps, which are called swaptions. We shall illustrate swaptions when we show how to use a binomial tree to price interest rate derivatives in Chapter 28.  

# 26.4 RECAP AND PREVIEW  

In this chapter, we looked at interest rate derivatives, which are different from the derivatives on assets that we have previously covered. An interest rate is not an asset and, therefore, cannot be owned. Nonetheless, the payoff functions of interest rate derivatives can be replicated. Hence, these derivatives can be priced by arbitrage. We showed that pricing FRAs and swaps is relatively simple, at least in comparison to pricing options in that they can be replicated in a static, rather than dynamic, manner.  

In Chapter 27, we show how an arbitrage-free model of the term structure can be built. It will then form the basis for pricing derivatives on these interest rates that will prohibit arbitrage.  

# QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS  

1 Suppose you are quoted loan rates of $3\%$ for both 270-day and 360-day maturities. Compute the 90-day FRA fixed rate based on this information.   
2 Using the same information as in the previous problem, assume now that 90 days have passed but interest rates have not changed. Specifically, you are quoted loan rates of $3\%$ for both the 180-day and 270-day maturities. Compute the receive-floating FRA value assuming a 1,000,000 notional.   
3 Suppose you are quoted $4\%$ for the 270-day rate and $3\%$ for the 360-day rate. Compute the 90-day FRA fixed rate based on this information. Assuming a trader entered this receive-floating FRA with 1,000,000 notional. Now assume 90 days have passed and the 180-day rate is $3\%$ and the 270-day rate is $4\%$ . Compute the value of this FRA assuming all rates are quoted on an add-on interest basis on a 360-day year.  

4 Suppose you are provided the following information regarding loan spot rates. Compute the equilibrium swap rate based on discount factors as well as forward rates.

5 The following table provides three sets of forward rates each with an average forward rate of $3.5\%$ . Compute the equilibrium swap rates by both methods (discount factors and weighted average of forward rates). Explain your results.

# NOTES  

1. Alternatively, you can think of an asset the way accountants think of assets: as “things” that belong on the left-hand side of the balance sheet wherein the cost of acquiring these “things” is funded by either equity or debt, which comprise the right-hand side of the balance sheet.  

2. All contracts are designated as having a certain underlying amount, called the notional. For example, if the notional were 10 million, the above amount would be multiplied by 10 million. The FRA would be a contract to pay the agreed-on fixed rate of interest and receive the underlying LIBOR interest on 10 million notional. There is no exchange of the 10 million. Only the interest payments are exchanged. In our examples, we are effectively assuming a 1.0 notional.   
3. That is, we multiplied by the factor $1+L_{m}(q)(q/360)$ to reflect rolling over the payoff at the rate $L_{\scriptscriptstyle m}(q)$ .   
4. This point is no different from the fact that if we had a liquid asset, such as stock, and wanted to know what it was worth, we would simply look up its current price in the market. We do not have to actually sell the asset. We just need to know the price at which we could sell it.   
5. There are also swaps based on currencies, commodity prices, stock prices, and stock indexes, but we do not cover these other swaps in this book.   
6. As with FRAs, the example here assumes 1.0 notional. In a real swap, where the notional is more than 1.0, the payments would be multiplied by whatever is the notional. Further, in practice, the accrual period and related day-count methods influence the pricing and valuation of FRAs. For our purposes here, we simply assume 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year.  

7. Recall that we added a 1.0 hypothetical notional when valuing FRAs.  

8. The word notional means in name only, but here we prepend the word hypothetical, which would seem to be unnecessary because these notionals are obviously not exchanged. In currency swaps however, the parties can exchange nonequivalent notionals, meaning, the notionals are not hypothetical.   
9. Technically, this is not a requirement. The exercise rates could be set such that the floor generates more than enough value to result in a net cash inflow from selling the floor at a greater price than buying the cap. Or the exercise rates could be set such that the cap costs more than the floor, resulting in a net cash outflow. These cases are not common, however, and the cap and floor strikes are usually set so that the cap and floor prices are equal. Sometimes this transaction is called a zero-cost collar, but most collars are of the zero-cost type.
