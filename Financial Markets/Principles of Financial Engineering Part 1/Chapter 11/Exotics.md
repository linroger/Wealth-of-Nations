# 11.4 EXOTICS  

Up to this point, the chapter has dealt with option strategies that used only plain vanilla calls and puts. The more complicated volatility building blocks, namely straddles and strangles, were generated by putting together plain vanilla options with different strike prices or expiration. But the use of plain vanilla options to take a view on the direction of markets or to trade volatility may be considered by some as "outdated." There are now more practical ways of accomplishing similar objectives.  

The general principle is this. Instead of combining plain vanilla options to create desired payoff. diagrams, lower costs, and reach other objectives, a trader would directly design new option con-. tracts that can do similar things in a "better' fashion. Of course, these new contracts imply a hedge. that is, in general, made of the underlying plain vanilla options, but the new instruments themselves would sell as exotic options. Before closing this chapter, we would like to introduce further option. strategies that use exotic options as building blocks. We will look at a limited number of exotics, although there are many others that we relegate to the exercises at the end of the chapter..  

# 11.4.1 BINARY, OR DIGITAL, OPTIONS  

To understand binary options, first remember the static strangle and straddle strategies. The idea was to take a long (short) volatility position, and benefit if the underlying moved more (less) than what the implied volatility suggested. Binary options form essential building blocks for similar volatility strategies, which can be implemented in a cheaper and perhaps more efficient way. Also, binary options are excellent examples of option engineering. We begin with a brief description of a European-style binary option.

# FIGURE 11.16  

Intrinsic value of a binary call.  

# 11.4.1.1 A binary call  

Consider a European call option with strike $K$ and expiration time $T.S_{t}$ denotes the underlying risk. This is a standard call, except that if the option expires at or in-the-money, the payoff will be either (i) a constant cash amount or (ii) a particular asset. In this section, we consider binaries with cash payoffs only.  

Figure 11.16 shows the payoff structure of this call whose time $t$ price is denoted by $C^{\mathrm{bin}}\left(t\right)$ The time- $T$ payoff can be written as.  

$$
C^{\mathrm{bin}}(T)=\left\{{\begin{array}{l l}{R}&{{\mathrm{If~}}K\leq S_{T}}\ {0}&{{\mathrm{Otherwise}}}\end{array}}\right.
$$  

According to this, the binary call holder receives the cash payment $R$ as long as $S_{T}$ is not less. than $K$ at time $T.$ Thus, the payoff has an $R$ -or-nothing binary structure. Binary puts are defined in. a similar way..  

The diagram in Figure 11.16 shows the intrinsic value of the binary where $R=1$ . What would the time value of the binary option look like? It is, in fact, easy to obtain a closed-form formula that will price binary options. Yet, we prefer to answer this question using financial engineering. More precisely, we first create a synthetic for the binary option. The value of the synthetic should then equal the value of the binary.  

The logic in forming the synthetic is the same as before. We have to duplicate the final payoffs. of the binary using other (possibly liquid) instruments, and make sure that the implied cash flows and the underlying credit risks are the same..  

# 11.4.1.2 Replicating the binary call  

Expiration payoff of the binary is displayed by the step function shown in Figure 11.16. Now, make two additional assumptions. First, assume that the underlying $S_{t}$ is the price of a futures contract traded at an exchange, and that the exchange has imposed a minimum tick rule such that, given $S_{t}.$ the next instant's price, $S_{t+\Delta}$ , can only equal  

$$
S_{t+\Delta}=S_{t}+i h
$$  

![](images/e2b48233d5b0f52d10ab3d3f2d20fce0630f4ac339b7917e0a67d154aed5a5d3.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.17  

Expiration payoff of a binary call.  

where $i$ is an integer, and $h$ is the minimum tick chosen by the exchange. Second, we assume without any loss of generality that  

$$
R=1
$$  

Under these conditions, the payoff of the binary is a step function that shows a jump of size 1 at $S_{T}=K$  

It is fairly easy to find a replicating portfolio for the binary option under these conditions.. Suppose the market maker buys one vanilla European call with strike. $K$ , and, at the same time, sells one vanilla European call with strike. $K+h$ on the $S_{t}$ Figure 11.17 shows the time- $T$ payoff of this portfolio. The payoff is similar to the step function in Figure 11.16, except that the height is. $h$ , and not 1. But this is easy to fix. Instead of buying and selling 1 unit of each call, the market maker can buy and sell $\frac{1}{h}$ units. This implies the approximate contractual equation  

![](images/ccdc199ad15cf48bb5497babe0a2fd9f19fc26a293c7f0e2cf36cfcfbbdefd42.jpg)  

The existence of a minimum tick makes this approximation a true equality, since  

$$
|S_{t}-S_{t+\Delta}<h|
$$  

cannot occur due to minimum tick requirements. We can use this contractual equation and get two interesting results.  

# 11.4.1.3 Delta and price of binaries  

There is an interesting analogy between binary options and the delta of the constituent plain vanilla counterparts. Let the price of the vanilla $K$ and $K+h$ calls be denoted by $C^{K}(t)$ and $C^{K+h}(t)$ respectively. Then, assuming that the volatility parameter $\sigma$ does not depend on $K.$ we can let $h\to0$ in the previous contractual equation, and obtain the exact price of the binary, $C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)$ , as  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{{\displaystyle C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)=\operatorname*{lim}_{h\rightarrow0}\frac{C^{K}(t)-C^{K+h}(t)}{h}}}}\ {{~}}\ {{{\displaystyle~=\frac{\partial C^{K}(t)}{\partial K}}}}\end{array}
$$  

assuming that the limit exists.  

That is to say, at the limit the price of the binary is, in fact, the partial derivative of a vanilla call with respect to the strike price $K.$ If all Black-Scholes assumptions hold, we can take this partial derivative analytically, and obtain?  

$$
C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)={\frac{\partial C^{K}(t)}{\partial K}}=e^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})
$$  

where $d_{2}$ is, as usual,  

$$
d_{2}=\frac{\mathrm{Log}(S_{t}/K)+r(T-t)-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{(T-t)}}
$$  

$\sigma$ being the constant percentage volatility of $S_{t},$ and, $r$ being the constant risk-free spot rate..  

This last result shows an interesting similarity between binary option prices and vanilla option deltas. In Chapter 9 we showed that a vanilla call's delta is given by  

$$
\mathrm{Delta}={\frac{\partial C^{K}(t)}{\partial S_{t}}}=N(d_{1})
$$  

Here we see that the price of the binary has a similar form. Also, it has a shape similar to that of a probability distribution:  

$$
C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)=e^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})=e^{-r(T-t)}\int_{-\infty}^{\log(S_{t}/K)+r(T-t)-{\frac{1}{2}}\sigma^{2}(T-t)}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}}e^{-{\frac{1}{2}}u^{2}\mathrm{d}u}
$$  

This permits us to draw a graph of the binary price,. $C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)$ . Under the Black-Scholes assumptions, it is clear that this price will be as indicated by the S-shaped curve in Figure 11.16.

# FIGURE 11.18  

Gamma of a binary as a function of underlying.  

# 11.4.1.4 Time value of binaries  

We can use the previous result to obtain convexity characteristics of the binary option shown in Figure 11.16. The deep out-of-the-money binary10 will have a positive price close to zero.. This price will increase and will be around $\frac12$ when the option becomes ATM. On the other hand, an in-the-money binary will have a price less than one, but approaching it as $S_{t}$ gets larger and larger. This means that the time value of a European in-the-money binary is negative for. $K<$ barrier. The $C^{\mathrm{bin}}(t)$ will never exceed 1 (or $R$ ), since a trader would never pay more than $\$1$ in order to get a chance of earning $\$1$ at $T.$  

From this figure, we see that a market maker who buys the binary call will be long volatility if the binary is out-of-the-money, but will be short volatility, if the binary option is in-the-money. This is because, in the case of an in-the-money option, the curvature of the. $\overline{{C^{K+h}(t)}}$ will dominate the curvature of the $C^{K}(t)$ , and the binary will have a concave pricing function. The reverse is true. if the binary is out-of-the-money. An ATM binary will be neutral toward volatility.  

To summarize, we see that the price of a binary is similar to the delta of a vanilla option. This implies that the delta of the binary looks like the gamma of a vanilla option. This logic tells us that the gamma of a binary looks like that in Figure 11.18, and is similar to the third partial with respect to $S_{t}$ of the vanilla option.  

# 11.4.1.5 Uses of the binary  

A range option is constructed using binary puts and calls with the same payoff. This option has a payoff depending on whether the $S_{t}$ remains within the range $[H^{\operatorname*{min}},H^{\operatorname*{max}}]$ or not. Thus, consider the portfolio  

$$
{\mathrm{Range~option}}=\{{\mathrm{Long~}}H^{\operatorname*{min}}-{\mathrm{Binary~call,~Short~}}H^{\operatorname*{max}}-{\mathrm{Binary~call}}\}
$$  

The time- $T$ payoff of this range option is shown in Figure 11.19. It is clear that we can use binary options to generate other, more complicated, range structures.  

![](images/56b7f00a3ddac05b71dbb12391ab17858672e69a26927e5d83b6e66cc8db9112.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.19  

Payoff of a range option.  

The expiration payoff denoted by $C^{\mathrm{range}}(T)$ of such a structure will be given by  

$$
C^{\mathrm{range}}(T)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{R}&{\mathrm{if}\quad H^{\mathrm{min}}<S_{u}<H^{\mathrm{max}}\quad u\in[t,T]}\ {0}&{\mathrm{Otherwise}}\end{array}\right.
$$  

Thus, in this case, the option pays a constant amount. $R$ if $S_{u}$ is range-bound during the whole life. of the option, otherwise the option pays nothing. The following example illustrates the use of such binaries.  

![](images/6d431db8d34e82da2ae47ac45cbf094b57327d8f7c2c80ed4b730eccd3159c06.jpg)  

Figure 11.19 illustrates the long binary options mentioned in the example. Looked at from the angle of yen, the binary options have similarities to selling dollar strangles.11.  

# 11.4.2 BARRIER 0PTIONS  

To create a barrier option, we basically take a vanilla counterpart and then add some properly selected thresholds. If, during the life of the option, these thresholds are exceeded by the underlying, the option payoff will exhibit a discrete change. The option may be knocked out, or it may be knocked in, meaning that the option holder either loses the right to exercise or gains it.  

Let us consider the two most common cases. We start with a European-style plain vanilla option written on the underlying, $S_{t},$ with strike $K.$ and expiration T. Next, we consider two thresholds.  

![](images/3cdd5f386c34b2c2a4531caef116a621eca5f1930dd02a9e429c5384134ac87e.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.20  

Payoff examples of a knock-out put and a knock-out call.  

$H^{\mathrm{min}}$ and $H^{\mathrm{max}}$ with $H^{\operatorname*{min}}<H^{\operatorname*{max}}$ . If, during the life of the option, $S_{t}$ exceeds one or both of these limits in some precise ways to be defined, then the option ceases to exist. Such instruments are called knock-out options. Two examples are shown in Figure 11.20. The lower part of the diagram is a knock-out call. If, during the life of the option, we observe the event.  

$$
S_{u}<H^{\operatorname*{min}}\quad u\in[t,T]
$$  

then the option ceases to exist. In fact, this option is down-and-out. The upper part of the figure displays an up-and-out put, which ceases to exist if the event  

$$
H^{\operatorname*{max}}<S_{u}\quad u\in[t,T]
$$  

is observed.  

An option can also come into existence after some barrier is hit. We then call it a knock-in option. A knock-in put is shown in Figure 11.21. In this section, we will discuss an $H$ knock-out  

![](images/d338f6c1e23f422e5e010869d7a7242b69916f4b00c181d7b766bc202e75515b.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.21

call and an $H$ knock-in call with the same strike $K$ These barrier options we show here have the. characteristic that when they knock-in or -out, they will be out-of-the-money. Barrier options with. positive intrinsic value at knock-in and -out also exist but are not dealt with (for these, see James (2003)).  

# 11.4.2.1 A contractual equation  

We can obtain a contractual equation for barrier options and the corresponding vanilla options.. Consider two European-style barrier options with the same strike $K.$ The underlying risk is $S_{t},$ and, for simplicity, suppose all Black-Scholes assumptions are satisfied. The first option, a knock-out call, whose premium is denoted by $C^{O}(t)$ , has the standard payoff $i f$ the $S_{t}$ never touches, or falls below, the barrier $H$ The premium of the second option, a knock-in call, is denoted by $C^{I}(t)$ . It entitles its holder to the standard payoff of a vanilla call with strike $K$ only if $S_{t}$ does fall below the barrier $H.$ These payoffs are shown in Figure 11.22. In each case, $H$ is such that, when the option knocks in or out, this occurs in a region with zero intrinsic value. Now consider the following logic that will lead to a contractual equation.  

1. Start with the case where $S_{t}$ is below the barrier, $S_{t}<H.$ Here, the $S_{t}$ is already below the threshold $H.$ So, the knock-out call is already worthless, while the opposite is true for the knock-in call. The knock-in is in, and the option holder has already earned the right to a standard vanilla call payoff. This means that for all $S_{t}<H$ , the knock-in call has the same value as a vanilla call. These observations mean  

$$
{\mathrm{~e~range~}}S_{t}<H,{\mathrm{Knock}}{\mathrm{-in}}+{\mathrm{Knock}}{\mathrm{-out}}={\mathrm{Vanilla~call}}={\mathrm{Knock}}{\mathrm{-in}}
$$  

The knock-out is worthless for this range.

# FIGURE 11.22  

Payoffs of a knock-out call and a knock-in call.  

2. Now suppose $S_{t}$ is initially above the barrier, $H.$ There are two possibilities during the life of. the barrier options:. $S_{t}$ either stays above $H$ , or falls below. $H.$ One and only one of these events. will happen during. $[t,T]$ . This means that, if we buy the knock-in call simultaneously with a. knock-out call, we guarantee access to the payoff of a vanilla call. In other words,  

$$
\mathrm{For~the~range}\:H<S_{t},\mathrm{Knock}{\cdot}\mathrm{in}+\mathrm{Knock}{\cdot}\mathrm{out}=\mathrm{Vanilla}\mathrm{call}
$$  

Putting these two payoff ranges together, we obtain the contractual equation:  

![](images/09369df686e834674fecb8248503b0dd4623337e264c46bc7e4d4b354ad5d784.jpg)  

From here, we can obtain the pricing formulas of the knock-in and knock-out barriers. In fact,. determining the pricing function of only one of these barriers is sufficient to determine the price of  

the other. In Chapter 9, we provided a pricing formula for the knock-out barrier where the underlying satisfied the Black-Scholes assumptions.12 The formula was given by  

$$
C^{O}(t)=C(t)-J(t)\quad{\mathrm{for}}\quad H\leq S_{t}
$$  

where  

$$
J(t)=S_{t}\left(\frac{H}{S_{t}}\right)^{\frac{2\left(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\right)}{\sigma^{2}}+2}N(c_{1})-K e^{-r(T-t)}\left(\frac{H}{S_{t}}\right)^{\frac{2\left(r-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\right)}{\sigma^{2}}}N(c_{2})
$$  

where  

$$
c_{1,2}={\frac{\ln(H^{2}/S_{t}K)+(r\pm{\frac{1}{2}}\sigma^{2})(T-t)}{\sigma{\sqrt{T-t}}}}
$$  

The $C(t)$ is the value of the vanilla call given by the standard Black-Scholes formula, and the $J(t)$ is the discount that needs to be applied because the option may disappear if $S_{t}$ falls below $H$ during $[t,T]$  

But we now know from the contractual equation that a long knock-in and a long knock-out call with the same strike $K$ and threshold $H$ is equivalent to a vanilla call:  

$$
C^{O}(t)+C^{I}(t)=C(t)
$$  

Using Eq. (11.41) with this gives the formula for the knock-in price as  

$$
C^{I}(t)=J(t)
$$  

Thus, the expressions in Eqs. (11.42)-(11.44) provide the necessary pricing formulas for barrier options that knock-out and knock-in, when they are out-of-the-money under the Black-Scholes assumptions. It is interesting to note that when $S_{t}$ touches the barrier,  

$$
S_{t}=H
$$  

the formula for $J(t)$ reduces to the standard Black-Scholes formula:  

$$
J(t)=S_{t}N(d_{1})-K e^{-r(T-t)}N(d_{2})
$$  

That is to say, the value of. $C^{O}(t)$ will be zero. The knock-out call option price is shown in Figure 11.22. We see that the knock-out is cheaper than the vanilla option. The discount gets larger, the closer $S_{t}$ is to the barrier,. $H.$ Also, the delta of the knock-out is higher everywhere and is dis-. continuous at $H.$  

Finally, Figure 11.22 shows the pricing function of the knock-in. To get this graph, all we need to do is subtract. $C^{O}(t)$ from $C(t)$ , in the upper part of Figure 11.22. The reader may wonder why the knock-in call gets cheaper as. $S_{t}$ moves to the right of. $K.$ .After all, doesn't the call become more in-the-money? The answer is no, because as long as $H<S_{t}$ the holder of the knock-in does not have access to the vanilla payoff yet. In other words, as $S_{t}$ moves rightward, the chances that the knock-in call holder will end up with a vanilla option are going down.  

# 11.4.2.2 Some uses of barrier options  

Barrier options are quite liquid, especially in FX markets. The following examples discuss the payoff diagrams associated with barrier options..  

The next example illustrates another way knock-ins can be used in currency markets Figures 10.20 and 10.21 illustrate these cases.  

# EXAMPLE  

US dollar puts (yen calls) were well bid last week. Demand is coming from stop-loss trading on the back of exotic knock-in structures. At the end of December, some players were seen selling 1-month dollar puts struck at JPY119 which knock-in at JPY109.30. As the yen moved toward that level early last week, those players rushed to buy cover.   
Hedge funds were not the only customers looking for cover. Demand for short-term dollar puts was widely seen. "People are still short yen," said a trader. "The risk reversal is four points in favor of the dollar put, which is as high as I have ever seen it."  

(Based on an article in Derivatives Week (now part of GlobalCapital)  

According to the example, as the dollar fell toward 110.6 yen, the hedge funds who had sold knock-in options were suddenly facing the possibility that these options would come into existence, and that they would lose money.13 As a result, the funds started to cover their positions by buying out-of-the-money puts. This is a good illustration of new risks often associated with exotic structures. The changes during infinitesimal intervals in mark-to-market values of barrier options can be discrete instead of "gradual."  

The next example concerning barrier options involves a more complex structure. The barrier may in fact relate to a different risk than the option's underlying. The example shows how barrier options can be used by the airline industry..  

Airlines face three basic costs: labor, capital, and fuel. Labor costs can be \*fixed' for long peri-. ods using wage contracts. However, both interest rate risk and fuel price risk are floating, and sud-. den spikes in these at any time can cause severe harm to an airline. The following example shows how airlines can hedge these two risks using a single barrier option..  

# EXAMPLE  

Although these are slow days in the exotic option market, clients still want alternative ways to hedge. cheaply, particularly if these hedges offer payouts linked to other exposures on their balance sheets. Barrier products are particularly popular. Corporates are trying to cheapen their projections by asking for knockout options.  

For example, an airline is typically exposed to both interest rate and fuel price risks. If interest rates. rose above a specified level, a conventional cap would pay out, but under a barrier structure it may not if the airline is enjoying lower fuel prices. Only if both rates and fuel prices are high is the option triggered.. Consequently, the cost of this type of hedge is cheaper than separate options linked to individual exposures..  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, May 13, 1995)  

The use of such barriers may lower hedging costs and may be quite convenient for businesses. The exercises at the end of the chapter contain further examples of exotic options. In the next section, we discuss some of the new risks and difficulties associated with these.  

# 11.4.3 NEW RISKS  

Exotic options are often inexpensive and convenient, but they carry their own risks. Risk management of exotic options books is nontrivial because there are (i) discontinuities in the respective Greeks due to the existence of thresholds and (ii) smile effects in the implied volatility.  

As the previous three chapters have shown, risk management of option books normally uses var-. ious Greeks or their modified counterparts. With threshold effects, some Greeks may not exist at the threshold. This introduces discontinuities and complicates risk management. We review some of these new issues next.  

1. Barrier options may exhibit jumps in some Greeks. This is a new dimension in risk-managing. option books. When spot is near the threshold, barrier option Greeks may change discretely. even for small movements in the underlying. These extreme changes in sensitivity factors make the respective delta, gamma, and vega more complicated tools to use in measuring and. managing underlying risks..   
2. Barrier options are path dependent. For example, the threshold may be relevant at each time point until the option expires or until the barrier is hit. This makes Monte Carlo pricing and. risk-managing techniques more delicate and more costly. Also, near the thresholds the spot. may need further simulated trajectories and this may also be costly..   
3. Barrier option hedging using vanilla and digital options may be more difficult and may be strongly influenced by smile effects..  

We will not discuss these risk management and hedging issues related to exotic options in this book. However, smile effects will be dealt with in Chapter 16.
