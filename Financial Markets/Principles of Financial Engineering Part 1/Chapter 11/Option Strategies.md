# 11.2 OPTION STRATEGIES  

We divide the engineering of option strategies into two broad categories. First, we consider the classical option-related methods. These will cover strategies used by market makers as well as retail investors. They will themselves be divided into two groups, those that can be labeled directional strategies, and those that relate to views on the volatility of some underlying instrument. The second category involves exotic options, which we consider as more efficient and sometimes cheaper alternatives to the classical option strategies. The underlying risks can be any of those mentioned in the previous section.  

# 11.2.1 SYNTHETIC LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS  

We begin with strategies that utilize options essentially as directional instruments, starting with the creation of long and short positions on an asset. Options can be used to create these positions synthetically.  

Consider two plain vanilla options written on a forward price $F_{t}$ of a certain asset. The first is a short put, and the second a long call, with prices $P(t)$ and $C(t)$ , respectively, as shown in Figure 11.3. The options have the same strike price $K$ and the same expiration time $T^{4}$ Assume that the Black-Scholes conditions hold, and that both options are of European style. Importantly, the underlying asset does not have any payouts during $[t,T]$ . Also, suppose the appropriate short rate to discount future cash flows is constant at $r$  

Now consider the portfolio  

$$
\{1\mathrm{Long}K\mathrm{{\cdot}C a l l},1\mathrm{Short}K\mathrm{{\cdot}P u t}\}
$$  

At expiration, the payoff from this portfolio will be the vertical sum of the graphs in Figure 11.3 and is as shown in Figure 11.4. This looks like the payoff function of a long forward contract entered into at $K.$ If the options were at-the-money (ATM) at time. $t.$ the portfolio would exactly duplicate the long forward position and hence would be an exact synthetic. But there is a close connection between this portfolio and the forward contract, even when the options are not ATM.  

At expiration time $T.$ the value of the portfolio is  

$$
C(T)-P(T)=F_{T}-K
$$

# FIGURE 11.3  

Payoff of a long call and a short put position.  

where $F_{T}$ is the time- $T$ value of the forward price. This equation is valid because at. $T,$ only one of the two options can be in-the-money. Either the call option has a value of $F_{T}-K$ while the other is. worthless, or the put is in-the-money and the call is worthless, as shown in Figure 11.3.  

Subtract the time- $t$ forward price, $F_{t}$ , from both sides of this equation to obtain  

$$
C(T)-P(T)+(K-F_{t})=F_{T}-F_{t}
$$  

This expression says that the sum of the payoffs of the long call and the short put plus $(K-F_{t})$ units of cash should equal the time- $T$ gain or loss on a forward contract entered into at $F_{t},$ at time $t$ Take the expectation of Eq. (11.4). Then the time- $t$ value of the portfolio,  

$$
\{1\mathrm{Long}K\mathrm{{-Call}},1\mathrm{Short}K\mathrm{{-Put}},e^{-r(T-t)}(K-F_{t})\mathrm{Dollars}\}
$$

# FIGURE 11.4  

Joint payoff of a long call and short put.  

should be zero at $t$ , since credit risks and the cash flows generated by the forward and the replicat ing portfolio are the same. This implies that  

$$
C(t)-P(t)=e^{-r(T-t)}(F_{t}-K)
$$  

This relationship is called put-call parity. It holds for European options. It can be expressed in terms of the spot price, $S_{t},$ as well. Assuming zero storage costs, and no convenience yield:5.  

$$
F_{t}=e^{r(T-t)}S_{t}
$$  

Substituting in the preceding equation gives  

$$
C(t)-P(t)=(S_{t}-e^{-r(T-t)}K)
$$  

Put-call parity can thus be regarded as another result of the application of contractual equations, where options and cash are used to create a synthetic for the. $S_{t}$ This situation is shown in. Figure 11.5.  

# 11.2.1.1 An application  

Option market makers routinely use the put-call parity in exploiting windows of arbitrage opportunities. Using options, market makers construct synthetic futures positions and then trade them  

![](images/b76959cc49e1626e61e971a633ef6955437b10fea38a305969cdecfd6cf21ec0.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.5  

Put-call parity illustration and payoff of a synthetic stock position.  

against futures contracts. This way, small and temporary differences between the synthetic and the true contract are converted into "riskless" profits. In this section, we discuss an example.  

Suppose, without any loss of generality, that a stock is trading at  

$$
S_{t}=100
$$  

and that the market maker can buy and sell ATM options that expire in 30 days. Suppose also that the market maker faces a funding cost of $5\%$ . The stock never pays dividends and there are no corporate actions.  

Also, and this is the real-life part, the market maker faces a transaction cost of 20 cents per traded option and a transaction cost of 5 cents per traded stock. Finally, the market maker has calculated that to be able to continue operating, he or she needs a margin of 0.25 cent per position. Then, we can apply put-call parity and follow the conversion strategy displayed in Figure 11.6.  

Borrow necessary funds overnight for 30 days, and buy the stock at price $S_{t}$ . At the same time, sell the $S_{t}$ -call and buy the. $S_{t}$ -put that expires in 30 days, to obtain the position shown in Figure 11.6.  

The position is fully hedged, as any potential gains due to movement in. $S_{t}$ will cover the potential losses. This means that the only factors that matter are the transaction costs and any price differentials that may exist between the call and the put. The market maker will monitor the difference between the put and call premiums and take the arbitrage position shown in Figure 11.6 if this difference is bigger than the total cost of the conversion.

Adding together...If prices are different enough" then there will be arbitrage opportunity.

# FIGURE 11.6  

Put-call parity application and conversion strategy.  

# EXAMPLE  

Suppose $S_{t}=100$ , and 90-day call and put options trade actively. The interest cost is $5\%$ - A market maker has determined that the call premium,.. $C(t)$ , exceeds the put premium, $P(t)$ by $\$2.10$ ...  

$$
C(t)-P(t)=2.10
$$  

The stock will be purchased using borrowed funds for 90 days, and the ATM put is purchased and held until expiration, while the ATM call is sold. This implies a funding cost of.  

$$
100(0.05)\bigg(\frac{90}{360}\bigg)=\mathbb{5}1.25
$$  

Add all the costs of the conversion strategy:  

# Cost per Security \$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Funding cost 1.25</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stockpurchase 0.05</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Put purchase 0.20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Call sale 0.20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating costs 0.25</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total cost 1.95</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The market maker incurs a total cost of. $\$1.95$ . It turns out that under these conditions, the net cash position will be positive:.  

$$
\mathrm{Netprofit}=2.10-1.95
$$  

and the position is worth taking.  

If, in the example just discussed, the put-call premium difference is negative, then the market maker can take the opposite position, which would be called a reversal.6  

# 11.2.1.2 Arbitrage opportunity?  

An outside observer may be surprised to hear that such "arbitrage" opportunities exist, and that. they are closely monitored by market makers on the trading floor. Yet, such opportunities are available only to market makers on the "floor' and may not even constitute arbitrage in the usual sense..  

This is because of the following: (i) Off-floor investors pay much higher transaction costs than the on-floor market makers. Total costs of taking such a position may be prohibitive for off-floor investors. (ii) Off-floor investors cannot really make a simultaneous decision to buy (sell) the underlying, and buy or sell the implied puts or calls to construct the strategy. By the time these strategies are communicated to the floor, prices could move. (iii) Even if such opportunities are found, net gains are. often too small to make it worthwhile to take such positions sporadically. It is, however, worthwhile to. a market maker who specializes in these activities. (iv) Finally, there is also a serious risk associated with these positions, known as the pin risk. Pin risk refers to the situation when the market price of the underlying of an option contract at the time of the contract's expiration is close to the option's strike. price. Traders pay attention to whether an underlying such as a stock, for example, may be close to pin-. ning, since a small movement of the price of the underlying through the strike can have a large impact on a trader's net position in the underlying on the trading day after expiration..  

# 11.2.2 A REMARK ON THE PIN RISK  

It is worthwhile to discuss the pin risk in more detail, since similar risks arise in hedging and trading some exotic options as well. Suppose we put together a conversion at 100, and waited 90 days until expiration to unwind the position. The positions will expire some 90 days later during a Friday. Suppose at expiration $S_{t}$ is exactly 100. This means that the stock closes exactly at the. strike price. This leads to a dilemma for the market maker..  

The market maker owns a stock. If he or she does not exercise the long put and if the short call. is not assigned (i.e., if he or she does not get to sell at. $K$ exactly), then the market maker will have. an open long position in the stock during the weekend. Prices may move by Monday and he or she may experience significant losses.  

If, on the other hand, the market maker does exercise the long put (i.e., he or she sells the stock at. $K)$ and if the call is assigned (i.e., he or she needs to deliver a stock at. $K_{\cdot}$ , then the market maker will. have a short stock position during the weekend. These risks may not be great for an end investor who takes such positions occasionally, but they may be substantial for a professional trader who depends on these positions. There is no easy way out of this dilemma. This type of risk is known as the pin risk..  

The main cause of the pin risk is the kink in the expiration payoff at. $S_{T}=K.$ A kink indicates a sudden change in the slope-for a long call, from zero to one or vice versa. This means that even with small movements in $S_{t},$ the hedge ratio can be either zero or one, and the market maker may. be caught significantly off guard. If the slope of the payoff diagram changed smoothly, then the required hedge would also change smoothly. Thus, a risk similar to pin risk may arise whenever the delta of the instrument shows discrete jumps.  

# 11.2.3 RISK REVERSALS  

A more advanced version of the synthetic long and short futures positions is known as risk reversals. These are liquid synthetics especially in the foreign exchange markets, where they are traded as a commodity. Risk reversals are directional positions but differ in more than one way from synthetic long-short futures positions discussed in the previous section.  

The idea is again to buy and sell calls and puts in order to replicate long and short futures positions-but this time using options with different strike prices. Figure 11.7 shows an example. The underlying is $S_{t}$ The strategy involves a short put struck at $K_{1}$ , and a long call with strike $K_{2}$ Both options are out-of-the-money initially, and the $S_{t}$ satisfies  

$$
K_{1}<S_{t}<K_{2}
$$  

![](images/5dee2c6cfbd12acc7d3bc26a4c73e14750c26074193dd237e852e0510f277b55.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.7  

Payoff of a long call, short put, and a risk reversal position.  

Since strikes can be chosen such that the put and call have the same premium, the risk reversal can be constructed so as to have zero initial price..  

By adding vertically the option payoffs in the top portion of Figure 11.7, we obtain the expiration payoff shown at the bottom of the figure. If, at expiration,. $S_{T}$ is between $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$ , the strategy has zero payoff. If, at expiration,. $S_{T}{<}K_{1}$ , the risk reversal loses money, but under $K_{2}<S_{T}$ it  

makes money. Clearly, what we have here is similar to a long position but the position is neutral for small movements in the underlying starting from $S_{t}$ If taken naked, such a position would imply a bullish view on $S_{t}$  

We consider an example from foreign exchange (FX) markets where risk reversals are traded as commodities.  

# EXAMPLE  

Twenty-five delta 1-month risk reversals showed a stronger bias in favor of euro calls (dollar puts) in the last 2 weeks after the euro started to strengthen against the greenback.  

Traders said market makers in EUR calls were buying risk reversals expecting further euro upside. The 1-month risk reversal jumped to 0.91 in favor of euro calls Wednesday. from 0.3 3 weeks ago. Implied volatility spiked across the board. One-month volatility was. $13.1\%$ Wednesday from $11.78\%$ 3 weeks ago as the euro appreciated to USD1.0215 from USD1.0181 in the spot market.  

The 25-delta risk reversals mentioned in this reading are shown in Figure 11.8. The risk reversal is constructed using two options, a call and a put. Both options are out-of-the-money and have a "current' delta of 0.25. According to the reading, the 25-delta EUR call is more expensive than the 25-delta EUR put.  

# 11.2.3.1 Uses of risk reversals  

Risk reversals can be used as "cheap' hedging instruments. Here is an example.  

# EXAMPLE  

A travel company in Paris last week entered a zero-cost risk reversal to hedge US dollar exposure to the USD. The company needs to buy dollars to pay suppliers in the United States, China, Indonesia, and South America.  

The head of treasury said it bought dollar calls and sold dollar puts in the transaction to hedge $30\%$ of its USD200-300 million dollar exposure versus the USD. The American-. style options can be exercised between November and May..  

The company entered a risk reversal rather than buying a dollar call outright because it was cheaper. The head of treasury said the rest of its exposure is hedged using different strategies, such as buying options outright. (Based on an article in Derivatives Week (now part of GlobalCapital).)  

Here we have a corporation that has EUR receivables from tourists going abroad but needs to make payments to foreigners in dollars. Euros are received at time $t.$ , and dollars will be paid at some future date $T,$ with $t<T$ The risk reversal is put together as a zero-cost structure, which means that the premium collected from selling the put (on the UsD) is equal to the call premium on the USD. For small movements in the exchange rate, the position is neutral, but for large movements it represents a hedge similar to a futures contract.

# FIGURE 11.8  

Payoff of a long put, short call a risk reversal position.  

Of course, such a position could also be taken in the futures market. But one important advan-. tage of the risk reversal is that it is "composed' of options, and hence involves, in general, no daily mark-to-market adjustments.  

# 11.2.4 YIELD ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES  

The class of option strategies that we have studied thus far is intended for creating synthetic short and long futures positions. In this section, we consider option synthetics that are said to lead to yield enhancement for investment portfolios.  

![](images/3c7902f2f691ae5ac8c42ce58a83b32295cfc97caff59206321b8113517f47f3.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.9  

Payoff of call overwriting strategy components.  

# 11.2.4.1 Call overwriting  

The simplest case is the following. At time $t.$ , an investor takes a long position in a stock with current price $S_{t}.$ as shown in Figure 11.9. If the stock price increases, the investor gains; if the price declines, he or she loses. The investor has, however, a subjective expected return, $\overset{\mathrm{~\boldmath~\bar{~}~}}{R}_{t}$ , for an interval of time $\Delta$ , that can be expressed as  

$$
\hat{R_{t}}=E_{t}^{\hat{P}}\left[\frac{S_{t+\Delta}-S_{t}}{S_{t}}\right]
$$  

where $\hat{P}$ is a subjective conditional probability distribution for the random variable $S_{\mathrm{t}+\Delta}$ According to the formula, the investor is expecting a gain of $\hat{R_{t}}$ during period $\Delta$ .The question is. whether we can provide a yield-enhancing alternative to this investor. The answer depends on what we mean by "yield enhancement.".  

![](images/28d0051e4a48d99718df6c88e0661f7322193c277ed6098dd94d86a975358472.jpg)  

# FIGURE 11.10  

Payoff of call overwriting strategy.  

Suppose we ask the investor the following question: "What is the maximum gain you would like to make on this stock position?" and the investor indicates $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ as the price he or she is willing to sell the stock and realize the "maximum"' desired gain:  

$$
(S^{\operatorname*{max}}-S_{t})
$$  

Next, consider a call option $C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}$ that has the strike.  

$$
K=S^{\mathrm{max}}
$$  

and that expires at $T=t+\Delta$ . This option sells for $C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}$ at time $t$ We can then recommend the following portfolio to this investor:  

$$
\mathrm{Yield~enhanced~portfolio}=\{\mathrm{Long}~S_{t},\mathrm{Short}~C(t)^{\mathrm{max}}\}
$$  

Assuming zero interest rates, at time $T=t+\Delta$ , this portfolio has the following value, $V_{t+\Delta}$  

$$
V_{t+\Delta}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}+S_{t+\Delta}}&{\mathrm{Option~not~exercised}}\ {C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}+S_{t+\Delta}(S_{t+\Delta}-S^{\operatorname*{max}})=C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}+S^{\operatorname*{max}}}&{\mathrm{Option~exercised}}\end{array}\right.
$$  

According to this, if at expiration, the price stays below the level $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ , the investor "makes' an extra $C(t)^{\operatorname*{max}}$ dollars. If $S_{t+\Delta}$ exceeds the $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ , the option will be exercised, and the gains will be truncated at $S^{\mathrm{max}}+C(t)^{\mathrm{max}}$ . But, this amount is higher than the price at which this investor was willing to sell the stock according to his or her subjective preferences. As a result, the option position has enhanced the "yield' of the original investment. However, it is important to realize that what is being enhanced is not the objective risk-return characteristics, but instead, the subjective expected returns of the investor.  

Figure 11.9 shows the situation graphically. The top portion is the long position in the stock. The bottom profile is the payoff of the short call, written at strike $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ . If $S_{t+\Delta}$ exceeds this strike, the option will be in-the-money and the investor will have to surrender his or her stock, worth $S_{t+\Delta}$ dollars, at a price of $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ dollars. But, the investor was willing to sell at $S^{\mathrm{max}}$ anyway. The sum of the two positions is illustrated in the final payoff diagram in Figure 11.10.  

This strategy is called call overwriting and is frequently used by some investors. The following reading illustrates one example. Fund managers who face a stagnant market use call overwriting to enhance yields.  

# EXAMPLE  

Fund manager motivation for putting on options strategies ahead of the Russell indices annual rebalance   
next month is shifting, say some options strategists. "The market has had no direction since May last year," said a head of equity derivatives strategy in   
New York. Small cap stocks have only moved up slightly during the year, he added. Fund managers are proving increasingly willing to test call overwriting strategies for the rebalance as.   
they seek absolute returns, with greater competition from hedge funds pushing traditional fund managers in   
this direction, [a] head of equity derivatives strategy said. Employing call overwriting strategies--even   
though they suppress volatility levels-looks attractive, because the worst outcome is that they outperform   
the stock on the downside. As such, it can help managers enhance their returns.  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1433, May 11, 2002)  

The situation described in this reading is slightly more complicated and would not lend itself to the simple call overwriting position discussed earlier. The reading illustrates the periodic and routine rebalancing that needs to be performed by fund managers. Many funds "track' well-known indices. But, these indices are periodically revised. New names enter, others leave, at known dates. A fund manager who is trying to track a particular index, has to rebalance his or her portfolio as indices are revised.
