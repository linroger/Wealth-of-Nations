# 3.13 A DIGRESSION: STRIPS  

Before finishing this chapter we discuss an instrument that is the closest real-life equivalent to the default-free pure discount bonds $B(t_{0},t_{i})$ . This instrument is called strips. US strips have been available since 1985 and UK strips since 1997.  

Consider a long-term straight Treasury bond, a German bund, or a British gilt and suppose there are no implicit options. These bonds make coupon payments during their life at regular intervals.. Their day-count and coupon payment intervals are somewhat different, but in essence they are standard long-term debt obligations. In particular, they are not the zero-coupon bonds that we have been discussing in this chapter.  

Strips are obtained from coupon bonds. The market practitioner buys a long-term coupon bond. and then "strips' each coupon interest payment and the principal and trades them separately. Such. bonds will be equivalent to zero-coupon bonds except that, if needed, one can put them back together and reconstruct the original coupon bond..  

The institution overseeing the government bond market, the Bank of England in the United Kingdom or the Treasury in the United States, arranges the necessary infrastructure to make stripping possible and also designates the strippable securities.33 Note that only some particular dealers are usually allowed to strip and to reconstruct the underlying bonds. These dealers put in a request to strip a bond that they already have in their account and then they sell the pieces separately.34 As an example, a 10-year gilt is strippable into 20 coupons plus the principal. There will be 21 zerocoupon bonds with maturities 6, 12, 18, 24 (and so on) months.
