# 3.2 WHAT IS A SYNTHETIC?  

The notion of a synthetic instrument, or replicating portfolio, is central to financial engineering. We would like to understand how to price and hedge an instrument, and learn the risks associated with it. To do this, we consider the cash flows generated by an instrument during the lifetime of its contract. Then, using other simpler, liquid instruments, we form a portfolio that replicates these cash flows exactly. This is called a replicating portfolio and will be a synthetic of the original instrument. The constituents of the replicating portfolio will be easier to price, understand, and analyze than the original instrument.  

In this chapter, we start with synthetics that can be discussed using forwards and futures and. money market products. At the end, we obtain a contractual equation that can be algebraically manipulated to obtain solutions to practical financial engineering problems..  

# 3.2.1 CASH FLOWS  

We begin our discussion by defining a simple tool that plays an important role in the first part of this book. This tool is the graphical representation of a cash flow.  

By a cash flow, we mean a payment or receipt of cash at a specific time, in a specific currency, with a certain credit risk. For example, consider the default-free cash flows in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. Such figures are used repeatedly in later chapters, so we will discuss them in detail.  

# EXAMPLE  

In Figure 3.1 we show the cash flows generated by a default-free loan. Multiplying these cash flows by $^{-1}$ converts them to cash flows of a deposit, or depo. In the figure, the horizontal axis represents time. There are two time periods of interest denoted by symbols $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}.t_{0}$ represents the time of a USD100 cash inflow. It is shown as a rectangle above the line. At time $t_{1}$ , there is a cash outflow, since the rectangle is placed below the line and thus indicates a debit. Also note that the two cash flows have different sizes.

# FIGURE 3.2  

Cash flows generated by a risky loan.  

We can interpret Figure 3.1 as cash flows that result when a market participant borrows USD100 at time $t_{0}$ and then pays this amount back with interest as USD105, where the interest rate applicable to period $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ is $5\%$ and where $t_{1}-t_{0}=1$ year.  

Every financial transaction has at least two counterparties. It is important to realize that the top portion of Figure 3.1 shows the cash flows from the borrower's point of view. Thus, if we look at the same instrument from the lender's point of view, we will see an inverted. image of these cash flows. The lender lends USD100 at time. $t_{0}$ and then receives the principal and interest at time $t_{1}$ . The bid-ask spread suggests that the interest is the asking rate..  

Finally, note that the cash flows shown in Figure 3.1 do not admit any uncertainty, since, both at time $t_{0}$ and time $t_{1}$ cash flows are represented by a single rectangle with known value. If there was uncertainty about either one, we would need to take this into account in the graph by considering different states of the world. For example, if there was a default possibility on the loan repayment, then the cash flows would be represented as in Figure 3.2. If the borrower defaulted, there would be no payment at all. At time $t_{1}$ , there are two possibilities. The lender either receives USD105 or receives nothing.  

Cash flows have special characteristics that can be viewed as attributes. At all points in time, there are market participants and businesses with different needs in terms of these attributes. They will exchange cash flows in order to reach desired objectives. This is done by trading financial contracts associated with different cash flow attributes. We now list the major types of cash flows with well-known attributes.  

# 3.2.1.1 Cash flows in different currencies  

The first set of instruments devised in the markets trade cash flows that are identical in every respect except for the currency they are expressed in..  

In Figure 3.3, a decision maker pays USD100 at time $t_{0}$ and receives $100e_{t_{0}}$ units of Euro at the same time. This is a spot FX deal, since the transaction takes place at time $t_{0}$ .The $e_{t_{0}}$ is the spot exchange rate. It is the number of Euros paid for one USD.'

# 3.2.1.2 Cash flows with different market risks  

If cash flows with different market risk characteristics are exchanged, we obtain more complicated instruments than a spot FX transaction or deposit. Figure 3.4 shows an exchange of cash flows that depend on different market risks. The market practitioner makes a payment proportional to $L_{t_{1}}$ percent of a notional amount $N$ against a receipt of $F_{t_{0}}$ percent of the same $N$ . Here $L_{t_{1}}$ is an unknown, floating LIBOR rate at time $t_{0}$ that will be learned at time. $t_{1}$ $F_{t_{0}}$ , on the other hand, is set at time. $t_{0}$ and is a forward interest rate. The cash flows are exchanged at time $t_{2}$ and involve two different types of risk. Instruments that are used to exchange such risks are often referred to as swaps. They exchange a floating risk against a fixed risk. Swaps are not limited to interest rates. For example, a market participant may be willing to pay a floating (i.e., to be determined) oil price and receive a fixed oil price. One can design such swaps for all types of commodities.  

# 3.2.1.3 Cash flows with different credit risks  

The probability of default is different for each borrower. Exchanging cash flows with different credit risk characteristics leads to credit instruments.  

In Figure 3.5, a counterparty makes a payment that is contingent on the default of a decision maker against the guaranteed receipt of a fee. Market participants may buy and sell such cash. flows with different credit risk characteristics and thereby adjust their credit exposure. For example,. AA-rated cash flows can be traded against BBB-rated cash flows.2.  

# 3.2.1.4 Cash flows with different volatilities  

There are instruments that exchange cash flows with different volatility characteristics. Figure 3.6 shows the case of exchanging a fixed volatility at time. $t_{2}$ against a realized (floating) volatility observed during the period, $[t_{1},t_{2}]$ . Such instruments are called volatility swaps.
