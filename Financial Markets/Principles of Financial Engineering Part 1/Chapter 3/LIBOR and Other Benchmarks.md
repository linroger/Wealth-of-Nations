# 3.4 LIBOR AND OTHER BENCHMARKS  

We first need to define the concept of LIBOR rates. The existence of such reliable benchmarks is essential for engineering interest rate instruments. Banks with high credit ratings borrow money. from each other at the LIBOR rates. The LIBOR yield curves are typically a little higher than gov-. ernment curves and are known as the LIBOR curves or the swap curve. Figure 3.9 shows the USD LIBOR curve on June 13, 2014. It is apparent that on this day the LIBOR curve was above the US government bond yield curve. Later in this chapter, we discuss the construction of the yield curve from bond data, but first let's look at the precise definition of LIBOR..  

LIBOR is an arithmetic average interest rate that measures the cost of borrowing from the point of view of a panel of preselected contributor banks in London. It stands for London Interbank Offered Rate. It is the ask or offer price of money available only to banks. It is an unsecured rate in the sense that the borrowing bank does not post any collateral. The ICE-LIBOR (formerly known as BBA LIBOR) is obtained by polling a panel of preselected banks in London.8

LIBOR interest rates are published daily at 11:00 London time for nine currencies. In 2012, a scandal engulfed LIBOR as the US Department of Justice started a criminal investigation into the manipulation of LIBOR through communication between bankers before the rates were set. The investigations led to large fines by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) in 2012 and the investigations are continuing. The manipulation scandal in addition to evidence of understating of borrowing costs reported for. LIBOR in 2008 has led to a revision in the LIBOR framework and a new code of conduct. To make it more likely that the submitted rates are underpinned by real trades, the number of rates has been reduced. As of July 2013, only five currencies and seven maturities are quoted every day (35 rates). This is a significant drop from the 150 different LIBOR rates (15 maturities for each of 10 currencies) which were quoted before the GFC. Euribor is a similar concept determined in Brussels. by polling a panel of banks in continental Europe. These two benchmarks will obviously be quite. similar. London banks and Frankfurt banks face similar risks and similar costs of funding. Hence. they will lend Euros at approximately the same rate. But LIBOR and Euribor may have some slight. differences due to the composition of the panels used.  

The overnight indexed swap (OIS) rate is an increasingly important interest rate. The index rate is the rate for overnight unsecured lending between banks, for example, the Federal funds rate for US dollars, Eonia for Euros or Sonia for sterling. The LIBOR-OIS spread remained historically around 10 bps in the United States, but in 2007 and in 2011 during the GFC, the spread widened to 40-50 bps which led to a reconsideration of the LIBOR rate as a risk-free rate. Chapter 24 discusses the recent debate about the choice of LIBOR versus OIS as a discount rate. Because of lower counterparty risk, the fixed rate of OIS is considered less risky than the corresponding interbank rate (LIBOR).'  

Eonia is the daily average of overnight rates for unsecured interbank lending in the euro-zone; in other words, the equivalent of the federal funds rate in the United States. The banks contributing to Eonia are the same as the Panel Banks contributing to Euribor. Important LIBOR maturities are overnight, 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months. A plot of LIBOR rates against their maturities is called the LIBOR curve. Derivatives written on LIBOR are called LIBOR instruments. Using these derivatives and the underlying Euromarket loans, banks create LIBOR exposure. SHIBOR (Shanghai), TIBOR (Tokyo), and HIBOR (Hong Kong) are examples of other benchmarks that are used for the same purpose. When we use the term "interest rates" in this chapter, we often mean LIBOR rates or OIS rates.
