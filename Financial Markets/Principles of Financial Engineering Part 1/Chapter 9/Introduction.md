# 9.1 INTRODUCTION  

This chapter is an introduction to methods used in dealing with optionality in financial instruments..   
Compared to most existing textbooks, the present text adopts a different way of looking at options..   
We discuss options from the point of view of an options market maker. In our setting, options are.   
not presented as instruments to bet on or hedge against the direction of an underlying risk. Instead, options are motivated as instruments of volatility.  

In the traditional textbook approach, options are introduced as directional instruments. This is not how market professionals think of options. In most textbooks, a call option becomes in-the-money and hence profitable if the underlying price increases, indirectly associating it with a bullish view. The treatment of put options is similar. Puts are seen as appropriate for an investor who thinks the price of the underlying asset is going to decrease. For an end investor or retail client, such directional motivation for options may be natural. But, looking at options this way is misleading if we are concerned with the interbank or interdealer market. In fact, motivating options as directional tools will disguise the fundamental aspect of these instruments, namely that options are tools for trading volatility. The intuition behind these two views of options is quite different, and we would like the reader to think like an option trader or market maker.  

This chapter intends to show that an option exposure, when fully put in place, is an impure position on the way volatility is expected to change. A market maker with a net long position in options is someone who is "expecting" the volatility to increase. A market maker who is short the option is someone who thinks that the volatility of the underlying is going to decrease. Sometimes such positions are taken as funding vehicles.

# FIGURE 9.1  

Two possible stock price trajectories.  

In this sense, a trader's way of looking at puts and calls is in complete contrast to the directional. view of options. For example, market makers look at European calls and puts as if they were identical objects. As we will see in this chapter, from an option market maker's point of view, there is really no difference between buying a call or buying a put. Both of these transactions, in the end, result in the same payoff. Consider Figure 9.1, where we show two possible intraday trajectories of an underlying price, $S_{t}$ In one case prices are falling rapidly, while in the other, prices are rising.. An option trader will sell puts or calls with the same ease. As we will see, the trader may be concerned with whether he should sell or buy any options, rather than which type of option to sell..  

In this chapter and the next, we intend to clarify the connection between volatility and option prices. However, we first review some basics.
