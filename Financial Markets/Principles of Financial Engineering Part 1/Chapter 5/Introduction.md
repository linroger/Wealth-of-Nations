# 5.1 INTRODUCTION  

This is a nontechnical chapter which deals with repos, an important operation. The idea behind a repo is simple and easy to understand since it is similar to a secured loan such as the purchase of a house using a mortgage. There are some differences between repos and secured loans, but the basic idea is similar since an asset is used as collateral for a loan. The chapter briefly reviews repo markets and some uses of repo. Repo is short for repurchase agreement, which is a transaction that involves the sale of securities together with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date.  

Figure 5.1 illustrates a simplified example of a repo. It involves two parties, a buyer and a seller. The repo has a start and a maturity date and the repo's term is 7 days. On the start date, the seller delivers collateral, such as bonds, to the buyer, in exchange for an amount of cash (1,o0o,ooo).' On the maturity date, the buyer returns the collateral to the seller who repays the loan with interest. The interest rate is called the repo rate and, in the example, it is assumed to be 2 percent (per year) and calculated on a money market basis, i.e., actual/360. Therefore, the payment on the maturity date is  

$$
61,000,389=61,000,000\times\left(1+{\mathrm{repo~rate}}\times{\frac{{\mathrm{actual}}}{360}}\right)=61,000,000\times\left(1+2\%\times{\frac{{\mathrm{actual}}}{360}}\right)
$$  

Below we will explore the details and different types of repos further. In the above example, we made the simplifying assumption that the amount of cash exchanged at the start date was equal to

the market value of the collateral. But what if the collateral value was to suddenly drop? This would lead to losses for the collateral buyer. One way to protect against such potential losses would be for the collateral buyer to pay less than the market value of collateral to the seller. The difference between the market value of the collateral and the amount paid by the buyer to the seller is called the haircut. It is a way of imposing a margin on the collateral seller similar to that of initial margin in futures markets. If in the above example we assumed a haircut of. $1\%$ which would mean that the. buyer would only pay 990,000 to the seller and the repo interest is calculated based on 990,000 and not 1,000,o00. Note that if a client faces a. $1\%$ haircut when he or she borrows cash in the repo. market, the repo dealer can repo the same security with zero haircut and benefit from this transaction.  

Many financial engineering strategies require the use of the repo market. The repo market is both a complement and an alternative to swap markets. During a swap transaction, the market practitioner conducts a simultaneous "sale" and "purchase" of two sequences of cash flows generated by two different securities. In an equity swap, for example, returns of an equity instrument are swapped for a floating rate LIBOR. With no exchange of cash, flexible maturities, and liquid markets, swaps become a fundamental tool. Using swaps, a complex sequence of operations can be accomplished efficiently, quickly, and with little risk.  

Repo transactions provide similar efficiencies, with two major differences. In swaps, the use of cash is minimized and the ownership of the underlying instruments does not change. In a repo transaction, both cash and (temporary) ownership change hands. Suppose a practitioner does need cash or needs to own a security. Yet, he or she does not want to give up or assume the ownership of the security permanently. Swaps are of no help, but a repo is.  

Repo is a tool that can provide us cash without requiring the sale or giving up eventual ownership of the involved assets. Alternatively, we may need a security, but we may not want to own this security permanently. Then we must use a tool that secures ownership, without really requiring. the purchase of the security. In each case, these operations require either a temporary use of cash or a temporary ownership of securities. Repo markets provide tools for such operations. With repo transactions, we can "buy" without really buying, and we can "sell' without really selling. This is similar to swaps in a sense, but most repo transactions involve exchanges of cash or securities, and this is the main difference with swap instruments..  

In each case, the purpose behind these operations is not "long term." Rather, the objective is to con. duct daily operations rather smoothly, take directional positions, or hedge a position more efficiently.
