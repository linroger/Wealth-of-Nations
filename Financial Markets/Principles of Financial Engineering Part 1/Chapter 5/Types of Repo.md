# 5.3 TYPES OF REPO  

The term "repo" is used for selling and then simultaneously repurchasing the same instrument. But in practice, this operation can be done in different ways, and these lead to slightly different repo. categories.  

# 5.3.1 CLASSIC REPO  

A classic repo is also called a US style repo. This is the operation that we just discussed. A repo. dealer owns a security that he or she sells at a price, 100. This security he or she immediately pro-. mises to repurchase at 100, say in 1 month. At that time, the repo dealer returns the original cash received, plus the repo interest due on the sum..  

# EXAMPLE  

An investor with a fixed-income portfolio wants to raise cash for a period of 1 week only. This will be done through lending a bond on the portfolio. Suppose the trade date is Monday morning. The parameters of the deal are as follows:.  

Value date: Deal date $^{+2}$ days   
Start proceeds: 50 million euro   
Collateral: 6 $3/4\%$ 4/2003 Bund (the NOMINAL value equals 47.607 m)   
Term: 7 days   
Repo rate: $4.05\%$   
End proceeds: Start proceeds $^+$ (start proceeds $\times$ repo rate $\times$ term)   
This gives   
EUR $50\mathrm{m}+(\mathrm{EUR}50\mathrm{m}\times0.0405\times7/360)=\mathrm{EUR}50,039,375$   
Repo interest: 39,375  

Thus, by lending 47,607,000 of nominal bonds (DBRs), the investor borrows EUR 50 million (Figure 5.2).  

The difference between the nominal and $50\mathrm{m}$ is due to the existence of accrued interest. Accrued interest needs to be added to the nominal. That is to say, the calculations are done using bond's dirty price.4

Before we look at further real-life examples, we need to consider other repo types.  

# 5.3.2 SELL AND BUY-BACK  

A second type of repo is called sell and buy-back. The end result of a sell and buy-back is no different from the classic repo. But, the legal foundations differ, which means that credit risks may also be different. In fact, sell and buy-backs exist in two different ways. Some are undocumented. Two parties write two separate contracts at the same time. $t_{0}$ One contract involves a spot sale of a security, while the other involves a forward repurchase of the same security at a future date. Everything else being the same, the two prices should incorporate the same interest component as in the classic repo. In the documented sell and buy-back, there is a single contract, but the two operations are again treated as separate.  

# EXAMPLE  

We use the same parameters as in the previous example, but the way we look at the operation is different although the interest earned is the same:.  

Nominal: EUR 47.607 million Bund 6 $3/4\%$ 4/2003   
Start price: 101.971   
Plus accrued interest: 3.05625   
Total price: 105.02725   
Start proceeds: EUR 50,000,322.91   
End price: 101.922459   
Plus accrued interest: 3.1875   
Total price 105.109959   
End proceeds: 50,039,698.16   
Repo interest earned: EUR $50000322.91\times0.0405\times7/360=39.375$  

In this case, the investor's interest cost is the difference between the purchase price and selling price. The interest earned is exactly the same as in classic repo, but the way interest rate is characterized is different. We show the deal in Figure 5.3.

# FIGURE 5.3  

Sell and buy-back example.  

The major difference between the two repo types lies not in the mechanics, or in interest earned, but in the legal and risk management aspects. First of all, sell and buy-backs have no mark-to-market. So they are "easier' to book. Second, in case of undocumented sell and buy-backs, no documentation means lower legal expenses and lower administrative costs. Yet, associated credit risks may be higher. In particular, with sell and buy-backs there is no specific right to offset during default.  

# 5.3.3 SECURITIES LENDING  

Securities lending is older than repo as a transaction. It is also somewhat less practical than repo. However, the mechanics of the operation are similar. The main difference is that one of the parties

# FIGURE 5.4  

Securities lending example  

to the transaction may not really need the cash that a repo would generate. But this party may still want to earn a return, hence, the party simply lends out the security for a fee. Any cash received may be deposited as collateral with another entity..  

Clearing firms such as Euroclear and Clearstream do securities lending. Suppose a bond dealer is a member of Euroclear. The dealer sold a bond that he or she did not own, and could not find in the markets for an on-time delivery. This may result in a failure to deliver. Euroclear can automatically lend this dealer a security by borrowing (at random) from another member.  

Note that here securities can be lent not only against cash but against other securities as well. The reason is simple: the lender of the security does not need cash, but rather needs collateral. The collateral can even be a letter of credit or any other acceptable form.  

One difference between securities lending and repo is in their quotation. In securities lending, a fee is quoted instead of a repo rate..  

# EXAMPLE  

Nominal: GBP 10 million $8.5\%$ 12/07/05 is lent for 2 weeks Collateral: GBP 10.62 million $8\%$ 10/07/06 Fee: 50 bp Total fee: $50\mathrm{bp}\times(14\mathrm{days}/360)\times\mathrm{GBP}\mathrm{~1~}$ 0 million.  

Obviously, the market value of the collateral will be at least equal to the value of borrowed securities. All other terms of the deal will be negotiated depending on the credit of the borrowing. counterparty and the term. This transaction is shown in Figure 5.4..  

# 5.3.4 REPO AND CUSTODY TYPES  

There are two main types of repos: bilateral and tri-party repos. At the beginning of the repo market, there was only the bilateral repo. The bilateral repo market allows for the exchange of cash

and securities directly between collateral and cash providers. Moreover, we can distinguish two different ways of holding the collateral. A classic type is delivery repo. Here the security is delivered to the counterparty. It is done either by physical delivery or as a transfer of a book entry. A second category is called hold-in-custody repo, where the "seller' (lender) keeps the security on behalf of the buyer during the term of the repo. This is either because it is impossible to make the transfer or because it is not worth due to time or other limitations.  

The third type of custody handling is through a tri-party repo, where a third party holds the col-. lateral on behalf of the "buyer" (borrower). Often the two parties have accounts with the same cus-. todian, in which case the tri-party repo involves simply a transfer of securities from one account to another. This will be cheaper since fewer fees or commissions are paid. In this case, the custodian also handles the technical details of the repo transaction such as (i) ensuring that delivery versus payment (DVP) is made and (ii) ensuring marking to market of the collateral. The third party is. responsible for settlement of the repo on its books and for collateral management. As a result the cash lender does not require the back-office capability to take possession of the collateral..  

Based on all of this, a good clearing, custody, and settlement infrastructure is an essential prerequisite for a well-functioning repo market. The above discussion is largely based on the US repo market. Figure 5.5 illustrates the structure of the US repo market including bilateral and tri-party repos.' Securities dealers are active in both borrowing and lending. In a repo one institution with cash to invest, the collateral buyer, purchases securities from another institution, the collateral seller. In practice, there are many different types of collateral buyers such as money market funds, asset managers, securities lending agents, and investors who require specific securities as collateral in order to hedge or speculate in certain markets. In a triparty repo, a third party, called a clearing bank, acts as an intermediary. For simplicity, the figure does not show a clearing bank. In the United States, Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase are the only two clearing banks that handle triparty repos.  

# 5.3.4.1 What is a matched-book repo dealer?  

Repo dealers are in the business of writing repo contracts. At any time, they post bid and ask repo rates for general, as well as special, collateral. In a typical repo contributor page of Reuters or Bloomberg, the specials will be clearly indicated and will command special prices (i.e., special repo rates). At any time, the repo dealer is ready to borrow and lend securities, whether they are special or general collateral. This way, books are "matched."' But this does not mean that dealers don't take one-way positions in the repo book. Their profit comes from bid-ask spreads and from. taking market exposure when they think it is appropriate to do so..  

# 5.3.5 ASPECTS OF THE REPO DEAL  

We briefly summarize some further aspects of repo transactions.  

1. A repo is a temporary exchange of securities against cash. But it is important to realize that the party who borrows the security has temporary ownership of the security. The underlying security can be sold. Thus, repo can be used for short-selling.   
2. Because securities borrowed through repo can, in general, be sold, the securities returned in the second leg of the repo do not have to be identical. They can be "equivalent," unless specified otherwise in the repo deal.   
3. In a repo deal, the lender of the security transfers the title for a short period of time. But the original owner keeps the risk and the return associated with the security. Thus, coupon payments due during the term of the repo are passed on to the original owner of the security. The risk remains with the original owner also because of the marking to market of the borrowed securities. For example, during the term of the repo, markets might crash and the value of the collateral may decrease. The borrower of the security then has the right to demand additional collateral. If the value of the securities increases, some of the collateral has to be returned.   
4. Coupon or dividend payments during the term of the repo are passed on to the original owner. This is called manufactured dividend and can occur at the end of the repo deal or some time during the term of the repo.   
5 In tho Hnited Ctatec and tha Hnited Kinndom rann documantation ic ctandardined A ctandard. repo contract is known as SIFMA/ICMA global master repurchase agreement (the "GMRA").7   
6. In the standard repo contract, it is possible to substitute other securities for the original collateral, if the lender desires so..   
7. As mentioned earlier, the legal title of the repo passes on to the borrower (in a classic repo), so that in case of default, the security automatically belongs to the borrower (buyer). There will be no need to establish ownership.  

Finally, we should mention that settlement in a classic repo is DVP. For international securities, the parties will in general use Euroclear and Clearstream..  

There are three possible ways to settle repo transactions: (i) cash settlement, which involves the same-day receipt of "cash"'; (ii) regular settlement, where the cash is received on the first business date following a trade date; and (iii) skip settlement, when cash is received 2 business days after the trade date.  

# 5.3.6 TYPES OF COLLATERAL  

The best-known repo collateral is, of course, government bonds, such as US Treasuries. Every.   
economy with a liquid government bond market will also have a liquid repo market if it is permissible legally. Yet, there are many types of collateral other than sovereign bonds. One of the most.   
common collateral types is Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) or Asset-Backed Securities (ABS).   
Many hedge funds carry such securities with repo funding. Other collateral types are emerging mar-.   
ket repo and equity repo, discussed below.  

# 5.3.7 REPO AND CREDIT RISK  

During the unfolding of the credit crisis of 2007, repo strategies played a significant role. Several "vehicles" established by banks had repoed structured assets to secure funding. Among these were senior tranches of CDOs that carried a AAA rating. However, repo is senior to senior tranches. During a margin call, the repo dealer has the first right to the collateralized assets, if additional margin is not posted. In this sense, repo funding does introduce additional credit risk.
