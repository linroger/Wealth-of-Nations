# 5.4 EQUITY REPOS  

If we can repo bonds out, can we do the same with equities? This would indeed be very useful.. Equity repos are becoming more popular, but, from a financial engineering perspective, there are potential technical difficulties:  

1. Equities pay dividends and make rights issues. There are mergers and acquisitions. How would we take these events into consideration in a repo deal? It is easy to account for coupons because these are homogeneous payouts. But mergers, acquisitions, and rights issues imply much more complicated changes in the underlying equity.   
2. It is relatively easy to find 100 million USD of a single bond to repo out; how do we proceed with equities? To repo equities worth 100 million USD, a portfolio needs to be put together. This complicates the instrument and makes it harder to design a liquid contract.   
3. The nonexistence of a standard equity repo agreement also hampers liquidity. In the United Kingdom, this business is conducted with an equity annex to the standard repo agreement.   
4. Finally, we should remember that equity has higher volatility which implies more frequent marking to market.  

We should also point out that some investment houses carry old-fashioned equity swaps and. equity loans, and then label them as equity repos. The following article highlights some of the recent issues and risks related to equity repos.  

# EXAMPLE  

Repurchase agreements, known as repos, backed by equities rose 40 percent during the year ended Jan. 10, according to Federal Reserve data. Rising equity-collateral usage combined with a slide in repos backed by. government securities pushed equities share to 9.6 percent of the. $\$1.55$ trillion tri-party repo market in. January, up from 5.7 percent a year earlier,. $I...J$  

One reason for the equity-backed repo increase is because of the higher yield available on them, that. is, from the lender's perspective," Robert Grossman, managing director of macro credit research at Fitch in. New York said in a telephone interview yesterday. "All other things being equal, in a distressed market the nongovernment collateral can have more liquidity issues. $I...J$  

Rates on short-term equity-backed repo transactions were 35 basis points, compared with about 11 basis points on agency repos, according to a separate Fitch study using August 2013 data..  

Fed policy makers and researchers have discussed during the past year that the repo market still requires changes to reduce risks related to fire-sales triggered by a dealer default or lenders' perceptions that it may default. $I...J$ The Fed has been seeking to strengthen the tri-party repurchase agreement market, which almost collapsed in 2008 amid the demise of Bear Stearns Cos. and bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. [...]  

Even as U.S. share prices have surged since 2011, reaching record levels last month, "the degree of leverage achievable through repo borrowing for equity collateral is unchanged," with median discounts holding stable at about 8 percent, according to the Fitch report. The discount refers to the percent difference between the value of a security used as collateral in a repo transaction and the amount of cash a lender is willing to exchange for it.  

"This is something to watch," Grossman said, noting that during the financial crisis equity discounts weren't raised until after the market started to decline.

The above article illustrates the issue of financing costs and haircuts. A small discount makes the borrowing cheaper from the borrower's perspective, but it provides less of a safety cushion from the perspective of the securities lender in case the value of the collateral was to decrease suddenly as a result of equity market turmoil for example.
