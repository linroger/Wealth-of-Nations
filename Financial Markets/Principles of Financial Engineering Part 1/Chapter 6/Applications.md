# 6.5 APPLICATIONS  

The contractual equation derived earlier and the manipulation of cash flows that led to it may initially be thought of as theoretical constructs with limited practical application. This could not be further from the truth. We now discuss four examples that illustrate how the equation. can be skillfully exploited to find solutions to practical, common problems faced by market participants.  

# 6.5.1 APPLICATION 1: A WITHHOLDING TAX PROBLEM  

We begin with a practical problem of withholding taxes on interest income. Our purpose is. not to comment on the taxation aspects but to use this example to motivate uses of synthetic instruments.  

The basic idea here is easy to state. If a government imposes withholding taxes on gains from a particular instrument, say a bond, and if it is possible to synthetically replicate this instrument, then the synthetic may not be subject to withholding taxes. If one learns how to do this, then the net returns offered to clients will be significantly higher-with, essentially, the same risk.  

# EXAMPLE  

Suppose an economy has imposed a withholding tax on interest income from government bonds. Let this withholding tax rate be $20\%$ . The bonds under question have zero default probability and make no coupon payments. They mature at time $T$ and their time $t$ price is denoted by $B(t,T)$ . This means that if  

$$
B(t,T)=92
$$  

one pays 92 dollars at time. $t$ to receive a bond with face value 100. The bond matures at time $T$ , with the maturity value.  

$$
B(T,T)=100
$$  

Clearly, the interest the bondholder has earned will be given by  

$$
100-B(t,T)=8
$$  

But because of the withholding tax, the interest received will only be 6.4:  

$$
{\mathrm{Interest~received}}=8-0.2\cdot(8)=6.4
$$  

Thus the bondholder receives significantly less than what he or she earns.  

We can immediately use the ideas put forward to form a synthetic for any discount bond using the contractual equation in formula (6.8). We discuss this case using two arbitrary currencies called $Z$ and $X$ Suppose T-bills in both currencies trade actively in their respective markets The contractual equation written in terms of T-bills gives.

Manipulating this as an algebraic equation, we can transfer the $Z$ denominated T-bill to the lefthand side and group all other instruments on the right-hand side.

Now, we change the negative signs to positive, which reverses the cash flows, and obtain a synthetic $Z$ -denominated T-bill:  

![](images/ab6ff29544fbbbc4081935be9ed5606d1db40aba214405b8ea340b4e4963bb63.jpg)  

Thus, in order to construct a synthetic for $Z\cdot$ denominated discount bonds, we first need to use money or T-bill markets of another economy where there is no withholding tax. Let the currency of this country be denoted by the symbol $X$ According to Eq. (6.15), we exchange. $Z\mathrm{s}$ into currency $X$ with a spot operation at an exchange rate. $e_{t_{0}}$ . Using the $X^{\ast}$ s obtained this. way, we buy the relevant. $X$ -denominated T-bill. At the same time, we forward purchase $Z\mathrm{s}$ for time $t_{1}$ . The geometry of these operations is shown in Figure 6.3. We see that by adding the cash flows generated by the right-hand-side operations, we can get exactly the cash flows of a T-bill in $Z$  

There is a simple logic behind these operations. Investors are taxed on. $Z\cdot$ -denominated bonds. So they use another country's markets where there is no withholding tax. They do this in a way. that ensures the recovery of the needed $Z\mathrm{s}$ at time $t_{1}$ by buying $Z$ forward. In a nutshell, this is a. strategy of carrying funds over time using another currency as a vehicle while making sure that the entry and exits of the position are pinned down at time $t_{0}$

# 6.5.2 APPLICATION 2: CREATING SYNTHETIC LOANS  

The second application of the contractual equation has already been briefly discussed in Chapter 1. Consider the following market event from the year 1997. 10  

# EXAMPLE  

Following the collapse of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, the "Japanese premium," the extra cost to Japanese banks of raising money in the Eurodollar market increased last week in dramatic style. Japanese banks in the dollar deposit market were said to be paying around 40 bp over their comparable US credits, against less than 30 bp only a week ago.  

Faced with higher dollar funding costs, Japanese banks looked for an alternative source of dollar finance. Borrowing in yen and selling yen against the dollar in the spot market, they bought yen against dollars in the forward market, which in turn caused the UsD/yen forward rate to richen dramatically.  

Thomson Reuters IFR (November 22, 1997).  

Readers with no market experience may consider this episode difficult to understand. Yet, the contractual equation in formula (6.8) can be used skillfully, to explain the strategy of Japanese banks mentioned in the example. In fact, what Japanese banks were trying to do was to create synthetic USD loans. The USD loans were either too expensive or altogether unavailable due to lack of credit lines. As such, the excerpt provides an excellent example of a use for synthetics.  

We now consider this case in more detail. We begin with the contractual equation in formula (6.8) again, but this time we write it for the USD/JPY exchange rate:  

![](images/e42b299027a2220575dcd6fc485653fe6fa62f004e257f87004a7e64d883c22b.jpg)  

Again, we manipulate this like an algebraic equation. Note that on the right-hand side, there is a loan contract. This is a genuine USD loan, and it can be isolated on the left-hand side by rearranging. the right-hand-side contracts. The loan would then be expressed in terms of a replicating portfolio..  

![](images/2df992e810b13966e2b021e5e0fea183d4a9fc2915c488b9413968a4ba815a31.jpg)  

Note that because we moved the deposit and the spot operation to the other side of the equality,. signs changed. In this context, a deposit with a minus sign would mean reversing the cash flow diagrams and hence it becomes a loan. A spot operation with a minus sign would simply switch the. currencies exchanged. Hence, the contractual equation can finally be written as.  

![](images/6339d6142c1c3dafec939d8156c674405e4fcb2cd813c5c21d7120a5c9138241.jpg)  

This contractual equation can be used to understand the previous excerpt. According to the. quote, Japanese banks that were hindered in their effort to borrow Eurodollars in the interbank (Euro) market instead borrowed Japanese yen in the domestic market, which they used to buy. (cash) dollars. But, at the same time, they sold dollars forward against yen in order to hedge their future currency exposure. Briefly, they created exactly the synthetic that the contractual equation implies on the right-hand side.  

# 6.5.3 APPLICATION 3: CAPITAL CONTROLS  

Several countries have, at different times, imposed restrictions on capital movements. These are known as capital controls. Suppose we assume that a spot purchase of UsD against the local currency $X$ is prohibited in some country.  

A financial engineer can construct a synthetic spot operation using the contractual relationship, since such spot operations were one of the constituents of the contractual equation as shown in formula (6.8). Rearranging formula (6.8), we can write  

![](images/387589fb5ed9443abca0ae8676ed7a9261609598049619499d688a6a32c1ce42.jpg)  

The right-hand side will be equivalent to a spot purchase of USD even when there are capital controls. Precursors of such operations were called parallel loans and were extensively used by businesses, especially in Brazil and some other emerging markets.l1 The geometry of this situation. is shown in Figure 6.4.12  

# 6.5.4 APPLICATION 4: "CROSS" CURRENCIES  

Our final example does not make use of the contractual equation in formula (6.8) directly. However, it is an interesting application of the notion of contractual equations, and it is appropriate to consider it at this point.  

One of the simplest synthetics is the "cross rates" traded in FX markets. A cross currency. exchange rate is a price that does not involve USD. The major "crosses"' are EUR/JPY, EUR/ CHF, and GBP/EUR. Other "crosses" are relatively minor. In fact, if a trader wants to purchase Swiss francs in, for example, Taiwan, the trader would carry out two transactions instead of a sin-. gle spot transaction. He or she would buy UsD with Taiwan dollars and then sell the USD against the Swiss franc. At the end, Swiss francs are paid by Taiwan dollars. Why would one go through two transactions instead of a direct purchase of Swiss francs in Taiwan? It is cheaper to. do so because of lower transaction costs and higher liquidity of the USD/CHF and USD/TWD exchange rates.

# FIGURE 6.4  

A synthetic spot operation.  

We can formulate this as a contractual equation:  

![](images/30856047a5a8c0e1528e9b2e56b37ce3ea164afc58b6c761225978bb86fdaa57.jpg)  

It is easy to see why this contractual equation holds. Consider Figure 6.5. The addition of the cash flows in the top two graphs results in the elimination of the USD element, and one creates a synthetic "contract' of spot purchase of CHF against Taiwan dollars.  

This is an interesting example because it shows that the price differences between the synthetic and the actual contract cannot always be exploited due to transaction costs, liquidity, and other rigidities such as the legal and organizational framework. It is also interesting in this particular case, that it is the synthetic instrument which turns out to be cheaper. Thus, before buying and selling an instrument, a trader should always try to see if there is a cheaper synthetic that can do the same job.
