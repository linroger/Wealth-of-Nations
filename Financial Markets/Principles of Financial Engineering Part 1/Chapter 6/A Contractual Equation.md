# 6.4 A CONTRACTUAL EQUATION  

In this section, we will obtain a contractual equation for a currency forward. In the next section, we will show several applications. We have just created a synthetic for a currency forward. The basic idea was that a portfolio consisting of the following instruments:.  

{Loan in EUR, Deposit of USD, spot purchase of USD against EUR} would generate the same cash flows, at the same time periods, with the same credit risk as the currency forward. This means that under the (unrealistic) assumptions of  

1. No transaction costs   
2. No bid-ask spreads   
3. No credit risk   
4. No counterparty risk   
5. Liquid markets  

we can write the equivalence between the related synthetic and the original instrument as a contractual equation that can conveniently be exploited in practice. In fact, the synthetic using the money market involved three contractual deals that can be summarized by the following contractual equation:

This operation can be applied to any two currencies to yield the corresponding FX forward.  

Under the simplifying assumptions listed above, we expect that arbitrage will make the values. of the two sides of the contractual equation equal. Due to arbitrage activity by market participants,. CIRP is one of the financial engineering concepts that holds very closely in normal market condi-. tions. In an interesting recent paper, Mancini-Griffoli and Ranaldo (2013) document deviations from CIRP for several months after the Lehman bankruptcy due to limits of arbitrage. Limits of arbitrage refers to a theory that, due to restrictions that are placed on funds that would normally be used by rational traders to exploit arbitrage opportunities, prices may remain in a nonequilibrium state for long periods of time.
