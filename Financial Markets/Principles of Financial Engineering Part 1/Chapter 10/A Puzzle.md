# 10.2 A PUZZLE  

Here is a puzzle. Consider the yield curve shown in Figure 10.1. The 10-year zero-coupon bond has a yield to maturity that equals $5.2\%$ . The 30-year zero, however, has a yield to maturity of just $4.94\%$ . In other words, if we buy and hold the latter bond 20 more years, we would receive a lower yield during its lifetime.

Yield curve.  

It seems a bit strange that the longer maturity is compensated with a lower yield. There are several economic or institutional explanations for this phenomenon. For example, expectations for inflation 20 years down the line may be less than the inflationary expectations for the next 10 years only. Or, the relative demands for these maturities may be determined by institutional factors and, because players don't like to move out of their "preferred' maturity, the yield curve may exhibit such inconsistencies. Insurance companies, for example, need to hedge their positions on long-term retirement contracts and this preference may lower the yield and raise the price of long bonds.  

But these explanations can hardly fully account for the observed anomaly. Institutional reasons such as preferred habitat and treasury debt retirement policies that reduce the supply of 30-year treasuries may account for some of the difference in yield, but it is hard to believe that an additional 20-year duration is compensated so little. Can there be another explanation?  

In fact, the yield to maturity may not show all the gains that can be realized from holding a. long bond. This may be hard to believe, as yield to maturity is by definition how much the bond will yield per annum if kept until maturity..  

Yet, there can be additional gains to holding a long bond, due to the convexity properties of the instrument, depending on what else is available to trade "against' it, and depending on the underlying volatility. These could explain the "puzzle"' shown in Figure 10.1. The $4.94\%$ paid by the 30-year treasury, plus some additional gains, could exceed the total return from the 10-year bond. This is conceivable since the yield to maturity and the total return of a bond are, in fact, quite different ways of measuring financial returns on fixed-income instruments.
