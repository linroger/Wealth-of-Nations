# 1.2 A MONEY MARKET PROBLEM  

Consider a Japanese bank in search of a 3-month money market loan. The bank would like to bor-. row USD in Euromarkets and then on-lend them to its customers. This interbank loan will lead to cash flows as shown in Figure 1.7. From the borrower's angle, UsD100 is received at time. $t_{0}.$ and then it is paid back with interest 3 months later at time $t_{0}+\delta$ . The interest rate is denoted by the symbol $L_{t_{0}}$ and is determined at time $t_{0}$ . The tenor of the loan is 3 months. Therefore,  

$$
\delta=\frac{1}{4}
$$  

and the interest paid becomes $L_{t_{0}}(1/4)$ . The possibility of default is assumed away.14

The money market loan displayed in Figure 1.7 is a fairly liquid instrument. In fact, banks pur-. chase such "funds"' in the wholesale interbank markets, and then on-lend them to their customers at a slightly higher rate of interest..  

# 1.2.1 THE PROBLEM  

Now, suppose the above-mentioned Japanese bank finds out that this loan is not available due to the lack of appropriate credit lines. The counterparties are unwilling to extend the UsD funds. The question then is: Are there other ways in which such dollar funding can be secured?  

The answer is yes. In fact, the bank can use foreign currency markets judiciously to construct exactly the same cash flow diagram as in Figure 1.7 and thus create a synthetic money market loan. The first cash flow is negative and is placed below the time axis because it is a payment by the investor. The subsequent sale of the asset, on the other hand, is a receipt, and hence is represented by a positive cash flow placed above the time axis. The investor may have to pay significant taxes on these capital gains. A relevant question is then: Is it possible to use a strategy that postpones the investment gain to the next tax year? This may seem an innocuous statement, but note that using currency markets and their derivatives will involve a completely different set of financial contracts, players, and institutional setup than the money markets. Yet, the result will be cash flows identical to those in Figure 1.7.  

# 1.2.2 SOLUTION  

To see how a synthetic loan can be created, consider the following series of operations:  

1. The Japanese bank first borrows local funds in yen in the onshore Japanese money markets. This is shown in Figure 1.8a. The bank receives yen at time $t_{0}$ and will pay yen interest rate $L_{t_{0}}^{Y}\delta$ at time $t_{0}+\delta$   
2. Next, the bank sells these yen in the spot market at the current exchange rate $e_{t_{0}}$ to secure USD100. This spot operation is shown in Figure 1.8b.   
3. Finally, the bank must eliminate the currency mismatch introduced by these operations. In orde to do this, the Japanese bank buys $100(1+L_{t_{0}}^{Y}\delta)f_{t_{0}}$ yen at the known forward exchange rate $f_{t_{0}}$

in the forward currency markets. This is the cash flow shown in Figure 1.8c. Here, there is no exchange of funds at time $t_{0}$ . Instead, forward dollars will be exchanged for forward yen at $t_{0}+\delta$  

Now comes the critical point. In Figure 1.8, add vertically all the cash flows generated by these operations. The yen cash flows will cancel out at time. $t_{0}$ because they are of equal size. and different sign. The time. $t_{0}+\delta$ yen cash flows will also cancel out because that is how the. size of the forward contract is selected. The bank purchases just enough forward yen to pay back the local yen loan and the associated interest. The cash flows that are left are shown in Figure 1.8d, and these are exactly the same cash flows as in Figure 1.7. Thus, the three operations have created a synthetic USD loan. The existence of the FX-forward played a crucial role in this synthetic.  

# 1.2.3 SOME IMPLICATIONS  

There are some subtle but important differences between the actual loan and the synthetic. First, note that from the point of view of Euromarket banks, lending to Japanese banks involves a principal of UsD100, and this creates a credit risk. In case of default, the 100 dollars lent may not be. repaid. Against this risk, some capital has to be put aside. Depending on the state of money markets and depending on counterparty credit risks, money center banks may adjust their credit lines toward. such customers.  

On the other hand, in the case of the synthetic dollar loan, the international bank's exposure to the Japanese bank is in the forward currency market only. Here, there is no principal involved. If the Japanese bank defaults, the burden of default will be on the domestic banking system in Japan. There is a risk due to the forward currency operation, called counterparty risk and since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) this has received much more attention since it can be economically important. Thus, the Japanese bank may end up getting the desired funds somewhat easier if a synthetic is used.  

There is a second interesting point to the issue of credit risk mentioned earlier. The original money market loan was a Euromarket instrument. Banking operations in Euromarkets are considered offshore operations, taking place essentially outside the jurisdiction of national banking. authorities. The local yen loan, on the other hand, would be subject to supervision by Japanese. authorities, obtained in the onshore market. In case of default, there may be some help from the Japanese Central Bank, unlike a Eurodollar loan where a default may have more severe implica-. tions on the lending bank.15  

The third point has to do with pricing. If the actual and synthetic loans have identical cash flows, their values should also be the same excluding credit risk issues. If there is a value. discrepancy the markets will simultaneously sell the expensive one, and buy the cheaper one,. realizing a windfall gain. This means that synthetics can also be used in pricing the original. instrument.16  

Fourth, note that the money market loan and the synthetic can in fact be each other's hedge.. Finally, in spite of the identical nature of the involved cash flows, the two ways of securing dollar funding happen in completely different markets and involve very different financial contracts. This means that legal and regulatory differences may be significant..
