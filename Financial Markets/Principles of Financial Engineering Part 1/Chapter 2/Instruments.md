# 2.6 INSTRUMENTS  

This section provides a list of the major instrument classes from the perspective of financial engineering. A course on markets and instruments along the lines of Hull (2014) is needed for a reasonable understanding.  

The convention in financial markets is to divide these instruments according to the following sectors:  

1. Fixed income instruments. These are interbank certificates of deposit (CDs), or deposits (depos), CP, banker's acceptances, and Treasury bill (T-bills). These are considered to be money market instruments. Bonds, notes, and floating rate notes (FRNs) are bond market instruments   
2. Equities. These are various types of stock issued by public companies   
3. Currencies   
4. Commodities   
5. Derivatives, the major classes of which are interest rate, equity, currency, and commodity derivatives   
6. Credit instruments, which are mainly high-yield bonds, corporate bonds, credit derivatives, CDSs, and various guarantees that are early versions of the former   
7. Structured products MBS, CDO, ABS.  

We discuss these major classes of instruments from many angles in the chapters that follow.
