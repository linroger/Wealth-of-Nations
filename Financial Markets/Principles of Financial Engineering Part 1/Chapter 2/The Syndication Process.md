# 2.8 THE SYNDICATION PROCESS  

A discussion of the syndication process will be useful. Several contract design and pricing issues faced by a financial engineer may relate to the dynamics of the syndication process. Stocks, bonds, and other instruments are not sold to investors in the primary market the way, say, cars or food are sold. The selling process may take a few days or weeks and has its own wrinkles. The following gives an indicative time table for a syndication process.  

# 2.8.1 SELLING SECURITIES IN THE PRIMARY MARKET  

Time tables show variations from one instrument to another. Even in the same sector, the timing.   
may be very different from one issuer to another, depending on the market psychology at that time.   
The process described gives an example. The example deals with a Eurobond issue. For syndicated.   
loans, for facilities, and especially for IPOs, the process may be significantly different, although.   
the basic ideas will be similar..   
1. The week of D-14: Manager is chosen, mandate is given. Issue strategy is determined. Documentation begins.   
2. The week of D-7: Documentation completed. Comanagers are determined..   
3. D-Day: "Launch" date. Contacting underwriter and selling group members. Issue is published in the press.   
4. $\mathrm{D}+8$ : Preliminary allotment done by lead manager.   
5. $\mathrm{D}+9$ : Pricing day.   
6. $\mathrm{D}+10$ : Offering day. Allotment messages are sent to group members..   
7. $\mathrm{D}+24$ : Payment day. Syndicate members make payments.  

In other markets, important deviations in terms of both timing and procedure may occur during. actual syndication processes. But overall, the important steps of the process are as shown in this simple example.  

# 2.8.1.1 Syndication of a bond versus a syndicated loan  

We can compare a bond issue with processing a syndicated loan. There are some differences. Syndicated loans are instruments that are in banking books or credit departments of banks. The follow-up and risk management is done by the banking credit departments with methodologies similar to standard loans. For example, information in the offering circular is not as important.  

Bonds, on the other hand, are handled by investment or in trading books, and the analysis and information in the circular are taken seriously. Documentation differences are major.  

The syndicated loan tries to maintain a relationship between the bank and its client through the agent. But in the bond issue, the relationship between the lender and the borrower is much more distant. Hence, this type of borrowing is available only to good names with good credit standing. Banks have to continuously follow lesser names to stay aware of any deterioration of credit conditions. The maturities can also be very different.
