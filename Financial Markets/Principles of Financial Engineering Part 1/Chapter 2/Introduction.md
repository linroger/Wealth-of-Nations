# 2.1 INTRODUCTION  

This chapter takes a step back and reviews in a nutshell the prerequisite for studying the methods of financial engineering. Readers with a good grasp of the conventions and mechanics of financial markets may skip it, although a quick reading would be preferable.  

Financial engineering is a practice and can be used only when we define the related environ-. ment carefully. The organization of markets, and the way deals are concluded, confirmed, and carried out, are important factors in selecting the right solution for a particular financial engineering. problem. This chapter examines the organization of financial markets and the way market practi-. tioners interact. Issues related to settlement, to accounting methods, and especially to conventions used by market practitioners are important and need to be discussed carefully..  

In fact, it is often overlooked that financial practices will depend on the conventions adopted by a particular market. This aspect, which is relegated to the background in most books, will be an important parameter of our approach. Conventions are not only important in their own right for proper pricing, but they also often reside behind the correct choice of theoretical models for analyzing pricing and risk management problems. The way information is provided by markets is a factor in determining the model choice. While doing this, the chapter introduces the mechanics of the markets, instruments, and who the players are. A brief discussion of the syndication process is also provided.
