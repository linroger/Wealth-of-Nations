# 2.7 POSITIONS  

By buying or short-selling assets, one takes positions, and once a position is taken, one has exposure to various risks.  

# 2.7.1 LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS  

A long position is easier to understand because it conforms to the instincts of a newcomer to financial engineering. In our daily lives, we often "buy"' things, we rarely "short' them. Hence, when we buy an item for cash and hold it in inventory, or when we sign a contract that obliges us to buy something at a future date, we will have a long position. We are long the "underlying instrument,"' and this means that we benefit when the value of the underlying asset increases.  

A short position, on the other hand, is one where the market practitioner has sold an item with-. out really owning it. For example, a client calls a bank and buys a particular bond. The bank may. not have this particular bond on its books, but can still sell it. In the meantime, however, the bank has a short position.  

# 2.7.1.1 Payoff diagrams  

One can represent short and long positions using payoff diagrams. Figure 2.3 illustrates the long position from the point of view of an investor. The investor has savings of 100. The upwardsloping vertical line. $O A$ represents the value of the investor's position given the price of the security. Since its slope is. $+1$ , the price of the security. $P_{0}$ will also be the value of the initial position. Starting from $P_{0}$ the price increases by. $\Delta P$ ; the gain will be equal to this change as well.  

In particular, if the investor "buys" the asset when the price is 100 using his or her own savings, the net worth at that instant is represented by the vertical distance. $O B$ , which equals 100. A market professional, on the other hand, has no "money.' So he or she has to borrow the OB (or the ${\cal P}_{0}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ first and then buy the asset. This is called funding the long position..  

This situation is shown in Figure 2.4. Note that the market professional's total net position amounts to zero at the time of the purchase, when. $P_{0}=100$ . In a sense, by first borrowing and then. buying the asset, one "owns"' not the asset but some exposure. If the asset price goes up, the position becomes profitable. If, on the other hand, the price declines, the position will show a loss..  

Figure 2.5 shows a short position from a market practitioner's point of view. Here the situation is simpler. The asset in the short position is borrowed anyway at. $P_{0}=100$ . Hence, when the price

is 100 at the time of the sale, the net worth is automatically zero. What was sold was an asset that was worth 100. The cash generated by the sale just equals the value of the asset that was borrowed.   
Therefore, at the price $P_{0}=100$ , the position has zero value. The position will gain when the price.   
falls and will lose when the price goes up. This is the case since what is borrowed is a security and.   
not "money." The asset is sold at 100; and, when. $P$ increases, one would have to return to the origi-.   
nal owner a security that is worth more than 100..  

Similarly, when $P$ falls, one covers the short position by buying a new security at a price lower than 100 and then returning this (less valuable) asset to the original owner. Overall, the short position is described by a downward sloping straight line with slope $^{-1}$  

# 2.7.1.2 Real-world complications and short selling  

When we discuss synthetics and replicating portfolios for derivatives in this book, for simplicity,. we assume that borrowing costs associated with shorting the underlying assets are negligible. This may be a reasonable assumption for liquid forward and futures markets, but it is not the case for other assets such as cash equities and bonds. Here, we briefly discuss real-world complications and the mechanics and costs of shorting stocks. Consider a hedge fund that would like to short a share such as Coca-Cola (KO), for example, in the hope of buying it back later at a lower price.. The fund could contact a broker dealer such as Citibank, for example, who would normally locate. the shares by borrowing them from a major custody bank or fund management company such as. State Street, for example. The incentive for State Street to lend the shares lies in the fact that it could charge a fee for lending the shares. If the hedge fund was to borrow a share of KO and sell it for, say $\$41$ , it could however not keep the. $\$41$ . The reason is that the security lender-State Street in. this example-needs to protect itself against the potential inability of the hedge fund to return the share. This is achieved by asking for cash collateral. In an institutional US stock loan, the borrower is required to put up cash collateral, typically. $102\%$ of the value of the stock or $\$41.82$ in the case of KO. The $\$0.82$ represents the margin requirement. Hence, in contrast to stylized academic accounts, short selling in practice does not free up capital, but instead it uses capital. If the price of KO was to increase, to say. $\$50$ , then the hedge fund would receive a margin call and would have to put up additional margin, of say $\$51$ . The opposite would happen if the stock price decreased..  

Once the hedge fund returns the KO share, State Street returns the cash collateral plus interest.. If Street can invest the cash collateral and a market interest rate that is higher than the rebate rate,. that is interest rate paid to the hedge fund, this represents an additional return source for State Street. The difference between the rebate rate and market interest rates is the loan fee that the hedge fund has to pay. Securities lending fees for most stocks are small, that is around $1\%$ per year in the United States, for most stocks, but sometimes they can be as high as. $50\%$ per year or even higher for individual stocks.23 The market for securities lending is after all subject to the same laws. of supply and demand as other markets and hard to borrow securities can only be borrowed at substantial cost. Most securities lending transactions are open loans. An open loan has an overnight. tenor, but continues until one of the counterparties decides to cancel it. The short seller faces recall. risk if the lender decides to recall or cancel the loan..  

In the above example, before the hedge fund closes the short position in KO it must buy back the share. Sometimes a lot of shortsellers try to do so at the same time and this can drive up the price and lead to a short squeeze, as the following recent example illustrates.  

# EXAMPLE  

Great cornering and eye-popping acceleration make Porsche's cars popular among thrill-seeking bankers   
and hedge fund managers. Now its clients are discovering that the carmaker itself has an unexpected talent   
for cornering markets. $I...J$ [...] on October 26th it executed a handbrake turn, saying that it owned nearly $43\%$ of VW's shares   
outright and had derivative contracts on nearly $32\%$ more $I...J$ Hedge funds quickly did the maths,   
concluding that they could be caught in an "infinite squeeze" Their frenzied buying sent VW's share price soaring. $I...J.$ After languishing below 200 last year, it   
jumped to more than 1,005 at one point on October 28th [...].  

The Economist, October 30, 2008  

In the three years preceding October 2008 Porsche had secretly used derivatives to accumulate a stake in VW and repeatedly denied that it was doing so. In the process Porsche had accumulated. most of the freely available shares of VW. The remainder of the shares was owned by the state government and passive funds which implied that hedge funds were short VW risked not being. able to close their short positions in time. The above illustrates that shorting is not simply the oppo-. site of going long. Not only are there borrowing fees, but the risk profile of shorting stocks is also. different from that of going long. Significant borrowing costs also have implications for financial engineering and derivatives pricing. It can affect put-call parity and the early exercise of American. options, which we will discuss in later chapters. The price discontinuities introduced by short squeezes make continuous hedging impossible and violate assumptions about the smooth stochastic processes that some financial engineering models rely on. Financial engineers and traders need to be aware of such model limitations in turbulent times and anticipate them in the pricing of products and execution of arbitrage strategies.  

# 2.7.2 PAYOFF DIAGRAMS FOR FORWARDS AND FUTURES  

Forwards and futures contracts are the most basic type of derivatives and involve some of the simplest cash flow exchanges. We discussed institutional differences between forwards and futures markets in Section 2.2. Next we extend our discussion of positions and payoff diagrams to forwards. A forward is a contract written at time $t_{0}$ with a commitment to accept delivery of (deliver) $N$ units of the underlying asset at a future date $t_{1}$ $t_{0}<t_{1}$ , at the forward price. $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ . At time $t_{0}$ nothing changes hands; all exchanges will take place at time $t_{1}$ . The current price of the underlying asset $S_{t_{0}}$ is called the spot price and is not written anywhere in the contract, instead, $F_{t_{0}}$ is used during the settlement. Note that. $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ has a $t_{0}$ subscript and is fixed at time. $t_{0}$ . An example of such a. contract is shown in Figure 2.6.

# FIGURE 2.6  

Long and short forward position.  

Forward contracts are written between two parties, depending on the needs of the client. They are flexible instruments. The size of contract $N$ , the expiration date $t_{1}$ , and other conditions written in the contract can be adjusted in ways the two parties agree on.  

To recap our earlier discussion: if the same forward purchase or sale is made through a homoge-. nized contract, in which the size, expiration date, and other contract specifications are preset, if the trading is done in a formal exchange, if the counterparty risk is transferred to a clearinghouse, and. if there is formal mark-to-market, then the instrument is called futures..  

Positions on forward contracts are either long or short. A long position is a commitment to accept delivery of the contracted amount at a future date, $t_{1}$ at price $F_{t_{0}}$ . This is displayed in Figure 2.6a.. Here $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ is the contracted forward price. As time passes, the corresponding price on newly written contracts will change and at expiration the forward price becomes $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{1}}$ . The difference, $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{1}}-\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ , is the profit or loss for the position taker. Note two points. Because we assume, for simplicity, that the forward contract does not require any cash payment at initiation, the time $t_{0}$ value is on the. $x$ -axis. This implies that, at initiation, the market value of the contract is zero. Second, at time $t_{1}$ the spot price $S_{t_{1}}$ and the forward price. $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{1}}$ will be the same (or very close).  

A short position is a commitment to deliver the contracted amount at a future date, $t_{1}$ at the agreed price $F_{t_{0}}$ . The short forward position is displayed in Figure 2.6b. The difference. $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}-\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{1}}$ is the profit or loss for the party with the short position..  

# EXAMPLES  

Elementary forwards and futures contracts exist on a broad array of underlyings. Some of the best known are the following:  

1. Forwards on interest rates. These are called forward rate agreements (FRA). An FRA is an OTC contract designed to fix the interest rate that will apply to either borrowing or. lending a certain amount during a specific time period in the future..   
2. Forwards on currencies. These are called FX forwards and consist of buying (selling). one currency against another at a future date $t_{1}$   
3. Futures on loans and deposits. Here, a currency is exchanged against itself, but at a later date. We call these forward loans or deposits. Another term for these is forward-forward. Futures provide a more convenient way to trade interest rate commitments; hence, forward. loans are not liquid. Futures on forward loans are among the most liquid..   
4. Futures on commodities, e.g., be oil, corn, pork bellies, and gold. There is even a thriving market in futures trading on weather conditions.   
5. Futures and forwards on individual stocks and stock indices. Given that one cannot settle a futures contract on an index by delivering the whole basket of stocks, these types of. contracts are cash settled. The losers compensate the gainers in cash, instead of exchanging the underlying products..   
6. Futures contracts on (interest rate) swaps. These are relatively recent and they consist of. future swap rate commitments. They are also settled in cash. Compared to futures trading, the OTC swap and OTC forward market are more dominant here.24   
7. Futures contracts on volatility indices.   
8. Futures contracts on swaps.  

It is interesting to note some technical aspects of the graphs in Figures 2.3-2.7. First, the payoff diagrams that indicate the value of the positions taken are linear in the price of the asset. As the price $P$ changes, the payoff changes by a constant amount. The sensitivity of the position to price. changes is called delta. In fact, given that the change in price will determine the gains or losses on a one-to-one basis, the delta of a long position will be 1. In the case of a short position, the delta. will equal $^{-1}$

One can define many other sensitivity factors by taking other partial derivatives. Such sensitivities are called Greeks and are extensively used in option markets.25 Financial derivatives with a delta of 1 have no optionality and are called Delta One products and the trading desks that pursue strategies related to them are called Delta One desks.26  

Forwards and futures contracts are ideal for creating synthetic instruments for many reasons. Forwards and futures are, in general, linear permitting static replication. They are often very liquid and, in case of currency forwards, have homogeneous underlying. Many technical complications are automatically eliminated by the homogeneity of a currency. Forwards and futures on interest rates present more difficulties and we will discuss them in the next chapter..  

# 2.7.3 TYPES OF POSITIONS  

Positions can be taken for the purposes of hedging, arbitrage, and speculation. We briefly review these activities.  

Let us begin with hedging. Hedging is the act of eliminating the exposures of existing positions without unwinding the position itself. Suppose we are short a bond (i.e., we borrowed somebody's bond and sold it in the market for cash). We have cash at hand, but at the same time, we owe somebody a bond. This means that if the bond price goes up, our position will have a mark-to-market loss.  

In order to eliminate the risk we can buy a "similar' bond. Our final position is shown in Figure 2.7. The long and short positions "cancel' each other except for some remaining basis. risk.2' At the end, we will have little exposure to movements in the underlying price $P$ . To hedge the same risk we can also take the long position not in the cash or spot bond markets, but in a. futures or forward market. That is to say, instead of buying another bond, we may write a contract. at time $t$ promising that we will buy the bond at a prespecified price. $P^{f}$ after $\delta$ days. This will not. require any cash disbursement until the settlement time. $t+\delta$ arrives, while yielding a gain or loss. given the way the market prices move until that time. Here, the forward price. $P^{f}$ and the spot price $P$ will not be identical. The underlying asset being the same, we can still anticipate quite similar. profits and losses from the two positions. This illustrates one of the basic premises of financial engineering. Namely that as much as possible, one should operate by taking positions that do not require new funding.  

The difference between the spot price of a given cash market asset and the price of its related futures contract, $P-P^{f}.$ is called the basis.28 The purchase of a particular financial instrument or commodity and the sale of its related derivative (e.g., the purchase of a particular bond and the sale of a related futures contract) may sometimes not be motivated by a hedging motive, but by speculation, in which case it is also called basis trading.  

# 2.7.3.1 Arbitrage  

The notion of arbitrage is central to financial engineering. It means two different things, depending. on whether we look at it from the point of view of market practice or from the theory of financial engineering.  

We begin with the definition used in the theory of financial engineering. In that context, we say that given a set of financial instruments and their prices, $\{P_{1},P_{2},...,P_{k}\}$ , there is no arbitrage opportunity if a portfolio that costs nothing to assemble now, with a nonnegative return in the future is ruled out. A portfolio with negative price and zero future return should not exist either.  

If prices $P_{i}$ have this characteristic, we say that they are arbitrage free. In a sense, arbitragefree prices represent the fair market value of the underlying instruments. One should not realize gains without taking some risk and without some initial investment. Many arguments in later chapters will be based on the no arbitrage principle.  

In market practice, the term "arbitrage,"' or "arb," has a different meaning. In fact, "arb' repre-. sents a position that has risks, a position that may lose money but is still highly likely to yield a "high" profit.  

# 2.7.3.2 Comparing performance  

There are two terms that need to be defined carefully in order to understand the appendix to Chapter 12 and several examples. An asset $A$ is set to outperform another asset $B$ , if a long position. in $A$ and a simultaneous short position in $B$ makes money. Otherwise $A$ is said to underperform $B$ According to this, outperform indicates relative performance and is an important notion for spread trading.
