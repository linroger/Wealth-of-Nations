# 7.5 THE HEDGE FUND INDUSTRY  

Throughout the book we refer to the application of financial engineering techniques to trading. opportunities and arbitrage as well as derivatives product design. One of the most prominent types of arbitrageur in financial markets is hedge funds. Their strategies are very diverse, but many funds  

use financial engineering techniques to design their strategies and they trade derivatives. Similar to. commodities, hedge funds are often referred to as an alternative asset class. Therefore, in this section, we review the hedge fund industry and its role in financial markets..  

# 7.5.1 ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUNDS  

Hedge funds are alternative investment funds (AIFs) that use a diverse set of techniques to improve performance and reduce volatility. The hedge fund industry has significantly changed over recent years and grown from what in retrospective appears to have been a loosely regulated multibillion. dollar cottage industry dominated by high net worth individuals as its main investors in the 1990s to a tightly regulated and institutionalized sector of the asset management industry that absorbed. many activities previously predominantly found in banks..  

Hedge funds differ from traditional investment funds such as mutual funds in three main ways regulation, investment mandate, and legal structure.  

# 7.5.2 HEDGE FUND REGULATION  

First, to understand the effect of hedge fund regulation, it is important to distinguish the alternative investment fund manager (AIFM) from the hedge funds that it manages.3 The object of recent regulation such as the 2010 Dodd-Frank Walter Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), the JOBS Act and AIFMD/EMIR is the AIFM. AIFMs such as Bridgewater Associates and the Man Group, for example, are headquartered in Connecticut and London, respectively, but their products include onshore and offshore funds. Most hedge funds are located in lightly regulated, low-tax, offshore centers like the Cayman Islands or Bermuda. The Cayman Islands are the single most popular location for hedge funds, with almost one in two registered there. However, even before the global financial crisis (GFC), there have been many onshore hedge funds in the United States or Europe where they were registered with regulators.  

Dodd-Frank changed the regulation of hedge funds in the United States by requiring that all hedge funds with 100 million or more in assets be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It also instructed the SEC to collect information, on a confidential basis, from private fund advisers regarding the risk-profiles of their funds. The 2012 JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) act directed the SEC to remove the decades-old ban on general solicitation that applied to companies or funds that make private securities offerings. As a result, hedge fund managers in the United States are now free to communicate freely with and advertise to the public.  

The European Union (EU) Directive on AIFMs passed in 2010 requires hedge funds to register with national regulators and increased disclosure requirements for AIFMs operating in the EU. The directive also increases capital requirements for hedge funds and places further restrictions on leverage utilized by hedge funds. Non-EU AIFMs marketing funds in the EU are subject to reporting requirements under an enhanced national private placement regime until they are eligible to or required to market under an EU passport in the future.4  

The GFC and the Maddof scandal affected both the supply of and demand for investor capital for hedge funds. The scandal negatively affected the perception of hedge funds by high net worth individuals who often invested in hedge funds via funds of funds. Arbitrages in the real world are not riskless and they require a stable sources of funding. Therefore, sudden redemptions by funds of funds and high net worth individuals during the GFC led many hedge funds to set out and seek more sticky sources of capital such as institutional investors. As a result, the investor base of hedge funds has changed. Since 2010, institutional investors such as pension funds, SwFs, endowments,. and foundations account for the majority of hedge fund investor assets, while HNWI and family. offices are in the minority.  

# 7.5.3 HEDGE FUND INVESTMENT MANDATE AND TECHNIQUES  

The second distinguishing feature of hedge funds has to do with their investment mandate and tech-. niques. Historically, most registered mutual funds had essentially two choices: They could either go long in the stated asset class or stay in cash. Often there is a limit on the latter. Thus, mutual funds have no room for maneuver during bear markets. Hedge funds on the other hand were less restricted and could short the markets. This was perceived at that time to be the "hedge"' for a. down-market, hence the term "hedge fund"' emerged. In addition to shorting, hedge funds could. also use derivatives to speculate or hedge and reduce risk. In recent years, a convergence of the. alternative investment industry and the traditional investment industry has been witnessed as $40A c t$ funds in the United States and absolute return UCITS funds in the EU increasingly employ hedge. fund techniques while being marketed to retail investors.6.  

Regulation explains why hedge funds are allowed to use shorting and derivative, but less well-. known differences in investment mandate explain why they choose to. While traditional mutual. funds normally only offer relative returns, hedge funds aim to offer absolute returns on an investment. For example, traditional funds set for themselves stock or bond market benchmarks and then measure their performance relative to these benchmarks. The fund may be down, but if the bench-. mark is down even more, the fund is said to outperform.' This is because a typical mutual fund has. to be long the underlying securities. When the price of the security goes down, they have few. means to make positive returns. Hedge funds, on the other hand, can realize profits in down-. markets as well. Unlike most traditional fund managers, hedge funds can (1) sell short, (2) use deri-. vatives, and (3) leverage to make bigger investments.  

# 7.5.4 HEDGE FUNDS' LEGAL STRUCTURE  

The use of leverage is explained by the third main feature of hedge funds, which is its legal structure. Hedge funds' legal structure grants them contractual flexibility, such as lockups for investors, whose legal rights are those of a limited partner. These characteristics facilitate leverage and allow the prime broker to grant special funding conditions to hedge funds. Leverage arises not just as a result of (a) borrowing, but also (b) the use of financial instruments with intrinsic leverage such as futures or (c) construction leverage resulting from short positions that fund long positions.8. Nevertheless, hedge funds have had on average lower leverage than banks, which had leverage ratios of 20-30, in the run up to the GFC.' In February 2014, average hedge fund leverage was 2.04, but it varied from 1.02 for Distressed Securities to 3.44 for Global Macro funds according to. Citi Prime Finance.1o Because some hedge funds leverage their capital significantly and some funds trade frequently, hedge funds are much more influential than their equity capital indicates..  

Assets under management in hedge funds were around $\$2.7$ trillion in 2014 compared to less than $\$200$ billion in 1994.1' However, most of the hedge fund $\mathbf{AuM}$ are concentrated in the largest funds. Although only. $9\%$ of funds in 2012 have AuM above $\$1$ billion, these funds manage more than $70\%$ of the industry AuM. The majority of hedge fund assets is therefore managed by large institutionalized AIFMs.12  

Hedge funds are important market participants. According to Reuters, hedge fund trading activity accounted for up to half the daily turnover on the New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange in 2005. More importantly, hedge funds make up almost. $60\%$ of US credit derivatives trading, and about half of emerging market bond trading. According to the same sources, about one-third of equity market activity is due to hedge funds. It is estimated that they are responsible for more than $50\%$ of trading in commodities.  

# 7.5.5 INCENTIVES  

Historically, hedge fund managers often started as prop desk traders at major banks. They then left the bank to set up their own businesses. The Volcker Rule, part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, came into effect on April 1, 2014, and restricts the ability of banking institutions and certain nonbank financial companies to engage in proprietary trading. In anticipation of the implemen-. tation of the rule, many investment banks closed proprietary trading desks with many traders moving to less regulated areas of financial markets such as hedge funds or privately held proprietary trading firms. Client-flow trading desks, of course, remain in investment banks and provide a training ground for young traders and a source of talent for hedge funds..  

Successful traders in banks are attracted by the hedge funds' potentially generous remuneration. Annual fees at traditional mutual funds are normally between 30 and 50 bp. Hedge funds charge an. annual $1-2\%$ management fee. However, they also receive up to $20\%$ of any outperformed amount. Funds of hedge funds charge an additional annual $1-1.5\%$ management fee and an average $10\%$ performance fee.  

Many hedge funds have high water marks. If the value of the portfolio they are managing falls. below, say, last year's value, the fund does not receive performance fees until this level is exceeded again. This means that after a sharp fall in the portfolio, such funds will be dissolved and reestablished under a different entity.  

# 7.5.6 STRATEGIES  

Hedge funds are classified according to the strategies they employ. The market a hedge fund uses is normally the basis for its strategy classification.  

Global macro funds bet on trends in financial markets based on macroeconomic factors. Positions are in general levered using derivatives. As we saw in our discussion of futures and margin requirements, such derivatives cost a fraction of the outright purchase.  

Managed futures/Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). These strategies speculate on market. trends using futures markets. Systematic CTAs differ from discretionary CTAs in that they use. computer programs that use technical analysis tools like relative strength and momentum indicators to make investment decisions.  

Long/short strategists buy stocks they think are cheap and short those they think are expensive. The overall position can be net long or net short. This means that they are not necessarily market. neutral. Within this category, the class of short bias funds can take long equity positions, but their. overall position must be short.  

Emerging market funds use equities or fixed income. Managers using this strategy tend to buy securities and sell only those they own. Note that this is in contrast to short-selling which is a technique that requires borrowing a security before selling it. Many emerging market countries do not allow short selling and derivatives markets in these countries are normally not developed.  

Event driven. There are two groups here. Merger or risk arbitrage trades the shares of firms in takeover battles, normally with a view that the bid will have to be raised to win over shareholders in the target company and will cost the bidder a lot more money. A higher buyout price will usually weigh on the bidding company's share price as it could deplete cash reserves or force it to issue bonds to pay the extra money.  

Distressed debt funds trade the bonds of a company in financial distress, where prices have collapsed, but where the chances of repayment are seen as high or there is a possibility that debt could be converted into equity. Distressed debt normally trades at a deep discount to its nominal value and could be bought against the company's investment grade bonds, which, because of collateral agreements, may not have crashed to the same extent.  

Relative value. These strategies generally buy stocks or bonds managers think are cheap and sell those they think are expensive..  

Equity neutral or hedged strategies should be cash neutral, which means the dollar value of stocks bought should equal the dollar value of stocks they have shorted. They can also be market neutral, which means the correlation between a portfolio and the overall market should be zero.  

Fixed income strategies look at interest rates, sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and mortgage and. asset-backed securities. Managers can trade corporate against government debt, cash versus futures, or a yield curve--short maturity bonds against long maturity bonds. Bonds of different governments are often traded against each other where interest rate cycles are seen to be out of sync..  

Convertible arbitrage funds trade convertible bonds. These are the implicit equity, bond, credit, and derivatives such as options.  

Credit derivatives are a key tool for hedge funds. Within this class, capital structure arbitrage, put simply, involves a hedge fund manager trading corporate bonds against the company's stock on the basis that one is cheap and the other expensive.13  

# 7.5.7 PRIME BROKERS  

Prime brokers offer settlement, custody, and securities lending services to hedge funds. Prime brokers earn their money from commissions and by charging a premium over money market lending rates for loans.  

Prime brokers also provide trade execution, stock lending, leveraged finance, and other essential services to hedge funds. In fact, without prime brokerages, hedge fund activity would be very different than where it is at the moment.  

One factor is the level of leverage prime brokers are offering. Such leverage can multiply a hedge fund's activities by a factor of 3 or more, but increased capital requirements for banks mean that leverage levels are low in hedge funds, especially compared to banks where they are typically 10 times higher than for hedge funds. The second major help provided by prime brokers is in execution of trades. For example, short selling an asset requires borrowing it. How would the hedge fund find a place to borrow such an asset? Prime brokers' securities lending divisions have better information on this.  

An important prime brokerage function is risk management and position keeping. Prime brokers keep the positions of the hedge funds14 and have developed elaborate risk management systems. that a small hedge fund may find too costly to own..  

Global prime brokerage revenues have fallen from $\$15$ billion in 2008 to $\$12$ billion in 2012.15 This trend is due to pressure on profit margins and the multiprime trend in the prime brokerage industry. The collapse of several prime brokerage firms during the GFC, which accounted for a 1arge share of the prime brokerage business, highlighted the need for hedge funds to diversify their. prime broker exposure in order to reduce their counterparty risk. Counterparty risk has become a. much more important consideration in financial engineering since the GFC and we will discuss it in a later chapter in detail.
