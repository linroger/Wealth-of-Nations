# 4.8 SOME CONVENTIONS  

If you have a coupon bond and the payment date falls on a nonworking day, then the payment will be made on the first following working day. But the amount does not change. In swaps, this convention is slightly different. The payment is again delayed to the next working day.33 But the pay-. ment amount will be adjusted according to the actual number of days. This means that the payment. dates and the amounts may not coincide exactly in case swaps are used as hedges for fixed-income portfolios. Most swaps involve terminology and documentation that have been standardized by the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and involve a Master ISDA agreement in place before dealing.  

# 4.8.1 QUOTES  

Suppose we see quotes on interest-rate swaps or some other liquid swap. Does this mean we can deal on them? Not necessarily. Observed swap rates may be available as such only to a bank's best customers; others may have to pay more. In practice, the bid-ask spreads on liquid instruments are very tight, and a few large institutions dominate the market.
