# 4.4 TYPES OF SWAPS  

Swaps are a very broad instrument category. Practically, every cash flow sequence can be used to generate a swap. It is impossible to discuss all the relevant material in this book. So, instead of. spreading the discussion thinly, we adopt a strategy where a number of critical swap structures are selected and the discussion is centered on these. We hope that the extension of the implied swap. engineering to other swap categories will be straightforward.  

# 4.4.1 NONINTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

Most swaps are interest rate related given the LIBOR and yield curve exposures on corporate and.   
bank balance sheets. But swaps form a broader category of instruments and to emphasize this point,.   
we start the discussion with one particular type of noninterest-rate swap, the equity swap. One of the most important recent innovations is the CDS, but we will examine it in detail in a separate.   
chapter. Similarly we will discuss currency- and commodity-related swaps in separate chapters on.   
financial engineering applications in foreign exchange and commodity markets respectively..  

# 4.4.1.1 Equity swaps  

Equity-swaps exchange equity-based returns against LIBOR as seen earlier. These swaps are sometimes also labeled as total return swaps.  

In equity swaps, the parties will exchange two sequences of cash flows. One of the cash flow sequences will be generated by dividends and capital gains (losses), while the other will depend on. a money market instrument, in general LIBOR. Once clearly defined, each cash flow can be valued separately. Then, adding or subtracting a spread to the corresponding LIBOR rate would make the. two parties willing to exchange these cash flows with no initial payment. The contract that makes. this exchange legally binding is called an equity swap..  

Thus, a typical equity swap consists of the following. Initiation time will be $t_{0}$ . An equity index $I_{t_{i}}$ and a money market rate, say LIBOR $L_{t_{i}}$ , are selected. At times $\{t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n}\}$ , the parties will exchange cash flows based on the percentage change in $I_{t_{i}}$ , written as  

$$
N_{t_{i-1}}\left(\frac{I_{t_{i}}-I_{t_{i-1}}}{I_{t_{i-1}}}\right)
$$  

against LIBOR-based cash flows, $N_{t_{i-1}}L_{t_{i-1}}\delta$ plus or minus a spread. The. $N_{t_{i}}$ is the notional amount,.   
which is not exchanged...  

Note that the notional amount is allowed to be reset at every $t_{0},t_{1},...,t_{n-1}.$ , allowing the parties to adjust their position in the particular equity index periodically. In equity swaps, this notional principal can also be selected as a constant, $N.$  

# EXAMPLE  

In Figure 4.6, we have a 4-year sequence of capital gains (losses) plus dividends generated. by a certain equity index. They are exchanged every 90 days, against a sequence of cash

flows based on 3-month LIBOR-20 bp. Figure 4.6a and b depicts the cash flows from the. total return associated with the equity index and the LIBOR payments, respectively Figure 4.6c shows the payoffs of the equity swap..  

The notional principal is USD 1 million. At time $t_{0}$ , the elements of these cash flows will. be unknown.  

At time $t_{1}$ , the respective payments can be calculated once the index performance is observed. Suppose we have the following data:  

$$
I_{t_{0}}=800
$$  

$$
I_{t_{1}}=850\quad L_{t_{0}}=5\%\quad\mathrm{spread}=0.20
$$  

Then the time $t_{1}$ equity-linked cash flow is  

$$
1m\bigg(\frac{I_{t_{1}}-I_{t_{0}}}{I_{t_{0}}}\bigg)=1,000,000(0.0625)=62,500
$$  

The LIBOR-linked cash flows will be  

$$
1m(L_{t_{0}}-s_{t_{0}})\frac{90}{360}=1,000,000(0.05-0.002)\frac{1}{4}=12,000
$$  

The remaining unknown cash flows will become known as time passes, dividends are paid, and prices move. The spread is subtracted from the interest rate..  

Some equity swaps are between two equity indices. The following example illustrates the idea.  

# EXAMPLE  

In an equity swap, the holder of the instrument pays the total return of the S&P 500 and receives the return on another index, say the Nikkei. Its advantage for the holder lies in the fact that, as a swap, it does not involve paying any up-front premium.  

Of course, the same trade could also be created by selling S&P futures and buying futures on. another equity index. But the equity swap has the benefit that it simplifies tracking the indices.  

Later in this chapter, we will discuss several uses of equity swaps.  

# 4.4.2 INTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

This is the largest swap market. It involves exchanging cash flows generated by different interest. rates. The most common case is when a fixed swap rate is paid (received) against a floating LIBOR rate in the same currency. Interest-rate swaps have become a fundamental instrument in world finan-. cial markets. The following reading illustrates this for the case of plain vanilla interest-rate swaps..  

# EXAMPLE  

The swap curve is being widely touted as the best alternative to a dwindling Treasury market for benchmarking US corporate bonds.... This has prompted renewed predictions that the swap curve will be adopted as a primary benchmark for corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.  

... Investors in corporate bonds say there are definite benefits from the increasing attention being paid to swap spreads for valuing bonds. One is that the mortgage-backed securities market has already to a large degree made the shift to use of LIBOR-based valuation of positions, and that comparability of corporate bonds with mortgage holdings is desirable..  

.. Swap dealers also point out that while the agency debt market is being adroitly positioned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as an alternative to the Treasury market for benchmarking purposes, agency spreads are still effectively bound to move in line with swap spreads.  

. Bankers and investors agree that hedging of corporate bond positions in the future will effectively mean making the best use of whatever tools are available. So even if swaps and agency bonds have limitations, and credit costs edge up, they will still be increasingly widely used for hedging purposes  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 6321).  

This reading illustrates the crucial position held by the swap market in the world of finance.. The "swap curve" obtained from interest-rate swaps is considered by many as a benchmark for the term structure of interest rates, and this means that most assets could eventually be. priced off the interest-rate swaps, in one way or another. Also, the reading correctly points out some major sectors in markets. In particular, (1) the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market,. (2) the market for "agencies," which means securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,. etc., and (3) the corporate bond market have their own complications, yet, swaps play a major role in all of them. At this point, it is best to define formally the interest-rate swap and then. look at an example.  

A plain vanilla interest-rate swap initiated at time $t_{0}$ is a commitment to exchange interest pay-. ments associated with a notional amount. $N.$ settled at clearly identified settlement dates,. $\{t_{1},\left.t_{2},\ldots\right.,$ $t_{n}{\big\}}$ . The buyer of the swap will make fixed payments of size $s_{t_{0}}N\delta$ each and receive floating pay-. ments of size $L_{t_{i}}N\delta$ . The LIBOR rate $L_{t_{i}}$ is determined at set dates $\{t_{0},t_{1},...,t_{n-1}\}$ . The maturity of swap is $m$ years.' The $s_{t_{0}}$ is the swap rate.  

# EXAMPLE  

An interest-rate swap has a notional amount $N$ of USD 1 million, a. $7\%$ fixed rate for 2 years. in semiannual (s.a.) payments against a cash flow generated by 6-month LIBOR. This is shown in Figure. $4.7\mathrm{a}$ . There are two sequences of cash flows. One involves four payments of USD35,000 each. They are known at. $t_{0}$ and paid at the end of each 6-month period.  

![](8e01410c38f3cc8443a247220aec273138024d9e7ec296f0df3f914708246400.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.7  

Cash flows of fixed payer and fixed receiver in an interest-rate swap.  

The second is shown in Figure 4.7b. These cash flows are determined by the value of 6-month USD LIBOR to be observed at set dates. Four separate LIBOR rates will be observed during this period. The $L_{t_{0}}$ is known at the initial point $t_{0}$ .The remaining. LIBOR rates, $L_{t_{1}},L_{t_{2}}$ and $L_{t_{3}}$ , will be observed gradually as time passes but are unknown. initially.  

In Figure 4.7, the floating cash flows depending on $L_{t_{i}}$ are observed at time $t_{i}$ but are paid-inarrears at times $t_{i+1}$ . Swaps that have this characteristic are known as paid-in-arrears swaps.  

Clearly, we have two sets of cash flows with different market risk characteristics. The market will price them separately. Once this is done, market participants can trade them. A fixed payer will pay the cash flows in Figure 4.7a and receive the one in Figure 4.7b. This institution is the buyer of the interest-rate swap.  

The market participant on the other side of the deal will be doing the reverse-receiving cash flows based on a fixed interest rate at time $t_{0}$ , while paying cash flows that become gradually known as time passes and the LIBOR rates $L_{t_{i}}$ are revealed. This party is the fixed receiver, whom the market also calls the seller of the swap.11 These cash flows of the fixed receiver are shown in Figure 4.7c and d. We can always make the exchange of the two cash flows acceptable to both parties by adding a proper spread to one of the cash flows.'2 This role is played by the swap spread. The market includes the spread in the fixed rate. By adjusting this spread accordingly, the two parties may be brought together and accept the exchange of one cash flow against another. The agreed fixed rate is the swap rate. We have  

The benchmark rate is often selected as the same maturity sovereign bond in that currency.  

The final cash flows of an interest-rate swap from the fixed payer's point of view will be as shown in Figure 4.5. Only the net amount will change hands..  

A real-life example might be helpful. In the following, we consider a private company that is contemplating an increase in the proportion of its floating rate debt. The company can do this by issuing short-term paper, called commercial paper (CP), and continuing to roll over the debt when these obligations mature. But a second way of doing it is by first issuing a 5-year fixed-rate bond and then swapping the interest paid into floating interest rates.  

# EXAMPLE  

A corporation considers issuing commercial paper or a medium-term fixed-rate bond (MTN) that it can convert to a floating-rate liability via a swap. The company is looking to increase the share of floating-rate liabilities to $50-55\%$ from $30\%$  

The alternative to tapping the MTN market is drawing on its $\$700$ million commercial paper facility.  

This reading shows one role played by swaps in daily decisions faced by corporate treasuries.. The existence of swaps makes the rates observed in the important CP sector more closely related to the interest rates in the MTN sector.  

# 4.4.2.1 Basis swaps  

Basis swaps are similar to currency swaps except that often there is only one currency involved. A basis swap involves exchanging cash flows in one floating rate, against cash flows in another floating rate, in the same currency. One of the involved interest rates is often a non-LIBOR-based rate, and the other is LIBOR.  

The following reading gives an idea about the basis swap. Fannie Mae, a US government agency, borrows from international money markets in USD LIBOR and then lends these funds to mortgage banks. Fannie Mae faces a basis risk while doing this. There is a small difference between the interest rate that it eventually pays, which is USD LIBOR, and the interest rate it eventually receives, the USD discount rate. To hedge its position, Fannie Mae needs to convert one floating rate to the other. This is the topic of the reading that follows:  

# EXAMPLE  

Merrill Lynch has been using Fannie Mae benchmark bonds to price and hedge its billion dollar discount/ basis swap business. "We have used the benchmark bonds as a pricing tool for our discount/LIBOR basis. swaps since the day they were issued. We continue to use them to price the swaps and hedge our exposure," said the head of interest-rate derivatives trading.   
He added that hedging activity was centered on the 5- and 10-year bonds-the typical discount/LIBOR basis swap tenors. Discount/LIBOR swaps and notes are employed extensively by US agencies, such as Fannie Mae, to hedge their basis risk. They lend at the US discount rate but fund themselves at the LIBOR rate and as a result are exposed to the LlBOR/discount rate spread. Under the basis swap, the agency/ municipality receives LlBOR and in return pays the discount rate.   
Major US derivative providers began offering discount/LIBOR basis swaps several years ago and now run billion dollar books.  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1229).  

This reading illustrates two things. Fannie Mae needs to swap one floating rate to another in order to allow the receipts and payments to be based on the same risk. But at the same time, because Fannie Mae is hedging using basis swaps and because there is a large amount of such Fannie Mae bonds, some market practitioners may think that these agency bonds make good pricing tools for basis swaps themselves.  

# 4.4.2.2 What is an asset swap?  

The term asset swap can, in principle, be used for any type of swap. After all, sequences of cash flows considered thus far are generated by some assets, indices, or reference rates. Also, swaps. linked to equity indices or reference rates such as LIBOR can easily be visualized as FRNs, corporate bond portfolios, or portfolios of stocks. Exchanging these cash flows is equivalent to exchanging the underlying asset.  

Yet, the term asset swap is often used with a more precise meaning. Consider a defaultable. par bond that pays annual coupon $c_{t_{0}}$ . Suppose the payments are semiannual. Then we can imagine a swap where coupon payments are exchanged against 6-month LIBOR $L_{t_{i}}$ plus a spread $s_{t_{0}}$ every 6 months. The coupon payments are fixed and known at. $t_{0}$ . The floating payments will be random, although the spread component, $s_{t_{0}}$ , is known at time $t_{0}$ as well. This structure is often. labeled an asset swap.13 The reader can easily put together the cash flows implied by this instrument, if the issue of default is ignored. Such a cash flow diagram would follow the exchanges as shown in Figure 4.4. One sequence of cash flows would represent coupons, the other LIBOR plus a spread.  

Asset swaps interpreted this way offer a useful alternative to investors. An investor can always buy a bond and receive the coupon. $c_{t_{0}}$ . But by using an asset swap, the investor can also swap out. of the coupon payments and receive only floating LIBOR plus the spread. $s_{t_{0}}$ .This way the exposure to the issuer is kept and the exposure to fixed interest rates is eliminated. In fact, treasury bonds or fixed receiver interest swaps may be better choices if one desires exposure to fixed interest rates. Given the use of LIBOR in this structure, the $s_{t_{0}}$ is calculated as the spread to the corresponding fixed swap rates.  

# 4.4.2.3 More complex swaps  

The swaps discussed thus far are liquid and are traded actively. One can imagine many other swaps. Some of these are also liquid, others are not. Amortizing swaps, bullion swaps, MBS swaps, quanto (differential) swaps, inflation swaps, longevity swaps14 are some that come to mind. We will not elaborate on them at this point; some of these swaps will be introduced as examples or exercises in later chapters.  

An interesting special case is constant maturity swaps (CMS), which will be discussed in detail. in Chapter 14. The CMS swaps have an interesting convexity dimension that requires taking into. account volatilities and correlations across various forward rates along a yield curve. A related swap category is constant maturity treasury (CMT) swaps..  

# 4.4.3 SWAP CONVENTIONS  

Interest-rate swap markets have their own conventions. In some economies, the market quotes the swap spread. This is the case for USD interest-rate swaps. USD interest-rates swaps are quoted as a spread to Treasuries. In Australia, the market also quotes swap spreads. But the spreads are to bond futures.  

In other economies, the market quotes the swap rate. This is the case for euro interest-rate swaps.  

Next, there is the issue of how to quote swaps. This is done in terms of two-way interest-rate quotes. But sometimes the quoted swap rate is on an annual basis, and sometimes it is on a semiannual basis. Also, the day-count conventions change from one market to another. In UsD swaps, the day-count is in general ACT/360. In EUR swaps day-count is 30/360.  

According to market conventions, a fixed payer, called the payer, is long the swap, and has bought a swap. On the other hand, a fixed receiver, called the receiver, is short the swap, and has sold a swap.
