# 4.9 ADDITIONAL TERMINOLOGY  

We would like to introduce some additional terms and instruments before moving on.  

A par swap is the formal name of the interest-rate swaps that we have been using in this chapter. It is basically a swap structure calculated over an initial and final (nominal) exchange of a principal equal to 100. This way, there will be no additional cash payments at the time of initiation.  

An accrual swap is an interest-rate swap in which one party pays a standard floating reference rate, such as LIBOR, and receives LIBOR plus a spread. But the interest payments to the. counterparty will accrue only for days on which LIBOR stays within preset upper and lower. boundaries.  

An extendible swap is a swap in which one party has the right to extend a swap beyond its original term.  

A power LIBOR swap is a swap that pays LIBOR squared or cubed (and so on), less a fixed amount/rate, in exchange for a floating rate.  

A LIBOR-in-arrears swap is a swap in which the interest paid on a particular date is determinec by that date's interest rate rather than the interest rate of the previous payment date.
