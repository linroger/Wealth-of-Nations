# 4.1 THE SWAP LOGIC  

Swaps are the first basic tool that we introduced in Chapter 1. It should be clear by now that swaps. are essentially the generalization of what was discussed in Chapters 1 and 3. We start this chapter by providing a general logic for swaps.  

It is important to realize that essentially all swaps can be combined under one single logic. Consider any asset. Suppose we add to this asset another contract and form a basket. But, suppose we choose this asset so that the market risk, or the volatility associated with it, is exactly zero.. Then the volatility (or the risk) of the basket is identical to the volatility (or the risk) of the original asset. Yet, the addition of this "zero"' can change other characteristics of the asset and make the whole portfolio much more liquid, practical, and useful for hedging, pricing, and administrative reasons. This is what happens when we move from original "cash" securities to swaps. We take a security and augment it with a "zero-volatility" asset. This is the swap strategy.  

# 4.1.1 THE EQUIVALENT OF ZERO IN FINANCE  

First we would like to develop the equivalent of zero in finance as was done in Chapter 1. Why?. Because, in the case of standard algebra, we can add (subtract) zero to a number and its value does not change. Similarly if we have the equivalent of a "zero"' as a security, then we could add this security to other securities and this addition would not change the original risk characteristics of the original security. But in the mean time, the cash flow characteristics, regulatory requirements,. tax exposure, and balance sheet exposure of the portfolio may change in a desirable way..  

What is a candidate for such a "zero"'? Consider the interbank money market loan as shown in. Figure 4.1. The loan principal is 100 and is paid at time $t_{1}$ . Interest and principal is received at. $t_{2}$ Hence this is a default-free loan to be made in the future. The associated interest rate is the LIBOR rate $L_{t_{1}}$ to be observed at time $t_{1}$  

We write a forward contract on this loan. According to this, 100 is borrowed at $t_{1}$ and for this the prevailing interest rate is paid at that time. What is, then, the value of this forward loan contract for all $t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]^{\ast}$

# FIGURE 4.1  

An interbank money market loan.  

It turns out that one can, in fact, calculate this value exactly at time $t_{0}$ even though the future. LIBOR rate $L_{t_{1}}$ is not known then. Consider the following argument..  

The $t_{2}$ cash flows are  

$$
+100+100L_{t_{1}}\delta
$$  

Discounting this value to time $t_{1}$ , we get  

$$
\frac{+(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta)100}{(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta)}\equiv+100
$$  

Adding this to the initial 100 that was lent, we see that the total value of the cash flows generated by the forward loan contract is exactly zero for all times $t$ during the interval $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ , no matter what the market thinks about the future level of $L_{t_{1}}$  

Denoting the value of this forward contract by $V_{t}$ , we can immediately see that  

$$
\operatorname{Volatility}(V_{t})\equiv0\quad{\mathrm{for~all~}}t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]
$$  

Hence adding this contract to any portfolio would not change the risk (volatility) characteristics of that portfolio. This is important and is a special property of such LIBOR contracts.? Thus let $V_{t}$  

'Another way of saying this is to substitute the forward rate. $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ for $L_{t_{1}}$ . As $\Delta$ amount of time passes, this forward rate would change to $F_{t_{0}}+\Delta$ . But the value of the loan would not change, because  

$$
\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)}=\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)}=-100
$$  

2For example, if the forward contract specified a forward rate $F_{t_{0}}$ at time $t_{0}$ the value of the contract would not stay the same, since starting from time $t_{0}$ as $\Delta$ amount of time passes, a forward contract that specifies a $F_{t_{0}}$ will have the value  

This is the case since, normally,  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\displaystyle\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)}\not=\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)}=-100\underbrace{\mathrm{~}}\mathrm{\backslashfrac~}\{+\backslash\mathrm{left}(1+\mathrm{L}_{-}\{t_{-}\{1\}\})}\ {\mathrm{~}}\ {\zeta_{t_{0}+\mathrm{L}\{t_{1}\}\mathrm{ght}\}100\}\qquad\mathrm{~}}\ {\displaystyle F_{t_{0}}\not=F_{t_{0}+\Delta}}\end{array}
$$  

denote the value of a security with a sequence of cash flows so that the security has a value equal to zero identically for all $t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]$  

$$
V_{1}=0
$$  

Let $S_{t}$ be the value of any other security, with  

$$
0<\mathrm{Volatility}(S_{t})\quad t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]
$$  

Suppose both assets are default-free.? Then, because the loan contract has a value identically equal to zero for all $t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]$ we can write  

$$
S_{t}+V_{t}=S_{t}
$$  

in the sense that  

$$
\mathrm{Volatility}(S_{t}+V_{t})=\mathrm{Volatility}(S_{t})
$$  

Hence the portfolio consisting of an $S_{t}$ and a $V_{t}$ asset has the identical volatility and correlation characteristics as the original asset $S_{t}.$ It is in this sense that the asset $V_{t}$ is equivalent to zero. By adding it to any portfolio, we do not change the market risk characteristics of this portfolio.  

Still, the addition of $V_{t}$ may change the original asset in important ways. In fact, with the addition of $V_{t}.$  

1. The asset may move the. $S_{t}$ off-balance sheet. Essentially, nothing is purchased for cash.  

2. Registration properties may change. Again no basic security is purchased.'   
3. Regulatory and tax treatment of the asset may change..   
4. No up-front cash will be needed to take the position. This will make the modified asset much more liquid.  

We will show these using three important applications of the swap logic: but first some advantages of the swaps. Swaps have the following important advantages among others.  

Remark 1: When you buy a US Treasury bond or a stock issued by a US company, you can only do this in the United States. But, when you work with the swap, $S_{t}+V_{t},$ you can do it anywhere, since you are not buying/selling a cash bond or a "cash"' stock. It will consist of only swapping cash.  

Remark 2: The swap operation is a natural extension of a market practitioner's daily work. When a trader buys an asset, the trader needs to fund this trade. "Funding" an asset with a LIBOR loan amounts to the same scheme as adding $V_{t}$ to the $S_{t}$ . In fact, the addition of the zero asset eliminates the initial cash payments.  

Remark 3: The new portfolio will have no default risk. In fact with a swap, no loan is extended by any party.  

Remark 4: Finally the accounting, tax, and regulatory treatment of the new basket may be much more advantageous.  

# 4.1.2 A GENERALIZATION  

We can generalize this notion of "zero." Consider Figure 4.2. This figure adds vertically $n$ such deposits, all having the same maturity but starting at different times, $t_{i},i=1,2,\ldots$ The resulting cash flows can be interpreted in two ways. First, the cash flows can be regarded as coming from a floating rate note (FRN) that is purchased at time $t_{i}$ with maturity at $t_{n}=T.$ The note pays LIBOR flat. The value of the FRN at time $t_{i}$ will be given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\operatorname{Value}_{t}[\operatorname{FRN}]=V_{t}^{1}+V_{t}^{2}+\dots+V_{t}^{n}}&{{}t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]}\ {=0}&{{}}\end{array}
$$  

where $\boldsymbol{V}_{t}^{i}$ is the time $t$ value of the period deposit starting at time $t_{1}$  

The second interpretation is that the cash flows shown in Figure 4.2 are those of a sequence of money market loans that are rolled over at periods $t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n-1}$
