# 4.2 APPLICATIONS  

In order to see how powerful such a logic can be, we apply the procedure to different types of assets as was done in Chapter 1. In this chapter, we consider an equity portfolio and add the zerovolatility asset to it. This way we obtain an equity swap. A similar approach can be applied to. currencies and we discuss cross-currency and FX swaps in Chapter 6. A commodity swap can be obtained similarly and we explain exactly how in Chapter 7..  

In Chapter 19, we do the same with a defaultable bond. The operation will lead to a credit default swap (CDS). These swaps lead to some of the most liquid and largest markets in the world.. They are all obtained from a single swap logic..  

# 4.2.1 EQUITY SWAP  

Consider a portfolio of stocks whose fair market value at time $t_{0}$ is denoted by $S_{t_{0}}$ . Let $t_{n}=T$ $t_{0}$ $<\cdots<t_{n}$ ,where $T$ is a date that defines the expiration of an equity-swap contract. For simplicity, think of $t_{n}-t_{0}$ as a 1-year period. We divide this period into equally spaced intervals of length $\delta$ with $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},...,t_{n}=T$ being the settlement dates.  

Let $\delta={\textstyle\frac{1}{4}}$ so that the $\overset{\triangledown}{t_{i}^{\mathrm{~\tiny~S~}}}$ are 3 months apart. During a 1-year interval with $n=4$ , the portfolio's. value will be changed by.  

$$
S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{0}}=[(S_{t_{1}}-S_{t_{0}})+(S_{t_{2}}-S_{t_{1}})+(S_{t_{3}}-S_{t_{2}})+(S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{3}})]
$$

A sequence of FRN purchases\Delta  

This can be rewritten as  

$$
S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{0}}=\Delta S_{t_{0}}+\Delta S_{t_{1}}+\Delta S_{t_{2}}+\Delta S_{t_{3}}
$$  

We consider buying and marking this portfolio to market in the following manner:  

1. $N=100$ is invested at time $t_{1}$   
2. At every. $t_{1}$ $i=1,2,3,4$ total dividends amounting to $d$ are collected..  

3. At the settlement dates, we collect (pay) the cash due to the appreciation (depreciation) of the portfolio value.   
4.At time $t_{n}=T$ , collect the original USD100 invested.  

This is exactly what an equity investor would do. The investor would take the initial investment (principal), buy the stocks, collect dividends, and then sell the stocks. The final capital gains or losses will be $S_{t_{n}}-S_{t_{0}}$ . In our case, this is monetized at each settlement date. The cash flows generated by this process can be shown in Figure 4.3.  

Now we follow the swap logic discussed above and add to the stock portfolio the contract $V_{t}$ which denotes the time $t$ value of the cash flows implied by a forward LIBOR deposit. Let. $g_{t_{i}}$ be the percentage decline or increase in portfolio value at each date, and let the initial investment be denoted by the notional amount. $N$  

$$
S_{t_{0}}=N
$$  

Then,  

1. The value of the stock portfolio has not changed any time between $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ , since the forward FRN has value identically equal to zero at any time $t\in[t,t_{0}]$  

2. But the initial and final $N\mathrm{s}$ cancel.  

3. The outcome is an exchange of  

$$
L_{t_{i-1}}\delta N
$$  

against  

$$
(\Delta S_{t_{i}}+d)\delta N
$$  

at each $t_{i}$  

4. Then we can express the cash flows of an equity swap as the exchange of  

$$
(L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{i})\delta N
$$  

against  

$$
\Delta S_{t_{i}}\delta N
$$  

at each $t_{i}$ .The $d_{i}$ being an unknown percentage dividend yield, the market will trade this as. a spread. The market maker will quote the "expected value of. $d_{i}$ and any incremental supply-demand imbalances as the equity-swap spread. The buyer of the equity swap will need to pay LIBOR $L_{t_{i-1}}\delta N$ plus a spread while receiving the total return on the equity index,. i.e., $(\Delta S_{t_{i}}+d)\delta N$ at each $t_{i}$  

5. The swap will involve no up-front payment. This construction proves that the market expects the portfolio $S_{t_{i}}$ to change by $L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{t_{i}}$ each period, in other words, we have.  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{E_{t}^{\overline{{P}}}[\Delta S_{t_{i}}]=L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{t_{i}}}\end{array}
$$  

This result is proved normally by using the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and the implied risk-neutral probability..  

Now we move on to interest-rate swaps.
