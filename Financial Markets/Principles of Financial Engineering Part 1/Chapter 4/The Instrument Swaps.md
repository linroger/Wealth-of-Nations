# 4.3 THE INSTRUMENT: SWAPS  

Imagine any two sequences of cash flows with different characteristics. These cash flows could be.   
generated by any process-a financial instrument, a productive activity, a natural phenomenon.   
They will also depend on different risk factors. Then one can, in principle, devise a contract where.   
these two cash flow sequences are exchanged. This contract will be called a swap. To design a.   
swap, we use the following principles:  

1. A swap is arranged as a pure exchange of cash flows and hence should not require any additional net cash payments at initiation.' In other words, the initial value of the swap contract should be zero.  

2. The contract specifies a swap spread. This variable is adjusted to make the two counterparties willing to exchange the cash flows.  

A generic exchange is shown in Figure 4.4. In this figure, the first sequence of cash flows starts at time $t_{1}$ and continues periodically at. $t_{2}$ $t_{3},..,t_{k}$ . There are $k$ floating cash flows of differing sizes denoted by  

$$
\{C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{1}}),C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{2}}),...,C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{k}})\}
$$  

These cash flows depend on a vector of market or credit risk factors denoted by $x_{t_{i}}$ . The cash flows depend also on the $s_{t_{0}}$ , a swap spread or an appropriate swap rate. By selecting the value of. $s_{t_{0}}$ , the initial value of the swap can be made zero..  

Figure $4.4\mathrm{b}$ represents another strip of cash flows:  

$$
\{B(y_{t_{0}}),B(y_{t_{1}}),B(y_{t_{2}}),...,B(y_{t_{k}})\}
$$  

which depend potentially on some other risk factors denoted by $y_{t_{i}}$  

The swap consists of exchanging the. $\{C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{i}})\}$ against $\{B(y_{t_{i}})\}$ at settlement dates $\left\{t_{i}\right\}$ . The parameter $s_{t_{0}}$ is selected at time $t_{0}$ so that the two parties are willing to go through with this. exchange without any initial cash payment. This is shown in Figure 4.4c. One will pay the $C(\cdot)^{\cdot}\mathrm{s}$ and receive the. $B(\cdot)^{\cdot}{\mathrm{s}}$ . The counterparty will be the "other side' of the deal and will do the reverse.' Clearly, if the cash flows are in the same currency, there is no need to make two different payments in each period $t_{i}$ . One party can simply pay the other the net amount. Then actual wire transfers will look more like the cash flows as shown in Figure 4.5. Of course, what one party. receives is equal to what the counterparty pays..  

Now, if two parties who are willing to exchange the two sequences of cash flows without any up-front payment, the market value of these cash flows must be the same no matter how different they are in terms of implicit risks. Otherwise one of the parties will require an up-front net payment. Yet, as time passes, a swap agreement may end up having a positive or negative net value, since the variables $x_{t_{i}}$ and $y_{t_{i}}$ will change, and this will make one cash flow more "valuable' than. the other.

Adding vertically, we get a swap.

Note that time- $t_{0}$ value is zero...

# FIGURE 4.5  

Exchange of net amounts in an interest-rate swap.  

# EXAMPLE  

Suppose you signed a swap contract that entitles you to a $7\%$ return in dollars, in return for. a $6\%$ return in euros. The exchanges will be made every 3 months at a predetermined exchange rate $e_{t_{0}}$ . At initiation time. $t_{0}$ , the net value of the commitment should be zero,. given the correct swap spread. This means that at time. $t_{0}$ , the market value of the receipts.  

and payments are the same. Yet, after the contract is initiated, USD interest rates may fall relative to European rates. This would make the receipt of $7\%$ USD funds relatively more valuable than the payments in euro.  

As a result, from the point of view of the USD-receiving party, the value of the swap will. move from zero to positive, while for the counterparty, the swap will have a negative value.  

Of course, actual exchanges of cash flows at times $t_{1}$ $,t_{2},...,t_{n}$ may be a more complicated process than the simple transactions as shown in Figure 4.5. What exactly is paid or received? Based on which price? Observed when? What are the penalties if deliveries are not made on time? What happens if a $t_{i}$ falls on a holiday? A typical swap contract needs to clarify many such parameters. These and other issues are specified in the documentation set by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).
