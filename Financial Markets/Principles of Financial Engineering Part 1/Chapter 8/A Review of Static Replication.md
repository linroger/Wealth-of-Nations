# 8.3 A REVIEW OF STATIC REPLICATION  

The following briefly reviews the steps taken in static replication.  

1. First, we write down the cash flows generated by the asset to be replicated. Figure 8.1 repeats. the example of replicating a deposit. The figure represents the cash flows of a $T.$ maturity Eurodeposit. The instrument involves two cash flows at two different times, $t$ and $T.$ in a given currency, US dollars (USD).   
2. Next, we decompose these cash flows in order to recreate some (liquid) assets such that a vertical addition of the new cash flows match those of the targeted asset. This is shown in the top part of Figure 8.1. A forward currency contract written against a currency $X$ a foreign deposit in currency $X$ , and a spot FX operation have cash flows that duplicate the cash flows of the Eurodeposit when added vertically.

3. Finally, we have to make sure that the (credit) risks of the targeted asset and the proposed. synthetic are indeed the same. The constituents of the synthetic asset form what we call the replicating portfolio.  

We have seen several examples for creating such synthetic assets. It is useful to summarize twc important characteristics of these synthetics.  

First of all, a synthetic is created at time $t$ by taking positions on three other instruments. But, and this is the point that we would like to emphasize, once these positions are taken we never again have to modify or readjust the quantity of the instruments purchased or sold until the expiration of the targeted instrument. This is in spite of the fact that market risks would certainly change. during the interval $(t,T)$ . The decision concerning the weights of the replicating portfolio is made. at time $t.$ , and it is kept until time $T.$ As a result, the synthetic does not require further cash injections or cash withdrawals, and it matches all the cash flows generated by the original instrument..  

Second, the goal is to match the expiration cash flows of the target instrument. Because the replication does not require any cash injections or withdrawals during the interval $[t,T]$ , the time $t$ value of the target instrument will then match the value of the synthetic.  

# 8.3.1 THE FRAMEWORK  

Let us show how nonexistence or illiquidity of markets and the convexity of some instruments change the methodology of static synthetic asset creation. We first need to illustrate the difficulties of using static methods under these circumstances. Second, we need to motivate dynamic synthetic. asset creation.  

The treatment will naturally be more technical than the simple approach adopted prior to this. chapter. It is clear that as soon as we move into the realm of portfolio rebalancing and dynamic replication, we will need a more analytical underlying framework. In particular, we need to be more careful about the timing of adjustments, and especially how they can be made without any. cash injections or withdrawals.  

We adopt a simple environment of dynamic synthetic asset creation using a basic example--we use discount bonds and assume that risk-free borrowing and lending is the only other asset that exists. We assume that there are no markets in FX, interest rate forwards, and Eurodeposit accounts beyond the very short maturity. We will try to create synthetics for discount bonds in this simple environment. Later in the chapter, we move into equity instruments and options and show how the same techniques can be implemented there.  

We consider a sequence of intervals of length $\delta$  

$$
t_{0}<\dots<t_{i}<\dots<T
$$  

with  

$$
t_{i+1}-t_{i}=\delta
$$  

Suppose the market practitioner faces only two liquid markets. The first is the market for oneperiod lending/borrowing, denoted by the symbol $B_{t}$ ' The $B_{t}$ is the time $t$ value of $\$1$ invested at time $t_{0}$ Growing at the annual floating interest rate $L_{t_{i}}$ with tenor $\delta$ , the value of. $B_{t}$ at time $t_{n}$ can be expressed as  

$$
B_{t_{n}}=\left(1+L_{t_{0}}\delta\right)\left(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta\right)\cdots\left(1+L_{t_{n-1}}\delta\right)
$$  

The second liquid market is for a default-free pure discount bond whose time $t$ price is denoted by $B(t,T)$ . The bond pays 100 at time $T$ and sells for the price. $B(t,T)$ at time $t.$ The practitioner can use only these two liquid instruments, $\{B_{t},B(t,T)\}$ , to construct synthetics. No other liquid instrument is available for this purpose.  

It is clear that these are not very realistic assumptions except maybe for some emerging markets where there is a liquid overnight borrowing-lending facility and one other liquid, on-the-run discount bond. In mature markets, not only is there a whole set of maturities for borrowing and lending and for the discount bond, but rich interest rate and FX derivative markets also exist. These facilitate the construction of complex synthetics as seen in earlier chapters. However, for discussing dynamic synthetic asset creation, the simple framework selected here will be very useful. Once the methodology is understood, it will be straightforward to add new markets and instruments to the picture.  

# 8.3.2 SYNTHETICS WITH A MISSING ASSET  

Consider a practitioner operating in the environment just described. Suppose this practitioner would like to buy, at time $t_{0}$ , a two-period default-free pure discount bond denoted by. $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ with maturity date $T_{2}=t_{2}$ . It turns out that the only bond that is liquid is a three-period bond with price. $B(t_{0},$ $T_{3,}$ and maturity $T_{3}=t_{3}$ . The $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ either does not exist or is illiquid. Its current fair price is. unknown. So the market practitioner decides to create the. $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ synthetically.  

One immediate consideration is that a static replication would not work in this setting. To see this, consider Figures 8.2 and 8.3. Figure 8.2 shows the cash flow diagrams for $B_{t}$ the one-period borrowing/lending, combined with the cash flows of a two-period bond. Figure 8.3 shows the cash flows of the three-period bond. The top portion of Figure 8.2 shows that $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ is paid at time $t_{0}$

to buy the bond that yields 100 at maturity. $T_{2}$ . These simple cash flows cannot, unfortunately, be. reconstructed using one-period borrowing/lending. $B_{t}$ only, as can be seen in the second part of. Figure 8.2. The two-period bond consists of two known cash flows at times $t_{0}$ and $T_{2}$ . It is impossible to duplicate, at time. $t_{0}$ the cash flow of 100 at $T_{2}$ using $B_{t}$ without making any cash injections and withdrawals, as the next section will show..  

# 8.3.2.1 A synthetic that uses $\mathtt{B_{t}}$ only  

Suppose we adopt a rollover strategy: (i) lend money at time $t_{0}$ for one period, at the known rate $L_{t_{0}}$ , (ii) collect the proceeds from this at $t_{1}$ , and (ii) lend it again at time $t_{1}$ at a rate $L_{t_{1}}$ , so as to. achieve a net cash inflow of 100 at time $t_{2}$ . There are two problems with this approach. First, the rate $L_{t_{1}}$ is not known at time $t_{0}$ , and hence we cannot decide, at $t_{0}$ , how much to lend in order to duplicate the time. $t_{2}$ cash flow. The amount  

$$
\frac{100}{\left(1+L_{t_{0}}\delta\right)\left(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta\right)}
$$  

that needs to be invested to recover the USD100 needed at time $t_{2}$ is not known. This is in spite of the fact that $L_{t_{0}}$ is known.  

Of course, we could guess how much to invest and then make any necessary additional cash injections into the portfolio when time. $t_{1}$ comes. We can invest $B_{t_{0}}$ at $t_{0}$ and then once $L_{t_{1}}$ is observed at $t_{1}$ , we add or subtract an amount. $\Delta B$ of cash to make sure that  

$$
\left[B_{t_{0}}\left(1+L_{t_{0}}\delta\right)+\Delta B\right]\left(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta\right)=100
$$  

But, and this is the second problem, this strategy requires injections or withdrawals $\Delta B$ of an unknown amount at $t_{1}$ . This makes our strategy useless for hedging, as the portfolio is not selffinancing and the need for additional funds is not eliminated.  

Pricing will be imperfect with this method. Potential injections or withdrawals of cash imply that the true cost of the synthetic at time $t_{0}$ is not known.? Hence, the one-period borrowing/lending cannot be used by itself to obtain a static synthetic for $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ . As of time $t_{0}$ , the creation of the  

synthetic is not complete, and we need to make an additional decision at date $t_{1}$ to make sure that the underlying cash flows match those of the targeted instrument.  

# 8.3.2.2 Synthetics that use $\mathsf{B_{t}}$ and B(t, T3)  

Bringing in the liquid longer-term bond. $B(t,T_{3})$ will not help in the creation of a static synthetic. either. Figure 8.4 shows that no matter what we do at time $t_{0}$ , the three-period bond will have an extra and nonrandom cash flow of $\$100$ at maturity date $T_{3}$ . This cash flow, being "extra"' (an exact duplication of the cash flows generated by. $B(t,T_{2})$ as of time $t_{0}$ ), is not realized.  

Up to this point, we did not mention the use of interest rate forward contracts. It is clear that a straightforward synthetic for $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ could be created if a market for forward loans or forward rate agreements (FRAs) existed along with the "long' bond $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ . In our particular case, a $2\times3$

# FIGURE 8.4  

Replicating two-period loan with FRA and three-period bond.  

FRA would be convenient as shown in Figure 8.4. The synthetic consists of buying $\left(1+f_{t_{0}}\delta\right)$ units of the $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ and, at the same time, taking out a one-period forward loan at the forward rate $f_{t_{0}}$ This way, we would successfully recreate the two-period bond in a static setting. But this approach assumes that the forward markets exist and that they are liquid. If these markets do not exist, dynamic replication is our only recourse.
