# 8.5 PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMIC REPLICATION  

We now go back to the issue of creating a satisfactory synthetic for a "short' bond $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ using the savings account $B_{t}$ and a "long" bond $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ . The best strategy for constructing a synthetic for $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ consists of a "clever" position taken in $B_{t}$ and $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ such that, at time $t_{1}$ , the extra cash generated by $B_{t}$ adjustment is sufficient for adjusting $B(t_{0},T_{3})$  

In other words, we give up static replication, and we decide to adjust the time $t_{0}$ positions at time $t_{1}$ , in order to match the time $T_{2}$ cash payoff of the two-period bond. However, we adjust the positions in a way that no net cash injections or withdrawals take place. Whatever cash is needed at time $t_{1}$ for the adjustment of one instrument will be provided by the adjustment of the other. instrument. If this is done while at the same time it is ensured that the time $T_{2}$ value of this adjusted portfolio is 100, replication will be complete. It will not be static; it will require adjustments, but, importantly, we would know, at time $t_{0}$ how much cash to put down in order to receive $\$100$ at $T_{2}$  

Such a strategy works because both. $B_{t_{1}}$ and $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ depend on the same $L_{t_{1}}$ , the interest rate that is unknown at time. $t_{0}$ and both have known valuation formulas. By cleverly taking offset-. ting positions in the two assets, we may be able to eliminate the effects of the unknown $L_{t_{1}}$ as of time $t_{0}$  

The strategy will combine imperfect instruments that are correlated with each other to get a synthetic at time $t_{0}$ . However, this synthetic will need constant rebalancing due to the dependence of the portfolio weights on random variables unknown as of time $t_{0}$ .Yet, if these random variables were correlated in a certain fashion, these correlations can be used against each other to eliminate the need for cash injections or withdrawals. The cost of forming the portfolio at $t_{0}$ would then equal the arbitrage-free value of the original asset.  

What are the general principles of dynamic replication according to the discussion thus far?  

1. We need to make sure that during the life of the security there are no dividends or other payouts. The replicating portfolio must match the final cash flows exactly..   
2. During the replication process, there should be no net cash injections or withdrawals. The cash. deposited at the initial period should equal the true cost of the strategy..   
3. The credit risks of the proposed synthetic and the target instrument should be the same..  

As long as these principles are satisfied, any replicating portfolio whose weights change during $[t,T]$ can be used as a synthetic of the original asset. In the rest of the chapter, we apply these principles to a particular setting and learn the mechanics of dynamic replication.  

# 8.5.1  DYNAMIC REPLICATION OF OPTIONS  

For replicating options, we use the same logic as in the case of the two-period bond discussed in. the previous section. We will explore options in the next chapter. However, for completeness we repeat a brief definition. A European call option entitles the holder to buy an underlying asset, $S_{t}$ at a strike price $K_{:}$ at an expiration date $T.$ Thus, at time $T,t<T_{:}$ the call option payoff is given by the broken line shown in Figure 8.5. If price at time $T$ is lower than $K$ , there is no payoff. If $S_{T}$ exceeds $K.$ the option is worth $(S_{T}-K)$ . The value of the option before expiration involves an additional component called the time value and is given by the curve shown in Figure 8.5.  

Let the underlying asset be a stock whose price is $S_{t}$ .Then, when the stock price rises, the option price also rises, everything else being the same. Hence the stock is highly correlated with the option.  

This means that we can form at time $t_{0}$ a porfolio using $B_{t_{0}}$ and $S_{t_{0}}$ such that as time passes, the gains from adjusting one asset compensate the losses from adjusting the other. Constant rebalancing can be done without cash injections and withdrawals, and the final value of the portfolio would equal the expiration value of the option. If this can be done with reasonably close approximation,

# FIGURE 8.5  

the cost of forming the portfolio would equal the arbitrage-free value of the option. We will discuss this case in full detail later in this chapter, and will see an example when interest rates are assumed to be constant.  

# 8.5.2 DYNAMIC REPLICATION IN DISCRETE TIME  

In practice, dynamic replication cannot be implemented in continuous time. We do need some time to adjust the portfolio weights, and this implies that dynamic strategies need to be analyzed in discrete time. We prefer to start with bonds again, and then move to options. Suppose we want to replicate the two-period default-free discount bond $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ $T_{2}=t_{2}$ , using $B_{t}$ ${\mathbf\Lambda}_{t},B(t_{0},T_{3})$ with $T_{2}<T_{3}$ similar to the special case discussed earlier. How do we go about doing this in practice?.  

# 8.5.2.1 The method  

The replication period is $[t_{0},T_{2}]$ , and rebalancing is done in discrete intervals during this period First, we select an interval of length $\Delta$ , and divide the period $[t_{0},T_{2}]$ into $n$ such finite intervals:  

$$
n\Delta=T_{2}-t_{0}
$$  

At each $t_{i}=t_{i-1}+\Delta$ , we select new portfolio weights $\theta_{t_{i}}$ such that  

1. At $T_{2}$ , the dynamically created synthetic has exactly the same value as the $T_{2}$ -maturity bond. 2. At each step, the adjustment of the replicating portfolio requires no net cash injections or withdrawals.  

To implement such a replication strategy, we need to deviate from static replication methods. and make some new assumptions. In particular, we just saw that correlations between the underly-. ing assets play a crucial role in dynamic replication. Hence, we need a model for the way $B_{t}$ $B(t,T_{2})$ and $B(t,T_{3})$ move jointly over time.  

This is a delicate process, and there are at least three approaches that can be used to model these dynamics: (i) binomial-tree or trinomial-tree methods; (ii) partial differential equation (PDE) methods, which are similar to trinomial-tree models but are more general; and (iii) direct modeling of the risk factors using stochastic differential equations and Monte Carlo simulation. In this section, we select the simplest binomial tree methods to illustrate important aspects of creating synthetic assets dynamically.  

# 8.5.3 BINOMIAL TREES  

We simplify the notation significantly. We let. $j=0$ , 1, 2, ... denote the "time period' for the bino-. mial tree. We choose $\Delta$ so that $n=3$ . The tree will consist of three periods,. $j=0$ , 1, and 2. At each node there are two possible states only. This implies that at $j=1$ there will be two possible states, and at $j=2$ there will be four altogether.3  

In fact, by adjusting $\Delta$ and selecting the number of possible states at each node as two, three,. or more, we obtain more and more complicated trees. With two possible states at every node, the tree is called binomial; with three possible states, the tree is called trinomial. The implied binomial.

# FIGURE 8.6  

A binomial tree.  

tree is in Figure 8.6. Here, possible states at every node are denoted, as usual, by up or down. These terms do not mean that a variable necessarily goes up or down. They are just shortcut names used to represent what traders may regard as "bullish' and "bearish' movements.  

# 8.5.4 THE REPLICATION PROCESS  

In this section, we let $\Delta=1$ , for notational convenience. Consider the two binomial trees shown in Figure 8.7 that give the joint dynamics of $B_{t}$ and $B(t,T)$ over time. The top portion of the figure represents a binomial tree that describes an investment of $\$1$ at $j=0$ . This investment, called the savings account, is rolled over at the going spot interest rate. The bottom part of the figure describes the price of the "long bond" over time. The initial point $j=0$ is equivalent to $t_{0}$ and $j=3$ is equivalent to $t_{3}$ when the long bond $B(t_{0},T_{3})$ matures. The tree is nonrecombining, implying that a fall in interest rates following an increase would not give the same value as an increase that follows a drop. Thus, the path along which we get to a time node is important.4 We now consider the dynamics implied by these binomial trees.  

# 8.5.4.1 The $B_{t},\mathsf{B}(\mathtt{t},\mathsf{T}_{3})$ dynamics  

First consider a tree for $B_{t},$ the savings account or risk-free borrowing and lending. The practitioner starts at time $t_{0}$ with one dollar. The observed interest rate at $j=0$ is $10\%$ , and the dollar invested initially yields 1.10 regardless of which state of the world is realized at time. $j=1$ . There are two possibilities at $j=1$ . The up state is an environment where interest rates have fallen and bond prices, in general, have increased. Figure 8.7 shows a new spot rate of. $8\%$ for the $u p$ state in period $j=1$ . For the down state, it displays a spot rate that has increased to $15\%$  

Thus, looking at the tree from the initial point $t_{0}$ we can see four possible paths for the spot rate until maturity time $t_{2}$ of the bond under consideration. Starting from the top, the spot interest rate paths are  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\{10\%,8\%,6\%\}}\ &{\{10\%,8\%,9\%\}}\ &{\{10\%,15\%,12\%\}}\ &{\{10\%,15\%,18\%\}}\end{array}
$$  

These imply four possible paths for the value of the savings account $B_{t}$  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\{1,1.10,1.188,1.26\}}\ &{\{1,1.10,1.188,1.29\}}\ &{\{1,1.10,1.26,1.42\}}\ &{\{1,1.10,1.26,1.49\}}\end{array}
$$  

t is clear that as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, and $n$ gets larger, the number of possible paths will increase.  

The tree for the "long" bond is shown in the bottom part of Figure 8.7. Here the value of the bond is $\$100$ at $j=3$ , since the bond matures at that point. Because there is no default risk, the maturity value of the bond is the same in any state of the world. This means that one period before maturity the bond will mimic a one-period risk-free investment. In fact, no matter which one of the next two states occurs, in going from a node at time $j=2$ to a relevant node at time $j=3$ ,we always invest a constant amount and receive 100. For example, at point $A$ , we pay  

$$
B(2,3)^{\mathrm{down}}=91.7
$$  

for the bond and receive 100, regardless of the spot rate move. This will change, however, as we move toward the origin. For example, at point $B$ , we have either a "good' return:  

$$
R^{\mathrm{{up}}}=\frac{94.3}{85.0}
$$  

or a "bad' return:  

$$
R^{\mathrm{{down}}}=\frac{91.7}{85.0}
$$  

Hence, Figure 8.7 shows the dynamics of two different default-free fixed-income instruments: the savings account $B_{t}$ , which can also be interpreted as a shorter maturity bond, and a three-period long bond $B(t,T_{3})$ . The question is how to combine these two instruments so as to form a synthetic medium-term bond $B(t,T_{2})$  

![](images/e920063333cbc3b2993b2b1c59ebf896f62f6f1a8498d923d277b978c8d74a47.jpg)  

# FIGURE 8.7  

Binomial tree with lending/borrowing and three-period bond dynamics.  

# 8.5.4.2 Mechanics of replication  

We will now discuss the mechanics of replication. Consider Figure 8.8, which represents a binomial tree for the price of a two-period bond,. $B(t,T_{2})$ . This tree is assumed to describe exactly the same states of the world as the ones shown in Figure 8.7. The periods beyond $j=2$ are not displayed, given that. $B(t,T_{2})$ matures then. According to this tree, we know the value of the two-period bond only at $j=2$ This value is 100, since the bond matures. Earlier values of the bond are not known and hence are left blank. The most important unknown is, of course, the time $j=0$ value $B(t_{0},T_{2})$ . This is the "current" price of the two-period bond. The problem we deal with in this section is how to "fill in' this tree.  

The idea is to use the information given in Figure 8.7 to form a portfolio with (time-varying) weights $\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{bond}}$ for $B_{t}$ and $B(t,T_{3})$ . The portfolio should mimic the value of the medium-. term bond $B(t,T_{2})$ at all nodes at $j=0$ , 1, 2. The first condition on this portfolio is that, at. $T_{2}$ , its value must equal 100.  

The second important condition to be satisfied by the portfolio weights is that the. $j=0$ 1 adjustments do not require any cash injections or withdrawals. This means that, as the portfolio weights are adjusted or rebalanced, any cash needed for increasing the weight of one asset should come from adjustment of the other asset. This way, cash flows will consist of a payment at time. $t_{0}$ and a receipt of $\$100$ at time $T_{2}$ with no interim net payments or receipts in between-which is exactly the cash flows of a two-period discount bond.  

Then, by arbitrage arguments the value of this portfolio should track the value of the $B(t,T_{2})$ at all relevant times. This means that the $\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{{bond}}}$ will also satisf y  

$$
\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{t}+\theta_{t}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(t,T_{3})=B(t,T_{2})
$$  

for all $t$ or $j.$  

![](images/aef223549e64827aef1b919295009092290ab290ad13f606237a6c6f08a944b8.jpg)  

# FIGURE 8.8  

Binomial tree for two-period bond.  

# 8.5.4.3 Guaranteeing self-financing  

How can we guarantee that the adjustments of the weights $\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{bond}}$ , observed along the tree paths $j=0,1,2$ will not lead to any cash injections or withdrawals? The following additional conditions at $j=0,1$ , will be sufficient to do this:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{j+1}^{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{up}}}+\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(j+1,3)^{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{up}}}=\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{j+1}^{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{up}}}+\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(j+1,3)^{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{up}}}}}\ {{\mathrm{}}}\ {{j_{j}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{j+1}^{\mathrm{down}}+\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(j+1,3)^{\mathrm{down}}=\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{j+1}^{\mathrm{down}}+\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(j+1,3)^{\mathrm{down}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Let us see what these conditions mean. On the left-hand side, the portfolio weights have the subscript $j$ while the asset prices are measured as of time $j+1$ . This means that the left-hand side is the value of a portfolio chosen at time $j$ and valued at a new up or down state at time $j+1$ The left-hand side is, thus, a function of "new" asset prices, but "old' portfolio weights..  

On the right-hand side of these equations, we have \*"new" portfolio weights, $\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{bond}}$ multiplied by the time $j+1$ prices. Thus, the right-hand side represents the cost of a new portfolio chosen at time $j+1$ , either in the up or down state. Putting these two together, the equations imply that, regardless of which state occurs, the previously chosen portfolio generates just enough cash to put together a new replicating portfolio.  

$\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{bond}}$ are chosen so as to satisfy Eqs. (8.36) and (8.3). there wil be no need to inject or withdraw any cash during portfolio rebalancing. The replicating portfolio will be selffinancing. This is what we mean by dynamic replication. By following these steps, we can form a portfolio at time $j=0$ and rebalance at zero cost until the final cash flow of $\$100$ is reached at time. $j=2$ . Given that there is no credit risk, and all the final cash flows are equal, the initial cost of the replicating portfolio must equal the value of the two-period bond at $j=0$  

$$
\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}B_{0}+\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{bond}}B(0,3)=B(0,2)
$$  

Ience, dynamic replication would create a true synthetic for the two-period bond.  

Finally, consider rewriting Eq. (8.37) after a slight manipulation:  

$$
(\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{lend}}-\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{lend}})B_{j+1}^{\mathrm{down}}=-(\theta_{j}^{\mathrm{bond}}-\theta_{j+1}^{\mathrm{bond}})B(j+1,3)^{\mathrm{down}}
$$  

This shows that the cash obtained from adjusting one weight will be just sufficient for the cash needed for the adjustment of the second weight. Hence, there will be no need for extra cash injections or withdrawals. Note that this "works' even though $B_{j+1}^{i}$ and $B(j+1,3)^{i}$ are random. The trees in Figure 8.7 implicitly assume that these random variables are perfectly correlated with each other.  

# 8.5.5 TWO EXAMPLES  

We apply these ideas to two examples. In the first, we determine the current value of the twoperiod default-free pure discount bond using the dynamically adjusted replicating portfolio from Figure 8.7. The second example deals with replication of options.  

# 8.5.5.1 Replicating the bond  

The top part of Figure 8.7 shows the behavior of savings account. $B_{t}$ The bottom part displays a tree. for the two-period discount bond. $B(t,T_{3})$ . Both of these trees are considered as given exogenously,. and their arbitrage-free characteristic is not questioned at this point. The objective is to fill in the future and current values in Figure 8.8 and price the two-period bond $B(t,T_{2})$ under these circumstances.  

# EXAMPLE  

To determine $\{B(j,2),j=0,1,2\}$ , we need to begin with period $j=2$ in Figure 8.8. This is. the maturity date for the two-period bond, and there is no default possibility by assumption. Thus, the possible values of the two-period bond at $j=2$ , denoted by. $B(2,2)^{i}$ , can immediately be determined:.  

$$
B(2,2)^{\mathrm{up-up}}=B(2,2)^{\mathrm{down-up}}=B(2,2)^{\mathrm{up-down}}=B(2,2)^{\mathrm{down-down}}=100\
$$  

Once these are placed at the. $j=2$ nodes in Figure 8.8, we take one step back and obtain the values of $\{B(1,2)^{i}$ $i=\mathrm{up}$ , down}. Here, the principles that we developed earlier will be used. As "time" goes from $j=1$ to $j=2$ , the value of the portfolio put together at. $j=1$ using $B_{1}$ and $B(1,3)^{i}$ should match the possible values of.. $B(2,2)$ at all nodes. Consider first the. top node, $B(1,2)^{\mathrm{up}}$ . The following equations need to be satisfied:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}B_{2}^{\mathrm{up-up}}+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}B(2,3)^{\mathrm{up-up}}=B(2,2)^{\mathrm{up-up}}}}\ {{{}}}\ {{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}B_{2}^{\mathrm{up-down}}+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}B(2,3)^{\mathrm{up-down}}=s B(2,2)^{\mathrm{up-down}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Here, $\theta\mathrm{s}$ have $j=1$ subscript, hence the left-hand side is the value of the replicating portfolio put together at time $j=1$ , but valued as of $j=2$ . In these equations, all variables are known except portfolio weights $\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}$ and $\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{{bond,up}}}$ . Replacing from Figure 8.7  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}1.188+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}94.3=100}\ &{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}1.188+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}91.7=100}\end{array}
$$  

Solving these two equations for the two unknowns, we get the replicating portfolio weights for $j=1$ $i=\mathrm{up}$ . These are in units of securities, not in dollars..  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}=84.18}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}=0}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, if the market moves to $i=\mathrm{up}$ , 84.18 units of $B_{1}$ will be sufficient to replicate the future values of the bond at time $j=2$ . In fact, this position will have the $j=2$ value of  

$$
84.18(1.188)=100
$$  

Note that the weight for the long bond is zero. The cost of the portfolio at time $j=1$ can be obtained using the just calculated $\{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}},\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}\}$ ; this cost should equal $B(1,2)^{\mathrm{up}}$  

$$
\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}(1.1)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,up}}(85.0)=92.6
$$  

Similarly, for the state. $j=1$ $i=\mathrm{down}$ , we have the two equations:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}1.265+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,down}}89.3=100}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}1.265+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,down}}84.7=100}\end{array}
$$  

Solving, we get the relevant portfolio weights:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}=79.05}}\ {{{}}}\ {{\theta_{2}^{\mathrm{bond,down}}=0}}\end{array}
$$  

We obtain the cost of the portfolio for this state:  

$$
\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}(1.1)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{bond,down}}(75)=86.9
$$  

This should equal the value of. $B(1,2)^{\mathrm{down}}$ . Finally, we move to the initial period to deter-. mine the value $B(0,2)$ . The idea is again the same. At time $j=0$ choose the portfolio weights $\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}$ and $\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{bond}}$ such that, as time passes, the value of the portfolio equals the possible future values of $B(1,2)$ ..  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}1.1+\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{bond}}85.00=92.6}\ {\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}1.1+\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{bond}}75.00=86.9}\end{array}
$$  

Here, the left-hand side is the value of the portfolio put together at time $j=0$ such that its value equals those of the two-period bond at $j=1$ . Solving for the unknowns,  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}=40.1}}\ {{}}\ {{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{bond}}=0.57}}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, at time. $j=0$ we need to make a deposit of 40.1 dollars and buy 0.57 units of the three-period bond with price $B(0,3)$ . This will replicate the two possible values $\{B(1,2)^{i}$ $i=\mathrm{up},\mathrm{down}\}$ . The cost of this portfolio must equal the current fair value of $B(0,2)$ , if the. trees for $B_{t}$ and $B(j,3)$ are arbitrage-free. This cost is given by  

$$
B(0,2)=40.1+0.57(72)=81.14
$$  

This is the fair value of the two-period bond at $j=0$  

The arbitrage-free market value of the two-period bond is obtained by calculating all the current and future weights for a dynamic self-financing portfolio that duplicates the final cash flows of a two-period bond. At every step, the portfolio weights are adjusted so that the rebalanced portfolio keeps matching the values of $B(j,2),j=0,1,2.$ The fact that there were only two possible moves from every node gave a system of two equations, in two unknowns.  

Note the (important) analogy to static replication strategies. By following this dynamic strategy and adjusting the portfolio weights, we guarantee to match the final cash flows generated by the two-period bond, while never really making any cash injections or withdrawals. Each time a future node is reached, the previously determined portfolio will always yield just enough cash to do necessary adjustments.'  

# 8.5.6 APPLICATION TO OPTIONS  

We can apply the replication technique to options and create appropriate synthetics. Thus, consider the same risk-free lending and borrowing $B_{t}$ dynamics shown in Figure 8.7. This time, we would like to replicate a call option $C_{t}$ written on a stock $S_{t}$ The call has the following plain vanilla properties. It expires at time $t_{2}$ and has a strike price $K=100$ . The option is European and cannot be exercised before the expiration date. The underlying stock $S_{t}$ does not pay any dividends. Finally, there are no transaction costs such as commissions and fees in trading. $S_{t}$ or $C_{t}$  

Suppose the stock price $S_{t}$ follows the tree shown in Figure 8.9. Note that unlike a bond, the stock never "matures"' and future values of $S_{t}$ are always random. There is no terminal time period where we know the future value of $S_{t}.$ as was the case for the bond that expired at time $T_{3}$  

![](images/5849e132ddc44f3edcc427a1da7ae3d853812a0c08f23f790c0f505e213d6bf8.jpg)  

# FIGURE 8.9  

Binomial tree for stock price.  

However, the corresponding binomial tree for the call option still has known values at expiration date $j=2$ . This is the case since, at expiration, we know the possible values that the option may. assume due to the formula:.  

$$
C_{2}=\operatorname*{max}[S_{2}-100,0]
$$  

Given the values of $S_{2}$ , we can determine the possible values of $C_{2}$ . But, the values of the call at earlier time periods still need to be determined.  

How can this be done? The logic is essentially the same as the one utilized in the case of a twoperiod default-free bond. We need to determine the current value of the call option, denoted by $C_{0}$ using a dynamically adjusted portfolio that consists of the savings account and of the stock. $S_{t}.$  

# EXAMPLE  

Start with the expiration period and use the boundary condition:  

$$
C_{2}^{i}=\operatorname*{max}[S_{2}^{i}-100,0]
$$  

where the $i$ superscript represents gain in the states of the world {up-up, up-down, down-up, down--down}. Using these, we determine the four possible values of $C_{2}^{i}$ at expiration:  

$$
C_{2}^{\mathfrak{u p}-\mathfrak{u p}}=60,C_{2}^{\mathfrak{u p}-\mathrm{down}}=42,C_{2}^{\mathrm{down}-\mathfrak{u p}}=0,C_{2}^{\mathrm{down}-\mathrm{down}}=0
$$  

Next, we take one step back and consider the value. $C_{1}^{\mathrm{up}}$ . We need to replicate this with a. portfolio using $B_{1},S_{1}$ , such that as "time" passes, the value of this portfolio stays identical to the value of the option. $C_{2}^{i}$ . Thus, we need  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}B_{2}^{\mathrm{up-up}}+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}S_{2}^{\mathrm{up-up}}=C_{2}^{\mathrm{up-up}}}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}B_{2}^{\mathrm{up-down}}+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}S_{2}^{\mathrm{up-down}}=C_{2}^{\mathrm{up-down}}}\end{array}
$$  

Replacing the known values from Figures 8.7 and 8.9, we have two equations and two unknowns:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}(1.188)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}(160)=60}\ &{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}(1.188)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}(142)=42}\end{array}
$$  

Solving for the portfolio weights $\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}$ and $\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}$ we get  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,up}}=-84.18}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,up}}=1}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, at time. $j=1,i=\mathrm{up}$ , we need to sell 84.18 units of. $B_{t}$ and buy one stock. The. behavior of this portfolio in the immediate future will be equal to the future values of $\{C_{2}^{i}\}$ where $i$ denotes the four possible states at $j=2$ . The cost of this portfolio is. $C_{1}^{\mathrm{up}}$ -..  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{C_{1}^{\mathrm{up}}=-84.18(1.1)+140}}\ {{}}\ {{=47.40}}\end{array}
$$  

Similarly, in order to determine $C_{1}^{\mathrm{down}}$ , we first form a replicating portfolio by solving the equations  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}(1.26)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,down}}(100)=0}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}(1.26)+\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,down}}(84)=0}\end{array}
$$  

which gives  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{lend,down}}=0}\ {{}}\ {\theta_{1}^{\mathrm{stock,down}}=0}\end{array}
$$  

The cost of this portfolio is zero and hence the option is worthless if we are at $j=1$ $i=\mathrm{down}$  

$$
C_{1}^{\mathrm{down}}=0
$$  

Finally, the fair value $C_{0}$ of the option can be determined by finding the initial portfolio weights from  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}(1.1)+\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{stock}}(140)=47.40}}\ {{{}}}\ {{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}(1.1)+\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{stock}}(80)=0}}\end{array}
$$  

We obtain  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{lend}}=-57.5}}\ {{{}}}\ {{\theta_{0}^{\mathrm{stock}}=0.79}}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, we need to borrow 57.5 dollars and then buy 0.79 units of stock at $j=0$ . The cost of this will be the current value of the option:.  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{C_{0}=-57.5+0.79(100)}\ {=21.3}\end{array}
$$  

This will be the fair value of the option if the exogenously given trees are arbitrage-free.  

Note again the important characteristics of this dynamic strategy.  

1. To determine the current value of the option, we started from the expiration date and used the boundary condition.   
2. We kept adjusting the portfolio weights so that the replicating portfolio eventually matched the final cash flows generated by the option.   
3. Finally, there were no cash injections or cash withdrawals, so that the initial amount invested in the strategy could be taken as the cost of the synthetic.
