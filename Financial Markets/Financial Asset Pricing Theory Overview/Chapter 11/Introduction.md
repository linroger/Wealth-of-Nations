# 11.1 Introduction  

Chapter 4 illustrated how the general pricing mechanism in a financial market can be represented by a state-price deflator. However, the state-price deflator is not the only way to represent the pricing mechanism of a financial market. As indicated in a one-period framework in Section 4.6.1,. one can equivalently represent the pricing mechanism by a risk-neutral probability measure and the risk-free return. This chapter explores and generalizes this idea and also outlines some applications. of this alternative representation. The risk-neutral pricing technique is the standard approach in. the valuation of derivative securities. The next chapter focuses on derivatives and will illustrate the use of risk-neutral valuation for derivative pricing..  

Apparently, the idea of risk-neutral valuation stems from Arrow (1971) and Dreze (1971) and was further explored by Harrison and Kreps (1979)..  

The rest of this chapter is organized in the following way. Section 11.2 outlines how a general. change of the probability measure is formalized. The risk-neutral probability measure is defined and studied in Section 11.3, while the so-called forward risk-adjusted probability measures are in-. troduced in Section 11.4. Section 11.5 shows that an appropriate risk-adjusted probability measure. can be defined for any given asset or trading strategy with a positive value. Section 11.6 demon-. strates that the risk-adjusted probability measure associated with the so-called growth-optimal trading strategy is identical to the real-world probability measure..
