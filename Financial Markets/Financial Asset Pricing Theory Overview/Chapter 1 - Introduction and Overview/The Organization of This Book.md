# 1.4 The organization of this book  

The remainder of this book is organized as follows. Chapter 2 discusses how to represent uncertainty and information flow in asset pricing models. It also introduces stochastic processes and some key results on how to deal with stochastic processes, which we will use in later chapters.  

Chapter 3 shows how we can model financial assets and their dividends as well as how we can represent portfolios and trading strategies. It also defines the important concepts of arbitrage, redundant assets, and market completeness.  

Chapter 4 defines the key concept of a state-price deflator both in one-period models, in discretetime multi-period models, and in continuous-time models. A state-price deflator is one way to represent the general pricing mechanism of a financial market. We can price any asset given the state-price deflator and the dividend process of that asset. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a state-price deflator are derived as well as a number of useful properties of stateprice deflators. We will also briefly discuss alternative ways of representing the general market pricing mechanism, e.g. through a set of risk-neutral probabilities.  

The state-price deflator and therefore asset prices are ultimately determined by the supply and demand of investors. Chapter 5 studies how we can represent the preferences for investors. We discuss when preferences can be represented by expected utility, how we can measure the risk aversion of an individual, and introduce some frequently used utility functions. In Chapter 6 we investigate how individual investors will make decisions on consumption and investments. We set up the utility maximization problem for the individual and characterize the solution for different relevant specifications of preferences. The solution gives an important link between state-price deflators (and, thus, the prices of financial assets) and the optimal decisions at the individual level. Chapter 7 deals with the market equilibrium. We will discuss when market equilibria are Paretoefficient and when we can think of the economy as having only one, representative individual instead of many individuals.  

Chapter 8 further explores the link between individual consumption choice and asset prices. The very general Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM) is derived. A simple version of the CCAPM is confronted with data and a number of extensions are discussed.  

Chapter 9 studies the so-called factor models of asset pricing where one or multiple factors. govern the state-price deflators and thus asset prices and returns. Some empirically successful. factor models are described. It is also shown how pricing factors can be identified theoretically as a special case of the general CCAPM.  

While Chapters 8 and 9 mostly focus on explaining the expected excess return of risky assets, most prominently stocks, Chapter 10 explores the implications of general asset pricing theory for bond prices and the term structure of interest rates. It also critically reviews some traditional hypotheses on the term structure of interest rates.  

Chapter 11 shows how the information in a state-price deflator equivalently can be represented by the price of one specific asset and an appropriately risk-adjusted probability measure. This turns out to be very useful when dealing with derivative securities, which is the topic of Chapter 12.  

Each chapter ends with a number of exercises, which either illustrate the concepts and conclusions of the chapter or provide additional related results.
