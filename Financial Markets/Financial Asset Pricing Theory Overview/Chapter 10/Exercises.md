# 10.10 Exercises  

EXERCISE 10.1 Show that if there is no arbitrage and the short rate can never go negative,.   
then the discount function is non-increasing and all forward rates are non-negative.  

EXERCISE 10.2 Show Equation (10.51).  

EXERCISE 10.3 The term premium at time $t$ for the future period $[t^{\prime},T]$ is the current forward rate for that period minus the expected spot rate, i.e. $f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}-\mathrm{E}_{t}[y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}]$ . This exercise will give a link between the term premium and a state-price deflator $\zeta=\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$  

(a) Show that  

$$
B_{t}^{T}=B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\operatorname{E}_{t}\left[B_{t^{\prime}}^{T}\right]+\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\left[\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}},\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}\right]
$$  

for any $t\leq t^{\prime}\leq T$  

(b) Using the above result, show that  

$$
\operatorname{E}_{t}\left[e^{-y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}(T-t^{\prime})}\right]-e^{-f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}(T-t^{\prime})}=-{\frac{1}{B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}}}\operatorname{Cov}_{t}\left[{\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}}},{\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}}\right].
$$  

Using the previous result and the approximation $e^{x}\approx1+x$ , show that  

$$
f_{t}^{t^{\prime},T}-\mathrm{E}_{t}[y_{t^{\prime}}^{T}]\approx-\frac{1}{(T-t^{\prime})B_{t}^{t^{\prime}}}\mathrm{Cov}_{t}\left[\frac{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}{\zeta_{t}},\frac{\zeta_{T}}{\zeta_{t^{\prime}}}\right].
$$  

EXERCISE 10.4 The purpose of this exercise is to show that the claim of the gross return pure. expectation hypothesis is inconsistent with interest rate uncertainty. In the following we consider time points $t_{0}<t_{1}<t_{2}$  

(a) Show that if the hypothesis holds, then  

$$
\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}}=\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{2}}}\operatorname{E}_{t_{0}}\left[B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\right].
$$  

Hint: Compare two investment strategies over the period $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ .The first strategy is to buy.   
at time $t_{0}$ zero-coupon bonds maturing at time. $t_{1}$ .The second strategy is to buy at time. $t_{0}$   
zero-coupon bonds maturing at time $t_{2}$ and to sell them again at time. $t_{1}$  

(b) Show that if the hypothesis holds, then  

$$
\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{2}}}=\frac{1}{B_{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}}\operatorname{E}_{t_{0}}\left[\frac{1}{B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}}\right].
$$  

(c) Show from the two previous questions that the hypothesis implies that  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{t_{0}}\left[{\frac{1}{B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}}}\right]={\frac{1}{\mathrm{E}_{t_{0}}\left[B_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\right]}}.
$$  

(d) Show that ( $^*$ ) can only hold under full certainty. Hint: Use Jensen's inequality.  

EXERCISE 10.5 Show (10.63) and (10.64).  

EXERCISE 10.6 Go through the derivations in the subsection with the heading "An example" in Section 10.6.3.  

EXERCISE 10.7 Constantinides (1992) develops the so-called SAINTS model of the nominal term structure of interest rates by specifying exogenously the nominal state-price deflator. $\ddot{\zeta}$ . In a  

slightly simplified version, his assumption is that  

$$
\tilde{\zeta}_{t}=k e^{-g t+(X_{t}-\alpha)^{2}},
$$  

where $k$ $g$ , and $\alpha$ are constants, and $X=\left(X_{t}\right)$ follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process  

$$
d X_{t}=-\kappa X_{t}d t+\sigma d z_{t},
$$  

where $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ are positive constants with $\sigma^{2}<\kappa$ and $z=\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion..  

(a) Derive the dynamics of the nominal state-price deflator. Express the nominal short-term interest rate, $\tilde{r}_{t}$ , and the nominal market price of risk, $\ddot{\lambda}_{t}$ , in terms of the variable $X_{t}$   
(b) Find the dynamics of the nominal short rate.   
(c) Find parameter constraints that ensure that the short rate stays positive? Hint: The short rate is a quadratic function of $X$ . Find the minimum value of this function.   
(d) What is the distribution of $X_{T}$ given $X_{t}$ \~.   
(e) Let $Y$ be a normally distributed random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $v^{2}$ . Show that  

$$
\operatorname{E}\left[e^{-\gamma Y^{2}}\right]=(1+2\gamma v^{2})^{-1/2}\exp\left\{-{\frac{\gamma\mu^{2}}{1+2\gamma v^{2}}}\right\}.
$$  

(f) Use the results of the two previous questions to derive the time $t$ price of a nominal zero-. coupon bond with maturity. $T$ , i.e. $\tilde{B}_{t}^{T}$ . It will be an exponential-quadratic function of $X_{t}$ What is the yield on this bond?.  

(g) Find the percentage volatility. $\sigma_{t}^{T}$ of the price of the zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$  

(h) The instantaneous expected excess rate of return on the zero-coupon bond maturing at $T$ is often called the term premium for maturity. $T$ . Explain why the term premium is given by. $\sigma_{t}^{T}\ddot{\lambda}_{t}$ and show that the term premium can be written as.  

$$
4\sigma^{2}\alpha^{2}\left(1-F(T-t)\right)\left(\frac{X_{t}}{\alpha}-1\right)\left(\frac{X_{t}}{\alpha}-\frac{1-F(T-t)e^{\kappa(T-t)}}{1-F(T-t)}\right),
$$  

where  

$$
F(\tau)=\frac{1}{\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\kappa}+\left(1-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{\kappa}\right)e^{2\kappa\tau}}.
$$  

For which values of $X_{t}$ will the term premium for maturity $T$ be positive/negative? For a given state $X_{t}$ , is it possible that the the term premium is positive for some maturities and negative for others?  

EXERCISE 10.8 Assume a continuous-time economy where the state-price deflator $\zeta=\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$ has dynamics  

$$
d\zeta_{t}=-\zeta_{t}\left[r_{t}d t+\lambda d z_{1t}\right],
$$  

where $z_{1}=\left(z_{1t}\right)$ is a (one-dimensional) standard Brownian motion, $\lambda$ is a constant, and $\boldsymbol r=(r_{t})$ follows the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process  

$$
d r_{t}=\kappa[\bar{r}-r_{t}]d t+\sigma_{r}d z_{1t}.
$$  

This is the Vasicek model so we know that the prices of zero-coupon bonds are given by (10.37) and the corresponding yields are given by (10.39).  

Suppose you want to value a real uncertain cash flow of $F_{T}$ coming at time $T$ . Let $x_{t}=\operatorname{E}_{t}[F_{T}]$ and assume that  

$$
d x_{t}=x_{t}\left[\mu_{x}d t+\sigma_{x}\rho d z_{1t}+\sigma_{x}\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}d z_{2t}\right],
$$  

where $\mu_{x}$ $\sigma_{x}$ , and $\rho$ are constants, and where. $z_{2}~=~(z_{2t})$ is another (one-dimensional) standard Brownian motion independent of $z_{1}$  

(a) Argue that $x=\left(x_{t}\right)$ must be a martingale and hence that $\mu_{x}=0$  

(b) Show that the time $t$ value of the claim to the cash flow $F_{T}$ is given by  

$$
V_{t}\equiv V(t,r_{t},x_{t})=x_{t}e^{-A(T-t)-B(T-t)r_{t}},
$$  

where $B(\tau)=b(\tau)$ and  

$$
A(\tau)=a(\tau)+\rho\lambda\sigma_{x}\tau+\frac{\rho\sigma_{x}\sigma_{r}}{\kappa}\left(\tau-b(\tau)\right).
$$  

(c) Write the dynamics of $V=\left(V_{t}\right)$ as $d V_{t}=V_{t}[\mu_{t}^{V}d t+\sigma_{1t}^{V}d z_{1t}+\sigma_{2t}^{V}d z_{2t}]$ . Use $(^{*})$ to identify $\mu_{t}^{V}$ $\sigma_{1t}^{V}$ , and $\sigma_{2t}^{V}$ . Verify that $\mu_{t}^{V}=r_{t}+\left(\pmb{\sigma}_{t}^{V}\right)^{\top}\lambda_{t}$ , where ${\pmb\sigma}^{V}=(\sigma_{1}^{V},\sigma_{2}^{V})^{\top}$ and $\lambda$ is the market price of risk vector (the market price of risk associated with $z_{2}$ is zero! Why?).  

(d) Define the risk-adjusted discount rate. $R_{t}$ for the cash flow by the relation $V_{t}=\mathrm{E}_{t}[F_{T}]e^{-R_{t}[T-t]}$ What is the difference between $R_{t}$ and $y_{t}^{T}$ ? How does this difference depend on the cash flow payment date $T$  

EXERCISE 10.9 Consider an economy with complete financial markets and a representative agent with CRRA utility, u(C) = q'-z, , where $\gamma>0$ , and a time preference rate of $\delta$ .The aggregate consumption level $C$ is assumed to follow the stochastic process  

$$
d c_{t}=c_{t}\left[\left(a_{1}X_{t}^{2}+a_{2}X_{t}+a_{3}\right)d t+\sigma_{c}d z_{t}\right],
$$  

where $z~=~\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion under the real-life probability measure $\mathbb{P}$ and where. $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\sigma_{c}$ are constants with $\sigma_{c}~>~0$ .Furthermore, $X~=~\left(X_{t}\right)$ is a stochastic process with dynamics  

$$
d X_{t}=-\kappa X_{t}d t+d z_{t}.
$$  

where $\kappa$ is a positive constant.  

(a) Show that the short-term interest rate is of the form $r_{t}=d_{1}X_{t}^{2}+d_{2}X_{t}+d_{3}$ and determine the constants $d_{1},d_{2},d_{3}$  

(b) Find a parameter condition under which the short-term interest rate is always non-negative.  

(c) Write up the dynamics of $r_{t}$ (d) What is the market price of risk in this economy?  

Suppose that the above applies to the real economy and that money has no effects on the real economy. The consumer price index $F_{t}$ is supposed to have dynamics  

$$
d F_{t}=F_{t}\left[\mu_{\varphi t}d t+\rho_{C F}\sigma_{\varphi t}d z_{t}+\sqrt{1-\rho_{C F}^{2}}\sigma_{\varphi t}d\hat{z}_{t}\right],
$$  

where $\rho_{C F}$ is a constant correlation coefficient and $\hat{z}=(\hat{z}_{t})$ is another standard Brownian motion independent of $z$ . Assume that $\mu_{\varphi t}$ and $\sigma_{\varphi t}$ are on the form  

$$
\mu_{\varphi t}=b_{1}X_{t}^{2}+b_{2}X_{t}+b_{3},\qquad\sigma_{\varphi t}=k X_{t}.
$$  

(e) Write up an expression for the nominal short-term interest rate, $\tilde{r}_{t}$  

Assume in the rest of the problem that $\gamma a_{1}+b_{1}=k^{2}$  

(f) Show that the nominal short rate $\ddot{r}_{t}$ is affine in $X_{t}$ and express $X_{t}$ as an affine function of $\tilde{r}_{t}$   
(g) Compute the nominal market price of risk $\tilde{\lambda}_{t}$   
(h) Determine the dynamics of the nominal short rate. The drift and volatility should be expressed in terms of $\ddot{r}_{t}$ , not $X_{t}$
