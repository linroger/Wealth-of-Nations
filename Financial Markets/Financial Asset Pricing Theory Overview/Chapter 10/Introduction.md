# 10.1 Introduction  

The previous two chapters focused on the implications of asset pricing models for the level of stock market excess returns and the cross-section of stock returns. This chapter focuses on the consequences of asset pricing theory for the pricing of bonds and the term structure of interest rates implied by bond prices.  

A bond is nothing but a standardized and transferable loan agreement between two parties. The issuer of the bond is borrowing money from the holder of the bond and promises to pay back the loan according to a predefined payment scheme. The presence of the bond market allows individuals to trade consumption opportunities at different points in time among each other. An individual who has a clear preference for current capital to finance investments or current consumption can borrow by issuing a bond to an individual who has a clear preference for future consumption opportunities. The price of a bond of a given maturity is, of course, set to align the demand and supply of that bond, and will consequently depend on the attractiveness of the real investment opportunities and on the individuals' preferences for consumption over the maturity of the bond. The term structure of interest rates will reflect these dependencies.  

After a short introduction to notation and bond market terminology in Section 10.2, we derive in Sections 10.3 and 10.4 relations between equilibrium interest rates and aggregate consumption and production in settings with a representative individual. In Section 10.5 we give some examples of equilibrium term structure models that are derived from the basic relations between interest rates, consumption, and production. The famous Vasicek model and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model are presented.  

Since individuals are concerned with the number of units of goods they consume and not the dollar value of these goods, the relations found in those sections apply to real interest rates. However, most traded bonds are nominal, i.e. they promise the delivery of certain dollar amounts, not the delivery of a certain number of consumption goods. The real value of a nominal bond depends on the evolution of the price of the consumption good. In Section 10.6 we explore the relations between real rates, nominal rates, and inflation. We consider both the case where money has no real effects on the economy and the case where money does affect the real economy.  

The development of arbitrage-free dynamic models of the term structure was initiated in the 1970s. Until then, the discussions among economists about the shape of the term structure were based on some relatively loose hypotheses. The most well-known of these is the expectation hypothesis, which postulates a close relation between current interest rates or bond yields and expected future interest rates or bond returns. Many economists still seem to rely on the validity of this hypothesis, and a lot of man power has been spend on testing the hypothesis empirically. In Section 10.7, we review several versions of the expectation hypothesis and discuss the consistency of these versions. We argue that neither of these versions will hold for any reasonable dynamic term structure model. Some alternative traditional hypotheses are briefly reviewed in Section 10.8.
