# 8.1 Introduction  

Previous chapters have shown how state-price deflators determine asset prices and how the optimal consumption choices of individuals determine state-price deflators. In this chapter we combine these observations and link asset prices to consumption. Models linking expected returns to the covariance between return and (aggregate) consumption are typically called Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Models (CCAPM). Such models date back to Rubinstein (1976) and Breeden (1979).  

The outline of the chapter is as follows. Section 8.2 develops the CCAPM in the one-period framework. Section 8.3 derives a general link between asset prices and consumption in a multiperiod setting, while Section 8.4 focuses on a simple and tractable specification. Section 8.5 shows that this simple specification is unable to match important empirical features of aggregate consumption and return, leaving a number of apparent asset pricing puzzles. Section 8.6 discusses some problems with such empirical studies. Some extensions of the simple model are presented in Sections 8.7 and 8.9. These extensions help resolve some of the apparent puzzles.
