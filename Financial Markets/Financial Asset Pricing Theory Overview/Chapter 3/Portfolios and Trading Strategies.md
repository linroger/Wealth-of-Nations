# 3.3 Portfolios and trading strategies  

Individuals can trade assets at all time points of the model, except for the last date. The combination of holdings of different assets at a given point in time is called a portfolio. We assume that there are no restrictions on the portfolios that investors may form and that there are no trading costS.  

# 3.3.1 The one-period framework  

In a one-period model an individual chooses a portfolio. $\pmb\theta=(\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{I})^{\top}$ at time $0$ with $\theta_{i}$ being the number of units held of asset. $i$ . It is not possible to rebalance the portfolio but the individual simply cashes in the dividends at time 1. Let. $D^{\theta}$ be the random variable that represents the. dividend of the portfolio $\pmb{\theta}$ . If state $\omega$ is realized, the total dividend from a portfolio. $\pmb{\theta}$ is  

$$
D^{\theta}(\omega)=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\theta_{i}D_{i}(\omega)=\theta\cdot D(\omega),
$$  

i.e. $D^{\theta}=\pmb\theta\cdot\pmb D$  

Denote the price or value of a portfolio $\pmb{\theta}$ by $P^{\theta}$ .We will throughout this book assume that prices are linear so that  

$$
P^{\theta}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\theta_{i}P_{i}=\theta\cdot P.
$$  

This is called the Law of One Price. Since we ignore transaction costs, any candidate for an. equilibrium pricing system will certainly have this property. In Section 3.4 we will discuss the link between the Law of One Price and the absence of arbitrage..  

The fraction of the total portfolio value invested in asset $i$ is then $\pi_{i}=\theta_{i}P_{i}/P^{\theta}$ and the vector $\pi=\left(\pi_{1},\ldots,\pi_{I}\right)^{\top}$ is called the portfolio weight vector. If we let $\mathbf{1}=\left(1,\ldots,1\right)^{\top}$ , we have ${\boldsymbol{\pi}}\cdot\mathbf{1}=$ $\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}=1$ . Note that $\mathrm{diag}(P)\mathbf{1}=P $ and thus $P^{\theta}=P^{\top}\pmb{\theta}=(\mathrm{diag}(P)\mathbf{1})^{\top}\pmb{\theta}=\mathbf{1}^{\top}\mathrm{diag}(P)\pmb{\theta}$ so that  

$$
\pi={\frac{\operatorname{diag}(P)\theta}{P^{\top}\theta}}={\frac{\operatorname{diag}(P)\theta}{{\bf1^{\top}}\operatorname{diag}(P)\theta}}.
$$  

Given $\pmb{\theta}$ and the price vector $_{P}$ we can derive $\pi$ . Conversely, given $\pi$ , the total portfolio value $P^{\theta}$ and the price vector $_{P}$ , we can derive $\pmb{\theta}$ . We therefore have two equivalent ways of representing a portfolio.  

The gross rate of return on a portfolio $\pmb{\theta}$ is the random variable  

$$
R^{\theta}={\frac{D^{\theta}}{P^{\theta}}}={\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{I}\theta_{i}D_{i}}{P^{\theta}}}={\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{I}\theta_{i}P_{i}R_{i}}{P^{\theta}}}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}{\frac{\theta_{i}P_{i}}{P^{\theta}}}R_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}R_{i}=\pi\cdot R,
$$  

where $\pi_{i}$ is the portfolio weight of asset i. We observe that the gross return on a portfolio is just a weighted average of the gross rates of return on the assets in the portfolio. Similarly for the net rate of return since $\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}=1$ and thus  

$$
r^{\theta}=R^{\theta}-1=\left(\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}R_{i}\right)-1=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}\left(R_{i}-1\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{I}\pi_{i}r_{i}=\pi\cdot r,
$$  

where $\pmb{r}=(r_{1},\dots,r_{I})^{\top}$ is the vector of net rates of return on the basic assets.  

# 3.3.2 The discrete-time framework  

In a multi-period model individuals are allowed to rebalance their portfolio at any date considered in the model. A trading strategy is an. $I$ dimensional adapted stochastic process ${\pmb\theta}=({\pmb\theta}_{t})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ where $\pmb\theta_{t}=(\theta_{1t},\dots,\theta_{I t})^{\top}$ denotes the portfolio held at time. $t$ or rather immediately after trading at time $t$ $\theta_{i t}$ is the number of units of asset. $i$ held at time $t$  

A trading strategy $\pmb{\theta}$ generates a dividend process. $D^{\theta}$ . Immediately before time. $t$ the portfolio is given by $\pmb{\theta}_{t-1}$ so the investor will receive dividends $\pmb{\theta}_{t-1}\cdot\pmb{D}_{t}$ at time $t$ , and then rebalance the. portfolio to $\pmb{\theta}_{t}$ immediately after time $t$ . The net gain or dividend at time $t$ is therefore equal to  

$$
D_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t-1}\cdot D_{t}-\left(\theta_{t}-\theta_{t-1}\right)\cdot P_{t}=\theta_{t-1}\cdot\left(P_{t}+D_{t}\right)-\theta_{t}\cdot P_{t},\quad t=1,2,\ldots,T-1.
$$  

We can think of this as a budget constraint saying that the sum of the withdrawn dividend and our additional investment $(\pmb{\theta}_{t}-\pmb{\theta}_{t-1})\cdot\pmb{P}_{t}$ has to equal the dividends we receive from the current portfolio. The terminal dividend is  

$$
D_{T}^{\theta}=\theta_{T-1}\cdot D_{T}.
$$  

Given the Law of One Price, the initial price of the trading strategy is $P^{\pmb{\theta}}={\pmb{\theta}}_{0}\cdot{\pmb{P}}_{0}$ . We can let $D_{0}^{\theta}=-P^{\theta}$ so that the dividend process $D^{\theta}$ is defined at all $t\in\mathcal{T}$  

For $t=1,\ldots,T$ define  

$$
V_{t}^{\pmb\theta}=\pmb\theta_{t-1}\cdot(\pmb P_{t}+\pmb D_{t})
$$  

which is the time $t$ value of the portfolio chosen at the previous trading date. This is the value of the portfolio just after dividends are received at time. $t$ and before the portfolio is rebalanced. Define. $V_{0}^{\pmb\theta}={\pmb\theta}_{0}\cdot{\pmb P}_{0}$ . We call $V^{\theta}=(V_{t}^{\theta})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ the value process of the trading strategye $\pmb{\theta}$ . According to (3.8), we have $V_{t}^{\pmb\theta}=D_{t}^{\pmb\theta}+{\pmb\theta}_{t}\cdot{\pmb P}_{t}$ for $t=1,\ldots,T$ and, in particular, $V_{T}^{\theta}=D_{T}^{\theta}$ . The change in the value of the trading strategy between two adjacent dates is.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{V_{t+1}^{\theta}-V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t}\cdot(P_{t+1}+D_{t+1})-\theta_{t-1}\cdot(P_{t}+D_{t})}\ &{\qquad=\theta_{t}\cdot(P_{t+1}+D_{t+1})-D_{t}^{\theta}-\theta_{t}\cdot P_{t}}\ &{\qquad=\theta_{t}\cdot(P_{t+1}-P_{t}+D_{t+1})-D_{t}^{\theta}.}\end{array}
$$  

The first term on the right-hand side of the last expression is the net return on the portfolio $\pmb{\theta}_{t}$ from time $t$ to $t+1$ , the latter term is the net dividend we have withdrawn at time $t$  

The trading strategy is said to be self-financing if all the intermediate dividends are zero, i.e. $D_{t}^{\theta}=0$ for $t=1,\dots,T-1$ . Using (3.8) this means that  

$$
\left(\pmb{\theta}_{t}-\pmb{\theta}_{t-1}\right)\cdot\pmb{P}_{t}=\pmb{\theta}_{t-1}\cdot\pmb{D}_{t},\quad t=1,\dots,T-1.
$$  

The left-hand side is the extra investment due to the rebalancing at time $t$ , the right-hand side is the dividend received at time $t$ . A self-financing trading strategy requires an initial investment of $P^{\pmb{\theta}}={\pmb{\theta}}_{0}\cdot{\pmb{P}}_{0}$ and generates a terminal dividend of $D_{T}^{\theta}=\pmb{\theta}_{T-1}\cdot\pmb{D}_{T}$ . At the intermediate dates no money is invested or withdrawn so increasing the investment in some assets must be fully financed by dividends or selling off other assets. If $\pmb{\theta}$ is self-financing, we have $V_{t}^{\pmb\theta}=P_{t}^{\pmb\theta}\equiv\pmb\theta_{t}\cdot\pmb P_{t}$ , the time. $t$ price of the portfolio $\pmb{\theta}_{t}$ , for $t=0,1,\ldots,T-1$ . Moreover, the change in the value of the trading strategy is just the net return, cf. (3.10).

# 3.3.3 The continuous-time framework  

Also in the continuous-time framework with. $\mathcal{T}=[0,T]$ a trading strategy is an $I$ -dimensional adapted stochastic process ${\pmb\theta}=({\pmb\theta}_{t})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ where $\pmb\theta_{t}=(\theta_{1t},\dots,\theta_{I t})^{\top}$ denotes the portfolio held at. time $t$ or rather immediately after trading at time $t$  

Consistent with the discrete-time framework we define the value of the trading strategy $\pmb{\theta}$ at any given time $t$ as the price of the portfolio just chosen at that time plus any lump-sum dividends received at that time. Since we only allow for lump-sum dividends at the terminal date, we define  

$$
V_{t}^{\pmb\theta}=\pmb\theta_{t}\cdot\pmb P_{t},\quad t<T
$$  

and $V_{T}^{\theta}=\theta_{T}{\cdot}D_{T}\equiv D_{T}^{\theta}$ , the terminal lump-sum dividend. The time $0$ value is the cost of initiating. the trading strategy, which we can think of as a negative initial dividend,. $D_{0}^{\theta}=-V_{0}^{\theta}=\theta_{0}\cdot P_{0}$ We assume that between time 0 and time. $T$ no lump-sum dividends can be withdrawn from. the investment but funds can be withdrawn at a continuous rate as represented by the process. $\boldsymbol{\alpha}^{\theta}=(\alpha_{t}^{\theta})$ describing the rate with which we withdraw funds from our investments. Intermediate. lump-sum withdrawals could be allowed at the expense of additional notational complexity. For later use note that an application of Ito's Lemma implies that the increment to the value process is given by.  

$$
d V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t}\cdot d P_{t}+d\theta_{t}\cdot P_{t}+d\theta_{t}\cdot d P_{t}.
$$  

Assume for a moment that we do not change our portfolio over a small time interval $[t,t+\Delta t]$ The total funds withdrawn over this interval is. $\alpha_{t}^{\pmb\theta}\Delta t$ . Let $\Delta\theta_{t+\Delta t}=\theta_{t+\Delta t}-\theta_{t}$ and $\Delta P_{t+\Delta t}=$ $P_{t+\Delta{t}}-P_{t}$ . The total dividends received from the portfolio. $\pmb{\theta}_{t}$ over the interval is $\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{I}\theta_{i t}\delta_{i t}P_{i t}\Delta t$ which we can rewrite as. ${\pmb\theta}_{t}^{\scriptscriptstyle\prime}\mathrm{diag}({\pmb P}_{t})\delta_{t}\Delta t$ , where $\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})$ is the matrix defined in (3.1). Then the. budget constraint over this interval is.  

$$
\alpha_{t}^{\theta}\Delta t+\Delta\pmb{\theta}_{t+\Delta t}\cdot\pmb{P}_{t+\Delta t}=\pmb{\theta}_{t}^{\top}\mathrm{diag}(\pmb{P}_{t})\pmb{\delta}_{t}\Delta t.
$$  

The left-hand side is the sum of the funds we withdraw and the net extra investment. The right hand side is the funds we receive in dividends. Let us add and subtract $(\Delta\pmb{\theta}_{t+\Delta t})\cdot\pmb{P}_{t}$ in the above equation. Rearranging we obtain  

$$
\alpha_{t}^{\theta}\Delta t+\Delta\theta_{t+\Delta t}\cdot\Delta P_{t+\Delta t}+\Delta\theta_{t+\Delta t}\cdot P_{t}=\theta_{t}^{\top}\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\delta_{t}\Delta t.
$$  

The equivalent equation for an infinitesimal interval $[t,t+d t]$ is  

$$
\alpha_{t}^{\theta}d t+d\pmb{\theta}_{t}\cdot d\pmb{P}_{t}+d\pmb{\theta}_{t}\cdot\pmb{P}_{t}=\pmb{\theta}_{t}^{\top}\operatorname{diag}(\pmb{P}_{t})\delta_{t}d t.
$$  

Using this, we can rewrite the value dynamics in (3.12) as  

$$
d V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t}\cdot d P_{t}+\theta_{t}^{\top}\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\delta_{t}d t-\alpha_{t}^{\theta}d t.
$$  

Substituting in (3.5), this implies that  

$$
d V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t}^{\top}\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\left[\left(\mu_{t}+\delta_{t}\right)d t+\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{t}d z_{t}\right]-\alpha_{t}^{\theta}d t.
$$  

As discussed earlier we can define a portfolio weight vector  

$$
\pi_{t}={\frac{\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\pmb{\theta}_{t}}{P_{t}^{\top}\pmb{\theta}_{t}}}={\frac{\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\pmb{\theta}_{t}}{V_{t}^{\theta}}}.
$$  

The value dynamics can therefore be rewritten as  

$$
d V_{t}^{\theta}=V_{t}^{\theta}\pi_{t}^{\top}\left[\left(\mu_{t}+\delta_{t}\right)d t+\underline{{\sigma}}_{t}d z_{t}\right]-\alpha_{t}^{\theta}d t.
$$  

A trading strategy is called self-financing if no funds are withdrawn, i.e. $\alpha_{t}^{\pmb\theta}\equiv0$ . In that case the value dynamics is simply  

$$
d V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{t}^{\top}\operatorname{diag}(P_{t})\left[\left(\mu_{t}+\delta_{t}\right)d t+\underline{{\sigma}}_{t}d z_{t}\right].
$$  

This really means that for any $t\in(0,T)$  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle V_{t}^{\theta}=\theta_{0}\cdot P_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}\theta_{s}^{\top}\mathrm{diag}(P_{s})\left[\left(\mu_{s}+\delta_{s}\right)d s+\underline{{{\sigma}}}_{s}d z_{s}\right]}}\ {{\displaystyle~=\theta_{0}\cdot P_{0}+\int_{0}^{t}\theta_{s}^{\top}\mathrm{diag}(P_{s})\left(\mu_{s}+\delta_{s}\right)d s+\int_{0}^{t}\theta_{s}^{\top}\mathrm{diag}(P_{s})\underline{{{\sigma}}}_{s}d z_{s}.}}\end{array}
$$
