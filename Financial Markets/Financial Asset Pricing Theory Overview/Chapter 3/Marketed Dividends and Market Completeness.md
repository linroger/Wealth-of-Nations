# 3.6 Marketed dividends and market completeness  

By forming portfolios and trading strategies investors can generate other dividends than those of. the individual basic assets. Any dividend that can be generated by trading the basic assets is said to be a marketed dividend. If all the dividends you can think of are marketed, the financial market. is said to be complete. Otherwise the financial market is said to be incomplete. We will see in later. chapters that some important results will depend on whether the financial market is complete or incomplete. Below we provide formal definitions and characterize complete markets..  

# 3.6.1 The one-period framework  

In the one-period framework dividends are random variables. A random variable is said to be a marketed dividend or spanned by traded assets if it is identical to the dividend of some portfolio of the traded assets. The dividend of a portfolio. $\pmb{\theta}$ is the random variable $D^{\theta}=\pmb\theta\cdot\pmb D$ . The set of marketed dividends is thus  

$$
{\mathcal{M}}=\left\{x|x=\theta\cdot D{\mathrm{~for~some~portfolio~}}\theta\right\}.
$$  

Note that $\mathcal{M}$ is a subset of the set $\mathcal{L}$ of all random variables on the probability space $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}\right)$ with finite variance.  

If some of the basic assets are redundant, they will not help us in generating dividends. Suppose that there are $k\leq{\mathit{I}}$ non-redundant assets. The $k$ -dimensional random variable of dividends of these assets is denoted by $\hat{D}$ and a portfolio of these assets is denoted by a $k$ -dimensional vector $\hat{\pmb{\theta}}$ . We can obtain exactly the same dividends by using only the non-redundant assets as by using all dividends so  

$$
\mathcal{M}=\left\{x|x=\hat{\pmb{\theta}}\cdot\hat{D}\mathrm{~for~some~portfolio~}\hat{\pmb{\theta}}\right\}.
$$  

The financial market is said to be complete if any dividend is marketed, i.e. if any random variable $x$ is the dividend of some portfolio. In symbols, the market is complete if. $\mathcal{\mathrm{M}}=\mathcal{L}$  

With $k$ non-redundant assets, the set of marketed dividends will be a. $k$ -dimensional linear subspace in $\mathcal{L}$ .You have $k$ choice variables, namely how much to invest in each of the. $k$ nonredundant assets. The dimension of. $\mathcal{L}$ is the number of possible states. For each state. $\omega$ you have to make sure that the dividend of the portfolio will equal the desired dividend $x(\omega)$ . Whether the market is complete or not is therefore determined by the relation between the number of states and the number of non-redundant assets. If the state space is infinite, the market is clearly incomplete.  

With a finite state space. $\Omega=\{1,2,\dots,S\}$ , there can be at most. $S$ non-redundant assets, i.e.. $k\leq S$ .If $k<S$ , the market will be incomplete. If $k=S$ , the market will be complete. Details follow now: With a finite state space dividends can be represented by. $S$ -dimensional vectors and the dividends of all the. $I$ basic assets by the $I\times S$ dividend matrix D. A marketed dividend is. then an $S$ -dimensional vector $_{x}$ for which a portfolio $\pmb{\theta}$ can be found such that  

$$
\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top}\pmb{\theta}=\pmb{x}
$$  

Removing redundant assets we eliminate rows in the dividend matrix $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ .As long as one of the. assets is redundant, the rows of. $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ will be linearly dependent. The maximum number of linearly independent rows of a matrix is called the rank of the matrix. It can be shown that this is also the maximum number of linearly independent columns of the matrix. With $k$ non-redundant assets, the rank of $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ is equal to $k$ . Removing the rows corresponding to those assets from $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ we obtain a matrix $\underline{{\underline{{\hat{D}}}}}$ of dimension $k\times S$ , where $k\leq S$ since we cannot have more than. $S$ linearly independent $S$ -dimensional vectors. Then the set of marketed dividend vectors is  

$$
\mathcal{M}=\left\{\underline{{\underline{{\hat{D}}}}}^{\top}\hat{\pmb{\theta}}\mid\hat{\pmb{\theta}}\in\mathbb{R}^{k}\right\}
$$  

since we can attain the same dividend vectors by forming portfolios of only the non-redundant assets as by forming portfolios of all the assets..  

In the finite-state economy, the market is complete if $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^{S}$ , i.e. any state-contingent dividend can be generated by forming portfolios of the traded assets. The market is complete if and only if for any $\pmb{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{S}$ , we can find $\pmb\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{I}$ such that  

$$
\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top}\pmb\theta=\pmb x.
$$  

Market completeness is thus a question of when we can solve $S$ equations in $I$ unknowns. From linear algebra we have the following result:  

Theorem 3.2 With a finite state space, $\Omega=\{1,2,\dots,S\}$ , the market is complete if and only if the rank of the. $I\times S$ dividend matrix. $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ is equal to. $S$  

Clearly, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for a complete market is that. $I\geq S$ , i.e. that there are at least as many assets as states. If the market is complete, the "pruned' dividend matrix $\underline{{\underline{{\hat{D}}}}}$ will be a non-singular $S\times S$ matrix.  

Example 3.2 The market considered in Example 3.1 is complete since there are as many nonredundant assets as there are states. Any potential dividend vector can be formed by some portfolio of three of the traded assets. For example, if we let $\underline{{\underline{{\boldsymbol{D}}}}}$ be the dividend matrix of the first three assets, we can generate any dividend vector $_{x}$ by solving $\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top}\pmb{\theta}=\pmb{x}$ for the portfolio. $\pmb{\theta}$ of the first three assets, i.e.. $\pmb\theta=\left(\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\pmb x$ . In the present case, we have.  

$$
\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}=\left(\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{1}&{1}\ {0}&{1}&{2}\ {4}&{0}&{1}\end{array}\right),\quad\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top}=\left(\begin{array}{l l l}{1}&{0}&{4}\ {1}&{1}&{0}\ {1}&{2}&{1}\end{array}\right),\quad(\underline{{\underline{{D}}}}^{\top})^{-1}=\left(\begin{array}{l l l}{0.2}&{1.6}&{-0.8}\ {-0.2}&{-0.6}&{0.8}\ {0.2}&{-0.4}&{0.2}\end{array}\right).
$$  

For example, the portfolio providing a dividend vector of $(5,-10,5)^{\top}$ is given by  

$$
\theta=\left(\begin{array}{c c c}{{0.2}}&{{1.6}}&{{-0.8}}\ {{-0.2}}&{{-0.6}}&{{0.8}}\ {{0.2}}&{{-0.4}}&{{0.2}}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{{5}}\ {{-10}}\ {{5}}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}{{-19}}\ {{9}}\ {{6}}\end{array}\right).
$$  

# 3.6.2 Multi-period framework  

In a multi-period setting the market is said to be complete if for any random variable $X$ there is a trading strategy $\pmb{\theta}$ such that $D_{T}^{\theta}=X$ in all states. This implies that any terminal payment you may think of can be obtained by some trading strategy. If you think of a payment before the terminal date $T$ , this can be transformed into a terminal payment by investing it in a given asset until time $T$ . Hence the definition covers all relevant dates and the market will thus be complete if any adapted stochastic process can be generated by some trading strategy in the given assets.  

More formally, let $\mathcal{L}$ denote the set of all random variables (with finite variance) whose outcome can be determined from the exogenous shocks to the economy over the entire time span $\mathcal{T}$ .On the other hand, let $\mathcal{M}$ denote the set of possible time $T$ values that can be generated by forming self-financing trading strategies in the financial market, i.e.  

$$
\mathcal{M}=\left\{V_{T}^{\theta}|\theta\mathrm{self-financing}\right\}.
$$  

Of course, for any trading strategy $\pmb{\theta}$ the terminal value $V_{T}^{\theta}$ is a random variable, whose outcome is not determined until time $T$ . Imposing relevant technical conditions imposed on trading strategies, the terminal value will have finite variance, so $\mathcal{M}$ is always a subset of $\mathcal{L}$ . If, in fact, $\mathcal{M}$ is equal to $\mathcal{L}$ , the financial market is complete. If not, it is said to be incomplete.  

How many assets do we need in order to have a complete market? In the one-period model, Theorem 3.2 tells us that with $S$ possible states we need at least $S$ sufficiently different assets for the market to be complete. To generalize this result to the multi-period setting we must be careful. Consider once again the two-period model illustrated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 in Chapter 2. Here there are six possible outcomes, i.e. $\Omega$ has six elements. Hence, one might think that we need access to trade in at least six sufficiently different assets in order for the market to be complete. This is not correct. We can do with fewer assets. This is based on two observations: (i) the uncertainty is not revealed completely at once, but little by little, and (ii) we can trade dynamically in the assets. In the example there are three possible transitions of the economy from time O to time 1. From our one-period analysis we know that three sufficiently different assets are enough to "span'". this uncertainty. From time 1 to time 2 there are either two, three, or one possible transition. of the economy, depending on which state the economy is in at time 1. At most, we need three. sufficiently different assets to span the uncertainty over this period. In total, we can generate any. dividend process if we just have access to three sufficiently different assets in both periods..  

In the one-period model, "sufficiently different' means that the matrix of the dividends of the assets in a given period is of full rank. In the discrete-time multi-period model the payment of a given asset at the end of each period is the sum of the price and the dividend in that period. The relevant matrix is therefore the matrix of possible values of price plus dividend at the end of the period. This matrix tells us how the assets will react to the exogenous shocks over that subperiod. If we have at least as many assets that respond sufficiently differently to the shocks as we have possible realizations of these shocks, we can completely hedge the shocks.  

The continuous-time financial market with uncertainty generated by a $d$ -dimensional standard Brownian motion is complete if there are. $d+1$ sufficiently different assets traded at all times. For example this is true with an instantaneously risk-free asset plus $d$ risky assets having a price sensitivity matrix of rank $d$ . The formal proof of this result is pretty complicated and will $\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}t$  

not be given here. We refer the interested reader to Harrison and Pliska (1981, 1983) and Duffie (2001). However, the result is quite intuitive given the following observations:  

. For continuous changes over an instant, only means and variances matter.   
. We can approximate the $d$ -dimensional shock $d{\boldsymbol{z}}_{t}$ by a random variable that takes on $d+1$ possible values and has the same mean and variance as $d{\boldsymbol{z}}_{t}$   
. For example, a one-dimensional shock $d{\boldsymbol{z}}_{t}$ has mean zero and variance $d t$ . This is also true. for a random variable. $\varepsilon$ which equals $\sqrt{d t}$ with a probability of. $1/2$ and equals $-\sqrt{d t}$ with a probability of $1/2$   
. With continuous trading, we can adjust our exposure to the exogenous shocks every instant.  

Over each instant we can thus think of the model with uncertainty generated by a $d$ -dimensional standard Brownian motion as a discrete-time model with $d+1$ states. Therefore it only takes $d+1$ sufficiently different assets to complete the market. For example, if all market prices are affected by a single shock, a one-dimensional Brownian motion, the market will be complete if you can always find two assets with different sensitivities towards that shock. One of the assets could be a risk-free asset. Note however that when counting the number of shocks you should include shocks to variables that contain information about future asset prices.  

Let us take a simple, concrete example. Suppose that assets pay no intermediate dividends and that the price dynamics of an arbitratey asset, asset. $i$ , is given by  

$$
d P_{i t}=P_{i t}\left[\mu_{i}d t+\sigma_{i}d z_{t}\right],
$$  

where $z=\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion and $\mu_{i}$ $\sigma_{i}$ are constants. Suppose. that assets. $i$ and $j$ have different sensitivities towards the shock, i.e. that $\sigma_{i}\neq\sigma_{j}$ . From (3.14), it follows that a self-financing trading strategy with a weight of $\pi_{t}$ on asset $i$ and $1-\pi_{t}$ on asset $j$ will generate a value process $V_{t}$ with dynamics.  

$$
d V_{t}=V_{t}\left[\left(\pi_{t}(\mu_{i}-\mu_{j})+\mu_{j}\right)d t+\left(\pi_{t}(\sigma_{i}-\sigma_{j})+\sigma_{j}\right)d z_{t}\right].
$$  

We can obtain any desired sensitivity towards the shock. The portfolio weight $\pi_{t}=(\nu_{t}-\sigma_{j})/(\sigma_{i}-$ $\sigma_{j}$ ) will generate a portfolio return sensitivity of $\nu_{t}$ . Now suppose that each $\mu_{i}$ is a function of some. variable $x_{t}$ and that the dynamics of $x_{t}$ is affected by another shock represented by a standard Brownian motion. $\hat{z}=(\hat{z}_{t})$ independent of. $z$ , e.g.  

$$
d x_{t}=m(x_{t})d t+v(x_{t})\left(\rho d z_{t}+\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}d\hat{z}_{t}\right).
$$  

Then the full uncertainty of the model is generated by a two-dimensional shock $(z,\hat{z})$ . Since the instantaneous price changes are affected only by $z$ , the market is now incomplete. You cannot hedge against the shock process $\hat{z}$  

For a moment think about a continuous-time model where there can be a jump in the value of one of the key variables. Suppose that in case of a jump the variable can jump to $K$ different values. The change over an instant in such a variable cannot be represented only by the expectation and the variance of the jump. To obtain any desired exposure to the jump risk you need $K$ assets which react sufficiently different to the jump. Typical models with jump risk assume that the size of the jump is normally or lognormally distributed. In both cases there are infinitely many. possible realizations of the jump size and, consequently, a market with finitely many assets will be incomplete.  

# 3.6.3 Discussion  

As we shall see in later sections, some fundamental results require that the market is complete. It is therefore relevant to assess the realism of this property. Market completeness means that every risk is traded. Individuals can insure against all risks (relevant for asset prices) through trading. in financial assets. Clearly, individuals would like to have that opportunity so if the market is incomplete there will be an incentive to create new non-redundant assets that will help complete the market. In fact, at least part of the many new assets that have been introduced in the financial markets over the last decades do help complete the market, e.g. assets with dividends depending on. the stock market volatility, the weather at a given location, or the number of natural catastrophes. On the other hand, some risks are difficult to market. For example, due to the obvious information asymmetry, it is unlikely that individual labor income risk can be fully insured in the financial market. Maybe you would like to obtain full income insurance but who should provide that, given that you probably know a lot more about your potential income than anybody else-and that you can influence your own income while others cannot. Hence, we should not expect that real-life. financial markets are complete in the strict sense.  

If the market is incomplete, it is not possible to adjust your exposure to one or several shocks. included in the model. But maybe investors do not care about those shocks. Then the model is. said to be effectively complete. Before solving for prices and optimal decisions of the individuals, it is generally impossible to decide whether an incomplete market is really effectively complete.. We will return to this discussion and some formal results on that in Chapter 7..
