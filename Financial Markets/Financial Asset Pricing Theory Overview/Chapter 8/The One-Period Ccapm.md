# 8.2 The one-period CCAPM  

For simplicity let us first investigate the link between asset prices and consumption in the oneperiod framework.  

As discussed several times the marginal rate of substitution of any individual defines a stateprice deflator. If we assume time-additive expected utility with time preference rate. $\delta$ and utility function $u$ , this state-price deflator is.  

$$
\zeta=e^{-\delta}\frac{u^{\prime}(c)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})},
$$  

where $c_{0}$ is optimal time $0$ consumption and $c$ is the state-dependent optimal time 1 consumption. If the economy can be modeled by a representative individual, the equation holds for aggregate consumption.  

Assuming that a risk-free asset is traded, we know from Section 4.2.1 that the gross risk-free  

return is  

$$
R^{f}={\frac{1}{\operatorname{E}[\zeta]}}=e^{\delta}{\frac{1}{\operatorname{E}[u^{\prime}(c)/u^{\prime}(c_{0})]}}
$$  

and the expected gross return on any asset $i$ is  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]=\frac{1}{\mathrm{E}[\boldsymbol{\zeta}]}-\frac{\mathrm{Cov}[R_{i},\boldsymbol{\zeta}]}{\mathrm{E}[\boldsymbol{\zeta}]}}\ &{\quad\quad=R^{f}-\frac{\mathrm{Cov}[u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c})/u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}_{0}),R_{i}]}{\mathrm{E}[u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c})/u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}_{0})]}}\ &{\quad\quad=R^{f}-\frac{\sigma[u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c})/u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}_{0})]}{\mathrm{E}[u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c})/u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}_{0})]}\sigma[R_{i}]\rho[R_{i},u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c})/u^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{c}_{0})],}\end{array}
$$  

where $\sigma[x]$ denotes the standard deviation of the random variable $x$ , while $\rho[x,y]$ is the correlation between the random variables $x$ and $y$ . An asset with a return which is positively correlated with. the marginal utility of consumption (and hence negatively correlated with the level of consumption) is attractive, has a high equilibrium price, and thus a low expected return..  

In order to obtain a relation between expected returns and consumption itself (rather than marginal utility of consumption) we need to make further assumptions or approximations. Below we develop three versions.  

# 8.2.1 The simple one-period CCAPM: version 1  

A first-order Taylor approximation of $u^{\prime}(c)$ around $c_{0}$ gives that  

$$
\frac{u^{\prime}(c)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}\approx\frac{u^{\prime}(c_{0})+u^{\prime\prime}(c_{0})(c-c_{0})}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}=1-\gamma(c_{0})g,
$$  

where $\gamma(c_{0})=-c_{0}u^{\prime\prime}(c_{0})/u^{\prime}(c_{0})$ is the relative risk aversion of the individual evaluated at the time 0 consumption level, and $g=c/c_{0}-1$ is the (state-dependent) relative growth rate of consumption over the period. If we further assume that $\operatorname{E}[u^{\prime}(c)/u^{\prime}(c_{0})]\approx1$ , we get that  

$$
\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx\gamma(c_{0})\operatorname{Cov}[g,R_{i}]=\gamma(c_{0})\rho[g,R_{i}]\sigma[g]\sigma[R_{i}],
$$  

where $\rho[g,R_{i}]$ is the correlation between consumption growth and the return and. $\sigma[g]$ and $\sigma[R_{i}]$ are the standard deviations of consumption growth and return, respectively. The above equation links expected excess returns to covariance with consumption growth. We can rewrite the equation as  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]\approx R^{f}+\beta[R_{i},g]\eta,}\end{array}
$$  

where $\beta[R_{i},g]=\mathrm{Cov}[g,R_{i}]/\mathrm{Var}[g]$ and $\eta=\gamma(c_{0})\operatorname{Var}[g]$ . If we ignore the approximative character of the equation, it shows that the growth rate of the individual's optimal consumption is a pricing factor.  

If the economy has a representative individual we can use the above relations with aggregate consumption instead of individual consumption. The factor risk premium $\eta$ should then reflect the relative risk aversion of the representative individual..  

What if the economy does not have a representative individual? Eq. (8.3) will still hold for any individual $\textit{l}$ , i.e.  

$$
\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx\gamma_{l}(c_{0}^{l})\mathrm{Cov}[c^{l}/c_{0}^{l},R_{i}]=\mathrm{ARA}_{l}(c_{0}^{l})\mathrm{Cov}[c^{l},R_{i}],
$$  

where y and $\mathrm{ARA}_{l}$ are the relative and absolute risk aversion of individual $\textit{l}$ , so that  

$$
\left(\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\right){\frac{1}{\operatorname{ARA}_{l}(c_{0}^{l})}}\approx\operatorname{Cov}[c^{l},R_{i}],\quad l=1,2,\ldots,L.
$$  

Summing up over all individuals, we get  

$$
\left(\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\right)\sum_{l=1}^{L}{\frac{1}{\operatorname{ARA}_{l}(c_{0}^{l})}}\approx\sum_{l=1}^{L}\operatorname{Cov}[c^{l},R_{i}]=\operatorname{Cov}\left[\sum_{l=1}^{L}c^{l},R_{i}\right]=\operatorname{Cov}[C,R_{i}],
$$  

where $C$ is aggregate time 1 consumption. If we let $C_{0}$ denote aggregate time $0$ consumption, we obtain  

$$
\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx\left(\sum_{l=1}^{L}{\frac{1}{\mathrm{ARA}_{l}(c_{0}^{l})}}\right)^{-1}C_{0}\operatorname{Cov}[C/C_{0},R_{i}].
$$  

Again ignoring the approximation, this equation shows that aggregate consumption growth is a pricing factor even if there is no representative individual. We just need to replace the relative risk aversion of the representative individual by some complex average of individual risk aversions. The absolute risk tolerance of individual $l$ is exactly $1/\mathrm{ARA}_{l}(c_{0}^{l})$ so the first term on the right-hand side of the above equation can be interpreted as the inverse of the aggregate absolute risk tolerance in the economy. The higher the aggregate absolute risk tolerance, the lower the equilibrium risk premium on risky assets.  

Of course, we prefer exact asset pricing results to approximate. In a later section, we will show that in continuous-time models the analogues to the above relations will hold as exact equalities under appropriate assumptions.  

# 8.2.2 The simple one-period CCAPM: version 2  

Suppose that  

(i) the individual has constant relative risk aversion, $u(c)=c^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$  

(ii) consumption growth is lognormally distributed,  

$$
\ln(1+g)\equiv\ln\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)\sim N(\bar{g},\sigma_{g}^{2}).
$$  

Then  

$$
\frac{u^{\prime}(c)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}=\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)^{-\gamma}=\exp\left\{-\gamma\ln\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)\right\}.
$$  

For a random variable $x\sim N(m,s^{2})$ , it can be shown (see Appendix B) that  

$$
\operatorname{E}[e^{-k x}]=e^{-k m+{\frac{1}{2}}k^{2}s^{2}}
$$  

for any constant $k$ . In particular,  

$$
\mathrm{E}[e^{-\gamma x}]=e^{-\gamma m+\frac{1}{2}\gamma^{2}s^{2}}
$$  

and  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{\operatorname{Var}[e^{-\gamma x}]=\operatorname{E}[(e^{-\gamma x})^{2}]-\left(\operatorname{E}[e^{-\gamma x}]\right)^{2}=\operatorname{E}[e^{-2\gamma x}]-\left(e^{-\gamma m+{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}s^{2}}\right)^{2}}\ &{\qquad=e^{-2\gamma m+2\gamma^{2}s^{2}}-\left(e^{-\gamma m+{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}s^{2}}\right)^{2}=\left(e^{-\gamma m+{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}s^{2}}\right)^{2}\left[e^{\gamma^{2}s^{2}}-1\right].}\end{array}}
$$  

In our case, we get  

$$
\operatorname{E}\left[{\frac{u^{\prime}(c)}{u^{\prime}(c_{0})}}\right]=\operatorname{E}\left[\exp\left\{-\gamma\ln\left({\frac{c}{c_{0}}}\right)\right\}\right]=\exp\left\{-\gamma{\bar{g}}+{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}\right\}
$$  

and  

$$
\frac{\sigma\left[u^{\prime}(c)/u^{\prime}(c_{0})\right]}{\operatorname{E}\left[u^{\prime}(c)/u^{\prime}(c_{0})\right]}=\sqrt{e^{\gamma^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}}-1}\approx\gamma\sigma_{g},
$$  

where the approximation is based on $e^{x}\approx1+x$ for $x\approx0$ . The gross risk-free rate of return is then given by.  

$$
R^{f}=e^{\delta}\left(\operatorname{E}\left[(c/c_{0})^{-\gamma}\right]\right)^{-1}=\exp\left\{\delta+\gamma{\bar{g}}-{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}\right\}
$$  

so that the continuously compounded risk-free rate of return becomes  

$$
\ln R^{f}=\delta+\gamma\bar{g}-\frac{1}{2}\gamma^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2}.
$$  

From (8.2) and (8.7) we conclude that in the simple model the excess expected rate of return on a risky asset is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx-\gamma\sigma_{g}\rho\left[R_{i},(c/c_{0})^{-\gamma}\right]\sigma[R_{i}].}\end{array}
$$  

A first-order Taylor approximation of the function $f(x)=x^{-\gamma}$ around $^{1}$ gives $f(x)\approx f(1)+$ $f^{\prime}(1)(x-1)=1-\gamma(x-1)$ and with $x=c/c_{0}$ we get  

$$
\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)^{-\gamma}\approx1-\gamma\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}-1\right)
$$  

and, consequently,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\rho\left[R_{i},\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)^{-\gamma}\right]\approx\rho\left[R_{i},1-\gamma\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}-1\right)\right]=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}\left[R_{i},1-\gamma\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}-1\right)\right]}{\sigma\left[R_{i}\right]\sigma\left[1-\gamma\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}-1\right)\right]}}\ &{\qquad=\frac{-\gamma\operatorname{Cov}\left[R_{i},c/c_{0}\right]}{\sigma\left[R_{i}\right]\gamma\sigma\left[c/c_{0}\right]}=-\rho[R_{i},c/c_{0}].}\end{array}
$$  

Therefore,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx\gamma\sigma_{g}\rho[R_{i},c/c_{0}]\sigma[R_{i}],}\end{array}
$$  

as in (8.3).  

# 8.2.3 The simple one-period CCAPM: version 3  

Assume that the individual has constant relative risk aversion and that the gross asset return $R_{i}$ and the consumption growth $c/c_{0}$ are jointly lognormally distributed (a stronger condition than in version 2). Then the state-price deflator $\zeta=e^{-\delta}(c/c_{0})^{-\gamma}$ is also lognormally distributed. It now follows from the analysis in Section 4.2.1 that the continuously compounded risk-free rate of return is  

${\mathrm{\Delta}}^{,}=\ln{R}^{f}=-\operatorname{E}[\ln\zeta]-{\frac{1}{2}}\operatorname{Var}[\ln\zeta]=\delta+\gamma\operatorname{E}\left[\ln\left({\frac{c}{c_{0}}}\right)\right]-{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}\operatorname{Var}\left[\ln\left({\frac{c}{c_{0}}}\right)\right]=\delta+\gamma\bar{g}-{\frac{1}{2}}\gamma^{2}\sigma_{g}^{2},$ as in version 2 above. The expectation of the continuously compounded rate of return $r_{i}=\ln R_{i}$ of asset $i$ satisfies  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle\mathrm{E}[r_{i}]-r^{f}=-\mathrm{Cov}[\ln\zeta,r_{i}]-\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Var}[r_{i}]}}\ {~}\ {{\displaystyle~=\gamma\mathrm{Cov}\left[r_{i},\ln\left(\frac{c}{c_{0}}\right)\right]=\gamma\sigma_{g}\rho[r_{i},\ln(c/c_{0})]\sigma[r_{i}]}.}\end{array}
$$  

This relation is exact but holds only under the more restrictive assumption of joint lognormality of consumption and returns.  

# 8.2.4 The consumption-mimicking portfolio  

In both versions 1 and 2 above, expected excess returns are determined by the beta of the asset with the growth rate of consumption via the equation $\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}[R_{i}]\approx R^{f}+\beta[R_{i},g]\eta}\end{array}$ , cf. (8.4).We will now show that we can replace the consumption growth by the return $R^{c}$ on a portfolio $\pi^{c}$ mimicking the consumption growth in the sense that $\pi^{c}$ is the portfolio minimizing the variance of the difference between the portfolio return and the consumption growth. A portfolio characterized by the portfolio weight vector $\pi$ has a return of $R^{\pi}=\pi^{\top}R$ , where $\kappa$ is the vector of returns of the individual assets. The variance we seek to minimize is  

$$
\mathrm{Var}\left[R^{\pi}-g\right]=\pi^{\top}\mathrm{Var}[R]\pi+\mathrm{Var}[g]-2\pi^{\top}\mathrm{Cov}[R,g].
$$  

Here $\mathrm{Var}[R]$ is the variance-covariance matrix of the returns and. $\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]$ is the vector of the covariances of each assets return with consumption growth. The first-order condition determining the consumption growth mimicking portfolio. $\pi=\pi^{c}$ is  

$$
2\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi^{c}-2\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]=0\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\pi^{c}=\left(\operatorname{Var}[R]\right)^{-1}\operatorname{Cov}[R,g],
$$  

so that the return on that portfolio is  

$$
R^{c}=(\pi^{c})^{\top}R=(\operatorname{Cov}[R,g])^{\top}(\operatorname{Var}[R])^{-1}R.
$$  

The variance of the return is  

$$
\mathrm{Var}[R^{c}]=\left(\mathrm{Cov}[R,g]\right)^{\top}\left(\mathrm{Var}[R]\right)^{-1}\mathrm{Cov}[R,g],
$$  

which implies that  

$$
\operatorname{Cov}[R^{c},g]=(\operatorname{Cov}[\pmb{R},g])^{\top}\left(\operatorname{Var}[\pmb{R}]\right)^{-1}\operatorname{Cov}[\pmb{R},g]=\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}].
$$  

Also observe that  

$$
\mathrm{Cov}[R,R^{c}]=\mathrm{Cov}[R,g].
$$  

The equation (8.4) holds for all assets and portfolios. In particular, it must hold for the consumption-mimicking portfolio so that  

$$
\operatorname{E}[R^{c}]-R^{f}\approx\beta[R^{c},g]\eta={\frac{\operatorname{Cov}[R^{c},g]}{\operatorname{Var}[g]}}\eta={\frac{\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}]}{\operatorname{Var}[g]}}\eta,
$$  

where the last equality follows from (8.13). Solving for $\eta$ in the above equation, we find.  

$$
\eta\approx{\frac{\operatorname{Var}[g]}{\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}]}}\left(\operatorname{E}[R^{c}]-R^{f}\right).
$$  

Hence the expected excess return on any risky asset $i$ can be rewritten as  

$$
\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx{\frac{\operatorname{Cov}[R_{i},g]}{\operatorname{Var}[g]}}{\frac{\operatorname{Var}[g]}{\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}]}}\left(\operatorname{E}[R^{c}]-R^{f}\right)={\frac{\operatorname{Cov}[R_{i},g]}{\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}]}}\left(\operatorname{E}[R^{c}]-R^{f}\right).
$$  

Applying (8.14), we conclude that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]-R^{f}\approx\beta[R_{i},R^{c}]\left(\operatorname{E}[R^{c}]-R^{f}\right),}\end{array}
$$  

where $\beta[R_{i},R^{c}]=\operatorname{Cov}[R_{i},R^{c}]/\operatorname{Var}[R^{c}]$ . Equation (8.15) is exactly as the classic CAPM but with.   
the return on a consumption-mimicking portfolio instead of the return on the market portfolio.  

The consumption-mimicking portfolio has the property that its return has the highest absolute correlation with consumption growth. In order to see this, note that  

$$
\left(\operatorname{Corr}[R^{\pi},g]\right)^{2}={\frac{\left(\operatorname{Cov}[R^{\pi},g]\right)^{2}}{\operatorname{Var}[R^{\pi}]\operatorname{Var}[g]}}={\frac{\left(\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\right)^{2}}{\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi\operatorname{Var}[g]}}.
$$  

The first-order condition for the minimization implies that  

$$
2\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\left(\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi\operatorname{Var}[g]\right)-\left(\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\right)^{2}2\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi\operatorname{Var}[g]=0.
$$  

Simplification leads to  

$$
\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi=\pi^{\top}\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi.
$$  

We know from (8.12) that the consumption-mimicking portfolio satisfies. $\operatorname{Var}[R]\pi=\operatorname{Cov}[R,g]$ and substituting that into the above equation, we see that the consumption-mimicking portfolio also satisfies the first-order condition for the correlation maximization problem..
