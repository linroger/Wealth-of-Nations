# 6.1 Introduction  

Chapter 4 discussed how the general pricing mechanism of a financial market can be represented. by a state-price deflator. Given a state-price deflator we can price all state-contingent dividends.. Conversely, given the market prices of state-contingent dividends we can extract one or several. state-price deflators. Market prices and hence the state-price deflator(s) are determined by the supply and demand of the individuals in the economy. Therefore, we have to study the portfolio decisions of individuals. This is the topic of the present chapter. In the next chapter we will then discuss market equilibrium.  

Section 6.2 studies the maximization problem of an individual under various preference speci-. fications in the one-period setting. Sections 6.3 and 6.4 extend the analysis to the discrete-time and the continuous-time framework, respectively. The main result of these sections is that the (marginal utility of) optimal consumption of any individual induces a valid state-price deflator, which gives us a link between individual optimality and asset prices. This is the cornerstone of the consumption-based asset pricing models studied in Chapter 8. Section 6.5 introduces the dynamic programming approach to the solution of multi-period utility maximization problems. In particular, we derive the so-called envelope condition that links marginal utility of consumption to marginal utility of optimal investments. In this way the state-price deflator is related to the optimally invested wealth of the individual plus some state variables capturing other information affecting the decisions of the individual. This will be useful for the factor pricing models studied. in Chapter 9.
