# 9.5 Pricing factors in a multi-period framework  

In the one-period framework we defined a pricing factor to be a $K$ -dimensional random variable $_{\alpha}$ such that there exists some $\alpha\in\mathbb R$ and some $\eta\in\mathbb{R}^{K}$ so that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]=\alpha+\beta[R_{i},\pmb{x}]^{\top}\pmb{\eta},\quad i=1,\ldots,I,}\end{array}
$$  

where $\beta[R_{i},{\pmb x}]=(\mathrm{Var}[{\pmb x}])^{-1}\mathrm{Cov}[{\pmb x},R_{i}]$ . We saw that any state-price deflator works as a pricing factor and, more generally, if $\zeta=a+b^{\top}x$ is a state-price deflator for constants $a,b$ then $_{x c}$ is a pricing factor. On the other hand, given any pricing factor $_{x c}$ , we can find constants $a,b$ such that $\zeta=a+b^{\top}x$ is a candidate state-price defator (not necessarily strictly positive, alas).  

In a multi-period discrete-time framework we will say that a $K$ -dimensional adapted stochastic process ${\pmb x}=({\pmb x}_{t})$ is a conditional pricing factor, if there exist adapted stochastic processes $\alpha=\left(\alpha_{t}\right)$ and $\eta=\left(\eta_{t}\right)$ so that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}_{t}[R_{i,t+1}]=\alpha_{t}+\beta_{t}[R_{i,t+1},\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}]^{\top}\boldsymbol{\eta}_{t},\quad i=1,\dots,I,}\end{array}
$$  

for any $t=0,1,2,\ldots,T-1$ . Here, the conditional factor beta is defined as  

$$
\beta_{t}[R_{i,t+1},\pmb{x}_{t+1}]=(\mathrm{Var}_{t}[\pmb{x}_{t+1}])^{-1}\mathrm{Cov}_{t}[\pmb{x}_{t+1},R_{i,t+1}].
$$  

If a conditionally risk-free asset exists, then $\alpha_{t}=R_{t}^{f}$ implying that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}_{t}[R_{i,t+1}]=R_{t}^{f}+\beta_{t}[R_{i,t+1},\boldsymbol{x}_{t+1}]^{\top}\eta_{t},\quad i=1,\dots,I.}\end{array}
$$  

Suppose $_{x c}$ is a conditional pricing factor, and let $a=\left(a_{t}\right)$ be an adapted one-dimensional process and $\underline{{\underline{{A}}}}=(\underline{{\underline{{A}}}}_{t})$ be an adapted process whose values. $\underline{{\underline{{A}}}}_{t}$ are non-singular $K\times K$ matrices. Then. $\hat{\pmb x}$ defined by  

$$
\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{t+1}=a_{t}+\underline{{\underline{{A}}}}_{t}\mathbf{x}_{t+1}
$$  

will also be a conditional pricing factor.  

If $\zeta~=~\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$ is a state-price deflator process, the one-period analysis implies that the ratios. $\zeta_{t+1}/\zeta_{t}$ define a conditional pricing factor. Since $\zeta_{t+1}=0+\zeta_{t}(\zeta_{t+1}/\zeta_{t})$ is a transformation of the form (9.36), we see that any state-price deflator is a conditional pricing factor. As in the one-period case, we will have that if $\zeta_{t+1}=a_{t}+b_{t}^{\top}x_{t+1}$ is a state-price deflator for some adapted process. $_{\alpha}$ , then $_{x c}$ is a conditional pricing factor. And for any conditional pricing factor. $_{x c}$ , we can find adapted process $a=\left(a_{t}\right)$ and $\pmb{b}=(\pmb{b}_{t})$ so that $\zeta_{t+1}=a_{t}+b_{t}^{\top}x_{t+1}$ defines a candidate state-price deflator (not necessarily positive, however).  

We will say that a $K$ -dimensional adapted stochastic process $\pmb{x}=(\pmb{x}_{t})$ is an unconditional pricing factor, if there exist constants $\alpha$ and $\pmb{\eta}$ so that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}[R_{i,t+1}]=\alpha+\beta[R_{i,t+1},\mathbf{\boldsymbol{x}}_{t+1}]^{\top}\pmb{\eta},\quad i=1,\dots,I,}\end{array}
$$  

for any $t=0,1,2,\ldots,T-1$ . Here, the unconditional factor beta is defined as  

$$
\beta[R_{i,t+1},\pmb{x}_{t+1}]=(\mathrm{Var}[\pmb{x}_{t+1}])^{-1}\mathrm{Cov}[\pmb{x}_{t+1},R_{i,t+1}].
$$  

This is true if the state-price deflator can be written as $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{\zeta_{t+1}}{\zeta_{t}}=a+b^{\top}x_{t+1}}\end{array}$ for constants $a$ and $^{b}$ . Hence, an unconditional pricing factor is also a conditional pricing factor. The converse is not true.  

Testing factor models on actual data really requires an unconditional model since we need to replace expected returns by average returns, etc. To go from a conditional pricing factor model to an unconditional, we need to link the variation in the coefficients over time to some observable variables. Suppose for example that $\begin{array}{r}{\frac{\zeta_{t+1}}{\zeta_{t}}=a_{t}+b_{t}x_{t+1}}\end{array}$ is a state-price deflator so that $x=\left(x_{t}\right)$ is a conditional pricing factor, assumed to be one-dimensional for notational simplicity. If we can. write  

$$
a_{t}=A_{0}+A_{1}y_{t},\quad b_{t}=B_{0}+B_{1}y_{t}
$$  

for some observable adapted process $y=\left(y_{t}\right)$ , then  

$$
\frac{\zeta_{t+1}}{\zeta_{t}}=A_{0}+A_{1}y_{t}+B_{0}x_{t+1}+B_{1}y_{t}x_{t+1}
$$  

which defines a 3-dimensional unconditional pricing factor given by the vector $(y_{t},x_{t+1},y_{t}x_{t+1})^{\top}$  

Now let us turn to the continuous-time setting. By a $K$ -dimensional conditional pricing factor in a continuous-time model we mean an adapted $K$ -dimensional process $\pmb{x}=(\pmb{x}_{t})$ with the property that there exist some one-dimensional adapted process $\alpha=\left(\alpha_{t}\right)$ and some $K$ -dimensional adapted process $\eta=\left(\eta_{t}\right)$ such that for any asset $i$ (or trading strategy), the expected rate of return per time period satisfies  

$$
\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}=\alpha_{t}+(\beta_{t}^{i x})^{\top}\eta_{t},
$$  

where again $\beta_{t}^{i x}$ is the factor-beta of asset $i$ at time $t$ . To understand the factor-beta write the price dynamics of risky assets in the usual form  

$$
d P_{i t}=P_{i t}\left[\mu_{i t}d t+\sigma_{i t}^{\top}d z_{t}\right].
$$  

and the dynamics of $_{\mathbf{\nabla}}\mathbf{\phi}_{\mathbf{\phi}}$ as  

$$
d\mathbf{x}_{t}=\mu_{x t}d t+\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}d z_{t},
$$  

where $\pmb{\mu}_{x}$ is an adapted process valued in $\mathbb{R}^{K}$ and $\underline{{\underline{{O}}}}.x$ is an adapted process with values being $K\times d$ matrices. Then the factor-beta is defined as  

$$
\beta_{t}^{i x}=\left(\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}\pm\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}.
$$  

If a "bank account' is traded, it then follows that $\alpha_{t}=r_{t}^{f}$ . In the following we will assume that this is the case.  

Factors are closely linked to market prices of risk and hence to risk-neutral measures and stateprice deflators.If $\pmb{x}=(\pmb{x}_{t})$ is a factor in an expected return-beta relation, then we can define a. market price of risk as (note that it is. $d$ -dimensional)  

$$
\lambda_{t}=\underline{{\sigma}}_{x t}^{\top}\left(\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}{x t}\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\eta_{t},
$$  

since we then have  

$$
\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}=\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\underline{{\sigma}}_{x t}^{\top}\left(\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}_{x t}^{\top}\right)^{-1}\eta_{t}=\left(\beta_{t}^{i x}\right)^{\top}\eta_{t}=\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}.
$$  

Conversely, let $\lambda=\left(\lambda_{t}\right)$ be any market price of risk and let $\zeta=\left(\zeta_{t}\right)$ be the associated state-price.   
deflator so that.  

$$
d\zeta_{t}=-\zeta_{t}\left(r_{t}^{f}d t+\lambda_{t}^{\top}d z_{t}\right).
$$  

Then we can use $\zeta$ as a one-dimensional factor in an expected return-beta relation. Since this corresponds to a factor "sensitivity" vector $-\zeta_{t}\lambda_{t}$ replacing the matrix $\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}x t$ , the relevant 'beta" is  

$$
\beta_{t}^{i\zeta}=\frac{-\zeta_{t}\pm\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}{\zeta_{t}^{2}\lambda_{t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}=-\frac{1}{\zeta_{t}}\frac{\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}{\lambda_{t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}.
$$  

We can use $\eta_{t}=-\zeta_{t}\lambda_{t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}$ , since then  

$$
\beta_{t}^{i\zeta}\eta_{t}=-\frac{1}{\zeta_{t}}\frac{\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}{\lambda_{t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}}\left(-\zeta_{t}\lambda_{t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}\right)=\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\lambda_{t}=\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}
$$  

for any asset $i$ .We can even use $a_{t}+b_{t}\zeta_{t}$ as a factor for any sufficiently well-behaved adapted processes $a=\left(a_{t}\right)$ and $b=\left(b_{t}\right)$  

If we use. $\zeta^{*}$ as the factor, the relevant $\eta$ is $\eta_{t}=-\zeta_{t}^{*}\left(\lambda_{t}^{*}\right)^{\top}\lambda_{t}^{*}=-\zeta_{t}^{*}\|\lambda_{t}^{*}\|^{2}$ . From (4.51), we see that $\|\lambda_{t}^{*}\|^{2}$ is exactly the excess expected rate of return of the growth-optimal strategy, we which can also write as $\mu_{t}^{*}-r_{t}^{f}$ . Hence, we can write the excess expected rate of return on any asset (or. trading strategy) as  

$$
\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}=\beta_{t}^{i\zeta^{*}}\left(-\zeta_{t}^{*}[\mu_{t}^{*}-r_{t}^{f}]\right)=\frac{\sigma_{i t}^{\tau}\lambda_{t}^{*}}{(\lambda_{t}^{*})^{\top}\lambda_{t}^{*}}[\mu_{t}^{*}-r_{t}^{f}]\equiv\beta_{t}^{i\lambda^{*}}[\mu_{t}^{*}-r_{t}^{f}].
$$  

Whether we want to use a discrete-time or a continuous-time model, the key question is what. factors to include in order to get prices or returns that are consistent with the data. Due to the link between state-price deflators and (marginal utility of) consumption, we should look for factors among variables that may affect (marginal utility of) consumption..
