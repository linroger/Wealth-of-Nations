# 9.1 Introduction  

The lack of reliable consumption data discussed in Section 8.6 complicates tests and applications of the consumption-based models. As mentioned above, most tests that have been carried out find it problematic to match the (simple) consumption-based model and historical return and consumption data (of poor quality). This motivates a search for models linking returns to other factors than consumption.  

The classical CAPM is the Mother of all factor models. It links expected excess returns (on. Stocks) to the return on the market portfolio (of stocks). It was originally developed in a oneperiod framework but can be generalized to multi-period settings. The model is based on rather unrealistic assumptions and the empirical success of the CAPM is modest..  

Many, many papers have tried to identify factor models that perform better, mostly by adding extra factors. However, this should only be done with extreme care. In a given data set of historical returns it is always possible to find a return that works as a pricing factor, as already indicated in Chapter 4. In fact, any ex-post mean-variance efficient return will work. On the other hand, there is generally no reason to believe that the same return will work as a pricing factor in the future. Factors should be justified by economic arguments or even a theoretical asset pricing model.  

It is worth emphasizing that the general theoretical results of the consumption-based asset pricing framework are not challenged by factor models. The problem with the consumption-based models is the implementation. Factor models do not invalidate the consumption-based asset pricing framework but are special cases that may be easier to apply and test. Therefore factors should generally help explain typical individuals' marginal utilities of consumption.  

Section 9.2 reviews the classical one-period CAPM and how it fits into the modern consumptionbased asset pricing framework. Section 9.3 defines and studies pricing factors in the one-period setting. In particular, pricing factors are linked to state-price deflators. The relation between mean-variance efficient returns and pricing factors is the topic of Section 9.4. Multi-period pricing factors are introduced in Section 9.5 with a discussion of the distinction between conditional and unconditional pricing factors. Section 9.6 offers a brief introduction to empirical studies of factor models. Finally, Section 9.7 discusses how pricing factors can be derived theoretically. It also derives an intertemporal version of the CAPM.
