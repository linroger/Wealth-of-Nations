# 9.7 Theoretical factors  

Factor models can be obtained through the general consumption-based asset pricing model by relating optimal consumption to various factors. As discussed in Section 6.5 the optimal consumption plan of an individual with time-additive expected utility must satisfy the so-called envelope condition  

$$
u^{\prime}(c_{t})=J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t).
$$  

Here $J$ is the indirect utility function of the individual, i.e. the maximum obtainable expected utility of future consumption. $W_{t}$ is the financial wealth of the investor at time $t$ $x_{t}$ is the time $t$ value of a variable that captures the variations in investment opportunities (captured by the riskfree interest rate, expected returns and volatilities on risky assets, and correlations between risky assets) and investor-specific variables (e.g. labor income). For notational simplicity, $x$ is assumed to be one-dimensional, but this could be generalized.  

In a continuous-time framework write the dynamics of wealth compactly as  

$$
d W_{t}=W_{t}\left[\mu_{W t}d t+\pmb{\sigma}_{W t}^{\top}d z_{t}\right]
$$  

and assume that the state variable $x$ follows a diffusion process.  

$$
d x_{t}=\mu_{x t}d t+\sigma_{x t}^{\top}d z_{t},\qquad\mu_{x t}=\mu_{x}(x_{t},t),\quad\sigma_{x t}=\sigma_{x}(x_{t},t).
$$  

From (8.16) it follows that the state-price deflator derived from this individual can be written as  

$$
\zeta_{t}=e^{-\delta t}\frac{J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}{J_{W}(W_{0},x_{0},0)}.
$$  

An application of Ito's Lemma yields a new expression for the dynamics of $\zeta$ , which again can be compared with (4.41). It follows from this comparison that.  

$$
\lambda_{t}=\left(\frac{-W_{t}J_{W W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}{J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}\right)\sigma_{W t}+\left(\frac{-J_{W x}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}{J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}\right)\sigma_{x t},
$$  

is a market price of risk. Consequently, the expected excess rate of return on asset $i$ can be written  

$$
\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}=\left(\frac{-W_{t}J_{W W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}{J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}\right)\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\sigma_{W t}+\left(\frac{-J_{W x}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}{J_{W}(W_{t},x_{t},t)}\right)\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\sigma_{x t},
$$  

which can be rewritten as  

$$
\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}=\beta_{i W t}\eta_{W t}+\beta_{i x t}\eta_{x t},
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{i W t}=\frac{\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\sigma_{W t}}{\|\sigma_{W t}\|^{2}},\quad\beta_{i x t}=\frac{\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\sigma_{x t}}{\|\sigma_{x t}\|^{2}},\quad}\ {\eta_{W t}=\|\sigma_{W t}\|^{2}\left(\frac{-W_{t}J_{W W}\left(W_{t},x_{t},t\right)}{J_{W}\left(W_{t},x_{t},t\right)}\right),\quad\eta_{x t}=\|\sigma_{x t}\|^{2}\left(\frac{-J_{W x}\left(W_{t},x_{t},t\right)}{J_{W}\left(W_{t},x_{t},t\right)}\right).}\end{array}
$$  

We now have a continuous-time version of (9.35) with the wealth of the individual and the state variable as the factors.If it takes. $m$ state variables to describe the variations in investment. opportunities, labor income, etc., we get an. $(m+1)$ -factor model.  

If the individual is taken to be a representative individual, her wealth will be identical to the. aggregate value of all assets in the economy, including all traded financial assets and non-traded. asset such as human capital. This is like the market portfolio in the traditional static CAPM. The first term on the right-hand side of (9.42) is then the product of the relative risk aversion of the representative individual (derived from her indirect utility) and the covariance between the rate of return on asset $i$ and the rate of return on the market portfolio. In the special case where the. indirect utility is a function of wealth and time only, the last term on the right-hand side will be zero, and we get the well-known relation.  

$$
\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}-r_{t}^{f}=\beta_{i W t}\left(\mu_{W t}+\delta_{W t}-r_{t}^{f}\right),
$$  

where $\beta_{i W t}$ is the "market-beta' of asset. $i$ . This is a continuous-time version of the traditional. static CAPM. This is only true under the strong assumption that individuals do not care about. variations in investment opportunities, income, etc. In general we have to add factors describing the future investment opportunities, future labor income, etc. This extension of the CAPM is called the Intertemporal CAPM and was first derived by Merton (1973b)..  

Only few empirical studies of factor models refer to Merton's Intertemporal CAPM when motivating the choice of factors. Brennan, Wang, and Xia (2004) set up a simple model with the short-term real interest rate and the slope of the capital market line as the factors since these variables capture the investment opportunities. In an empirical test, this model performs as well as the Fama-French model, which is encouraging for the development of theoretically well-founded and empirically viable factor models.
