# 12.2 Forwards and futures  

# 12.2.1 General results on forward prices and futures prices  

A forward with maturity date $T$ and delivery price $K$ provides a dividend of $P_{T}-K$ at time $T$ where $P$ is the underlying variable, typically the price of an asset or a specific interest rate. If you plan to buy a unit of an asset at time $T$ , you can lock in the effective purchase price with a forward on that asset. Conversely, if you plan to sell a unit of an asset, you can lock in the effective selling price by taking a short position in a forward on the asset, which will give a terminal dividend of $K-P_{T}$ . Of course, forwards can also be used for speculation. If you believe in high values of $P_{T}$ you can take a long position in a forward. If you believe in low values of $P_{T}$ , you can take a short position in a forward.  

In terms of a risk-neutral probability measure $\mathbb{Q}$ , the time $t$ value of such a future payoff can be. written as  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{V_{t}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}\left(P_{T}-K\right)\right]}\ &{\quad=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]-K\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}\right]}\ &{\quad=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]-K B_{t}^{T},}\end{array}
$$  

where $B_{t}^{T}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\Psi}[(R_{t,T}^{f})^{-1}]$ is the price of the zero-coupon bond maturing at time $T$ with a unit. payment. Here $R_{t,T}^{f}$ is the gross return between time $t$ and $T$ on the bank account, i.e. a roll-over in short risk-free investments, cf. the discussion in Section 11.3.  

For forwards contracted upon at time $t$ , the delivery price $K$ is typically set so that the value of. the forward at time $t$ is zero. This value of. $K$ is called the forward price at time $t$ (for the delivery date $T$ ) and is denoted by $F_{t}^{\prime I^{\prime}}$ . We define the terminal forward price to be $F_{T}^{T}=P_{T}$ , the only  

reasonable price for immediate delivery. Solving the equation $V_{t}=0$ , we get that the forward price. is given by  

$$
F_{t}^{T}=\frac{\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]}{B_{t}^{T}}.
$$  

If the underlying variable is the price of a traded asset with no payments in the period $[t,T]$ , we have  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]=P_{t},}\end{array}
$$  

so that the forward price can be written as $F_{t}^{\prime I^{\prime}}=P_{t}/B_{t}^{\prime I^{\prime}}$ . Applying a well-known property of.   
covariances, we have that.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]=\mathrm{Cov}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1},P_{T}\right]+\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}\right]\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}[P_{T}]}\ &{\qquad=\mathrm{Cov}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1},P_{T}\right]+B_{t}^{T}\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}[P_{T}]}\end{array}
$$  

and therefore  

$$
F_{t}^{T}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}[P_{T}]+\frac{\operatorname{Cov}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1},P_{T}\right]}{B_{t}^{T}}.
$$  

We can also characterize the forward price in terms of the forward measure for maturity $T$ . The forward price process for contracts with delivery date. $T$ is a $\mathbb{Q}^{T}$ -martingale. This is clear from the following considerations. With $B_{t}^{T^{\prime}}$ as the numeraire, we have that the forward price. $F_{t}^{\prime I^{\prime}}$ is set so that  

$$
\frac{0}{B_{t}^{T}}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}^{T}}\left[\frac{P_{T}-F_{t}^{T}}{B_{T}^{T}}\right]
$$  

and hence  

$$
{\boldsymbol{F}}_{t}^{T}={\mathrm{E}}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}^{T}}[P_{T}]={\mathrm{E}}_{t}^{Q^{T}}[F_{T}^{T}],
$$  

which implies that the forward price $F_{t}^{T}$ is a $\mathbb{Q}^{T}$ - martingale.  

We summarize our findings in the following theorem.  

Theorem 12.1 The forward price for delivery at time $T$ is given by  

$$
F_{t}^{T}=\frac{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}P_{T}\right]}{\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{T}}=\boldsymbol{\mathrm{E}}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}^{T}}[P_{T}].
$$  

If the underlying variable is the price of a traded asset with no payments in the period $\lfloor t,T\rfloor$ , the forward price can be written as  

$$
F_{t}^{T}=\frac{P_{t}}{B_{t}^{T}}.
$$  

Note that when (12.3) holds, the forward price of an asset follows immediately from the spot price of the asset and the price of the zero-coupon bond maturing at the delivery date. No model for the price dynamics of the underlying asset is needed. This is because the forward is perfectly replicated by a portfolio of one unit of the underlying asset and a short position in $K$ zero-coupon bonds maturing at the delivery date of the forward.  

Consider now a futures contract with final settlement at time. $T$ . The marking-to-market at a. given date involves the payment of the change in the so-called futures price of the contract relative to the previous settlement date.Let $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ be the futures price at time $t$ .The futures price at the settlement time is by definition equal to the price of the underlying security, $\Phi_{T}^{I^{\prime}}=P_{T}$ .At maturity of the contract the futures thus gives a payoff equal to the difference between the price of the underlying asset at that date and the futures price at the previous settlement date. After the last settlement before maturity, the futures is therefore indistinguishable from the corresponding forward contract, so the values of the futures and the forward at that settlement date must be identical. At the next-to-last settlement date before maturity, the futures price is set to that value that ensures that the net present value of the upcoming settlement at the last settlement date before maturity (which depends on this futures price) and the final payoff is equal to zero. Similarly at earlier settlement dates. We assume that the futures is marked-to-market at every trading date considered in the model. In the discrete-time framework, the dividend from the futures at time $t+1$ is therefore $\Phi_{t+1}^{T}-\Phi_{t}^{T}$ . In a continuous-time setting, the dividend over any infinitesimal interval $[t,t+d t]$ is $d\Phi_{t}^{T}$ . The following theorem characterizes the futures price:  

Theorem 12.2 The futures price. $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ is a martingale under the risk-neutral probability measure $\mathbb{Q}$ In particular,  

$$
\Phi_{t}^{T}=\operatorname{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[P_{T}\right].
$$  

Proof: We give a proof in the discrete-time framework, a proof originally due to Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1981b). Then the continuous-time version of the result follows by taking a limit. For a proof based on the same idea but formulated directly in continuous time, see Duffie and Stanton (1992).  

Consider a discrete-time setting in which positions can be changed and the futures contracts marked-to-market at times $t,t+\Delta t,t+2\Delta t,...,t+N\Delta t\equiv T$ . Let $R_{t}^{f}$ denote the risk-free gross retun between t and t + At and let R,+nst = R R+4t  R+(n-1)st: The idea is to set up a self-financing strategy that requires an initial investment at time $t$ equal to the futures price $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ . Hence, at time. $t$ $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ is invested in the bank account. In addition, $R_{t}^{f}$ futures contracts are acquired (at a price of zero).  

At time $t+\Delta t$ , the deposit at the bank account has grown to $R_{t}^{f}\Phi_{t}^{T}$ . The marking-to-market of. the futures position yields a payoff of $R_{t}^{f}\left(\Phi_{t+\Delta t}^{T}-\Phi_{t}^{T}\right)$ , which is deposited at the bank account,. so that the balance of the ccount becomes $R_{t}^{f}\Phi_{t+\Delta t}^{T}$ . The position in futuesi ncresed (at no extra costs) toa total of $R_{t}^{f}R_{t+\Delta t}^{f}=R_{t,t+2\Delta t}^{f}$ contracts.  

At time $t+2\Delta t$ , the deposit has grown to. $R_{t,t+2\Delta t}^{f}\Phi_{t+\Delta t}^{T}$ , which together with the marking-tomarket payment ofd $R_{t,t+2\Delta t}^{f}\left(\Phi_{t+2\Delta t}^{T}-\Phi_{t+\Delta t}^{T}\right)$ gives a total ofd $R_{t,t+2\Delta t}^{f}\Phi_{t+2\Delta t}^{T}$  

Continuing this way, the balance of the bank account at time $T=t+N\Delta t$ will be  

$$
R_{t,t+N\Delta t}^{f}\Phi_{t+N\Delta t}^{T}=R_{t,T}^{f}\Phi_{T}^{T}=R_{t,T}^{f}P_{T}.
$$  

This is true for any value of $\Delta t$ and $\Delta t=1$ covers our standard discrete-time framework and $\Delta t\rightarrow0$ gives the continuous-time limit.  

So a self-financing trading strategy with an initial time $t$ investment of. $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ will give a dividend of $R_{t,T}^{f}P_{T}$ at time $T$ . On the other hand, we can value the time $T$ dividend by multiplying by $(R_{t,T}^{f})^{-1}$ and taking the risk-neutral expectation. Hence,  

$$
\boldsymbol{\Phi}_{t}^{T}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1}R_{t,T}^{f}P_{T}\right]=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}[P_{T}],
$$  

as was to be shown.  

Note that in order to compute the futures price of an asset we generally have to model the dynamics of the underlying spot price..  

Comparing (12.4) with (11.12), we see that we can think of the futures price as the price of a traded asset with a continuous dividend given by the product of the current price and the shortterm interest rate.  

From (12.1) and (12.4) we get that the difference between the forward price $F_{t}^{T}$ and the futures price $\Phi_{t}^{T}$ is given by  

$$
F_{t}^{T}-\Phi_{t}^{T}=\frac{\mathrm{Cov}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\left(R_{t,T}^{f}\right)^{-1},P_{T}\right]}{B_{t}^{T}}.
$$  

The forward price and the futures price will only be identical if the two random variables $P_{T}$ and $(R_{t,T}^{f})^{-1}$ are uncorrelated under the risk-neutral probability measure. In particular, this is true if. the short-term risk-free rate is constant or deterministic..  

The forward price is larger [smaller] than the futures price if the variables $(R_{t,T}^{f})^{-1}$ and $P_{T}$ are positively [negatively] correlated under the risk-neutral probability measure. An intuitive,. heuristic argument for this goes as follows. If the forward price and the futures price are identical,. the total undiscounted payments from the futures contract will be equal to the terminal payment. of the forward. Suppose the interest rate and the spot price of the underlying asset are positively. correlated, which ought to be the case whenever. $(R_{t,T}^{f})^{-1}$ and $P_{T}$ are negatively correlated. Then the marking-to-market payments of the futures tend to be positive when the interest rate is high. and negative when the interest rate is low. So positive payments can be reinvested at a high interest rate, whereas negative payments can be financed at a low interest rate. With such a correlation, the futures contract is clearly more attractive than a forward contract when the futures price and the forward price are identical. To maintain a zero initial value of both contracts, the futures price. has to be larger than the forward price. Conversely, if the sign of the correlation is reversed..  

If the underlying asset has a constant or deterministic volatility and pays no dividends before time $T$ , we can write the risk-neutral price dynamics as.  

$$
d P_{t}=P_{t}\left[r_{t}d t+\sigma(t)d z_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\right],
$$  

where $z^{\mathbb{Q}}=(z_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}})$ is a standard Brownian motion under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{Q}$ . If, furthermore, the short-term risk-free rate is constant or follows a Gaussian process as for example in the Vasicek model introduced in Section 10.5.1, the future values of $P_{T}$ will be lognormally distributed under the risk-neutral measure. In that case, the futures price can be stated in closed form. In. Exercise 12.6 you are asked to compute and compare the forward price and the futures price on a. zero-coupon bond under the assumptions of the Vasicek model of interest rate dynamics introduced. in Section 10.5.1.  

# 12.2.2 Interest rates forwards and futures  

Forward interest rates are rates for a future period relative to the time where the rate is set. Many. participants in the financial markets may on occasion be interested in \*locking in' an interest rate. for a future period, either in order to hedge risk involved with varying interest rates or to speculate in specific changes in interest rates. In the money markets the agents can lock in an interest rate by entering a forward rate agreement (FRA). Suppose the relevant future period is the time interval between $T$ and $S$ , where $S>T$ .In principle, a forward rate agreement with a face value $H$ and a contract rate of $K$ involves two payments: a payment of. $-H$ at time $T$ and a payment of $H[1+(S-T)K]$ at time $S$ . (Of course, the payments to the other part of the agreement are $H$ at time $T$ and $-H[1+(S-T)K]$ at time $S$ .) In practice, the contract is typically settled at time $T$ so that the two payments are replaced by a single payment of $B_{T}^{S}H[1+(S-T)K]-H$ at time $T$ Usually the contract rate $K$ is set so that the present value of the future payment(s) is zero at the time the contract is made. Suppose the contract is made at time $t<T$ . Then the time. $t$ value of the two future payments of the contract is equal to $-H B_{t}^{I^{\prime}}+H[1+(S-T)K]B_{t}^{S}$ . This is zero. if and only if.  

$$
K=\frac{1}{S-T}\left(\frac{B_{t}^{T}}{B_{t}^{S}}-1\right)=L_{t}^{T,S},
$$  

cf. (10.6), i.e. when the contract rate equals the forward rate prevailing at time $t$ for the period bet ween $T$ and $S$ . For this contract rate, we can think of the forward rate agreement having a single payment at time $T$ , which is given by.  

$$
B_{T}^{S}H[1+(S-T)K]-H=H\left(\frac{1+(S-T)L_{t}^{T,S}}{1+(S-T)l_{T}^{S}}-1\right)=\frac{(S-T)(L_{t}^{T,S}-l_{T}^{S})H}{1+(S-T)l_{T}^{S}}.
$$  

The numerator is exactly the interest lost by lending out. $H$ from time $T$ to time $S$ at the forward rate given by the FRA rather than the realized spot rate. Of course, this amount may be negative, so that a gain is realized. The division by. $1+(S-T)l_{T}^{S}$ corresponds to discounting the gain/loss from time $S$ back to time $T$  

Interest rate futures trade with a very high volume at several international exchanges, e.g. CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), LIFFE (London International Financial Futures $\&$ Options Exchange), and MATIF (Marche a Terme International de France). The CME interest rate futures involve the three-month Eurodollar deposit rate and are called Eurodollar futures. The interest rate involved in the futures contracts traded at LIFFE and MATIF is the three-month LIBOR rate on the Euro currency. We shall simply refer to all these contracts as Eurodollar futures and refer to the underlying interest rate as the three-month LIBOR rate, whose value at time. $t$ we denote by lt+0.25  

The price quotation of Eurodollar futures is a bit complicated since the amounts paid in the marking-to-market settlements are not exactly the changes in the quoted futures price. We must therefore distinguish between the quoted futures price, $\ddot{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}$ , and the actual futures price, $\mathcal{E}_{t}^{T}$ , with the settlements being equal to changes in the actual futures price. At the maturity date of the contract, $T$ , the quoted Eurodollar futures price is defined in terms of the prevailing three-month LIBOR rate according to the relation  

$$
\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{T}^{T}=100\left(1-l_{T}^{T+0.25}\right),
$$  

which using (10.5) on page 246 can be rewritten as  

$$
\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{T}^{T}=100\left(1-4\left(\frac{1}{B_{T}^{T+0.25}}-1\right)\right)=500-400\frac{1}{B_{T}^{T+0.25}}.
$$  

Traders and analysts typically transform the Eurodollar futures price to an interest rate, the socalled LIBOR futures rate, which we denote by. $\varphi_{t}^{T}$ and define by  

$$
\varphi_{t}^{T}=1-\frac{\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}}{100}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}=100\left(1-\varphi_{t}^{T}\right).
$$  

It follows from (12.7) that the LIBOR futures rate converges to the three-month LIBOR spot rate, as the maturity of the futures contract approaches.  

The actual Eurodollar futures price is given by  

$$
\mathcal{E}_{t}^{T}=100-0.25\big(100-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}\big)=\frac{1}{4}\left(300+\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}\right)=100-25\varphi_{t}^{T}
$$  

per 100 dollars of nominal value. It is the change in the actual futures price which is exchanged. in the marking-to-market settlements. At the CME the nominal value of the Eurodollar futures is 1 million dollars. A quoted futures price of. $\dot{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}=94.47\$ corresponds to a LIBOR futures rate of $5.53\%$ and an actual futures price of  

$$
{\frac{1000000}{100}}\cdot[100-25\cdot0.0553]=986175.
$$  

If the quoted futures price increases to 94.48 the next day, corresponding to a drop in the LIBOR futures rate of one basis point (0.01 percentage points), the actual futures price becomes.  

$$
{\frac{1000000}{100}}\cdot[100-25\cdot0.0552]=986200.
$$  

An investor with a long position will therefore receive $986200-986175=25$ dollars at the settlement at the end of that day..  

If we simply sum up the individual settlements without discounting them to the terminal date, the total gain on a long position in a Eurodollar futures contract from $t$ to expiration at $T$ is given by  

$$
\mathcal{E}_{T}^{T}-\mathcal{E}_{t}^{T}=\left(100-25\varphi_{T}^{T}\right)-\left(100-25\varphi_{t}^{T}\right)=-25\left(\varphi_{T}^{T}-\varphi_{t}^{T}\right)
$$  

per 100 dollars of nominal value, i.e. the total gain on a contract with nominal value $H$ is equal to $-0.25\left(\varphi_{T}^{T}-\varphi_{t}^{T}\right)H$ . The gain will be positive if the three-month spot rate at expiration turns. out to be below the futures rate when the position was taken. Conversely for a short position. The gain/loss on a Eurodollar futures contract is closely related to the gain/loss on a forward rate agreement, as can be seen from substituting. $S=T+0.25$ into (12.6). Recall that the rates $\varphi_{T}^{T}$ and $l_{T}^{T+0.25}$ are identical. However, it should be emphasized that in general the futures rate $\varphi_{t}^{T}$ and the forward rate $L_{t}^{T,T+0.25}$ will be different due to the marking-to-market of the futures contract.  

The final settlement is based on the terminal actual futures price  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{E}_{T}^{T}\equiv100-0.25\left(100-\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{T}^{T}\right)}}\ {{\mathrm{~}=100-0.25\left(400\left[(B_{T}^{T+0.25})^{-1}-1\right]\right)}}\ {{\mathrm{~}=100\left[2-(B_{T}^{T+0.25})^{-1}\right].}}\end{array}
$$  

It follows from Theorem 12.2 that the actual futures price at any earlier point in time $t$ can be computed as  

$$
\mathcal{E}_{t}^{T}=\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[\mathcal{E}_{T}^{T}\right]=100\left(2-\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[(B_{T}^{T+0.25})^{-1}\right]\right).
$$  

The quoted futures price is therefore  

$$
\tilde{\mathcal{E}}_{t}^{T}=4\mathcal{E}_{t}^{T}-300=500-400\mathrm{E}_{t}^{\mathbb{Q}}\left[(B_{T}^{T+0.25})^{-1}\right].
$$  

In several models of interest rate dynamics and bond prices, including the Vasicek and CoxIngersoll-Ross models introduced in Chapter 10, the expectation in (12.8) can be computed in closed form; see, e.g., Munk (2005).
