# 12.1 Introduction  

A derivative is an asset whose dividend(s) and price are derived from the price of another asset, the. underlying asset, or the value of some other variable. The main types of derivatives are forwards, futures, options, and swaps. While a large number of different derivatives are traded in today's financial markets, most of them are variations of these four main types..  

A forward is the simplest derivative. A forward contract is an agreement between two parties. on a given transaction at a given future point in time and at a price that is already fixed when the agreement is made. For example, a forward on a bond is a contract where the parties agree to. trade a given bond at a future point in time for a price which is already fixed today. This fixed price is usually set so that the value of the contract at the time of inception is equal to zero so. that no money changes hand before the delivery date. Forward contracts are not traded or listed at financial exchanges but traded in quite organized over-the-counter (OTC) markets dominated. by large financial institutions. For example, forwards on foreign exchange are quite common..  

As a forward contract, a futures contract is an agreement upon a specified future transaction,. e.g. a trade of a given security. The special feature of a future is that changes in its value are settled continuously throughout the life of the contract (usually once every trading day). This so-called marking-to-market ensures that the value of the contract (i.e. the value of the payments still to come) is zero immediately following a settlement. This procedure makes it practically possible to trade futures at organized exchanges, since there is no need to keep track of when the futures position was originally taken. Futures on many different assets or variables are traded at different exchanges around the world, including futures on stocks, bonds, interest rates, foreign exchange,. oil, metals, frozen concentrate orange juice, live cattle, and the temperature in Las Vegas!.  

An option gives the holder the right to make some specified future transaction at terms that are already fixed. A call option gives the holder the right to buy a given security at a given price at or before a given date. Conversely, a put option gives the holder the right to sell a given security. If the option gives the right to make the transaction at only one given date, the option is said to be European-style. If the right can be exercised at any point in time up to some given date, the option is said to be American-style. Both European- and American-style options are traded. Options on stocks, bonds, foreign exchange, and many other assets, commodities, and variables are traded at many exchanges around the world and also on the OTC-markets. Also options on futures on some asset or variable are traded, i.e. a derivative on a derivative! In addition, many financial assets or contracts have "embedded' options. For example, many mortgage-backed bonds and corporate bonds are callable, in the sense that the issuer has the right to buy back the bond at a pre-specified price.

A swap is an exchange of two dividend streams between two parties. In a "plain vanilla" interest rate swap, two parties exchange a stream of fixed interest rate payments and a stream of Hoating interest rate payments. In a currency swap, streams of payments in different currencies are exchanged. Many exotic swaps with special features are widely used.  

The markets for derivatives are of an enormous size. Table 12.1 provides some interesting. statistics published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) on the size of derivatives. markets at organized exchanges. The markets for interest rate derivatives are much larger than. the markets for currency- or equity-linked derivatives. The option markets generally dominate. futures markets measured by the amounts outstanding but ranked according to turnover futures markets are larger than options markets..  

The BIS statistics also contain information about the size of OTC markets for derivatives. BIS estimates that in June 2004 the total amount outstanding on OTC derivative markets was 220,058 billions of US dollars, of which single-currency interest rate derivatives account for 164,626 billions, currency derivatives account for 26,997 billions, equity-linked derivatives for 4,521 billions, commodity contracts for 1,270 billions, while the remaining 22,644 billions cannot be split into any. of these categories, cf. Table 19 in BIS (2004). Table 12.2 shows how the interest rate derivatives. market can be disaggregated according to instrument and maturity. Approximately 38% of these. OTC-traded interest rate derivatives are denominated in Euro, 35% in US dollars, 13% in yen, and. 7% in pound sterling, cf. Table 21B in BIS (2004)..  

This chapter gives an introduction to frequently traded derivatives and their valuation. We will specify the payments of these derivatives, discuss the links between different derivatives, and we will also indicate what we can conclude about their prices from general asset pricing theory.

Throughout the chapter we assume that prices are arbitrage-free and that a bank account and zero-coupon bonds of relevant maturities are traded so that we can define and work with the riskneutral probability measures and forward measures introduced in Chapter 11. We will denote the continuously compounded risk-free short-term interest rate by. $r_{t}$ instead of $\boldsymbol{r}_{t}^{f}$  

Section 12.2 deals with forwards and futures, Section 12.3 with options, and Section 12.4 with. swaps and swaptions. Some features of American-style derivatives are discussed in Section 12.5.
