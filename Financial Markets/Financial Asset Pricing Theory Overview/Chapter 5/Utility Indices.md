# 5.3 Utility indices  

A utility index for a given preference relation $\succeq$ is a function $\mathcal{U}:\mathcal{P}(Z)\to\mathbb{R}$ that to each probability distribution over consumption levels attaches a real-valued number such that  

$$
\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\mathbb{U}(\pi_{1})\geq\mathbb{U}(\pi_{2}).
$$  

Note that a utility index is only unique up to a strictly increasing transformation. If $\mathrm{\mathcal{U}}$ is a utility index and $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is any strictly increasing function, then the composite function $\mathcal{V}=f\circ\mathcal{U}$ defined by $\mathcal{V}(\pi)=f\left(\mathcal{U}(\pi)\right)$ , is also a utility index for the same preference relation.  

We will show below that a utility index exists under the following two axiomatic assumptions on the preference relation $\succeq$  

Axiom 5.1 (Monotonicity) Suppose that $\pi_{1},\pi_{2}\in\mathcal{P}(Z)$ with $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}$ and let $a,b\in[0,1]$ .The preference relation $\succeq$ has the property that.  

$$
a>b\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad a\pi_{1}+(1-a)\pi_{2}\succ b\pi_{1}+(1-b)\pi_{2}.
$$  

This is certainly a very natural assumption on preferences. If you consider a weighted average of two probability distributions, you will prefer a high weight on the best of the two distributions.  

Axiom 5.2 (Archimedean) The preference relation $\succeq$ has the property that for any three probability distributions $\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\pi_{3}\in\mathcal{P}(Z)$ with $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}\succ\pi_{3}$ , numbers $a,b\in(0,1)$ exist such that  

$$
a\pi_{1}+(1-a)\pi_{3}\succ\pi_{2}\succ b\pi_{1}+(1-b)\pi_{3}.
$$  

The axiom basically says that no matter how good a probability distribution $\pi_{1}$ is, it is so that for any $\pi_{2}\succ\pi_{3}$ we can find some mixed distribution of $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{3}$ to which $\pi_{2}$ is preferred. We just have to put a sufficiently low weight on $\pi_{1}$ in the mixed distribution. Similarly, no matter how bad a probability distribution $\pi_{3}$ is, it is so that for any $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}$ we can find some mixed distribution of $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\prime}/{\mathfrak{I}}_{1}$ and $\pi_{3}$ that is preferred to $\pi_{2}$ . We just have to put a sufficiently low weight on $\pi_{3}$ in the mixed distribution.  

We shall say that a preference relation has the continuity property if for any three probability distributions $\pi_{1},\pi_{2},\pi_{3}\in\mathcal{P}(Z)$ with $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}\succ\pi_{3}$ , a unique number $\alpha\in(0,1)$ exists such that  

$$
\pi_{2}\sim\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}.
$$  

We can easily extend this to the case where either $\pi_{1}\sim\pi_{2}$ or $\pi_{2}\sim\pi_{3}$ . For $\pi_{1}\sim\pi_{2}\succ\pi_{3}$ $\pi_{2}\sim1\pi_{1}+(1-1)\pi_{3}$ corresponding to $\alpha=1$ . For $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}\sim\pi_{3}$ $\pi_{2}\sim0\pi_{1}+(1-0)\pi_{3}$ corresponding to $\alpha=0$ . In words the continuity property means that for any three probability distributions there is a unique combination of the best and the worst distribution so that the individual is indifferent between the third "middle' distribution and this combination of the other two. This appears to be closely related to the Archimedean Axiom and, in fact, the next lemma shows that the Monotonicity Axiom and the Archimedean Axiom imply continuity of preferences.  

Lemma 5.1 $L e t\succeq b e$ a preference relation satisfying the Monotonicity Axiom and the Archimedean Axiom. Then it has the continuity property.  

Proof: Given $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}\succ\pi_{3}$ . Define the number $\alpha$ by  

$$
\alpha=\operatorname*{sup}\{k\in[0,1]\mid\pi_{2}\succ k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}\}.
$$  

By the Monotonicity Axiom we have that $\pi_{2}\succ k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}$ for all $k<\alpha$ and that $k\pi_{1}+$ $(1-k)\pi_{3}\succeq\pi_{2}$ for all $k>\alpha$ .We want to show that. $\pi_{2}\sim\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}$ . Note that by the.  

Archimedean Axiom, there is some $k>0$ such that $\pi_{2}\succ k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}$ and some $k<1$ such that $k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}\succ\pi_{2}$ . Consequently, $\alpha$ is in the open interval $(0,1)$  

Suppose that $\pi_{2}\succ\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}$ . Then according to the Archimedean Axiom we can find a number $b\in(0,1)$ such that $\pi_{2}\succ b\pi_{1}+(1-b)\{\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}\}$ . The mixed distribution on. the right-hand side has a total weight of. $k=b+(1-b)\alpha=\alpha+(1-\alpha)b>\alpha$ on $\pi_{1}$ . Hence we have found some. $k>\alpha$ for which $\pi_{2}\succ k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}$ . This contradicts the definition of $\alpha$ Consequently, we must have that. $\pi_{2}\not\vdash\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}$  

Now suppose that $\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}\succ\pi_{2}$ . Then we know from the Archimedean Axiom that a number $a\in(0,1)$ exists such that $a\{\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}\}+(1-a)\pi_{3}\succ\pi_{2}$ . The mixed distribution on the left-hand side has a total weight of $a\alpha<\alpha$ on $\pi_{1}$ . Hence we have found some $k<\alpha$ for which $k\pi_{1}+(1-k)\pi_{3}\succ\pi_{2}$ . This contradicts the definition of. $\alpha$ . We can therefore also conclude. that $\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}\not\vdash\pi_{2}$ . In sum, we have $\pi_{2}\sim\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{3}$  

The next result states that a preference relation which satisfies the Monotonicity Axiom and has the continuity property can always be represented by a utility index. In particular this is true when $\succeq$ satisfies the Monotonicity Axiom and the Archimedean Axiom.  

Theorem 5.1 $L e t\succeq b e$ a preference relation which satisfies the Monotonicity Axiom and has the continuity property. Then it can be represented by a utility index. $\mathrm{\mathcal{U}}$ , i.e. a function $\mathcal{U}:\mathcal{P}(Z)\to\mathbb{R}$ with the property that.  

$$
\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad\mathcal{U}(\pi_{1})\succeq\mathcal{U}(\pi_{2}).
$$  

Proof: Recall that we have assumed a best probability distribution $\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}$ and a worst probability distribution $\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}$ in the sense that  

$$
\succ{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{l}}\mathrm{or}{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{u}}\sim\pi\succ{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{l}}\mathrm{or}{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{u}}\succ\pi\sim{\mathbf{1}}_{z}
$$  

for any $\pi\in{\mathcal{P}}(Z)$ . For any $\pi\in{\mathcal{P}}(Z)$ we know from the continuity property that a unique number $\alpha_{\pi}\in[0,1]$ exists such that  

$$
\boldsymbol{\pi}\sim\alpha_{\pi}\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}+(1-\alpha_{\pi})\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}.
$$  

If ${\mathbf{1}}_{z^{u}}\sim\pi\succ{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{l}}$ $\alpha_{\pi}=1$ . If ${\mathbf{1}}_{z^{u}}\succ\pi\sim{\mathbf{1}}_{z^{l}}$ $\alpha_{\pi}=0$ . If $\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}\succ\pi\succ\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}$ $\alpha_{\pi}\in(0,1)$  

We define the function $\mathcal{U}:\mathcal{P}(Z)\to\mathbb{R}$ by $\mathcal{U}(\pi)=\alpha_{\pi}$ . By the Monotonicity Axiom we know that $\mathcal{U}(\pi_{1})\geq\\\\\mathcal{U}(\pi_{2})$ if and only if  

$$
\mathcal{U}(\pi_{1})\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}+\left(1-\mathcal{U}(\pi_{1})\right)\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}\succeq\mathcal{U}(\pi_{2})\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}+\left(1-\mathcal{U}(\pi_{2})\right)\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}},
$$  

and hence if and only if $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}$ . It follows that. $\mathrm{\mathcal{U}}$ is a utility index..
