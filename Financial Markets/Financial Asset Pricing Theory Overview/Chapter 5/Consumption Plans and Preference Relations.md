# 5.2 Consumption plans and preference relations  

It seems fair to assume that whenever the individual compares two different consumption plans, she will be able either to say that she prefers one of them to the other or to say that she is indifferent between the two consumption plans. Moreover, she should make such pairwise comparisons in a consistent way. For example, if she prefers plan 1 to plan 2 and plan 2 to plan 3, she should prefer plan 1 to plan 3. If these properties hold, we can formally represent the preferences of the individual by a so-called preference relation. A preference relation itself is not very tractable so we are looking for simpler ways of representing preferences. First, we will find conditions under which it makes sense to represent preferences by a so-called utility index which attaches a real number to each consumption plan. If and only if plan 1 has a higher utility index than plan 2, the individual prefers plan 1 to plan 2. Attaching numbers to each possible consumption plan is also not. easy so we look for an even simpler representation. We show that under an additional condition we can represent preferences in an even simpler way in terms of the expected value of a utility function. A utility function is a function defined on the set of possible levels of consumption. Since. consumption is random it then makes sense to talk about the expected utility of a consumption plan. The individual will prefer consumption plan 1 to plan 2 if and only if the expected utility from consumption plan 1 is higher than the expected utility from consumption plan 2. This representation of preferences turns out to be very tractable and is applied in the vast majority of asset pricing models.  

Our main analysis is formulated under some simplifying assumptions that are not necessarily. appropriate. At the end of this section we will briefly discuss how to generalize the analysis and. also discuss the appropriateness of the axioms on individual behavior that need to be imposed in order to obtain the expected utility representation.  

We assume that there is uncertainty about how the variables affecting the well-being of an individual (e.g. asset returns) turn out. We model the uncertainty by a probability space $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}\right)$ In most of the chapter we will assume that the state space is finite,. $\Omega=\{1,2,\dots,S\}$ , so that there are $S$ possible states of which exactly one will be realized. For simplicity, think of this as a model of a one-period economy with. $S$ possible states at the end of the period. The set. $\mathcal{F}$ of events that can be assigned a probability is the collection of all subsets of. $\Omega$ . The probability measure. $\mathbb{P}$ is defined by the individual state probabilities $p_{\omega}=\mathbb{P}(\omega)$ $\omega=1,2,\ldots,S$ . We assume that all. $p_{\omega}>0$ and, of course, we have that. $p_{1}+\ldots p_{S}=1$ . We take the state probabilities as exogenously given. and known to the individuals.  

Individuals care about their consumption. It seems reasonable to assume that when an individual chooses between two different actions (e.g. portfolio choices), she only cares about the consumption. plans generated by these choices. For example, she will be indifferent between two choices that generate exactly the same consumption plans, i.e. the same consumption levels in all states. In. order to simplify the following analysis, we will assume a bit more, namely that the individual. only cares about the probability distribution of consumption generated by each portfolio. This is effectively an assumption of state-independent preferences..

We can represent a consumption plan by a random variable. $c$ on $\left(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}\right)$ .We assume that there is only one consumption good and since consumption should be non-negative,. $c$ is valued in $\mathbb{R}_{+}=[0,\infty)$ . As long as we are assuming a finite state space. $\Omega=\{1,2,\dots,S\}$ we can equivalently represent the consumption plan by a vector $\left(c_{1},\dots,c_{S}\right)$ , where $c_{\omega}\in[0,\infty)$ denotes the consumption level if state $\omega$ is realized, i.e. $c_{\omega}\equiv c(\omega)$ . Let $\mathrm{\textregistered}$ denote the set of consumption plans that the individual has to choose among. Let $Z\subseteq\mathbb{R}_{+}$ denote the set of all the possible levels of the consumption plans that are considered, i.e. no matter which of these consumption plans we take, its value will be in $Z$ no matter which state is realized. Each consumption plan. $c\in\mathcal{C}$ is associated with a probability distribution $\pi_{c}$ , which is the function $\pi_{c}:Z\to[0,1]$ , given by  

$$
\pi_{c}(z)=\sum_{\omega\in\Omega:c_{\omega}=z}p_{\omega},
$$  

i.e. the sum of the probabilities of those states in which the consumption level equals $z$  

As an example consider an economy with three possible states and four possible state-contingent consumption plans as illustrated in Table 5.1. These four consumption plans may be the prod-. uct of four different portfolio choices. The set of possible end-of-period consumption levels is $Z=\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ . Each consumption plan generates a probability distribution on the set. $Z$ . Thee probability distributions corresponding to these consumption plans are as shown in Table 5.2. We see that although the consumption plans $c^{(3)}$ and $c^{(4)}$ are different they generate identical probability distributions. By assumption individuals will be indifferent between these two consumption plans.  

Given these assumptions the individual will effectively choose between probability distributions on the set of possible consumption levels $Z$ . We assume for simplicity that $Z$ is a finite set, but the. results can be generalized to the case of infinite $Z$ at the cost of further mathematical complexity. We denote by $\mathcal{P}(Z)$ the set of all probability distributions on $Z$ that are generated by consumption plans in $\mathrm{\textregistered}$ . A probability distribution $\pi$ on the finite set. $Z$ is simply a function. $\pi:Z\to\lfloor0,1\rfloor$ with the properties thate $\textstyle\sum_{z\in Z}\pi(z)=1$ and $\pi(A\cup B)=\pi(A)+\pi(B)$ whenever $A\cap B=\emptyset$  

We assume that the preferences of the individual can be represented by a preference relation $\succeq$ on $\mathcal{P}(Z)$ , which is a binary relation satisfying the following two conditions:  

(i) if $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}$ and $\pi_{2}\succeq\pi_{3}$ , then $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{3}$ [transitivity] (ii) $\forall\pi_{1},\pi_{2}\in\operatorname{\mathcal{P}}(Z):{\mathrm{either~}}\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}{\mathrm{~or~}}\pi_{2}\succeq\pi_{1}[{\mathrm{com}}_{\operatorname{P}}$ letene  

Here, $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}$ is to be read as " $\pi_{1}$ is preferred to $\pi{_2}^{\gamma}$ .We write $\pi_{1}\nsimeq\pi_{2}$ if $\pi_{1}$ is not preferred to $\pi_{2}$ . If both $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}$ and $\pi_{2}\succeq\pi_{1}$ , we write $\pi_{1}\sim\pi_{2}$ and say that the individual is indifferent between $\pi_{1}$ and $\pi_{2}$ . If $\pi_{1}\succeq\pi_{2}$ , but $\pi_{2}\not\subset\pi_{1}$ , we say that $\pi_{1}$ is strictly preferred to $\pi_{2}$ and write $\pi_{1}\succ\pi_{2}$  

Note that if. $\pi_{1},\pi_{2}\in\mathcal{P}(Z)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$ , then. $\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{2}\in\mathcal{P}(Z)$ . The mixed distribution $\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{2}$ assigns the probability $\left(\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{2}\right)(z)=\alpha\pi_{1}(z)+(1-\alpha)\pi_{2}(z) $ to the consumption level $z$ . When can think of the mixed distribution $\alpha\pi_{1}+(1-\alpha)\pi_{2}$ as the outcome of a two-stage "gamble." The first stage is to flip a coin which with probability $\alpha$ shows head and with probability $1-\alpha$ shows tails. If head comes out, the second stage is the "consumption gamble" corresponding to the probability distribution $\pi_{1}$ .If tails is the outcome of the first stage, the second stage is the consumption gamble corresponding to $\pi_{2}$ . When we assume that preferences are represented by a preference relation on the set $\mathcal{P}(Z)$ of probability distributions, we have implicitly assumed that the individual evaluates the two-stage gamble (or any multi-stage gamble) by the combined probability distribution, i.e. the ultimate consequences of the gamble. This is sometimes referred to as consequentialism.  

Let $z$ be some element of. $Z$ , i.e. some possible consumption level. By $\mathbf{1}_{z}$ we will denote the. probability distribution that assigns a probability of one to $z$ and a zero probability to all other elements in $Z$ . Since we have assumed that the set $Z$ of possible consumption levels only has a finite number of elements, it must have a maximum element, say $z^{u}$ , and a minimum element, say $z^{l}$ . Since the elements represent consumption levels, it is certainly natural that individuals prefer higher elements than lower. We will therefore assume that the probability distribution $\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}$ is preferred to any other probability distribution. Conversely, any probability distribution is preferred to the probability distribution $\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}$ .We assume that $\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}$ is strictly preferred to. $\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}$ so that the individual is not indifferent between all probability distributions. For any $\pi\in{\mathcal{P}}(Z)$ we thus have that,.  

$$
\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}\succ\pi\succ\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}\mathrm{or}\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}\sim\pi\succ\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}\mathrm{or}\mathbf{1}_{z^{u}}\succ\pi\sim\mathbf{1}_{z^{l}}.
$$
