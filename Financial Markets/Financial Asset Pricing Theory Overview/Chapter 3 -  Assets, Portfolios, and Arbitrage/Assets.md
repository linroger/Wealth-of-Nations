# 3.2 Assets  

An asset is characterized by its dividends and its price. We will always assume that the dividends of the basic assets are non-negative and that there is a positive probability of a positive dividend. at the terminal date of the model. Then we can safely assume (since equilibrium prices will be arbitrage-free; see precise definition below) that the prices of the basic assets are always positive. We assume without loss of generality that assets pay no dividends at time 0. The price of an asset. at a given point in time is exclusive any dividend payment at that time, i.e. prices are ex-dividend. At the last point in time considered in the model, all assets must have a zero price. We assume throughout that $I$ basic assets are traded.  

# 3.2.1 The one-period framework  

In a one-period model any asset $i$ is characterized by its time 0 price $P_{i}$ and its time 1 dividend. $D_{i}$ which is a random variable. If the realized state is. $\omega\in\Omega$ , asset $i$ will give a dividend of. $D_{i}(\omega)$ . We can gather all the prices in the. $I$ -dimensional vector $P=(P_{1},\dots,P_{I})^{\intercal}$ and all the dividends in the $I$ -dimensional random variable $D=(D_{1},\ldots,D_{I})^{\top}$ . We assume that all variances of dividends. and all pairwise covariances of dividends are finite.  

Instead of prices and dividends, we will often focus on returns. Returns can be defined in different ways. The net return on an investment over a period is simply the end-of-period outcome generated by the initial investment subtracted by the initial investment. In a one-period. framework the net return on asset $i$ is $D_{i}-P_{i}$ . The net rate of return is the net return relative to. the investment made, i.e. the net rate of return on asset. $i$ is $r_{i}=(D_{i}-P_{i})/P_{i}$ . The gross rate of return on asset $i$ is defined as. $R_{i}=D_{i}/P_{i}=1+r_{i}$ , the ratio of the uncertain dividend to the price.. The log-return or continuously compounded rate of return is defined as. $\ln R_{i}=\ln(D_{i}/P_{i})$  

Note that since the end-of-period dividend is a random variable, any of these returns will also be a random variable. In a one-period model an asset is said to be risk-free if it pays the same dividend in all states so that return (with any of the above definitions) will be non-random, i.e. known at the beginning of the period. We will write the risk-free gross return as $R^{f}$  

We can stack the returns on the different assets into vectors. For example, the gross rate of return vector is $\pmb{R}=\left(R_{1},\ldots,R_{I}\right)^{\top}$ . Defining the $I\times I$ matrix  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{diag}(P)=\left(\begin{array}{c c c c}{P_{1}}&{0}&{\dots}&{0}\ {0}&{P_{2}}&{\dots}&{0}\ {\vdots}&{\vdots}&{\ddots}&{\vdots}\ {0}&{0}&{\dots}&{P_{I}}\end{array}\right),}\end{array}
$$  

we can write the link between the dividend vector and the gross rate of return vector as  

$$
R=\left[\mathrm{diag}(P)\right]^{-1}D\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad D=\mathrm{diag}(P)R.
$$  

Given our assumptions about dividends, all the gross returns will have finite variances and all the pairwise covariances of gross returns will also be finite..  

Note that given the expected dividend of asset $i$ $\operatorname{E}[D_{i}]$ , finding the expected return $\operatorname{E}[R_{i}]$ is equivalent to finding the price $P_{i}$ . We can therefore study equilibrium expected returns instead of equilibrium prices and many asset pricing models are typically formulated in terms of expected returns (as for example the classical CAPM).  

# 3.2.2 The discrete-time framework  

In a discrete-time model with $\mathcal{T}=\{0,1,2,\ldots,T\}$ , we allow for dividends at all dates except time $0$ so that the dividends of an asset are represented by an adapted, non-negative stochastic process $D_{i}=(D_{i t})_{t\in\ensuremath{\mathbb{T}}}$ with initial value $D_{i0}=0$ . The random variable. $D_{i t}$ represents the dividend. payment of asset $i$ at time $t$ . We are interested in prices at all dates. $t\in\mathcal{T}$ and let $P_{i}=(P_{i t})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ denote the price process of asset. $i$ . By our assumptions,. $P_{i T}=0$ in all states. We assume that no. matter what the information at time $T-1$ is, for any asset there will be a positive (conditional) probability that the terminal dividend is positive. We collect the prices and dividend processes of the $I$ assets in. $I$ -dimensional processes $\pmb{P}=(\pmb{P}_{t})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ and $D=(D_{t})_{t\in\mathcal{T}}$ with $P_{t}=(P_{1t},\ldots,P_{I t})^{\top}$ and similarly for. $D_{t}$  

The gross rate of return on asset. $i$ between two adjacent points in time, say. $t$ and time $t+1$ is defined as $R_{i,t+1}=(P_{i,t+1}+D_{i,t+1})/P_{i t}$ , the net rate of return is. $r_{i,t+1}=R_{i,t+1}-1$ , and the log-return is $\ln R_{i,t+1}$ . Note that now the relation between the expected gross rate of return $\mathrm{E}_{t}[R_{i,t+1}]$ and the beginning-of-period price. $P_{i t}$ involves both the expected dividend. $\mathrm{E}_{t}[D_{i,t+1}]$ and the expected future price. $\operatorname{E}_{t}[P_{i,t+1}]$ . Therefore we cannot easily switch between statements about expected returns and statements about prices. We will consider both formulations of asset pricing models and the link between them in later chapters.  

We can also define returns over longer holding periods. Now, we could define the gross rate of return on asset $i$ between time $t$ and time $t+n$ as $R_{i,t,t+n}=(P_{i,t+n}+D_{i,t+1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+D_{i,t+n})/P_{i t}$ but, unless the intermediate dividends $D_{i,t+1},\ldots,D_{i,t+n-1}$ are all zero, we will add values at different dates without any discounting. This is typically not very useful. More appropriately, we can compute the return if intermediate dividends are reinvested in the asset. Assume we buy one unit of asset $i$ at time $t$ .For the dividend of. $D_{i,t+1}$ received at time $t+1$ , one can buy $D_{i,t+1}/P_{i,t+1}$ extra units of the asset so that the total holdings is. $A_{t+1}\equiv1+D_{i,t+1}/P_{i,t+1}$ units. The total dividend received at time. $t+2$ is then $(1+D_{i,t+1}/P_{i,t+1})D_{i,t+2}$ , which will buy you. $(1+D_{i,t+1}/P_{i,t+1})D_{i,t+2}/P_{i,t+2}$ additional units of the asset, bringing the total up to.  

$$
A_{t+2}\equiv1+\frac{D_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t+1}}+\left(1+\frac{D_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t+1}}\right)\frac{D_{i,t+2}}{P_{i,t+2}}=\left(1+\frac{D_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t+1}}\right)\left(1+\frac{D_{i,t+2}}{P_{i,t+2}}\right)
$$  

units. Continuing like this we end up with  

$$
A_{t+n}\equiv\prod_{m=1}^{n}\left(1+{\frac{D_{i,t+m}}{P_{i,t+m}}}\right)=\left(1+{\frac{D_{i,t+1}}{P_{i,t+1}}}\right)\cdot\cdot\cdot\left(1+{\frac{D_{i,t+n}}{P_{i,t+n}}}\right)
$$  

units at time $t+n$ . The gross rate of return on asset $i$ between time $t$ and time $t+n$ is therefore  

$$
R_{i,t,t+n}=\frac{A_{t+n}P_{i,t+n}}{P_{i t}}=\frac{P_{i,t+n}}{P_{i t}}\prod_{m=1}^{n}\left(1+\frac{D_{i,t+m}}{P_{i,t+m}}\right).
$$  

Again, we can define the corresponding net rate of return or log-return.  

In the discrete-time framework an asset is said to be risk-free if the dividend at any time $t=$ $1,\ldots,T$ is already known at time $t-1$ , no matter what information is available at time $t-1$ The risk-free gross return between time $t$ and $t+1$ is denoted by $R_{t}^{f}$ so that the subscript indicate the point in time at which the return will be known to investors, not the point in time at which the return is realized. Before time $t$ , the risk-free return $R_{t}^{f}$ for the period beginning at $t$ is not necessarily known. Risk-free rates fluctuate over time so they are only risk-free in the short run. If you roll-over in one-period risk-free investments from time $t$ to $t+n$ , the total gross rate of return will be  

$$
R_{t,t+n}^{f}=\prod_{m=0}^{n-1}R_{t+m}^{f}.
$$  

Note that this return is risky seen at, or before, time $t$ . An asset that provides a risk-free return from time $t$ to time $t+n$ is a default-free, zero-coupon bond maturing at time $t+n$ . If it has a face value of 1 and its time $t$ price is denoted by $B_{t}^{t+n}$ , you will get a gross rate of return of $1/B_{t}^{t+n}$  

# 3.2.3 The continuous-time framework  

In a continuous-time model over the time span. $\mathcal{T}=[0,T]$ , the price of an asset $i$ is represented by. an adapted stochastic process $P_{i}=(P_{i t})_{t\in[0,T]}$ . In practice, no assets pay dividends continuously. However, for computational purposes it is sometimes useful to approximate a stream of frequent dividend payments by a continuous-time dividend process. On the other hand, a reasonable model should also allow for assets paying lump-sum dividends. We could capture both through a process $\mathcal{D}_{i}=(\mathcal{D}_{i t})_{t\in[0,T]}$ where $\mathcal{D}_{i t}$ is the (undiscounted) sum of all dividends of asset. $i$ up to and including. time $t$ . The total dividend received in a small interval. $[t,t{+}d t]$ would then be. $d\mathcal{D}_{i t}$ and the dividends. yield would be $d\mathrm{{\mathcal{D}}}_{i t}/{P_{i t}}$ . A lump-sum dividend at time. $t$ would correspond to a jump in. $\mathcal{D}_{i t}$ . For notational simplicity we assume that only at time. $T$ the basic assets of the economy will pay a lump-sum dividend. The terminal dividend of asset. $i$ is modeled by a random variable. $D_{i T}$ assumed non-negative with a positive probability of a positive value. Up to time $T$ , dividends are paid out continuously. In general, the dividend yield can then be captured by a specification like $d\mathrm{{D}}_{i t}/P_{i t}=\delta_{i t}d t+\nu_{i t}d z_{i t}$ for some one- or multi-dimensional standard Brownian motion $z_{i}$ but for simplicity we assume that there is no uncertainty about the dividend yield over the next instant, i.e. $\nu_{i t}=0$ . To sum up, the dividends of asset. $i$ are represented by a dividend yield process $\delta_{i}=(\delta_{i t})_{t\in[0,T]}$ and a terminal lump-sum dividend $D_{i}$  

Next consider returns. If we buy one unit of asset $i$ at time $t$ and keep reinvesting the continuous dividends by purchasing extra (fractions of) units of the assets, how many units will we end up with at time $t^{\prime}>t$ ? First divide the interval $[t,t^{\prime}]$ into many bits of length $\Delta t$ so that dividends are cashed in and additional units bought at times $t+\Delta t,t+2\Delta t,\ldots$ We can then proceed as in the discrete-time case discussed above. Let $A_{t+n\Delta t}$ denote the number of units of the asset we will have immediately after time $t+n\Delta t$ .We start with $A_{t}\:=\:1$ unit. At $t+\Delta t$ we receive a dividend of $\delta_{i t}P_{i,t+\Delta t}\Delta t$ which we spend on buying $\delta_{i t}\Delta t$ extra assets, bringing our holdings up to $A_{t+\Delta t}=1+\delta_{i t}\Delta t$ . At time $t+2\Delta t$ we receive a total dividend of $A_{t+\Delta t}\delta_{i,t+\Delta t}P_{i,t+2\Delta t}\Delta t$ which will buy us $A_{t+\Delta t}\delta_{i,t+\Delta t}\Delta t$ extra units. Our total is now $A_{t+2\Delta t}=A_{t+\Delta t}+A_{t+\Delta t}\delta_{i,t+\Delta t}\Delta t$ Continuing like this we will find for any $s=t+n\Delta t$ for some integer $n<N$ , our total holdings immediately after time $s+\Delta t$ is given by $A_{s+\Delta t}=A_{s}+A_{s}\delta_{i s}\Delta t$ so that  

$$
\frac{A_{s+\Delta t}-A_{s}}{\Delta t}=\delta_{i s}A_{s}.
$$  

If we go to the continuous-time limit and let $\Delta t\rightarrow0$ , the left-hand side will approach the derivative $A_{s}^{\prime}$ and we see that. $A_{s}$ must satisfy the differential equation $A_{s}^{\prime}~=~\delta_{i s}A_{s}$ as well as the initial. condition $A_{t}=1$ . The solution is.  

$$
A_{s}=\exp\left\{\int_{t}^{s}\delta_{i u}d u\right\}.
$$  

So investing one unit in asset $i$ at time $t$ and continuously reinvesting the dividends, we will end up with $\begin{array}{r}{A_{t^{\prime}}=\exp\{\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\delta_{i u}d u\}}\end{array}$ units of the asset at time $t^{\prime}$ . The gross rate of return on asset $i$ over the interval $[t,t^{\prime}]$ is therefore $\begin{array}{r}{R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}=\exp\{\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\delta_{i u}d u\}P_{i,t^{\prime}}/P_{i t}}\end{array}$  

The net rate of return per time period is $r_{i,t,t^{\prime}}=(R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}-1)/(t^{\prime}-t)$ . Informally letting $t^{\prime}\to t$ we get the instantaneous net rate of return per time period  

$$
r_{i t}=\frac{1}{d t}\frac{d P_{i t}}{P_{i t}}+\delta_{i t}.
$$  

The first term on the right-hand side is the instantaneous percentage capital gain (still unknown at time $t$ ), the second term is the dividend yield (assumed to be known at time. $t$  

We will typically write the dynamics of the price of an asset $i$ as  

$$
d P_{i t}=P_{i t}\left[\mu_{i t}d t+\sigma_{i t}^{\top}d z_{t}\right],
$$  

where $z=\left(z_{t}\right)$ is a standard Brownian motion of dimension. $d$ representing shocks to the prices, $\mu_{i t}$ is then the expected capital gain so that the total expected net rate of return per time period is $\mu_{i t}+\delta_{i t}$ , while $\sigma_{i t}$ is the vector of sensitivities of the price with respect to the exogenous. shocks. The volatility is the standard deviation of instantaneous relative price changes, which is $\begin{array}{r}{\|\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}\|=\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}\sigma_{i j t}^{2}\right)^{1/2}}\end{array}$ . Using Ito's Lemma exactly as in Section 2.6.7, one finds that  

$$
P_{i,t^{\prime}}=P_{i t}\exp\left\{\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\left(\mu_{i u}-\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma_{i u}\|^{2}\right)d u+\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\sigma_{i u}^{\top}d z_{u}\right\}.
$$  

Therefore, the gross rate of return on asset $i$ between $t$ and $t^{\prime}$ is  

$$
R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}=\exp\left\{\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\delta_{i u}d u\right\}\frac{P_{i,t^{\prime}}}{P_{i t}}=\exp\left\{\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\left(\delta_{i u}+\mu_{i u}-\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma_{i u}\|^{2}\right)d u+\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\sigma_{i u}^{\top}d z_{u}\right\}.
$$  

For a short period, i.e. with $t^{\prime}=t+\Delta t$ for $\Delta t$ small, we have  

$$
R_{i,t,t+\Delta t}\approx\exp\left\{\left(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t}-\frac{1}{2}\|\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}\|^{2}\right)\Delta t+\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}^{\top}\Delta\boldsymbol{z}_{t}\right\},
$$  

where $\Delta z_{t}~=~z_{t+\Delta t}-z_{t}$ is $d$ -dimensional and normally distributed with mean vector $\mathbf{0}$ and variance-covariance matrix $\underline{{\underline{{I}}}}\cdot\Delta t$ (here $\underline{{\underline{{I}}}}$ is the $d\times d$ identity matrix). The gross rate of return is thus approximately lognormally distributed with mean  

$$
\mathrm{E}_{t}\left[R_{i,t,t+\Delta t}\right]\approx\exp\left\{\left(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t}-\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma_{i t}\|^{2}\right)\Delta t\right\}\mathrm{E}_{t}\left[\exp\left\{\sigma_{i t}^{\top}\Delta z_{t}\right\}\right]=e^{(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t})\Delta t},
$$  

cf. Appendix B.  

The log-return is  

$$
\ln R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}=\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\left(\delta_{i u}+\mu_{i u}-\frac{1}{2}\|\pmb{\sigma}_{i u}\|^{2}\right)d u+\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\pmb{\sigma}_{i u}^{\top}d z_{u}
$$  

with mean and variance given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\quad\mathrm{E}_{t}[\ln R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}]=\displaystyle\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\left(\delta_{i u}+\mu_{i u}-\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma_{i u}\|^{2}\right)d u\approx\left(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t}-\frac{1}{2}\|\sigma_{i t}\|^{2}\right)\Delta t,}\ &{\mathrm{Var}_{t}[\ln R_{i,t,t^{\prime}}]=\displaystyle\int_{t}^{t^{\prime}}\mathrm{E}_{t}\left[\|\sigma_{i u}\|^{2}\right]d u\approx\|\sigma_{i t}\|^{2}\Delta t,}\end{array}
$$  

according to Theorem 2.2, and the approximations are useful for a short time period $t^{\prime}-t=\Delta t$ Note that the expected log return is (approximately) $\begin{array}{r}{\left(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t}-\frac{1}{2}\|\pmb{\sigma}_{i t}\|^{2}\right)\Delta t}\end{array}$ , whereas the log of the expected gross return is (approximately) $(\delta_{i t}+\mu_{i t})\Delta t$ . The difference is due to the concavity of the log function so that Jensen's Inequality implies that $\operatorname{E}[\ln X]\leq\ln\operatorname{E}[X]$ with equality only for the case of a deterministic $X$  

We can write the dynamics of all $I$ prices compactly as  

$$
d P_{t}=\mathrm{diag}(P_{t})\left[\mu_{t}d t+\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}{}_{t}d z_{t}\right],
$$  

where $\operatorname{diag}(\boldsymbol{P}_{t})$ is defined in (3.1), ${\pmb\mu}_{t}$ is the vector $(\mu_{1t},\ldots,\mu_{I t})^{\top}$ and $\underline{{\underline{{\sigma}}}}t$ is the $I\times d$ matrix whose $i$ 'th row is ${\pmb{\sigma}}_{i t}^{\top}$  

A risk-free asset is an asset where the rate of return over the next instant is always known. We can think of this as an asset with a constant price and a continuous dividend yield process $r^{f}=$ $(r_{t}^{f})_{t\in[0,T]}$ or as an asset with a zero continuous dividend yield and a price process accumulating t he interest rate payments, $\begin{array}{r}{P_{t}^{f}=\exp\left\{\int_{0}^{t}r_{s}^{f}d s\right\}}\end{array}$
