# 16.14 THE RELEVANCE OF THE SMILE  

The volatility smile is important in financial engineering for at least three reasons.  

First, if we associate a volatility smile with all the risk factors, and if this smile shifts randomly. over time, then we may be able to trade it, take spread positions, and arbitrage it. The smile dynamics, thus, imply new opportunities for a market professional..  

The second reason for the relevance of the volatility smile is that it may contain important information about the dynamics of the underlying realized volatility processes. With a volatility smile, pricing and hedging may become much more complicated, especially if the instrument has characteristics of an exotic option. Is volatility constant or a stochastic process? If the latter is the case, then what type of stochastic process is it? Are there jumps or is a process with Wiener-type increments a. sufficiently good approximation? These questions are important for risk management and pricing..  

Third, the creation of new products and synthetics must pay attention to the causes of the smile.. If the smile is the result of conventions and practices adopted by market professionals rather than. resulting from the underlying volatility processes, we must take these conventions into account. We now discuss these issues in more detail and provide some examples to the uses of the volatility smile.
