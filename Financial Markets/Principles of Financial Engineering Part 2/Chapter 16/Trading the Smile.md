# 16.15 TRADING THE SMILE  

The volatility smile is actively traded to a different extent in different sectors. The smile is an integral part of daily trading in the FX sector. Here, market practitioners routinely quote risk reversals, which relate to the symmetry in exchange rate volatility and butterflies related to the curvature of the smile. Traders trade and arbitrage these effects. The volatility smile is also traded in the equity sector. Traders arbitrage volatility across stock market indices, and in doing this, sometimes trade the smile indirectly. At other times, this trade is direct. The smile relating to a risk may be too steep and is expected to flatten. The trader then sells the deep out-of-the-money options and buys those that are closer to being ATM. In the interest rate sector, volatility smile is mainly traded due to its risk management and hedging implications for cap/floor positions and swaption books.  

Smiles can be of interest to investors who may want to take positions on the slope and the cur-. vature of the volatility smile, thinking that the market has under- or overemphasized one of the underlying parameters. In the following example, traders are putting together skew swaps that will. trade realized skews against implied skews..  

# EXAMPLE  

As the skew in volatility between out-of-the-money puts and calls on Standard & Poor's 500 index has.   
grown, street traders are looking to capture discrepancies between the realized and implied skews of the.   
options. One trader in New York noted interest in a skew swap on the S&P500 from hedge funds trading.   
volatility. The swaps-which traders believe would be a first-would offer the realized skew of puts and calls in return for the implied skew..  

Currently, the S&P skew is above 30-if strikes on puts and calls are moved by $I O\%$ the volatility would [increase by] $3\%$ explained one structurer. This compares with a level of 15 at the beginning of October, which is in line with the historical levels of 15-20.  

One structurer who had tried to put together a skew swap noted that there is no mathematical formula that can capture implied skews for any period of time. He also admitted to being stumped by hedging the product. "To hedge this, we would have to close every night with a vol swap on the deal and that can't. always be done," he said. A rival noted that one popular trade to capture flattening skews is selling out-ofthe-money puts and calls and buying ATM puts and calls..

One interesting point in this reading is that, at least in this particular case, the observed smile (skew) is characterized by multiplying a linear relationship with a slope of 3. According to the tra-. ders, if moneyness decreases by $10\%$ volatility increases by $3\%$ . Traders expect this relationship to be around 15 during normal times. Hence, the smile is expected to flatten..
