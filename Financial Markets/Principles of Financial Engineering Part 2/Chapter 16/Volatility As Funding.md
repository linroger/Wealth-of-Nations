# 16.2 VOLATILITY AS FUNDING  

For market professionals and hedge funds, the issue of how to fund an investment is as important. as the investment itself. After all, a hedge fund would look for the "best way"' to borrow funds to carry a position. The best way may sometimes carry a negative interest. In other words, the hedge. fund would make money from the investment and from the funding itself..  

The normal floating LIBOR funding one is accustomed to think about is \*risk-free,"2 but at the. same time may not always carry the lowest funding cost. In principle, volatility could be used as a funding source. A practitioner could for example go short volatility and long another asset such as. a fixed-income asset. To fund the position, why not select an appropriate volatility, sell options of. value $N_{-}$ and then delta hedge these option positions? In fact, this would fund the bond position with volatility. We analyze it below..  

First we know from Chapter 9 that delta-hedged short option positions are convex exposures that will pay the gamma. These payouts are unknown initially. As market volatility is observed, the hedge is dynamically adjusted, and depending on the market volatility the hedge fund will face a cash outflow equal to gamma. To the hedge fund this is similar to paying floating money market interest rates.  

Note one difference between loan cash flows and volatility cash flows. In volatility funding, there is no payback of the principal $N$ at the end of the contract. In this sense, $N$ is borrowed and then paid back gradually over time as gamma gains. One example is provided below from the year 2005.  

# EXAMPLE  

Merrill notes "one of the most overcrowded trades in the market has been to take advantage. of the long term trading range," by selling volatility and "earning carry via mortgage-backed securities."  

Market professionals use options as funding vehicles for their positions. The main problem with this is that in many cases option markets may not have the depth needed in order to sell large chunks of options. If such selling depresses prices (i.e., volatility), then this idea may be hard to implement no matter how attractive it looks at the outset..
