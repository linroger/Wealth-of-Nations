# 14.9 DIFFERENTIAL (QUANTO) SWAPS  

Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 133 and the International Accounting Standard (IAS) 39 set the accounting rules for derivatives for the United States and for European companies, respectively. According to these rules, a derivative position will have to be marked-to-market and included in income statements unless it qualifies for hedge accounting.35  

A quanto (differential) swap is a special type of cross-currency swap. It is an agreement where one party makes payments in, say, USD LIBOR and receives payments, say, in Euro LIBOR.. However, the important point is that both parties make payments in the same currency. In other words, the quanto swap value is an exposure on pure play of international interest rate differentials and has no foreign exchange risk.  

Quanto swap popularity depends on the relative shapes of the forward curves in the two under-. lying money markets. Quanto swaps become "cheap" if one of the two forward curves is lower at the short end and higher at the long end..  

# 14.9.1 BASIS SWAPS  

This discussion is limited to US dollar markets. The particular interest rates discussed below will change if other currencies are considered, since basis swaps are directly related to the business environment in an economy. A basis swap is a floating-floating interest rate swap in which cash flows based on one floating reference rate are exchanged against the cash flows based on a different floating reference rate.  

In a basis swap, one party will often pay USD LIBOR and will receive another money-market. rate. Most bank liabilities are in fact LIBOR based, but assets are not. A corporation that deals. mainly in the domestic US economy may be exposed to commercial paper (CP) rates; a bank may. be exposed to T-bill rates, and another to the prime rate. Basis swaps could then be used to protect the party with respect to changes in these different money market rates..  

The most common types of basis swaps are Fed Funds against LIBOR,36 T-bill rates against. LIBOR, CP rates against LIBOR, and the prime rate against LIBOR.37 Which basis swap a client. picks depends on his or her business. For example, a party that has concerns about credit squeezes can use Fed Funds-LIBOR basis swaps or the T-bill-LIBOR basis swaps. During a credit squeeze,. a flight to safety will make the basis swap spread increase. On the other hand, the Prime-LIBOR basis swap can hedge the exposures of those players involved in credit card, auto, or consumer. loans.
