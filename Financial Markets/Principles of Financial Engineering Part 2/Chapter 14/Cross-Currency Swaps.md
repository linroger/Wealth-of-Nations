# 14.8 CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS  

A cross-currency swap can serve different purposes. It can be used for hedging, that is to reduce the exposure to exchange rate changes. Alternatively, one can use it to exploit arbitrage opportunities between different rates.  

The following reading illustrates some of the recent issues related to cross-currency swaps.  

# EXAMPLE  

It has been a rollercoaster couple of years for the Australian cross-currency basis swap [...], which has ripsawed to unprecedented levels primarily as a result of large irregular capital dislocations during the global financial crisis. On October 10, 2008, a shortage of US dollars, coupled with major rehedging of Japanese. power reverse dual currency (PRDC) notes, caused the five-year AUD/USD cross-currency basis swap to drop to $-50$ basis points--quite a move for a swap that has traditionally traded in a fairly predictable range of. around six to 10 bp. Its 10-year equivalent suffered an equally volatile fate, hitting $-47$ bp on the same date. By September 2009, this situation had completely reversed. Kangaroo bond issuance had all but ground to a halt, while Australian banks--buoyed by AA credit ratings and government guarantees-were able to comfortably tap offshore markets to shore up their balance sheets. [...]  

These extreme levels of volatility have attracted the attention of a number of hedge funds. "The hedge. fund community has been active in the basis swap market for some time. By nature, it is a function of opportunity," says Anthony Robson, head of rates for Australian and New Zealand dollars at Barclays. Capital in Sydney.  

Those opportunities, he says, have occurred regularly in the past two years. "In 2008 and early 2009, the yield curve was steeply negative, which reflected the sheer illiquidity at that time, severe global funding. issues and bank hedging need to receive in the long-end around 30 years. For hedge funds looking for the basis swap to widen, that presented attractive opportunities to pay. For example, they could pay a five-year basis swap, starting in five years' time and pick up 60 bp, benefiting from the negative-shaped curve and the very rapid change in levels," he says, adding: "At the moment, and especially late last year, the basis swap is quite steeply positive, so there are certainly receivers of the forward basis spread.".  

Dealers say that since hitting its peak in late 2009, interest from hedge fund managers in the basis swap has noticeably picked up. Betting on the basis to trend back towards its historical average, they have put on a range of forward-starting basis swaps to extract value from the shape of the curve. "A fund manager could receive a five-year basis swap on a hold-to-maturity basis, yielding say, $+3I.5b p$ ," says Ian Martin, head of global rates for Australia and New Zealand at Deutsche Bank in Sydney, who says hedge funds have been particularly involved in two- to five-year maturities. "By hedging the first year's cash flows at $+5.5$ bp, the manager can create a forward-starting four-year swap at 39 bp. Assuming the swap tightens in line with its historical average, they would benefit from carry and capital appreciation as the trade rolls down the curve."  

Since the fourth quarter of 2009, following a surge in kangaroo issuance, the three- to seven-year basis swap tenors have come back in substantially from their late 2009 peaks, with the five-year AUD/UsD cross currency swap falling to $+32$ bp on February 17. Ten-year and longer tenors, however, have not fallen as  

sharply. That caused the inversion of the long-end of the basis to remain pronounced and has led Deutsche Bank to recommend a butterfly spread to take advantage of the inversion of the curve. "While the basis.   
swap spread slope has returned to fairly normal long-run levels, the five-year/10-year/15-year butterfly is.   
currently near the wides reached in February last year. We think this butterfly (receiving 10-year basis.   
against paying the five-year and 15-year) is one of the better trade opportunities in basis swap spreads at.   
present, and we recommend entering the trade," the bank wrote in a research note dated February 17..

As an example of the use of a cross-currency swap for hedging, consider a European company that intends to buy US dollar bonds and would like to hedge the US dollar exchange rate risk. The European company could buy a cross-currency swap from a US-based bank. As a result of the swap, the European company would pay in euros and receive a (fixed) US dollar cash flow. These US dollar cash flows from the swap could be used to buy the US dollar bond. The valuation of a cross-currency swap is similar to that of an interest-rate swap but one difference relates to the exchange of notional. A cross-currency swap has two principal amounts, one for each currency. The initial principals can be exchanged or not. The nonexchange of the initial amounts is a minor issue. But eliminating the exchange of the final amounts changes the pricing structure significantly. The exchange rate used to determine the principals is the prevailing spot rate.  

With an interest rate swap, there is no exchange of principal at either the start or end of the. transaction, as both principal amounts are the same and therefore net out. For a cross-currency. swap, it is essential that the parties agree to exchange principal amounts at maturity. The exchange of principal at the start is optional..  

Like all swaps, a cross-currency swap can be replicated using on-balance sheet instruments, in this. case with money market deposits or FRNs denominated in different currencies. This explains the necessity for principal exchanges at maturity as all loans and deposits also require repayment at maturity.33.  

The initial exchange can be replicated by the bank by entering into a spot exchange transaction at the same rate quoted in the cross-currency swap. Actually, all foreign exchange forwards can be described as cross-currency swaps as they are agreements to exchange two streams of cash flows in different currencies. Many banks manage long-term foreign exchange forwards as part of the crosscurrency swap business, given the similarities.  

Like FX forwards, the cross-currency swap exposes the user to foreign exchange risk. The swap leg the party agrees to pay is a liability in one currency, and the swap leg they have agreed to receive is an asset in the other currency. One of the users of cross-currency swaps are debt issuers. In the Eurobond markets, issuers sell bonds in the currency with the lowest cost and swap their exposure to the desired currency using a cross-currency swap.

At the inception of the swap, the present value of one leg must be equal to the present value of the other leg at the then-prevailing spot rate. Using this simple logic, it would seem natural that cash flows of LIBOR (flat) payments in one currency could be exchanged for cash flows of LIBOR (flat) payments in another currency.  

In reality this is not true, and there is a constant spread. By convention cross-currency swap spreads are quoted on the currency side against USD LIBOR: USD LIBOR versus Foreign Currency LIBOR plus a spread. The spread can be positive or negative. Before 2007 the EUR/USD crosscurrency swap spread was close to zero, but during the GFC it reached 120 bp. The reasons for the spread are twofold. First is the daily demand-supply imbalances that are always possible. There. may be more demand for paying a LIBOR in a particular currency and this will lead to a positive. (basis) spread to be paid. Consider US companies, for example, that issue a loan in euros. The companies will exchange principal and coupons payments in EUR for principal and coupons payments in USD. If the cross-currency basis is negative, the companies will have to pay LIBOR but will receive. Euribor minus the basis. Such corporate supply and hedging activity can be a potential driver crosscurrency swap basis. If the corporate issuance in EUR is high and most of it is swapped into USD, there could be a positive or spread to exchange EUR payments in USD payments. Such corporate activity, however, cannot explain the huge swings in the spread during the GFC.  

The second effect that leads to positive spreads is credit risk. Counterparties may not have the. same credit risk and the currency swap spread may then reflect this. For example, if one party is. paying the Philippine peso equivalent of the LIBOR rate against USD LIBOR, then this party is likely to have a higher credit risk. So the party will pay a higher spread. During the GFC, an excess demand of USD by non-US banks drove the EUR/USD cross-currency swap down dramatically in 2008. In 2011, US Money-Market funds withdrew funding to European banks which also led to a decline in the spread. These examples illustrate that the spread reflects the relative creditworthiness of banks across different countries.34  

# 14.8.2 CONVENTIONS  

The usual convention for quoting the currency swap spread, also called the basis, is to quote it relative to the USD LIBOR.
