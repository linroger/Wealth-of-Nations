# 20.1 INTRODUCTION  

Structured products consist of packaging basic assets such as stocks, bonds, and currencies together with some derivatives. The final product obtained this way will, depending on the product, (i) have an enhanced return or improved credit quality, (ii) lower costs of asset-liability management for corporates, (ii) build in the views held by the clients, and (iv) often be principal protected.'  

Households do not like to build their own cars, computers, or refrigerators themselves. They prefer to buy them from the producers who manufacture and assemble them. Every complex product has its own specialists, and it is more cost effective to buy products manufactured by these specialists. The same is true for financial products. Investors, corporates, and institutions need. solutions for problems that they face in their lives. The packaging solutions for investors' and insti-. tutions' needs are called structured products. "Manufacturers," i.e., the "structurers," put these together and sell them to clients. Clients consist of investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and individuals. Clients may have views on the near- or medium-term behavior of equity prices, interest rates, or commodities. Structured products can be designed so that such clients can. take positions according to their views in a convenient way.  

Industrial goods such as cell phones and cars are constantly updated and improved. Again, the same is true for structured products. The views, the needs, or simply the risk appetite of clients change and the structurer needs constantly to provide new structured products that fit these new views. This chapter discusses the way financial engineering can be used to service retail clients' particular needs.  

Financial engineering provides ways to construct any payoff structure desired by an investor.. However, often these payoffs involve complex option positions, and clients may not have the. knowledge, or simply the means, to handle such risks. Market practitioners can do this better. For example, many structured products offer principal protection or credit enhancements to investors. Normally, institutions that may not be allowed to invest in such positions due to regulatory reasons. will be eligible to hold the structured product itself once principal protection is added to it.. Providing custom-made products for clients due to differing views, risk appetite, or regulatory conditions is one way to interpret structured products and in general they are regarded this way. Hybrid securities that consist of several financial products such as a stock or bond plus a derivative. are also referred to as structured notes.  

However, in this book our main interest is to study financial phenomena from the manufac-. turer's point of view. This view provides a second interpretation of structured products. Investment banks deal with clients, corporates, and with each other. These activities require holding.  

inventories, sourcing and outsourcing exposures, and maintaining books. However, due to market conditions, the instruments that banks are keeping on their books may sometimes become too costly or too risky, or sometimes better alternatives emerge. The natural thing to do is to sell these exposures to "others." Structured products may be one convenient way of doing this. Consider the following example. A bank would like to buy volatility at a reasonable price, but suppose there are not enough sellers of such volatility in the interbank market. Then a structured product can be designed so that the bank can buy volatility at a reasonable price from the retail investor.  

In this interpretation, the structured product is regarded from the manufacturer's angle and looks like a tool in inventory or balance sheet management. A structured product is either an indirect way to sell some existing risks to a client or an indirect way to buy some desired risks from the retail client. Given that bank balance sheets and books contain a great deal of interest rate and credit risk-related exposures, it is natural that a significant portion of the recent activity in structured products relates to managing such exposures.  

In this chapter, we consider two major classes of structured products. The first group is the new equity-, commodity- and FX-based structured products and the second is LIBOR-based fixed-income. products. The latter are designed so as to benefit from expected future movements in the yield curve.. We will argue that the general logic behind structured products is the same, regardless of whether they are LIBOR-based or equity-linked. Hence we try to provide a unified approach to structured products. In a later chapter, we will consider the third important class of structured products based on the occurrence of an event. This event may be a mortgage prepayment or, more importantly, a credit default. These will be discussed through structured credit products. Because credit is considered separately in a different chapter, during the discussion that follows it is best to assume that there. is no credit risk.
