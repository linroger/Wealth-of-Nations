# 21.3 ABSs VERSUS CDOs  

This chapter introduces financial engineering applications that relate to ABSs and securitization. It turns out that securitization and hybrid asset creation are similar procedures with different objectives. From the issuer's point of view, one is a solution to balance sheet problems and it helps to reduce funding costs. From an investor's point of view, securitization gives access to payoffs the investor had no access to before and provides opportunities for better diversification. Hybrid assets, on the other hand, can be regarded as complex, ready-made portfolios.  

A financial engineer needs to know how to construct an ABS. In fact, engineering is implicit in this asset class. The remaining tasks of pricing and risk managing are straightforward. A similar statement can be made about hybrid assets.  

This book cannot deal with the technical issues concerning ABSs and CDOs. Still, credit indices should be put in context so that they can be compared to ABSs and CDOs. This is also a good opportunity to introduce the basic definitions of and the differences between the ABS- and CDOtype securities. A CDO is a security whose value is backed or collateralized by a pool of underlying fixed-income assets. The CDO pays a return which is based on payments from the performance of this pool of assets.  

Imagine three different classes of defaultable securities. The first class is defaultable bonds.. Except for U.S. Treasury bonds, all existing bonds are defaultable and fall into this category. The. second class can be defined as "loans." There are several types of loans, but for our purposes here,. we consider just the secured loans extended to businesses. Finally, there are loans extended to households, the most important of which are mortgages..  

ABS securities can be defined by either using other assets such as loans, bonds, or mortgages,. or more commonly using the stream of cash flows generated by various assets such as credit cards or student or equity loans. In this section, we consider the first kind. Figure 21.3 displays the way. we can structure an ABS security. A basket of debt securities is divided into subclasses with different ratings, then the subclasses are placed "behind' different classes of the ABS security. This means that any cash flows or the corresponding shortfalls from the original debt instruments would be passed on to the investor who buys that particular class of ABS security. In contrast, if there are defaults, the investors receive an accordingly lower coupon or may even lose their principal. Note that according to Figure 21.3, classes of ABS securities have different ratings because they are backed by different debt instruments. Often in an ABs, the credit pool is made of loans such as. credit cards, auto loans, home equity loans, and other similar consumer-related borrowing. When the underlying instrument is a mortgage, the ABS is called an MBS, which we examined in detail in Chapter 17. In each case, the rating of the ABS is determined by the rating of the loans that back it.2  

Figure 21.4 shows a "cash" CDO, also called a funded CDO. Again a pool of credit instruments are selected. But they are classified in a very different way. The CDO classes called tranches are formed, not by classifying the underlying securities, but the risk in them. In fact, all CDO tranches will be backed by the same pool of securities. What distinguishes the tranches is the subordination of the default risk. The ABS categorizes the securities themselves. A CDO categorizes the priority

of payments during defaults. The first few defaults will be the first tranche, then if defaults continue the next tranche will suffer and so on..  

# 21.3.1 TRANCHES AND SOME SECURITIZATION HISTORY  

In the 1990s, the securitization process that started with ABS was then extended to CDOs, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and their variants. In packaging bonds, mortgages, loans, and ABS securities into CDO-type instruments, banks went through the following practice. The banks decided to keep the first loss piece called the equity tranche. For example, the bank took responsibility for the first, say,. $3\%$ of the defaults during the CDO maturity. This introduced some subordination to the securities sold. The responsibility for the next tranche, the mezzanine took the risk of the defaults between, say,. $3\%$ and $6\%$ of the defaults in the underlying portfolio. This was. less risky than the equity tranche and the paper could be rated, say, BBB. Institutional investors who are prevented by law to invest in speculative grade securities could then buy the mezzanine tranche and, indirectly, the underlying loans even if the underlying debt was speculative grade. Consider the following illustrative example. Take 100 bonds all rated B. This is a fairly speculative rating and many institutions by law are not allowed to hold such bonds. Yet, suppose we sell the risk of the first. $10\%$ of the defaults to some hedge fund, at which time the default risk on the remaining bonds may in fact become A. Institutional investors can then buy this risk. Hence, credit enhancement made it possible to sell paper that originally was very risky.  

Then, the very high-quality tranches, called senior and super senior, were also kept on banks'. books because their implied return was too small for many investors. As a result, the banks found themselves long equity tranche and long senior and super senior tranches. They were short the mezzanine tranche which paid a good return and was rated investment grade (IG). It turns out, as we will see in this chapter, that the equity tranche value is positively affected by the default correlation while the super senior tranche value is negatively affected. The sum of these positions formed. the correlation books of the banks. Banks had to learn correlation trading, hedging, and pricing as. a result.  

As discussed below, the bespoke tranches evolved later into standard tranches on the credit indices. The equity tranche was the first loss piece. A protection seller on the equity tranche bears the risk of the first. $0-3\%$ of defaults in standard tranches. The mezzanine tranche bears the second highest risk. A protection seller on the tranche is responsible, by convention, for $3-6\%$ of the defaults.The $6-9\%$ tranche is called senior mezzanine. The senior and super senior iTraxx tranches bear the default risk of. $9-12\%$ and $12-22\%$ of names, respectively. In this chapter, we study the pricing and the engineering of such tranches.  

If the default risk comes from a pool of bonds, the CDO is called a collateralized bond obliga-. tion (CBO). If the underlying securities are loans, then it is called a CLO. The term CDO is more. general and the securities it represents may be a mixture of all these. In fact, these underlying secu-. rities may include MBS or other ABS securities. Even tranches of other CDOs were sometimes included in a CDO before the GFC.  

# 21.3.2 A COMPARISON OF ABSs AND CDOs  

Consider an investor pays 100 in cash to buy the ABS and the CDO structures shown in Figures 21.3 and 21.4. By buying the ABS or the CDO the investor is, in a sense, buying the underlying securities as a pool. The underlying pool can be arranged so that the investor can choose among classes of ABS securities with different ratings. In the CDO, the priority of interest and principal payments determine the rating of the tranche. Thus different classes of ABS securities (at least as defined here) represent different underlying assets grouped according to their credit rating,. whereas the tranches of CDOs are actually backed by the same underlying assets, while having different ratings due to how quickly they will be hit during successive defaults. Figure 21.4 shows. that the cash flows in CDOs have a cascading effect between classes. This pattern is therefore often referred to as a cash flow waterfall.  

# 21.3.2.1 Credit indices  

Markets prefer to trade credit risk through standardized and transparent credit indices. We discussed the 2009 standardization of single-name credit default swap (CDS) contracts in Chapter 18. Credit indices are liquid benchmarks that are based on portfolios of reference names or singlename CDS contracts. The corresponding default risks are then repackaged by slicing the portfolio into various standard tranches bearing different risk and return characteristics.3  

The indices allow investors to take a position on the broad corporate credit market with a single trade and provide liquid hedging instruments for institutions to hedge their complex credit exposures. Within the IG corporate credit names, there exist two major CDS index categories in the world: CDX and iTraxx. During the discussion in this chapter, we focus mostly on iTraxx indices.  

The credit indices are constructed by Markit's subsidiary International Index Company (IIC) after a. dealer liquidity poll. Market makers submit a list of names to the IIC based on the following criteria.  

1. The entities have to be incorporated in Europe and have to have the highest CDS trading. volume, as measured over the previous 6 months. Traded volumes for entities that fall under the same ticker, but trade separately in the CDS market, are summed to arrive at an overall volume for each ticker. The most liquid entity under the ticker qualifies for index membership..   
2. The list of entities in the index is ranked according to trading volumes. IIC removes any entities rated below BBB (by S&P) and those on negative outlook..   
3. The final portfolio is created using 125 names. It is assembled according to the following. classification: 10 Autos, 30 Consumers, 20 Energy, 20 Industrials, 20 TMT, and 25 Financials. Each name is weighted equally in the overall and subindices.4.  

The markets prefer to trade mostly the subinvestment grade indices called iTraxx Crossover (XO) in Europe and CDX High Yield (HY) in the United States. These indices see a large majority of the trading, they contain fewer names, and the spreads are significantly higher.5  

# 21.3.2.2 Synthetic CDOs  

A credit index and the associated tranches are a synthetic version of a CDO. The underlying assets are related to the bonds of the reference portfolio names but they are not purchased! Hence, they are unfunded. Thus, with an index and most of the tranches, there is no initial cash payment or. receipt involved. While a cash CDO pays LIBOR plus some spread, the synthetic (unfunded) CDO pays just the spread because it involves no initial cash payments. In this sense, the relationship between an index (unfunded CDO) and a funded CDO is similar to the relationship between cash bonds versus the CDS written on that name..  

Figure 21.5 shows how the index can be interpreted as a synthetic unfunded CDO. In this fig-. ure, the tranches are selected so that they conform to the standard iTraxx tranches. Synthetic CDOs

# FIGURE 21.5  

A credit index and the implied synthetic CDO.  

were popular in the run-up to the GFC since they were cheaper and easier to create than traditional CDOs which as we saw were mostly created from mortgages. The following example illustrates recent developments in CDS and CDO markets.  

# EXAMPLE  

The GFC led to a recession that started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Default rates following the recession peaked in 2010 according to S&P but subsequently declined to historical lows in 2012. As a result of the fall in defaults the demand for hedging default risk declined and the amount of single-name CDS outstanding fell. According to data from the BIS, at the end of 2012, the notional amount outstanding of single-name CDS was $\$14.3t n$ which represents a $57\%$ decline from its \$33.4tn peak in the first half of. 2008. It is important to bear in mind that part of the decline can be attributed to investors compressing or clearing their swaps portfolios but this does not explain the majority of the decline..  

The shrinking of the single-name CDS markets may have been welcomed by some regulators and politicians but it also means that banks and other market participants have fewer hedging tools available. As is clear from Figure 21.5, the creation for synthetic CDOs contributed to the growth of the single-name CDS market before the GFC as CDOs sold credit protection in waves. Demand for CDS protection stemmed from banks that used swaps to offset their loan exposures. At the same time hedge funds were active market participants and "correlation traders" as they arbitraged discrepancies in the prices of CDS or different CDO tranches. The synthetic CDO market is slowly recovering, as Figure 21.6 shows, but under new tougher capital rules banks no longer benefit as much from hedging their loans with CDS. Many remaining correlation traders are now involved in managing legacy synthetic CDOs. Correlation traders were some of the most active users of single-name CDS and with the decline in correlation trading liquidity in the singlename CDS market also shrank. An additional factor that depressed the single-name CDS activity was the EU's 2012 decision to ban buying naked sovereign CDS protection. One area where activity has been robust has been in the area of CDS on indices as some market participants use them for trading and hedging purposes. Index CDS has been used as hedges against macroeconomic uncertainty and as imperfect hedges against firm specific credit risk.

# FIGURE 21.6  

Global synthetic CDO issuance.  

As the example above illustrates the single-name CDS and synthetic CDO market have shrunk compared to pre-GFC levels, but the products continue to trade. Figure 21.6 shows that global issuance in the synthetic CDO market has rebounded slightly in 2013 although it remains at $<2\%$ of the pre-GFC annual issuance level. There are reasons to believe that securitization as well as CDO markets will continue to exist. The reason is that following a period of critical evaluation of the role of these markets in the GFC following by regulation, governments realize that securitization and CDOs play an important role in providing funding to the economy. As stricter regulation and capital requirements have seen banks reduce lending, securitization may provide one of the avenues to increase lending to businesses and stimulate the economy. The reading above also highlights the role of correlation trading based on CDOs which we will examine in further detail in the next chapter.
