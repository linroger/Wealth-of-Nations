# 21.12 CONCLUSIONS  

This chapter discussed securitization and the role that it has played before and after the GFC. We discussed one example of securitization in the form of CDOs and their tranches. We saw that CDO tranche values depend on default correlations which has led us to a discussion of correlation trading. The next chapter will provide a detailed example that shows the effect of correlation on tranche prices. This will lead us to a discussion of how to risk manage positions in CDO tranches and take views on increasing and decreasing correlations.  

This chapter also provided interesting applications of financial engineering principles including option valuation and reduced form and structural models which we encountered in earlier chapters. We discussed credit structured products include post-GFC developments such as CoCos.  

# SUGGESTED READING  

Brigo et al. (2010) provide a good account of credit models and CDOs during and after the GFC while Schonbucher (2004) and Duffie and Singleton (2002) are earlier academic approaches.  

Some of the most useful references are in handbooks published by banks. We recommend the Handbook of Credit Derivatives by Merrill Lynch and one by JP Morgan. The latter is the closest approach to the market standard in this sector. For more details on and recent developments in the credit indices, see www.markit.com. Francis et al. (2003) is a good reference for credit correlation trading. De Spiegeleer and Schoutens (2012) provide an in-depth analysis of the valuation and structuring of CoCos.  

# EXERCISES  

1. What is the difference between an ABS and a CDO?   
2. What is the effect of default probabilities on CDO tranches? What is the effect of default correlations on CDO tranches? Explain.   
3. Consider the following news from Reuters: 1008 GMT [Dow Jones] LONDON-SG recommends selling 7-year $0{-}3\%$ tranche protection versus buying 5-year and 10-year $0{-}3\%$ protection. 7-year equity correlation tightened versus 5-year and 10-year last year. SG's barbell plays a steepening of the 7-yea bucket, as well as offering positive roll down, time decay, and jump to default. SG also thinks Alstom's (1022047.FR) 3-5-year curve is too steep, and recommends buying its $6.25\%$ March 2010 bonds versus 3-year CDS. a.What is a barbell? What is positive roll down, time decay? b.What is jump to default?. c. Explain the logic behind SG's strategy.   
4. Consider the following quote: It is only when portfolios are tranched that the relative value of default correlation becomes meaningful. So, for subordinate tranches, the risk and spreads decrease as correlation between defaults increases, while for senior tranches the risk and spreads increase as default correlation increases. a. Explain the first sentence carefully. b. Explain the second paragraph. c. Suppose you think that credit correlation would decrease in the near future. What typ!. trade would you put on?  

5. Consider the following quote:  

Until last year, this correlation pricing of single-tranche CDOs and first-to-default. baskets was dependent on each bank or hedge fund's assessment of correlation. However, in 2003 the banks behind iBoxx and Trac- $x$ started trading tranched versions of the indexes. This standardization in tranches has created a market where bank desks and hedge funds are assessing value and placing prices on the same products rather than on portfolios bespoke single-tranche CDOs and first-to-default baskets. Rather than the price of correlation being based on a model, it is now being set by the market..
