# 21.6 TRANCHES: STANDARD AND BESPOKE  

The popularity of the indices is mostly due to the existence of standard index tranches that permit trading credit risk at different levels of subordination. At the present time, default correlation can be traded only by using index tranches. The index itself is used to hedge the sensitivity of tranches to changes in the probability of default.12 We discuss the formal aspects of pricing default correlation in the next chapter. In this section, we introduce standard index tranches and then introduce their relationship to default correlation..  

The equity tranche is the first loss piece. By convention equity tranche bears the highest default. risk.13 A protection seller on the standard equity tranche bears the risk of the first $0-3\%$ of defaults on the reference portfolio. The equity tranche spread is quoted in two components. The first, which is quoted by the market maker, is paid upfront. It is for the investor to "keep." The second is the. 500 bps running fee which is paid depending on how much time passes between relevant events.14  

The mezzanine tranche bears the second highest risk. A protection seller on the tranche is responsible, by convention, for $3-6\%$ of the defaults.15 This tranche is also upfront with a 500 bps spread.  

The senior and super senior iTraxx tranches bear the default risk of $6-9\%$ and $9-12\%$ names respectively. The $6-9\%$ tranche also has a 300 bps fixed spread.  

The numbers such as $0-3\%$ are called the lower and upper attachment points. The ones introduced above are the attachment points for standard tranches. If attachment points are different from those and negotiated individually with the market maker they become bespoke tranches.16 A bespoke trance will not naturally have the same liquidity as a standard tranche.  

The value of the tranches depends on two important factors: The first is the risk of a change in the average probability of default; the second is the change in default correlation. This is a complex and important idea and leads to the market known as correlation trading. It turns out that from a typical bank's point of view, one of the biggest risks that may lead to bankruptcy is the event of defaults of its clients at the same time. Banks normally make provisions for "expected' defaults. It is part of the business. If individual defaults occur now, then it will not be very harmful. Yet, joint defaults of the borrowers can be fatal. This explains the importance of default correlation for the banking sector. Although most financial crises are characterized by, to most participants, surprising increases in correlations associated with declines in risky assets, it was the unprecedented increase in correlations in many of the underlyings in ABS and CDOs that led to outsized losses in this sector during the GFC. Investor and structures did not consider scenarios with historically unseen correlations.  

In fact, the reference names in a credit index are affected by the same macroeconomic and financial conditions that prevail in an economy (sector) and hence are likely to be quite highly correlated at times, and the level of the correlation would change depending on the prevailing conditions. In an environment where credit conditions are benign and liquidity is ample, default correlation is likely to be low and any defaults occur mostly due to idiosnycratic reasons, that is to say, effects that relate to the defaulting company only, rather than the overall negative economic and financial conditions. During periods of stress this changes, and defaults occur in bunches due to the underlying adverse macroeconomic conditions.  

Thus default correlation is a stochastic process itself. During the last few years, market profes-. sionals have learned how to strip, price, hedge, and trade the default correlation. We will study this more formally in the next chapter. Here we note that the value of the equity tranche depends positively on the level of default correlation. The higher the default correlation in the reference portfolio, the higher the value of an investment in the equity tranche, which means that the spread associated with it will be lower.17 On the other hand, the value of the senior and super senior. tranches depends negatively on the default correlation. As default correlation increases, the investment in a super senior tranche will become less valuable and its spread will increase. This is called the correlation smile and is discussed in the next chapter.
