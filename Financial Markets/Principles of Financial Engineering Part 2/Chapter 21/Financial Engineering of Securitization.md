# 21.2 FINANCIAL ENGINEERING OF SECURITIZATION  

Every business or financial institution is associated with a "credit' or, more precisely, a credit rating. If this entity issues a debt instrument to secure funding, then the resulting bonds, in general, have the same credit rating as the company. Yet, a company can also be interpreted as the receiver of future cash flows with different credit ratings. The value and the credit rating of the company will be a function of these future cash flows. Not all the receivables will have the same rating. For example, some cash flows may be owed by institutions with a dubious credit record, and these cash flows may not be received in the case of default or delinquency. Other cash flows may be liabilities of highly reputable companies, may carry a low probability of default, and may indeed be received with very high probability.  

A debt issue will be backed by an average of these credits, since it is the average receivable cash flows that determine the probability that the bonds will be repaid at maturity. If the receivables of a company carry mostly a relatively high probability of default, then the company may experience difficulties in the future and, hence, may end up defaulting on the loan. Alternatively, the credit spread on the bond will increase and the investors will be subject to mark-to-market losses. All these possibilities reflect on the debt issued by this company and are factors in the determination of the proper cost of funding.  

On the other hand, instead of issuing debt on the back of the average cash flows to be received in the future, the company can issue special types of bonds that are backed only by the higher rated portion of the receivables. Clearly, such receivables have a comparatively lower probability of default, and this makes the bonds carry a lower default probability. The funding cost will decrease significantly. The company has thus securitized a certain portion of the cash flows that are to be received in the future. In other words, securitization can be regarded as a way to issue debt and raise funds that have a higher rating than that of the company. It is also a way of repackaging various cash flows.  

What are the critical aspects of such financial engineering? Essentially, various cash flows are to be analyzed and a proper selection is made so as to obtain an optimal basket. This is then sold to investors through special types of bonds.  

Yet, besides the financial engineering aspects, securitization involves (i) legal issues, (ii) balance sheet considerations, and (iii) tax considerations. Securitization is a way of funding an operation. Instead of selling bonds or securing bank lines, the company issues ABSs. The option of securitization helps corporations and banks make decisions among the various funding alternatives.  

# 21.2.1 CHOOSING CASH FLOWS  

Consider Figure 21.1. Here, we show a bank that expects three different (random) cash flows in the future. The institutions that are supposed to pay these cash flows have different credit ratings. For example, the first series of cash flows, rated BBB, may represent credit card payments. The third could represent the random cash flows due to mortgages made in the past. Arguably, people pay better attention to the timely payment of mortgages than they do to the timely payments of unsecured credit card proceeds. Credit card defaults are much more common and plausible than mortgage delinquencies. Thus, the mortgage cash flows will be rated higher, say, with an A rating as shown in the figure.  

Now, if the company is set to receive these three cash flows only, assuming similar liabilities, the company's average rating will perhaps be around. ${\tt B B B+}$ . A corporate bond issued by the com-. pany will carry a ${\tt B B+}$ credit spread.  

Consider two different ways of packaging the same cash flows. If the company "sells' cash. flow 3 and backs a bond issue with this cash flow only, the probability of default will be much

lower and funding can be secured at a lower rate. A bond backed by cash flows 1 and 2 will have a lower credit rating than a bond based on cash flow 3, but depending on the diversification benefits of combining different cash flows and the attractiveness of offering a bigger pool of receivables in. this second option, it may make sense for a company to combine cash flows 1 and 2 instead of sell-. ing separate bonds based on them.  

Early examples of securitization can be found as far back as the eighteenth century but the first modern residential mortgage backed security (MBS) was created in 1970 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. During the 1990s, banks moved into securitization of a wider range of assets and more complex structures. Loans from credit cards, mortgages, equity, and cars were packaged and sold to investors. A typical strategy was to (i) buy the loan from an originator, (ii) warehouse it in the bank while the cash flows stabilized and their credit quality was established, (iii) hedge the credit exposure during this warehousing period, and (iv) finally sell the loan to the. investor in the form of ABS.  

# 21.2.2 THE CRITICAL STEP: SECURING THE CASH FLOW  

The idea of securitization is quite simple. Instead of borrowing against the average quality of the.   
company's receivables, which is what happens if the company sells a straight corporate bond, the.   
entity decides to borrow against a higher-quality subset of the receivables. In case of default, these.   
receivables have a higher chance of being collected (recovered) and, hence, the cost of these funds will be lower.  

But there is a critical step. How can the buyer of an ABS make sure that the receivables that are supposed to back the security are not used by the company for other purposes, and that, in the. case of bankruptcy, these receivables will be there to cover losses?.  

The question is relevant, since after issuing the ABS security, it is still the original company that handles the business of processing new receivables (e.g., by issuing new mortgages), as well as the receipts of cash generated by such cash flows, and then uses them in the daily business of the firm. Clearly, there must be an additional mechanism that guarantees, at least partially, that these cash flows will be there in case of default..  

A bankruptcy remote SPV (special-purpose vehicle) is one such mechanism used quite often to resolve such problems in practice. The idea is as follows. (i) The issuing company forms a SPV, which is a shell company, often independent of the parent company, and whose sole purpose is to act as a vehicle in structuring the ABS. (ii) Steps are taken to make the SPV bankruptcy remote. That is to say, the probability that the SPV itself defaults is zero (since it does not engage in any meaningful economic activity other than that of issuing the paper), and in case the original company goes bankrupt, the underlying cash flows remain in the hands of the SPV. (iii) The issuing company draws all the necessary papers so that, at least from a legal point of view, the cash flows are sold to the SPV. This is a true sale at law.  

The idea is to transfer the right to these cash flows and guarantee them under the ABS as much as possible.' In fact, several SPVs with different purposes can be layered to make sure that the. ABS has the desired characteristics.  

1. An SPV may be needed for tax reasons.   
2. Another SPV may be needed for balance sheet reasons..   
3. Still another SPV may be needed to comply with other regulations.  

Hence, one possible structure can be layered as shown in Figure 21.2. Note that here, the first. SPV is a subsidiary of the company, so the company can "buy' the cash flows, and this is the rea-. son for its existence. But if the SPVs keep the cash flows, these will still be on the balance sheet of the original company.  

Finally, note the role played by the investment bank. The first three layers make up the ABS structure, and the investment bank still has to handle the original sale of the ABS. The structure clearly shows that the ABS has three important purposes, namely lowering the funding cost, managing the balance sheet, and handling tax and accounting restrictions.  

# 21.2.3 SOME COMPARISONS  

The first use of securitization concerns funding costs, as already discussed. Securitization is a form of funding. But we must add that it is also an unconstrained form of funding, and an off-balancesheet form of liquidity for small and medium-sized companies. Finally, it is a diversified funding source. This way it can lower leverage. Securitization also implies less public disclosure.  

Securitization is neither secured corporate financing, nor the sale of an asset. It is a hybrid, a combination of both that uses the well-accepted legal, regulatory, tax, and accounting concepts that. already exist.  

# 21.2.3.1 Loan sales  

We should also compare whole loan sales versus securitization. Securitization is on a serviceretained basis, whereas a loan sale is service released. The buyer of the loan would like to service

the loan himself or herself. Another point is the retention of credit and prepayment risk. In a loan sale, $100\%$ of these risks are transferred. With securitization, some of these risks may be retained. A loan sale is also often done at a premium, whereas securitization issues are often around par.  

In addition, there is a timing issue. In securitization, cash flows from assets are often invested in short-term investments and then transferred to the bond holders. Thus, the investor receives the payments later than the servicer. Finally, securitization sometimes uses credit enhancements, and. this makes the paper somewhat more liquid.  

# 21.2.3.2 Secured lending  

Securitization is similar to secured financing, with one important difference. In an ABS, the issuing company is not liable for its ABSs. It is as if the company has not really "borrowed' the funds. A separate legal entity needs to be established to do the borrowing. Securitization is structured so that this entity becomes the legal owner of the asset. If the company defaults, the cash flows will not belong to the company, but to the SPV. This way the owners of the bonds have an ownership interest in the case of securitization, whereas in the case of secured lending, they only have a security interest.
