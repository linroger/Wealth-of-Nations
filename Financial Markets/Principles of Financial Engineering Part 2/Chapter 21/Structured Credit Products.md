# 21.11 STRUCTURED CREDIT PRODUCTS  

CDS is the basic building block of the credit sector. Using CDS engineering, one can immediately. create credit-market equivalents of risk-free fixed-income instruments. Some of these instruments are discussed in this section.  

# 21.11.1 CREDIT OPTIONS  

It is natural for options to be the first derivative to be written on credit indices. After all, there are liquid indices and these could serve as an attractive underlying for those who would like to hedge their credit volatility or for investors who would like to take positions in them. Yet, such options turn out to be much more complicated to structure and market than visualized at the outset. Although there is decent liquidity in the market, with daily references to iTraxx and CDX implied volatility, some difficulties remain.  

There are essentially three problems associated with options on credit indices. First, the.   
credit sector is heavily influenced by monetary policy and has a long credit cycle. The practi-.   
tioners would need long-dated options. Second, although stocks are liquid, a large majority of.   
corporate bonds have very little liquidity; but the third and main problem is the index roll.  

Essentially these indices change every 6 months and one cannot price a long-term option against such an unstable benchmark.  

The credit option trader is then forced to operate in the shortest maturities and the exercise dates controlled by the roll dates.26 This is not sufficient for traders since their needs are really 5-year options because these could be used to arbitrage the structured credit market.27  

There is another important difference between credit index options and options from other markets. In the credit sector the longer dated an option, the more it becomes a correlation product. With longer-dated options, the underlying risk is to what extent referenced credits will move jointly. Shorter-dated options, on the other hand, are more like volatility products.  

# 21.11.2 FORWARD START CDOs  

Using forward start CDOs, one can take leveraged positions on the outlook for credit spreads in the distant future, say from 2015 to 2020. Such forward start products may be useful for some investors that want to hedge their positions on take exposure during the credit cycle..  

The product can be structured by selling CDSs maturing, say, in 10 years, and buying CDSs maturing in a shorter maturity, say, 5 years. Such forward start instruments are marketed as bespoken deals on the iTraxx or CDX default swap indexes. The most common reference is the mezzanine tranche insurance against the $3-6\%$ of defaults in a credit portfolio.  

The net position of buying 5-year protection and selling 10-year protection is selling 5-year pro-. tection 5 years from now. Note that such a position will have positive carry. Due to this, such trades become popular if the iTraxx curve is relatively steep.  

# 21.11.3 THE CMDS  

The constant maturity default swap (CMDS) is an important component of the structured credit sector. A CMDS can be structured as follows.  

Fix the maturity of the CDS at, say, 5 years. Consider a series of $T$ maturity CDSs starting at times $t,t+1,t+2,t+3,t+4,$ and $t+5$ . Note that the spread of the current CDS is known at time $t$ whereas future CDS spreads $c_{t+i}$ will be known only in the future as time passes. Also note that these CDSs all have the same 5-year constant maturity. Let their spread be denoted by $c_{t+i}$ Then the CMDS will be the 5-year CDS that pays the floating spreads $c_{t+i}.$  

Essentially this is an extension of the CMS swaps to the case where the underlying risk. incorporates default risk. There are several uses of this crucial component. A market example follows.  

# EXAMPLE  

Investors want to sell protection today with the potential to take advantage of expected future spread widening; this is exactly what the CMDS product provides. Client interest in constant maturity CDOs (CM-CDOs) also helps establish the CMDS market by drawing clients' attention to what the product can achieve.  

Nearly all new CDOs in the pipeline today come with the option of constant maturity technology embedded in them.  

There are concerns about the possibility that profit and loss volatility may be injected into. synthetic CDOs because of International Accounting Standards (IAS) 39 which requires all derivatives to be marked-to-market through the income statement. These concerns drive a lot of interest in CM-CDOs. Using CMDS to mitigate mark-to-market volatility is a legitimate reason for employing them. Market participants do not expect CMDS to outshine the market. for tranched credit index products or credit options. But having standardized fixings would be. useful both for closing CDO deals and for developing the market for cash-settled credit spread options and other structured credit and volatility products.  

CMDS are generally viewed as a building block for other structured credit products. The challenge is that fixings for credit derivatives are not as straightforward as they are for interest rate derivatives. "The amount of information that you need is so much greater than it is in rates. And where do you stop with fixings? The universe of names in the credit default swap market is very large. How many do you fix, and do you fix for the five-year or the whole curve for each name?" asked a trader.  

Fixings on the credit indices are relevant for CMDS contracts because if CDSs are written on indices, which most are, an independent fix is needed. Quoting an index, such as Dow Jones iTraxx, is not easier as the coupon must be linked to 125 names, but the liquidity in credit indices is greater than it is in the underlying single names..  

Standardized fixings. About 18 dealers have been working with Credited, the electronic. dealer-broker, and Mark-It Partners, the OCT derivatives valuation firm, to standardize fixings for credit indices. Six weekly fixing test runs have been completed so far (Thomson Reuters IFR 1552). No runs on single-name credit default swaps have been tested yet,. though.  

According to dealers, the standard resets that are being developed are essential for the continued growth of the product as opposed to relying on just dealer polls as documented in current contracts.  

"Fixings are worthwhile for the credit derivative market not just for CMDs but for all other second- and third-generation credit derivative products. For example, if fixings are. done for iTraxx index tranches, this will help breed a further range of derivatives on the. tranches. So, in this way, fixings are essential just like LIBOR fixes every day for the swap. market," one dealer added.  

For the CMDS market to evolve, common documentation must also be forthcoming, dealers say. In CMDS, two documentation issues to overcome are whether the coupon is quarterly or semiannual and if the fixing is $T+1$ 0r $T+2$  

The CMDS can be used to take an exposure to the movements of the credit curve. If one expects the credit curve to steepen then one could, for example, buy a 5-year protection on the CMDS that references a 10-year CDS and sell protection on the 5-year CMDS that references a 3-year CDS. The reverse could be done if the credit curve is expected to flatten. One could also put together a swap of the CDSs: e.g., paying 10-year and receiving 3-year reference spreads.  

# 21.11.4 LEVERAGED SUPER SENIOR NOTES  

The spreads on super senior tranches are very tight--say, around 10 bps. This is not very attractive to the investors. Hence, the demand for super senior tranches is relatively low. Yet, banks have issued many mezzanine tranches on CDOs and have kept the super senior and equity tranches on their books. They need a way to generate a demand for these tranches. Leveraged super senior notes is one method that was devised for selling the super senior risk to others.  

With the note investors, take the additional exposure to the mark-to-market value of the tranche,. and the trigger protects the bank against the investor's credit risk. Given the leverage, super senior investment may lose an amount greater than the original investment. With the trigger, this risk is reduced.  

In this sense, one can say that a leveraged super senior note is a modification of the super senior tranche. This modification occurs first in the leverage. $N$ is collected from the investor, but $\lambda N$ with $1<\lambda$ invested in the super senior tranche. Hence the return is also multiplied by $\lambda$ Second, there is a trigger on the market value of the note. If this trigger is reached the issuer of the note can unwind the position and return the mark-to-market value of the note to the investors.  

# EXAMPLE  

Consider a UsD1 billion portfolio. Let the senior tranche have attachment points of $12\%$ and $30\%$ . This gives a thickness of USD180 million.  

Suppose we select a leverage ratio of 10. The leveraged super senior note will consist of an issue of UsD18 million. This amount is multiplied by 10 and invested as a notional amount of 180 million in the super senior tranche. Assuming that the quoted spread for this tranche is 8 bp, the note will pay $\mathrm{LIBOR}+100\$  

The market value trigger could be defined, for instance, as. $70\%$ of the issue amount of USD18 million. If the market value of the note falls below this limit, say becomes 12, then the 12 is returned to the investors instead of the original investment of 18..  

There are two general tendencies in structured credit. The first is to introduce leveraged transactions; the second is the introduction of market risk in addition to default risk. The leveraged super senior notes are examples of the first tendency. The CPPI techniques applied to credit are an example of the second and they will be discussed in Chapter 23.  

Where does risk lie in leveraged super senior notes? Owing to the substantial credit protection inherent in a super senior structure, the default risk itself is very limited. The risk borne by investors mainly lies in the behavior of the market value of the CDS tranche, which depends on spreads and correlations. Most transactions are actually structured so as to ignore correlation variations as market value parameters; they introduce instead a trigger on the portfolio average spread.  

In such a trade, the investor is long the super senior risk, while the dealer goes short that risk. To boost the return on these investments, dealers have been constructing products for their clients using borrowed funds.  

During the year 2o0o, dealers purchased significant amounts of mezzanine protection and, as a result, were left exposed to the senior and equity components of the capital structure. This is because. they had marketed mezzanine products to clients and kept the senior and equity tranches on their books. Note that leveraged super senior trades is one way of buying protection on the senior and super senior tranches. Hence, the structured product is in fact useful to both the client and the dealer..  

If dealers did not have such long senior and super senior positions, after buying protection from a. client with a leveraged super senior issuance, they would hedge themselves through the iTraxx index. or other individual CDSs, although there may be a significant basis risk between the two risks.  

# 21.11.5 CoCos  

CoCos are an example of post-GFC financial innovation. The structuring and valuation of CoCos represent an interesting application of the financial engineering principles that we discussed in this book, including the modeling of credit and default events. For this reason and since CoCos are a relatively recent and untested product, we discuss CoCos in some detail. A CoCo is a hybrid product. It is a debt instrument that automatically converts into equity or suffers a write down when a certain trigger event occurs. CoCos can therefore be viewed as an example of convertible debt which we first encountered in Chapter 19. However, the contingent conversion of CoCos into equity means that they have more in common with structured products such as reverse convertibles discussed in Chapter 20 than with convertible bonds. What CoCos have in common with reverse convertibles is that they expose the holder to a limited upside but a potentially large downside. However, in contrast to reverse convertibles the trigger for CoCos recently issued by banks is an accounting trigger such as the banks' Tier-1 capital ratios (typically $5-7\%$ of risk-weighted assets) and not their share price. The first CoCo was issued by Lloyds banking group in 2009 and labeled Enhanced Capital Note (ECN). The 7bn Lloyds ECNs convert into equity if the bank's tier one capital falls below $5\%$ . The minimum level for banks to pass the European stress test is $5.5\%$  

There is another important difference compared to convertible bonds and reverse convertibles which is that the trigger may sometimes depend on regulatory intervention, as was the case with a CoCo launched by Credit Suisse in February 2011 under the name Buffer Capital Notes. The Swiss regulator has the right to intervene and force a conversion into shares of the Credit Suisse CoCo. Of course, such intervention that is external to the company makes modeling the risk significantly more complicated than when the trigger is just related to the share price.  

# 21.11.5.1 Cocos versus convertible bonds  

Figure 21.12 shows the difference in price behavior between a CoCo and a convertible bond. For simplicity here we assume that the underlying debt is riskless. This is reflected in the horizontal line that represents the flat bond floor. This is in contrast to Chapter 19 where convertible bond value for low stock price levels converged to zero. As the share price falls, the convertible bond value approaches the bond floor from above. The CoCo behaves differently. We assume that the

# FIGURE 21.12  

Contingent convertible versus convertible bond.  

$\mathrm{{CoCo}}$ is converted into shares when the share price $S$ falls below a market trigger $S^{*}$ . As the stock price falls, the line representing the CoCo approaches the conversion value line from below. As the stock price rises the CoCo approaches the bond floor from below while the convertible bond approaches the conversion value from above. The slope of the line representing the conversion value depends on the conversion ratio (CR), discussed in Chapter 19.  

# 21.11.5.2 Valuation of CoCos  

CoCos provide a nice application of the financial engineering principles discussed in this book. Since CoCos are a hybrid security, it is not surprising that there are different valuation methods that can be used to price a CoCo. In fact there are three different approaches: the credit derivative approach, the equity derivative approach, and the structural credit approach. From a credit derivative perspective or reduced form approach, we price the CoCo as a fixed-income instrument with an enhanced yield as compensation for potential losses upon conversion. The risk of losses can be modeled using the default intensity or reduced form approach outlined in Chapter 18. One can model the trigger event. that leads to the conversion of the CoCo into shares, an event similar to the way default is modeled statistically in the valuation of corporate debt or CDS. This approach could lead to an equation that. expresses the credit spread on CoCos as a function of the default, or in this case trigger, intensity $(\uplambda)$ and the recovery rate. As a variation of Eq. (18.38) we would obtain the following relationship:.  

$$
\mathrm{spread}_{\mathrm{CoCo}}=(1-R_{\mathrm{CoCo}})\times\lambda_{\mathrm{CoCo}}
$$  

From an equity derivatives perspective, we can apply the principles outlined in Chapter 20 and see the CoCo as a long position in CR shares, where CR is the conversion ratio. The knock-in feature. is dependent on the trigger event and barrier option valuation approaches can be used to price it. Third, in Chapter 19 we saw structural models of default and credit valuation. CoCos are just one ele-. ment of the issuer's capital structure and therefore we can apply the principles underlying the Merton model and its extensions to value CoCos. For this purpose, we would specify a stochastic process for  

the firm and model the value of different continent claims, including those of CoCo holders, as a.   
function of the value of the assets and the trigger price. From an equity derivatives one can decompose the $\mathrm{{CoCo}}$ into a risky bond, a knock-in forward on the underlying share and a short position in.   
a digital down-and-in option, which reflects the fact that the coupons on the bond will only be.   
received as long as the trigger event does not occur. This leads to the following contractual equation:.

The end of chapter exercises provide CoCo valuation examples using the credit reduced form approach and the equity derivatives approach. Further details are available in the references listed. at the end of the chapter.  

# 21.11.5.3 The outlook for CoCos  

The rationale for CoCos arose because of banks' desire to shore up their capital base in response to. regulatory changes that led to more stringent capital requirements. The implicit hope on the part of regulators is that CoCos will help protect big banks from having to be bailed out by taxpayers again. Therefore, CoCos are also sometimes referred to as bail-in bonds. Bond holders were largely unaffected by bank losses during the GFC because taxpayers bailed out banks. The idea behind a bail-in bond is not to bail out, but to bail-in bond holders before taxpayers are asked to rescue a. bank. Bail-in clauses are different from traditional bankruptcy procedures which have strict rules. and court-supervised procedures. As Figure 21.12 shows, CoCos have a significant downside potential which has to be compensated by a higher yield. Thus, these instruments may be of interest to yield-hungry investors, provided that they understand the risks..  

However as the following reading illustrates there is some concern about the hidden risk and future performance of CoCos.  

# EXAMPLE  

Potential conflict of interest between regulators and investor can arise as a result of significant discretion that regulators have over the mandatory conversion feature embedded in CoCos. From an investor point of view, a CoCo is a hybrid product that is a deeply subordinated investment with uncertain income and significant capital risk. In a 2012 Financial Times article Satyajit Das warned that as a result of the dependence of conversion on regulatory decisions as well as credit risks, it is rather difficult for investors to quantify the probability of conversion. In addition to this risk, investors also face liquidity risk when they buy CoCos. The potential downside is made worse by the possibility of "death spirals". Such negative feedback loop spirals may arise when holders of a bank's shares try to sell shares to hedge a feared decline in the value of their holdings in the face of a mandatory conversion and potential dilution of their shares. This can potentially worsen the bank's financial position and lead to increased fear among other banks, counterparties, investors, and depositors. The probability of such spirals is increased by the fact that hybrids such as CoCos are. marketed to private investors instead of institutional investors who face restrictions regarding purchases of hybrid securities. Of course, it is possible that investors are compensated for these risks in the form of generous coupons, but the recent example of CoCos issued by Credit Suisse and UBS which paid about. $8\%$ per annum suggests otherwise. Double-digit. percentage coupons may be required to compensate for the missed couponsor mandatory conversion in times of distress. History contains several examples that should serve as a. warning regarding the purchase of hybrids without careful due diligence. Perpetual Floating. Rate Notes were a popular form of hybrid capital in the late 1980s but saddled their investors with large capital losses when they fell sharply in price. Another example is the case of some hybrid capital securities issued in the late 1990s in Australia which in 2012 were trading well below issue price. More recently, during the GFC several banks deferred coupon payments on hybrids which caused losses for investors..  

As the above example illustrates, there are serious concerns about future performance of CoCos and several design flaws are apparent in the existing offerings.  

The sensitivity of financial engineering and structured product innovation to regulatory changes. was highlighted again in February 2014 when both Lloyds and Credit Suisse discussed plans to buy back their CoCos issued in 2009 after their respective regulators changed the way they viewed the. debt and which instruments will count towards capital in bank stress tests. The February 2014 episode illustrates the significant uncertainty related to CoCos, their trigger events, their treatment by. regulators for stress testing purposes, potential downward spirals and the wider effects on the legal. protection of bond holders and the economy.
