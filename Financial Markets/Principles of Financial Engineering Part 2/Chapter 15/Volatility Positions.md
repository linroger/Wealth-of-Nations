# 15.2 VOLATILITY POSITIONS  

Volatility positions can be taken with the purpose of hedging a volatility exposure or speculating. on the future behavior of volatility. These positions require instruments that isolate volatility risk as well as possible. To motivate the upcoming discussion, we introduce two examples that illustrate traditional volatility positions.  

# 15.2.1 TRADING VOLATILITY TERM STRUCTURE  

We have seen several examples for strategies associated with shifts in the interest rate term structure. They were called curve steepening or curve flattening trades. It is clear that similar positions can be taken with respect to volatility term structures as well. Volatilities traded in markets come with different maturities. As with the interest rate term structure, we can buy one "maturity"' and sell another "maturity," as the following example shows."  

# EXAMPLE  

[A] dealer said he was considering selling short-dated 25-delta euro puts/dollar calls and buying a longer-dated straddle. A three-month straddle financed by the sale of two 25-delta one-month puts would have cost $3.9\%$ in premium yesterday.  

These volatility plays are attractive because the short-dated volatility is sold for more than the cost of the longer-maturity options.  

In this particular example, the anticipations of traders concern not the level of an asset price or. return, but, instead, the volatility associated with the price. Volatility over one interval is bought using the funds generated by selling the volatility over a different interval..  

Apparently, the traders think that short-dated euro volatility will fall relative to the long-dated. euro volatility. The question is to what extent the positions taken will meet the traders' needs, even. when their anticipations are borne out. We will see that the payoff function of this position is not invariant to changes in the underlying euro/dollar exchange rate..  

# 15.2.2 TRADING VOLATILITY ACROSS INSTRUMENTS  

Our second example is from the interest rate sector and involves another "arbitrage"' position on volatility. The trader buys the volatility of one risk and sells a related volatility on a different risk. This time, the volatilities in question do not belong to different time periods, but instead are generated by different instruments.  

# EXAMPLE  

Dealers are looking at the spreads between euro cap-floor straddle and swaption straddle volatility to take advantage of a. $5\%$ volatility difference in the 7-year area. Proprietary traders are selling a two-year cap-floor straddle starting in six years with vols close to $15\%$ The trade offers a good pick-up over the five-year swaption straddle with volatility $10\%$ This compares with a historical spread closer to. $2\%$  

Cap-floors and swaptions are instruments on interest rates. There are both similarities and differ-. ences between them. We will study them in more detail in the next chapter. Selling a cap-floor. straddle will basically be short interest rate volatility. In the example, the traders were able to take this position at $15\%$ volatility. On the other hand, buying a swaption amounts to a long position on. volatility. This was done at $10\%$ , which gives a volatility spread of about $5\%$ . The example states that the latter number has historically been around $2\%$ . Hence, by selling the spread the traders would benefit from a future narrowing of differences between the volatilities of the two instruments..  

This position's payoff is not invariant to interest rate trajectories. Even when volatilities behave as anticipated, the path followed by the level of interest rates may result in unexpected volatility.2 The following discussion intends to clarify why such positions on volatility have serious weaknesses and require meticulous risk management. We will consider pure volatility positions later..
