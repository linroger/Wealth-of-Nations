# 15.6 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE OF VARIANCE CONTRACT  

Variance (volatility) swaps are clearly useful for taking positions with variance (volatility) exposure. and hedging. But, each time a new market is born, there are usually further developments beyond the immediate uses. We briefly mention some further applications of the notions developed in this chapter..  

First of all, the $F_{t}^{2}$ , which is the fixed leg of the variance swap, can be used as a benchmark in creating new products. It is important to realize, however, that this price was obtained using the risk-neutral measure and that it is not necessarily an unbiased forecast of future variance for the period $[T_{1},T_{2}]$ . Just like the FRA market prices, the. $F_{t}$ will include a risk premium. Still, it is. the proper price on which to write volatility options..  

The pricing of the variance swap does not necessarily give a volatility that will equal the. implied volatility for the same period. Implied volatility comes with a smile and this may introduce another wedge between $F_{t}$ and the ATM volatility.  

Finally, $F_{t}^{2}$ should be a good indicator for risk-managing volatility exposures and also options books.  

Volatility trading, volatility hedging, and arbitraging are still a relatively new area. Below, we. will see some recent difficulties that volatility products encountered during the GFC and new positions associated with them.
