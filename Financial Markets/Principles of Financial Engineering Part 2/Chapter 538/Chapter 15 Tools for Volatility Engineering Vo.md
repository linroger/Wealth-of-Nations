# 538 CHAPTER 15 TOOLS FOR VOLATILITY ENGINEERING, VOLATILITY SWAPS  

VU CBOE Russell 2000 Volatility Index (RVX) Futures   
VN CBOE Nasdaq-100 Volatility Index (VXN) Futures emerging markets indices,   
VXEM CBOE Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index (VXEEM) Security Futures VXEW CBOE Brazil ETF Volatility Index (VXEWZ) Security Futures and commodities   
CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index (GVZ) Security Futures   
CBOE Crude Oil ETF Volatility Index (OVX) Security Futures.  

This shows the widespread acceptance of volatility as an asset class. It also highlights the fact that market participants are become more discerning regarding different types of volatility exposure depending on country and asset class.  

# 15.7.4.2 Variance swaps  

Variance swaps have been traded over-the-counter for almost 20 years, but recently, there have been plans to list variance swaps on exchanges. The following example discusses plans by Eurex to move over-the-counter variance swaps on to exchanges.  

# EXAMPLE  

"Plans to move over-the-counter variance swaps on to exchanges are in full swing in Europe as the Eurex.   
derivatives exchange prepares to list futures-style contracts tracking EuroStoxx 50 variance in mid-2014.  

The exchange is not the first to attempt a listed alternative that produces the same pay-off as the widely. traded OTC product. The CBOE launched S&P 500 variance futures a year ago (see "Replicating variance"), but the contract has struggled to gain traction. Since the launch last October, open interest has built up to about 32,000 contracts and volume remains lumpy with relatively few days of active trading..  

Despite the inauspicious start for the US version, some traders remain optimistic there could be support for a listed version in Europe, where many asset managers looking to trade volatility do not have OTC approval, while the VStoxx futures have just a fraction of the liquidity seen in VIX contracts..  

"The demand is there," said Rory Hill, EMEA co-head of equity derivatives at Citigroup. "After the crisis, closing down and novating OTC risk became an issue. Now, anything that's OTC, institutions and funds want to try to get listed. Client flows are now pushing volumes on to exchanges and even banks themselves don't want OTC exposure any more."  

Sluggish demand for the CBOE product has been attributed to a variety of factors-not least the ample liquidity available in the US OTC variance swaps, where 10-year contracts can trade tighter than six-month. maturities in Europe.  

The S&P variance OTC market is very healthy and very liquid, so there hasn't been a natural need. Most   
of the clients trading the product are already set up to trade OTC with the top 10 dealers, so their needs are   
already fulfilled," said Mark Chen, head of equity derivatives index trading at Citigroup in New York.. [...]  

A number of dealers and hedge funds have already expressed interest in supporting the new product, subject to the right fee structure and incentives. But the real driver is likely to come from regulatory pressure as swaps are pushed into central clearing on a product-by-product basis.  

"What could change things is when the regulatory requirement to clear the OTC products through CCPs goes live. Then we might see some clients move to the listed platform," said Bornhauser.  

Variance swap activity stalled to a near standstill in the wake of the crisis-Citi's Hill estimates that volume plummeted to around $20\%$ of its 2006-07 peak, but has since returned to as much as $50\%$ though that is concentrated in index trades. "There's still some single-stock vol swap exposure but single-stock variance swaps died a death. Most of the variance swap flow is concentrated"  

(Thomson Reuters IFR 2011, November 23, 2013)  

Regulation restricts the ability of certain investors to buy OTC products. The costs of hedging. and funding complex products has also increased in banks, thus explaining the increased attraction of exchange traded assets.  

# 15.7.5 THE HEDGE  

In Section 15.5, we discussed the potential uses and users of variance swaps. But who were the counterparties in variance swaps in the run up to the GFC? It turns out that variance swaps were not just attrac-. tive to investors but also for dealers in investment banks with large structured products businesses.  

# EXAMPLE  

Variance swaps became a very critical part of the risk recycling process for dealers that were running structured products books and had a short correlation exposure to offset. That was a big driver of the growth of the market in the early part of the last decade.  

(Structured Products, April 1, 2010, www.risk.net/1595196)  

The above example refers to dealers in large investment banks who had sold structured products to their clients. Equity structured products, for example, often involved a downside protection to the client. The product would thus pay when markets fell. When markets fall, correlations tend to. rise sharply. This would leave the seller of such products short correlation. Thus one way of hedging such structured product exposure was to go long correlation by means of variance swaps. This is akin to buying protection on unexpected increases in correlations. Who would sell such protection? Before the financial crisis many hedge funds went short correlation. Thus, a hedge fund. would go short a variance swap on an index and go long a variance swap on the constituent stock. This created a short position for the hedge fund and a long position for the dealer. We discuss cor-. relation trading and correlation swaps in more detail in the next chapter..
