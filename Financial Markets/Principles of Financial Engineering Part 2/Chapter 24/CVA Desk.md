# 24.8 CVA DESK  

The incorporation of counterparty risk adjustments into market practice has also affected the internal organization of banks as banks created CVA desks.l2 The rationale for their creation was to move counterparty risk management away from traditional asset classes trading desks by creating a specific counterparty risk trading desk. In principle, the creation of CVA desks could be interpreted as allowing traditional traders to work in a counterparty risk-free world in the same way as they did before the GFC. Some top-tier banks used to have CVA desks for many years before the GFC, but their importance has now grown and CVA desks can now be found in most large banks. One of the incentives to create CVA desks is that it reduces the workload and skill needs of traders. They are freed from the need to be familiar with advanced credit models that are linked to traditional derivatives trading models for different asset classes, as illustrated by the CVA study above. Moreover, the traders do not need to concern themselves with netting details. Finally the CVA desk aggregates counterparty risks across trades, thus enabling the bank to take a view of counterparty risk-related options on the whole portfolio of derivatives transactions.  

The main job of a bank's CVA desks is to manage all counterparty risk for the bank. This implies several functions. First, CVA desks provide CVA/DVA and FVA pricing for trades with counterparties. Second, CVA desks can be involved in trade origination as they advise on structuring trades to minimize credit risk. Typically there is an upfront charge for the trade which contains CVA/DVA and it is allocated to the CVA desk. Thus the CVA desk provides protection to the origination/trading desk. Third, the CVA desk helps to monitor and dynamically hedge market, credit and cross partial risks as well as default risk. Fourth, in case a counterparty defaults, it is typically also the responsibility of the CVA desk to (i) pay the originating desk the exposure coverage, (ii) manage the workout with CDS protection providers, (ii) support trade termination activities, and (iv) maximize the recovery of the remaining trade value..  

Although a CVA desk can in principle address some of these issues related to counterparty risk,.   
one of the implications of incorporating counterparty risk is that there is no such thing as a fair.   
value for derivative transaction since the deal value depends on the counterparty. It also implies.   
that there is no such thing as mark-to-market at the deal level since the mark-to-market depends on   
the rest of the portfolio. Counterparty risk adjustments to some extent invalidate essential.  

assumptions behind risk-neutral valuation, that is market completeness and hedge availability to create a riskless portfolio. Moreover, model risk associated with CVA models is a new issue..  

In practice, there are also some institutional and psychological aspects that affect the efficient functioning of CVA desks. Some traders may question the CVA fees that they have to pay to the CVA desk and be reluctant to cede authority to another unit such as the CVA desk. CVA desks may also give a false sense of security if traders incorrectly assume that counterparty risk can be perfectly hedged away by CVA desks. As we have seen in the previous section, CVA hedges are rather imperfect in practice.
