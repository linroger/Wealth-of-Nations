# 24.2 COUNTERPARTY RISK  

Counterparty risk refers to the risk that a counterparty entering a transaction may default and not honor its payment obligations. In Chapter 2, we discussed how central clearing and CCPs can mitigate the effects of counterparty risk. Therefore, the counterparty risk associated with exchangetraded derivatives, which are always centrally cleared with CCPs, and with centrally cleared OTC transactions is remote since a clearing house guarantees the cash flows promised by the derivative to the counterparties.? However, the majority of derivatives transactions are not centrally cleared which makes counterparty risk adjustments widespread and economically important. How large is the noncentrally cleared derivatives market that requires counterparty risk adjustments? According to recent BIS 2013 Triannual Survey, the OTC segment accounts for around. $90\%$ of the $\$750$ trillion derivatives market in terms of notional amount outstanding. Moreover, only approximately onethird of the OTC's market's notional is cleared via CCPs. Based on the above numbers, we estimate that roughly $\$440$ trillion of the derivatives is not centrally cleared based on 2013 numbers.  

Practitioners were aware of counterparty risk before the GFC, but, compared to other risks, such as market and credit risk, it was considered of second-order importance. There is however evidence that counterparty risk is of first-order importance. The following two motivating examples illustrate counterparty risk-related concepts that we will explain in detail in this chapter. First, mark-tomarket losses due to counterparty risk can exceed mark-to-market losses due to market or credit risk at times as the following reading illustrates.  

# EXAMPLE  

Under Basel II, the risk of counterparty default and credit migration risk were addressed but mark-to-market losses due to credit valuation adjustments (CVA) were not. During the financial crisis, however, roughly. two-thirds of losses attributed to counterparty credit risk were due to CVA losses and only about one-third. were due to actual defaults.  

(Bank for International Settlements, 2011)  

Second, recent profits reported by major banks reflected CVA and DVA adjustments that amount to several billion dollars. The following is just one recent example..  

# EXAMPLE  

Goldman Sachs was the first large U.S. bank to report a third-quarter loss so far this earnings season, and   
its loss was due, in part, to its decision to hedge a potentially large accounting gain. [...]. The company hedged potential gains from its debit valuation adjustment, or DVA, by taking offsetting   
positions through insurance-like contracts called credit default swaps on a basket of other financials. [...].. Goldman's DVA gains in the third quarter totaled $\$450$ million, about $\$300$ million of which was   
recorded under its fixed income, currency and commodities trading segment and another \$150 million   
recorded under equities trading. That amount is comparatively smaller than the $\$1.9$ billion in DVA gains that J.P. Morgan Chase and   
Citigroup each recorded for the third quarter. Bank of America reported $\$1.7$ billion of DVA gains in its.   
investment bank. All three banks were profitable and got a boost from the DVA gains, an accounting   
phenomenon that can reverse in subsequent quarters, given the direction of bond spreads.. (Wall Street Journal, Deal Journal blog, October 18, 2011, "Goldman Sachs Hedge.  

Way to Less Volatile Earnings"' by Liz Moyer and Katy Burne).  

Both of these examples illustrate how important CVA and DVA are in practice. We will discuss these. concepts and how the derivatives industry has become progressively sophisticated in adjusting for counterparty risk in further detail below. Note that the formulae presented in this chapter are for uncollateralized derivatives transactions, but they can be generalized to collateralized deals too, where the CVA will. be smaller and broadly speaking the option term will not be on the residual NPV at default but on the. part of the residual NPV at default (if any) that will not be covered by collateral. This can be due to sudden profit and loss swings, possibly caused by the counterparty default itself or gap risk..
