# 24.10 CONCLUSIONS  

In this chapter, we have reviewed recent innovations in financial engineering and derivatives pricing related to counterparty risk. The discussion has shown that many of the tools from the toolkit developed in previous chapters can be applied in corporate counterparty risk. CVA can be viewed as an option on the residual value of a portfolio upon default. Default probabilities for the calculation of CVA can be backed out from CDS market quotes. Finally, the option to choose the type of eligible collateral also. At the same time, we have seen that this is a very new and complex area and it is likely that practitioners, accountants, regulators, and academics will debate the best way of incorporating counterparty risk into accounting statements, pricing approaches, and bank capital charges for years to come.  

# SUGGESTED READING  

This chapter could only provide a brief summary of the treatment of counterparty risk in financial engineering and derivatives pricing. Brigo et al. (2013) provide one of the best reviews of counterparty risk including detailed examples for each major asset class and a discussion of CVA-CDOs. The discussion in this chapter is partly based on this text. The best source for recent developments in counter-. party risk market practice and thinking is in the form of articles in Risk magazine, which we strongly recommend. For details about the recent debate about the choice of the riskless rate proxy as well as. the merits of FVA, for example, we refer the reader to Risk magazine as well as Hull and White (2014). For recent developments related to model risk in counterparty risk adjustments see Kenyon and Stamm (2012) and Anfuso, Karyampas and Nawroth (2014).
