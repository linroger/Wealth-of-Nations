# 24.6 HEDGING COUNTERPARTY RISK  

The main objectives of hedging CVA and DVA are threefold. First, hedging CVA and DVA allows one to reduce the sensitivity of a bank's profit and loss to changes in the credit spread of the counterparty or the banks' own creditworthiness changes. Second, hedging allows to lock in the CVA position for the duration of the trade with the counterparty. Third, hedging allows a reduction of a CVA exposure. In practice, CVA hedging is not that simple since hedging jump to default risk is difficult and wwR can make separating counterparty risk from other risks impossible.  

# 24.6.1 CVA AND DVA HEDGING IN PRACTICE  

As we saw earlier, DVA and CVA adjustments can amount to billions of dollars in practice. The following reading illustrates this practice.  

# EXAMPLE  

"Asked by an analyst to explain why the company's DVA gains were relatively muted, for a period in which its debt spreads also widened and which, in theory, should have led to a large DVA gain, Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said Tuesday that the company attempts to hedge using a basket of different financials. A Goldman spokesman confirmed that the company did this by selling credit default swaps on a range of financial firms. In selling CDS coverage, a firm is hoping to gain from an improvement in the credit quality of the underlying debt as evidenced by a narrowing in its risk spreads. Goldman wouldn't say what specific financials were in the basket, but Viniar confirmed to the analyst asking the question that the basket contained "a peer group."  

Most would consider peers to Goldman to be other large banks with big investment-banking divisions, including Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and others.  

In Europe, a company could hedge against a range of banks at once through an index of credit. lefault swaps called the iTraxx Europe Senior Financials, administered by Markit. But in the United States, there is no popularly traded index of CDS contracts on financials, so Goldman likely created a. :ustom basket with another dealer.".

The example above also showcases the role of credit derivatives as hedges for DVA gains. What is at first sight counterintuitive is that a deterioration in a bank's credit quality can lead to accounting gains. Although Goldman Sachs denied using CDS on its own name this raised the issue of whether a bank could potentially increase its account profits by taking actions that would reduce its credit-worthiness.  

According to a recent Ernst and Young survey10 based on responses from 19 financial institutions, the most popular instruments to manage and hedge market and credit risk related to CVA are single-name CDS (used by 14 of the 19 respondents) and interest rate and FX products (14 users) to manage market and credit risk relating to CVA. The next most popular hedges are based on index-linked CDS (13 users) and volatility hedges (10 users), while bond-based hedging (8 users) and correlation products (7 users) as well as contingent CDS (CCDS) (6 users) are less popular. Some more recent and advanced approaches to deal with counterparty risk involve CVA-CDOs and margin lending.  

Although CDS can be used for CVA hedging, there are some problems associated with static CDS hedging. The payout from a CDS is fixed and only depends on whether the reference name defaults and not on the amount of the exposure to the counterparty. This can be partly addressed by dynamic hedg-. ing, that is adjusting the CVA position over time and depending on the amount of exposure that one has today. There is also a tradeoff between single-name and index CDS hedges. Single-name hedging. is more precise in case of bad news affecting a single firm rather than broad market moves, but single-name CDS are not available for most counterparties as reference names. Index CDS hedges or other macro hedges are one practical alternative but they represent a rather imperfect hedge against bad news affecting a single firm.  

# 24.6.2 CONTINGENT CDS  

The above hedging limitations associated with vanilla CDS hedging have driven innovation in credit products such as CCDS. Whereas in a simple CDS, a credit event triggers the payment,. in a CCDS, the trigger requires both a credit event and another specified event such as the. level of a particular market or sector variable. A CCDS can be viewed as a derivative which. contains an embedded knock-in option upon the default of the reference transaction. The economic rationale that leads to the development of the CCDS is that it eliminates the economic risk which arises from variations in the credit exposure of a counterparty as a result of deterio-. ration in broader economic market forces. One of the caveats associated with CCDS is, how-. ever, that they are currently not standardized and this implies elevated contractual risks or deliverability risk compared to vanilla CDS. Moreover, in contrast to a vanilla CDS, a CCDS can currently only be used to create a static hedge and not a dynamic hedge, against the counterparty credit risk.
