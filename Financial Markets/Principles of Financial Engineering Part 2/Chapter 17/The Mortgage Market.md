# 17.2 THE MORTGAGE MARKET  

Lenders such as mortgage bankers and commercial banks originate mortgage loans by lending the original funds to a home buyer. This constitutes the primary mortgage market. Primary market. lenders are mortgage banks, savings and loan institutions, commercial banks, and credit unions.  

These lenders then group similar mortgage loans together and sell them to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac-type agencies. This is part of the secondary market which also includes pension funds, insurance companies, and securities dealers.  

Agencies buy mortgages in at least two ways. First, they pay "cash' for mortgages and hold them on their books.' Second, they issue mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) in exchange for pools of mortgages that they receive from lenders. The lenders can in turn either hold these MBSs on their books, or sell them to investors. To the extent that mortgages are converted into MBSs, the purchased mortgage loans are securitized? Agencies guarantee the payment of the principal and. interest. Hence, the "credit risk" is borne by the issuing institution.' We now discuss the engineering of a mortgage deal and the resulting positions. As usual, we use a highly simplified setting..  

# 17.2.1 THE LIFE OF A TYPICAL MORTGAGE  

The process from home buying activity in the US to hedging swaptions is a long one, and it is best to start the discussion by explaining the mechanics of primary and secondary mortgage markets. The implied cash flow diagrams eventually lead to swaption positions. The present section is intended to clarify the sequence of cash flows generated by this activity. We will see that, at the end, the prepayment right amounts to holding a short position on a swaption. This is from the point of view of an institution that holds the mortgage and finances it with a straight fixed rate loan. Essentially, the institution sold an American-style option on buying a fixed payer swap at a predetermined rate. The option is exercised when the future mortgage rates fall below a certain limit.4  

The interrelationships between home buying, mortgage lending, and agency activity are shown. in Figures 17.1-17.3. We go step by step and then put all the positions together in Figure 17.3 to obtain the consolidated position of the mortgage warehouse. We prefer to deal with a relatively. simple case which can then be generalized. Some of these generalizations are straightforward, others involve considerable problems.  

We consider the following setup. A balloon mortgage is issued at time $t_{0}$ 5 The mortgage holder pays only interest and returns the principal at maturity. The mortgage principal is $N_{-}$ the rate is $c_{t_{0}}$ and the mortgage matures at $t_{4}$ . The $t_{i},i=1,...,4.$ is measured in years. We emphasize that, with such a balloon mortgage, the periodic payments are made of interest only and no amortization takes place. This simplifies the engineering and permits the use of plain vanilla interest rate swaps.  

The home buyer makes four interest payments and then pays the $N$ at time $t_{4}$ if he or she does not prepay during the life of the mortgage. On the other hand, if the mortgage rate $c_{t}$ falls below a

threshold level at a future date, the home buyer refinances. We assume that the home buyer can prepay only at time $t_{2}$ . When the loan is paid at time $t_{2}$ , it is replaced by a new mortgage of two periods' that carries a lower rate. This situation is shown in Figure 17.1.  

The bank borrows at the floating LIBOR rate, $L_{t_{i}}$ , and lends at the fixed rate, $c_{t_{0}}$ . Then the mortgage is sold to an agency such as Fannie Mae or to some other mortgage warehouse. The bank will only be an intermediary and earns a fee for servicing mortgage payments.  

The interesting position is that of the agency that ends up with the mortgage. The agency buys. the mortgage and puts it on its books. This forms the asset side of its balance sheet. The issue is how these secondary market purchases are funded. In reality, there is more than one way. Some of the mortgages bought in the secondary market are kept on the books, and funded by issuing agency. securities to investors. Other mortgages are packaged as MBS, and resold to end investors..

# FIGURE 17.2  

Mortgage agency asset and liability side and prepayment risk.  

Suppose in our case the agency uses a 4-year fixed coupon note to secure funding at the rate $c_{t_{0}}$ The liabilities of the agency are shown in Figure 17.2. The asset side is shown in the lower part of this figure. The critical point is the prepayment issue. According to Figure 17.2b, the agency faces a prepayment risk only at time $t_{2}$  

If the home buyer does not refinance, the agency receives four interest payments of size $c_{t_{0}}N$ each, then, at time. $t_{4}$ receives the principal. We assume that the home buyer never defaults.' If, on the other hand, the home buyer pays the last' interest payment $c_{t_{0}}N$ and prepays the principal earlier at time $t_{2}$ , the agency places these funds in a floating rate money market account until time $t_{4}$ The rate would be. $L_{t_{i}}$ . Alternatively, the agency can get into a fixed receiver swap and receive the

swap rate beginning at time. $t_{3}$ . This swap rate is denoted by. $s_{t_{2}}$ . This explains the cash flows faced.   
by the agency in case the home buyer prepays.  

The asset and liability positions of the agency are consolidated in Figure 17.3. We see that all cash flows, except the ones for the prepayment case, cancel. Figure 17.3 shows that if the home buyer prepays, the agency will be long a fixed payer forward swap at the predetermined swap rate. $c_{t_{0}}$ . If no prepayment occurs, the agency will have a flat position..  

Now assume for simplicity, and without much loss of generality, that the swap rates and mortgage rates are equal for all $t\mathrm{.}$  

$$
c_{t}=s_{t}
$$  

Then, the final position of the agency amounts to the following contract.  

The agency has sold the right to enter into a fixed receiver swap at the predetermined rate $c_{t_{0}}$ to a counterparty. The swap notional is $N.$ the option is European,to and the exercise date is $t_{2}$ .The underlying cash swap has a life of 2 years. The agency is short this option, and would be a fixed payer in case the option is exercised.  

This contract is a swaption. The agency has sold an option on a swap contract and is short convexity. The home buyer is the counterparty, and he or she is long convexity. The option is exercised if $s_{t_{2}}\leq c_{t_{0}}$ . The option premium is $S w_{t_{0}}$ .11 It is paid at time $t_{0}$ 12 According to this, we are. ignoring any transaction costs or fees..  

# 17.2.2 HEDGING THE POSITION  

The important point of the exercise in the previous section is that, after all the dust settles, the agency faces prepayment risk and this results in a short swaption position. The short European. swaption position can be hedged in several ways. One option is direct dynamic hedging. The. hedger would (i) first calculate the delta of the swaption, and then, (ii) buy delta units of a 2-year forward-receiver swap with start date $t_{2}$ 13  

After following these steps, the agency will have a short convexity position, which is also a short position on volatility. If volatility increases, the agency suffers losses. In order to eliminate this risk as well, the agency has to buy convexity from the market. Another way to hedge the short swaption position is to issue callable bonds, and buy the convexity directly from the investors.  

# EXAMPLE  

Fannie Mae Callable Benchmark Notes will have a notional of at least US\$500m and a minimum reopening size of US\$1o0m. There will be at least one issue per month and four main structures will be used: a fiveyear, non-call two; a five-year, non-call three; a 10-year, non-call three; and a 10-year, non-call five. The volume and regular issuance pattern of the program is expected to depress volatility. Agencies have always had a natural demand for volatility and this has traditionally been provided by the banking community. But with the invention of the callable benchmark issuance program, agencies have instead started to source volatility from institutional investors.  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1291)  

Finally, as an alternative to eliminate the short swaption position, the agency can buy a similar swaption from the market.  

# 17.2.3 ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND THE MODEL  

The discussion thus far has made some simplifying assumptions, most of which can be relaxed in a straightforward way. Some assumptions are, however, of a fundamental nature. We list these below.  

1. It was assumed that the home buyer could finance only at time. $t_{2}$ . The resulting swaption was, therefore, of European style. Normally, home buyers can finance at all times at. $t_{1},t_{2}$ and $t_{3}$ This complicates the situation significantly. The same cash flow analysis can be done, but the underlying swaption will be of Bermudan style. It will be an option that can be exercised at. dates $t_{1},t_{2}$ , or $t_{3}$ , and the choice of the exercise date is left to the home buyer. This is not a. trivial extension. Bermudan options have no closed-form pricing formulas, and pricing them. requires more advanced techniques. The presence of an interest rate volatility smile complicates things further.  

2. The reader can, at this point, easily "add' derivatives to this setup to create mortgages seen. during the credit crisis of 2007-2008. We assumed, unrealistically, that there was no credit risk. The home buyer, or the agency, had zero default probability in the model discussed. This assumption was made for simplifying the engineering. As the credit crisis of 2007-2008 shows, mortgages can have significant credit risk, especially when they are not of "vanilla" type.  

3. The mortgage was assumed to be of balloon style. Normally, mortgages amortize over a. fixed period of, say, 15 or 30 years. This changes the structure of cash flows shown in. Figures 17.1-17.3. The assumption can be relaxed by moving from the standard plain vanilla swaps to amortizing swaps. This may lead to some interesting financial engineering issues. which are ignored in the present text..  

Finally, there are the issues of transaction costs, fees, and a more general specification of the maturities and settlement periods. These are relatively minor extensions and do not change the main points of the argument.  

# 17.2.4 TW0 RISKS  

According to the preceding discussion, there are two risks associated with prepayments. One is that the bank or the issuing agency will be caught long a payer swap in the case of prepayment. If this happens, the agency would be paying a fixed rate, $c_{t_{0}}$ , for the remainder of the original mortgage maturity, and this $c_{t_{0}}$ will be more than the prevailing fixed receiver swap rate.'4 The agency will face a negative carry of $s_{\tau}-c_{t_{0}}<0$ for the remaining life of the original mortgage, where $\tau$ is the random prepayment date.  

The second risk is more complicated. The agency does not know when the prepayment will hap-. pen. This means that, when mortgages are bought, the agency has to estimate the expected maturity. of the mortgage. Then, based upon this expected maturity, notes with fixed maturity are sold. The liability side has, then, a more or less predictable duration,5 whereas the asset side has an average. maturity that is difficult to calculate. The example below illustrates how such problems can become very serious.  

# EXAMPLE  

As rates rally, mortgage players become more vulnerable to call risk, which leads to a shortening of their asset duration, as occurred in September. "The mortgage supply into the street has been very heavy, so there has been an overall buying of volatility to hedge convexity risk from both Freddie and Fannie," says the chief strategist of a fixed-income derivatives house. The refinancing boom has already caught out some mortgage players. A New Jersey-based arbitrage fund specializing in mortgage securities, announced losses of around \$400 million at the end of October. Analysts say the fund had not adequately hedged itself against the rate rally.  

While some speculated that criticism of Fannie Mae's duration gap-the difference between the maturity of its assets and its liabilities--in the media would lead speculators to position themselves to benefit from the. agency's need to hedge, this was not a serious contributor to the increase in volatility..  

However, with the big increase in its mortgage portfolio, Fannie Mae, and indeed Freddie Mac, which has also been building up its mortgage portfolio, now faces the increased threat of extension risk--the risk of mortgage assets lengthening in duration as yields increase and prepayments decrease.. Fannie Mae's notional derivatives exposure stood at. $\$594.5$ billion at the end of June, while Freddie. reported a total derivatives exposure of $\$1.1$ trillion.  

(Based on an article in Derivatives Week (now part of GlobalCapital).)  

Of the two risks associated with trading and warehousing mortgages, the first is an issue of hedging convexity positions, whereas the second involves the Americanness of the implicit prepayment options.
