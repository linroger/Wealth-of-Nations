# 19.3 EQUITY AS THE DISCOUNTED VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS  

The traditional approach before option pricing models were developed was to view equity as the present discounted value of cash flows to equity holder. The stock or share prices corresponded to the equity value per share. These approaches postulate that expected future cash flows properly discounted should equal the current price. $S_{t}$ Here it is important to note that the discount rate that is. used to discount cash flows is risky and is used under the real-world probability measure. One vari-. ant of this approach is the Dividend Discount Model, for example, which takes dividends to be the. cash flows that equity holds receive..  

The corporation has future dividends per share denoted by $D P S_{t}.$ We can buy one unit of $S_{t}$ to get the title for future dividends. We then use the real-world probability $P$ and the real-world discount rate $k_{t}$ that apply to the dollar dividends paid out by this company to write an equation that is similar to the representation for the coupon bond price:3  

$$
S_{t}=E_{t}^{P}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\frac{D P S_{t+i}}{\prod_{j=1}^{i}(1+k_{t+j})}\right]
$$  

It is worth re-emphasizing that, in this expression, we are using the real-world probability. Thus, the relevant discount rate will differ from the risk-free rate:  

$$
k_{t}\neq r
$$  

How is $k_{t}$ obtained in practice? Various models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT), and others have been proposed. These models form the theoretical foundation for valuation and practitioners use different single or multifactor models to calculate the expected return and discount rate in practice.
