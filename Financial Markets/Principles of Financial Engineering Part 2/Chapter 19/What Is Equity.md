# 19.2 WHAT IS EQUITY?  

Equity holders have a claim to the residual value of a company after creditors have been paid. The traditional approach to equity valuation is to view the price of equity as the present discounted. value of future cash flows. This approach is covered in most standard corporate finance textbooks. and, therefore, we will briefly summarize it without discussing it further.' However, this approach, which discounts cash flows under the real-world probability measure and uses a risky discount rate, does not require any financial engineering. It turns out that there is also a second alternative perspective which views equity as an option on the assets of the firm and which can be used to calculate its value under the risk-neutral measure. The second interpretation is the one that represents an elegant application of financial engineering principles such as option replication and pricing that we discussed in previous chapters and therefore we focus on it in this chapter. From a practitioner. perspective, there is another important reason why the option replication approach to equity valuation is a useful framework. The reason is that it creates a link between the value of equity and bonds and thus between equity and bond markets. In fact, with the existence of liquid credit derivative markets, it can even be used to connect equity, bond, and CDS markets. The reason for these. linkages is that equity can be viewed as an option on the assets of the firm with a strike price equal to the present value of the debt. This leads to a closed-form expression that links equity and bond. prices as well as equity prices and credit spreads. In this equity-to-credit approach, equity market. values can be used to back out default probabilities of the debt.  

Bonds are contracts that promise the delivery of known cash flows, at known dates. Sometimes. these cash flows are floating, but the dates are almost always known, and with floating rate instru-. ments, pricing and risk management is less of an issue. Finally, the owner of a bond is a lender to the institution that issues the bond. This means a certain set of covenants would exist..  

Stocks, on the other hand, entitle the holder to some ownership of the company that issues the instrument.? Thus, the position of the equity holder is similar to that of a partner of. the company, benefiting directly from increasing profits and getting hurt by losses. One of the differences compared to a partnership is however that shareholders of public companies have limited liability.
