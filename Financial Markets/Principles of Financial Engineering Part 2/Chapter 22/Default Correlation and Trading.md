# 22.4 DEFAULT CORRELATION AND TRADING  

Correlation impacts risk assessment and valuation of CDO tranches. Each tranche value reflects correlation in a different way. Perhaps the most interesting correlation relationship is shown in the equity $(0-3\%)$ tranche. This may first appear counterintuitive. It turns out that the higher the corre-. lation, the lower the equity tranche risk, and the higher the value of the tranche. The reasoning. behind this is as follows. Higher correlation makes extreme cases of very few defaults more likely.. Everything else being the same, the more correlation, the lower the risk the investor takes on and the lower premium the investor is going to receive over the lifetime of the tranche..  

The influence of default correlation on the mezzanine tranche is not as clear. In fact, the value. of the mezzanine tranche is less sensitive to default correlation. For the senior tranches, higher correlation of default implies a higher probability that losses will wipe out the equity and mezzanine. tranches and inflict losses on the senior tranche as well. Thus, as default correlation rises, the value of the senior tranche falls. A similar reasoning applies to the super senior tranche..  

Correlation trading is based on this different dependence of the tranche spreads on default correlation. One of the most popular trades of 2004 and the first half of 2005 was to sell the equity. tranche and hedge the default probability movements (i.e., the market risk) by going long the mezzanine index.  

This is a long correlation trade and it had significant positive carry.' The trade also had signifi-. cant (positive) convexity exposure. In fact, as the position holder adjusts the delta hedge, the hedging gains would lead to a gain directly tied to index volatility. Finally, if the carry and convexity are higher, the position's exposure to correlation changes will be higher..  

A long correlation position has two major risks that are in fact related. First, if a single-name. credit event occurs, long correlation positions would realize a loss. This loss will depend on the way the position is structured and will be around. $5-15\%$ . The recovery value of the defaulted. bonds will also affect this number..  

Second, a change in correlation will lead to mark-to-market gains and losses. In fact, the change. in correlation is equivalent to markets changing their view on an idiosyncratic event happening.. A rule of thumb that can be used is that a 100 basis point drop in correlation will lead to a change in the value of a delta-hedged equity tranche by around. $1\%$ . For short equity tranche protection,. long mezzanine tranche protection position this loss would be even larger. This means that the position may suffer significant mark-to-market losses if expected correlation declines. Sometimes these positions need to be liquidated.  

A market participant can go  

long correlation by going either long the equity tranche or short the senior tranche. short correlation by going either short the equity tranche or long the senior tranche..  

Note that the sensitivity to correlation can change through time since it depends on several vari ables, underlying spreads, number of defaults, and time decay..
