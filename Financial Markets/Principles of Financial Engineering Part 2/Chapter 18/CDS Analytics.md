# 18.5 CDS ANALYTICS  

We will discuss the main quantitative tools used in CDS pricing and hedging using a 3-year,. single-name CDS. The idea is to illustrate the way (risk-adjusted) probability of default is obtained and used. Also, we would like to determine the so-called risky Dvol and risky annuity factors.. These factors are used in obtaining hedge ratios during the CDS pricing..  

Let $c d s_{t}$ be rate of a single-name CDS at time $t.$ Let $R$ denote the fixed recovery rate, and $N$ be the notional amount. As usual $B(t_{0},t_{i})$ with $t_{0}<t_{i}$ represents the default-risk free pure discount bond prices at time $t_{0}$ The bonds mature at times $t_{i}$ and have par value of $\$1$ . First we develop the notion of the default probability $p_{t}$ at time $t$
