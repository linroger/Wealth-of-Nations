# 18.9 SOVEREIGN CDS  

The cash flow engineering approach that we used to create synthetic CDS in Section 18.3 applies to any reference asset. In a corporate CDS, the reference asset is a corporate bond. In a sovereign CDS, the reference asset is sovereign debt. There are some special considerations associated with sovereign CDS which we want to highlight and therefore we discuss sovereign CDS in this section. In economic terms, sovereign CDS are also becoming more important. In terms of gross notional amounts the sovereign CDS market in 2012 was $11\%$ of the whole CDS market, but the sovereign CDS market has been growing while the single-name CDS market has been declining since the GFC. We discuss reasons for the decline in the single-name CDS market in Chapters 21 and 22.  

A sovereign CDS can in principle protect investors against losses on sovereign debt if a country restructures or defaults on its debt. Sovereign CDS have four main uses: hedging, speculation, basis trading, and credit risk management.  

First, sovereign CDS are also used as proxy hedges for other types of credit risk, such as financial and nonfinancial corporate bonds. An investor that holds Italian government bonds can buy an Italian sovereign CDS to hedge the credit risk in the Italian government bond.  

Second, sovereign CDS can be used to speculate. A market participant could buy or sell sovereign CDS on a naked basis, that is without an offsetting position in the underlying reference asset. A hedge fund, for example, with a view that Japanese sovereign credit ratings will improve could buy a sovereign CDS on Japanese government debt. CDS differ from traditional insurance in that in principle a purchase of a CDS does not need to own the reference asset. Expressing a view about the evolution of a country's credit rating could be achieved by using other financial markets such as cash bond markets or interest rate futures, but these alternatives reflect other types of risk in addition to sovereign credit risk.  

Naked CDS positions are banned in some markets. As a result of the rising influence of the sovereign CDS market, concerns have been voiced about whether speculative uses of sovereign CDS could be destabilizing. Since 2012, as part of the EU regulation "Short Selling and Certain Aspects of Credit Default Swaps" naked CDS on the debt of European Economic Area countries are banned. Liquidity in the sovereign CDS market had started to decrease ahead of the ban, but proving that the ban caused liquidity to decrease is made difficult by various other events and policy announcements at the same time. Some market participants have closed even covered CDS positions following the ban because of ambiguity in the hedge rules in the regulation. There are alternative instruments that can be used to hedge sovereign risk such as some corporate CDS contracts and bond futures but these proxy hedges are likely to be more expensive and less precise.  

Third, as we saw in Section 18.3, CDS, together with IRSs and FRNs can be used to replicate the cash flows of the underlying asset. Therefore, sovereign CDS can be used for basis trading, that is exploiting mispricing between the sovereign CDS and the underlying government bond. If the sovereign CDS spread is narrower than the credit spread of the underlying debt, that is if the basis is negative, arbitrageurs may be able to profitably buy the debt and buy CDS protection.  

Fourth, sovereign CDS are important credit risk management tools and sovereign CDS premia are widely used as market indicators of credit risk. Figure 18.6 shows an example of how CDS. spreads can be used as risk and default probability indicators. The figure shows a screenshot from Bloomberg which shows the implied 1-year default probability in percent for a range of reserve. currency and nonreserve currency sovereign credits on July 2, 2014. The default probabilities are. derived from the CDS spreads with are reported in the columns to the right. The 5-year CDS spread. for Greece is 455 bps or $4.55\%$ and the implied annual default probability for Greece on that day is $9.5\%$ . Note however that this probability is lower than the highest probability that had been reached. historically, which according to the screenshot was around $27\%$  

Dealer banks act as market makers and dominate the sovereign CDS market on the buy and the sell side. The banks' exposure to sovereign risk arises from their direct holdings of sovereign debt as well as counterparty credit risk associated with their derivatives trades with countries. Historically, sovereigns did not post collateral on a mark-to-market basis related to their OTC derivatives positions in interest rate and cross-currency derivatives for example. As a result dealer

banks have counterparty risk exposure on these OTC contracts in which sovereigns are counterparties and sovereign CDS can be used to hedge the counterparty risk..  

Argentina is an interesting name to be associated with the CDS market because of the large size of the default and the ongoing legal proceedings regarding Argentina's debt. The following deals with Argentina, where the CDS rate was around. $40\%$ for 1 year around the default period..  

# EXAMPLE  

One-year Argentina credit default swap mid-levels hit 4,000 bp late last week, though the highest trade in   
the sovereign is thought to have been a one-year deal at 2,350 bp early in the week.. Derivatives market-makers were cautiously quoting default swap prices on an extremely wide bid/offer   
spread (the two-year Argentina mid rose to around 3,900 bp), but mostly concentrated on balancing cash.   
market hedges, which did not prove easy. Dealers who have sold protection also consulted their lawyers to plot tactics in the event that Argentina.   
defaults, or restructures its debt. It is likely that more than US\$1bn of credit default protection on Argentina   
has traded in the last few years, which could result in the biggest default swap payout yet, if there is a.  

clear-cut default or debt restructuring. There is plenty of scope for disagreement on whether or not the. payout terms of swaps have been met, however, depending on how any debt restructuring is handled by the Argentine authorities.  

Pricing default swaps when a payout trigger could be hours away is an art, not a science. Late last week traders were working from the closing price on Thursday of Argentina's FRBs of 63.5, which was the equivalent of 3,060 bp over LIBOR, then adding a $30{-}40\%$ basis for the theoretical risk of writing a default swap, as opposed to the asset swap value of a bond trade. For much of this year, traders have been using a default against asset swap basis of around $10\%$ of the total spread for deals in Latin American sovereigns.

Following the events described in the reading above, Argentina defaulted on a total of UsD 93 billion of external debt on December 26, 2001. The following article summarizes the lengthy legal proceedings and impact on CDS markets in the subsequent years up to 2014 and provides valuable lessons.  

# EXAMPLE  

ISDA Asked If Event Clause Triggered on Argentina Debt Swaps The International Swaps & Derivatives Association said it was asked to rule whether a clause in credit-.   
default swaps on Argentina has been triggered after the government said it won't make bond interest   
payments.[...] Argentina is negotiating with creditors, who refused to accept restructured debt after its default in 2001,.   
following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week requiring full payment. The ruling blocks interest payments.   
on restructured bonds until holdout creditors are paid. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's.   
government said it's unable to pay all claims.[...]. The government owes $\$900$ million in interest on June 30 for bonds issued as part of restructurings in   
2005 and 2010. The New York judge's order requires Argentina to pay creditors, including billionaire Paul   
Singer's Elliott Management Corp., $\$1.5$ billion on defaulted debt before it's allowed to make the interest   
payments. Fernandez says the nation could owe as much as \$15 billion if forced to pay all holders of defaulted   
bonds on the same terms, which would deplete more than half of its foreign reserves.[...] The government defaulted on a record $\$95$ billion debt in 2001, replacing the defaulted bonds with new   
ones at a discount in two restructurings. Holdouts have fought for full payment on the defaulted bonds.   
Argentina had vowed never to pay the holdouts, calling them "vultures" and refusing to pay U.S. court   
judgments in their favor.. Argentina's debt is the world's most expensive to insure, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It   
cost $\$3.4$ million upfront and $\$500,000$ annually to protect $\$10$ million of Argentina's debt for five years,.   
signaling a 64 percent chance of default within that time, according to CMA. There were 2,602 credit-default swaps contracts covering a net \$906 million of Argentina's debt   
outstanding as of June 13, according to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.. (Bloomberg, June 23, 2014)  

The legal wrangling regarding the payment of creditors by Argentina in $2013-2014$ led to gyrations in the CDS spread and implied default probability. Figure 18.7 shows the annual probability of default for Argentina implied by 5-year CDS spreads and under the assumption of a $40\%$ recovery rate. In the

figure, the dashed line and $y$ -axis on the right show the default probability while the solid line and. y-axis on the left show the CDS spread. In August 2014, ISDA determined that Argentina's failure to pay its sovereign bonds was a credit event, triggering a payout to holders of credit default swap..  

The sovereign debt stress in the euro area following the GFC has again raised concerns about the reliability and usefulness of sovereign CDS. Between June 2005 and April 2013, there were 103 CDS credit events but only two sovereign CDS credit events in which settlements were publicly documented. The March 2012 Greece debt exchange was an example that highlighted the potential complexity of sovereign CDS credit event triggering and settlement. About 200 million in Greek government bonds (GGBs) were exchanged against new GGBs making this the largest sovereign restructuring event in history. European governments had concerns about the effect of a Greek debt default on European banks. Therefore, governments attempted to delay the triggering of the associated credit event. These actions however undermined confidence in the CDS market and raise questions about the effectiveness of sovereign CDS. The effectiveness of CDS protection depends on two main things. The first is whether the event responsible for the losses triggers the CDS payout. The second is whether the payout offsets the losses if the CDS is triggered. The April 2013 IMF Global Financial Stability report notes that it is a fortunate coincidence that the new GGBs were trading at about $22\%$ of par going into the CDS settlement, which was the same price. that the old GGBs were trading at before the exchange. This implied that the settlement resulted in sovereign CDS payouts roughly in line with losses incurred in the debt exchange. Since this result for a fortunate coincidence for debt and CDS holders, the associated uncertainty led to a rethinking. of alternative settlement mechanisms such as delivering a package of new instruments in proportion to the instruments that they replace..
