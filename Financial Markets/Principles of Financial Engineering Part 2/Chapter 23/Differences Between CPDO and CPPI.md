# 23.6 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CPDO AND CPPI  

One of the more recent structured products that is sometimes described as sharing similarities with CPPI is called constant proportion debt obligation (CPDO). However, the two structures are very.   
different and here we briefly contrast CPDO and CPPI to clear up any potential confusion. It is true.   
that the CPDO approaches share some common features with CPPI products, but there are also.   
important differences which imply that CPDOs are not really an example of principal protection.  

products. What CPDOs have in common with CPPI structures is that they use a constant proportion approach to determining the leverage and they both rebalance the portfolio between a risky (credit) asset and the safe asset. As the name indicates, CPDOs are applied to credit indices such as iTraxx or CDX. There are two important differences between CPDO and CPPI structures. One of the selling points of CPDO is to try to achieve a high yield for investors. This is attempted by using a relatively high level of leverage. In contrast to CPPI, however, leverage in CPDO structures will be increased when the net asset value of the portfolio decreases and falls below the target level. If the net asset value of the portfolio rises and comes close to the target amount, leverage will be reduced. The way that CPPI products achieve principal protection is by guaranteeing the zerocoupon bond to the investor, while making the seller of the CPPI bear any losses. In a CPDO, on the other hand, there is no guaranteed principal protection. If the underlying risky asset that the CPDO invests in performs well, the investor receives promised coupon and principal payments, but if the asset does not perform well, only the remaining amount is paid to the investor and this may be less than the principal invested at the beginning. Another important difference between CPPI and CPDO is that different strategies are used to realize the intended performance. At inception the value of the CPDO is below the target portfolio value and the CPDO structure will at each time take risk exposure proportional to the amount the CPDO portfolio is lacking in order to reach the target value. This is in contrast to the CPPI structure which will take risk exposure positions depending on the amount of surplus the portfolio value has with respect to the floor value. The above discussion shows conceptually that CPDO structures do not offer the same protection as CPPI structures. This was also illustrated in real life as the GFC led to poor performance and closure of many CPDO structures.
