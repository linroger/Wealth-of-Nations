# 23.7 A VARIANT: THE DPPI  

Dynamic portfolio insurance (DPPI) methodology is a variation of the CPPI. The difference is that leverage is not constant but can change over time. Here is a brief example from the markets..  

# EXAMPLE  

LONDON, June 14 (Reuters)PIMCO, one of the world's biggest bond funds, has joined forces with Goldman Sachs to launch a range of derivative products. The investments include principal protected and leveraged structures aimed at institutional investors, high net worth individuals and private banks.  

The main product, launched under PIMCO is a principle protected investment based on. Goldman's Variable Proportion Portfolio Protection, similar to the better-known CPPI technology.  

The leverage ratio $\lambda_{t_{i}}$ which was constant during the CPPI adjustments can be made variable and becomes one of the unknowns to be determined. The structurer needs to provide an algorithm to do this. The idea is that the leverage ratio can be made to depend on some variables that one thinks are relevant to the problem under consideration in some optimal fashion. In particular, the exposure to the risky asset may depend on.  

1. The past behavior of the returns   
2. The volatility of the returns   
3. The liquidity observed in the market for the underlying asset, since the methodology is heavily   
dependent on the correct rebalancing   
4. And upon the so-called gap risk.  

Finally, another relevant variable may the dependence of $\lambda_{t_{i}}$ on the swap curve parameters. The scenarios discussed above illustrated the importance of this. Note that this may be even more relevant for the credit market CPPI notes.  

In DPPI, the allocation between the risky asset and cash is dynamically managed with a variable. leverage ratio that will depend on one or more of these factors. Supposedly, the CPPI exposure to the ris-. ky asset increases when things "go well," and decreases when things "go badly."' At the outset, a variable leverage ratio seems to be better able to handle changes in the yield curve environment than the classical CPPI procedures. For example, the leverage ratio $\lambda_{t_{i}}$ may go down during high-volatility periods and. may go up during low-volatility periods. The response to changes in the market liquidity could be similar.
