# 23.8 APPLICATION OF CPPI IN THE INSURANCE SECTOR: ICPPI  

CPPI techniques continue to be applied in different financial sectors despite the turmoil related to credit-linked CPPI products during the GFC. One example of the application of CPPI techniques is the insurance sector. The difficult economic climate following the GFC also affected the insurance. sector and many insurance firm customers have become more cautious. There is still demand for guaranteed products that include upside participation. The UK's with profit or traditional variable annuity (VA) products typically included restrictions on protection levels and fund choices. Customers are now asking for less restrictive guaranteed products with upside participation. In response, insurance firms are exploring a variation on CPPI-type structures. Insurance companies compete with other financial services such as banks for long-term savings customers, but prefer not. to offer products that add risks to their own balance sheets or require expensive hedges based on derivatives. CPPI solutions have been applied in several countries' insurance sectors. In Japan, insurers employ them to match guarantees embedded in VA policies. In Germany they were popular in $2006{-}2007$ since they allowed insurers to circumvent restrictive investment rules for insurance companies that attempted to offer state-subsidised "Riester' pension products.  

Traditional CPPI products however had several drawbacks. If the performance of the underlying. risk asset resulted in the portfolio becoming cash-locked, investors missed out on future performance since the return reverted to the guaranteed level. This occurred in many instances during the. GFC which implied that CPPI investors did not get the returns that they were expecting..  

The market has responded to the problems related to the path-dependent nature of traditional CPPI structures by innovating and producing so-called individual constant proportion portfolio insurance (ICPPI). ICPPI products are customized for each policyholder and provide discretion on the level of the account floor, the duration of the contract and the choice of risky assets within the CPPI structure.  

Another innovation found in some ICPPI products addresses the issue of rebalancing costs. As discussed earlier, traditional CPPI require regular rebalancing (between risky assets such as physical equities and safe assets) which incurs costs. To address this issue some ICPPI providers use derivatives to create quasi-synthetic portfolios that replicate equity movements without the need for purchases of physical equities. One drawback of this innovation is however that it introduces counterparty risk as well as market risk into ICPPI products. Insurers using such ICPPI structures consequently need to adapt their risk management practices related to counterparty risk, a topic that is discussed in the next chapter.  

The following CPPI application example is from the insurance sector.  

# EXAMPLE  

Asset management firm Allianz Global Investors is already using ICPPI structures. Kai Wallbaum,   
Frankfurt-based head of retail and life/asset solutions at the firm, says "We have installed an operational.   
platform where we are able to manage on an individual account basis certain algorithmic strategies. One of   
the approaches clients often ask for is this individual CPPI, where we can manage a certain dynamic risk.   
approach for each customer and provide a custom guarantee as well.". (Insurance Risk, 9 May 2013, "Insurers eye CPPI structures for next generation of savings products", www.risk.net/2266887.)  

Another solution to the cash-lock scenario is to create an ICPPI product that is partly invested in a core insurance fund and partly invested in a third-party fund which contains its own guarantee level and. allocations are changed between the two relatively infrequently, for example on a monthly instead of a daily basis. The guarantee from the third-party fund could be against decreases in the NAV by. $80\%$ , for example, and this provides protection against locking in a low return while reducing operational and rebalancing costs. The following example describes one such product that was launched in 2012.  

# EXAMPLE  

Italian banking group Unicredit is one provider offering such a solution. The group pioneered an ICPPI   
product in 2012 called Green, aimed at its private banking clients, and achieved such success with this that   
it is now looking to partner with insurance providers to explore opportunities in other countries.. A further challenge for insurers is raising awareness around the products and dispelling the notion that   
long-term guarantees are not worth their price tag. "A lot of insurers are still at the concept stage when it   
comes to developing new products and customers are not yet at a place where they can understand the cost  
benefit of ICPPIs," [...] (Insurance Risk, 9 May 2013, "Insurers eye CPPI structures for next generati of savings products". www.risk.net/226688  

The reading illustrates that one of the motivations for the use of CPPI techniques by insurance companies is to avoid the costs of expensive derivatives such as options used in OBPI approaches.  

As our review of CPPI structures showed in earlier sections, CPPI algorithms can be customized and depending on an investor's risk aversion, the cushion can be set at a particular level. Some insurers have implemented systems to offer tailor-made CPPI specifications. Some of the issues of CPPI are highlighted. As the risky asset in the CPPI structure declines, for example, the funds are placed in a safe deposit or bond permanently and this provides principal protection but also prevents pensioners from benefiting from future market recoveries. The reading also provides an illustration of the dynamic rebalancing mechanisms that we discussed earlier. Rebalancing incurs transaction costs and these costs are higher for physical assets than derivatives. Derivatives on the other hand introduce counterparty risk, which is something that we cover in detail in the subsequent chapter.
