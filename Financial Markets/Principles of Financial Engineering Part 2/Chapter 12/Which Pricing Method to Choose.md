# 12.7 WHICH PRICING METHOD TO CHOOSE?  

In general, the choice of a pricing method depends on the following factors:  

The accuracy of pricing methods does, in general, differ. Some methods are numerically more stable than others. Some methods yield coarser approximations than others. Precision is an important factor. The speed of pricing methods also changes from one method to another. In general, everything else being the same, the faster results are preferred.. Some methods are easier to implement. The ease of understanding a pricing method is an important factor in its selection by practitioners.. The parsimony associated with the model is also important. In general, we want our pricing. models to depend on as few parameters as possible. This way, the model has to be calibrated to a smaller number of parameters, which means that fewer things can go wrong. Also, a trader/ broker can in general compensate for a parsimonious model by adjusting the quotes based on trading experience.  

However, in the end, the method chosen depends on the circumstances and is a matter of experience. What a book like this can do is to present a brief overview of the various approaches available to the financial engineer.
