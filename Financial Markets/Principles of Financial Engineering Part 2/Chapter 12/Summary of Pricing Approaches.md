# 12.2 SUMMARY OF PRICING APPROACHES  

In this section, we remind the reader of some important issues from earlier chapters. Suppose we. want to find the fair market price of an instrument. First, we construct a synthetic equivalent to this instrument using liquid contracts that trade in financial markets. Clearly, this requires that such contracts are indeed available. Second, once these liquid contracts are found, an arbitrage argument. is used. The cost of the replicating portfolio should equal the cost of the instrument we are trying. to price. Third, a trader would add a proper margin to this cost and thus obtain the fair price..  

In earlier chapters, we obtained synthetics for forward rate agreements (FRAs), foreign. exchange (FX) forwards, and several other quasi-linear instruments. Each of these constitutes an early example of asset pricing. Obtain the synthetic and see how much it costs. By adding a profit to this cost, the fair market price is obtained. It turns out that we can extend this practical approach and obtain a general theory.  

It should be reemphasized that pricing and hedging efforts can sometimes be regarded as two sides of the same coin. In fact, hedging a product requires finding a replicating portfolio and then using it to cover the position in the original asset. If the trader is long in the original instrument, he or she would be short in the synthetic, and vice versa. This way, exposures to risks would cancel out and the position would become "riskless." This process results in the creation of a replicating portfolio whose cost cannot be that different from the price of the original asset. Thus, a hedge will. transfer unwanted risks to other parties but, at the same time, will provide a way to price the original asset.3  

Pricing theory is also useful for the creation of "new products.' A new product is basically a series of contingent cash flows. We would, first, put together a combination of financial instruments that have the same cash flows. Then, we would write a separate contract and sell these cash flows to others under a new name. For example, a strip of FRAs or futures can be purchased and resulting cash flows are then labeled a swap and sold to others. The new product is, in fact, a dynamically maintained portfolio of existing instruments, and its fair cost will equal the sum of the price of its constituents.
