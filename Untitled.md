>
> The course covers a broad range of theories,  concepts,  and frameworks essential for understanding financial instruments,  with a particular focus on derivatives. Key areas of knowledge include:
>
> ### **DERIVATIVE PRICING MODELS**
>
> - **No-Arbitrage Pricing:** A fundamental principle that underpins the pricing of derivatives. It ensures that prices of financial instruments are consistent across markets and prevents arbitrage opportunities.
>
> - **Binomial Tree Model:** A discrete-time model for pricing options that allows for the analysis of complex derivatives through stepwise simulations of price movements.
>
> - **Black-Scholes-Merton Model:** A continuous-time model for option pricing that is widely used in financial markets. The model provides a closed-form solution for European option prices and serves as the foundation for much of modern financial theory.
>
> - **Risk-Neutral Pricing:** A methodology for pricing derivatives that assumes investors are indifferent to risk,  making it a key concept for valuing financial instruments in arbitrage-free markets.
>
> ### **FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES**
>
> - **Forwards and Futures:** Contracts that allow for the buying or selling of an asset at a predetermined future date and price. The course covers the pricing and hedging of these instruments,  as well as their strategic uses.
>
> - **Swaps:** Agreements to exchange cash flows,  such as interest rate swaps or currency swaps. The course delves into the pricing and applications of swaps in risk management.
>
> - **Options:** Contracts that provide the right,  but not the obligation,  to buy or sell an asset. The course examines various types of options,  including calls,  puts,  American options,  and exotic options,  with a focus on their pricing and strategic uses.
>
> - **Credit Derivatives:** Instruments such as credit default swaps (CDS) that allow for the transfer of credit risk. The course explores the pricing and risk management implications of these derivatives.
>
> ### **RISK MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING**
>
> - **Delta Hedging:** A technique used to manage the risk of options positions by adjusting the portfolio to remain neutral to small price movements in the underlying asset.
>
> - **Dynamic Replication:** The process of replicating the payoff of a derivative by continuously adjusting a portfolio of the underlying asset and risk-free bonds.
>
> - **Value at Risk (VaR):** A measure used to assess the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a given time frame due to market movements.
>
> ### **EMPIRICAL ISSUES AND APPLICATIONS**
>
> - **Implied Volatility:** The market’s expectation of volatility,  derived from option prices,  which can be used to assess market sentiment and for pricing other derivatives.
>
> - **Financial Engineering:** The creation of new financial products by combining existing derivatives,  such as structured securities or yield-enhancing strategies.
>
> - **Exotic Options:** Complex options with non-standard features,  such as barrier options or Asian options,  which require advanced pricing techniques.
