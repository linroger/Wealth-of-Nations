1. Background of HomeMax Inc.

Company Overview:

HomeMax Inc. is a regional home supply retailer operating in the northwestern United States. It specializes in upscale appliances and fixtures, offering superior interior design services to differentiate itself from competitors like Home Depot and Lowe’s. By targeting high-end customers, HomeMax carved out a profitable niche in the market.

2. The Acquisition by Train & Co.

Details of the Acquisition

In late 2003, Train & Co., a reputable private equity firm, acquired HomeMax for $562.5 million. The acquisition was strategic, aiming to capitalize on the recovering economy post the 2000-2002 recession.

Financing Structure

The acquisition was financed through a combination of debt and equity:
	1.	First Lien Loan (Secured Bank Debt): $200 million
	2.	Senior Notes (Unsecured Debt): $100 million
	3.	Equity Contribution by Train: $262.5 million
	4.	Assumed Liabilities: $75 million

Total Sources and Uses:
	     - 	Total Sources: $562.5 million
	     - 	Total Uses: $562.5 million (including cash, working capital, and goodwill)

Valuation Calculations

Operating Performance at Acquisition (2003):

	     - 	Revenue: $500 million
	     - 	Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): $350 million
	     - 	Gross Profit (Operating Income): $150 million
	     - 	Selling, General & Administrative Expenses (SG&A): $75 million
	     - 	Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA): $75 million
	     - 	Net Income: $30.6 million

Valuation Multiple:

	     - 	EBITDA Multiple Paid: 7.5x
	     - 	Calculation: Purchase Price / EBITDA = $562.5 million / $75 million = 7.5x

Rationale:

	     - 	The multiple of 7.5x EBITDA was consistent with industry standards at the time.
	     - 	The valuation reflected the company’s strong financial performance and growth potential.

3. Expansion and Subsequent Distress

Acquisition of HomeLux

In 2006, Train & Co. aimed to expand HomeMax’s operations into Northern California by acquiring HomeLux, a similar retailer with significant growth potential.

HomeLux’s 2006 Operating Performance:

	     - 	Revenue: $500 million
	     - 	EBITDA: $60 million
	     - 	EBITDA Margin: 12%

Financing of the Acquisition

The acquisition price for HomeLux was $540 million, representing a multiple of 9.0x EBITDA.

Financing Structure:

	1.	Additional First Lien Loan: $50 million
	2.	New Second Lien Loan: $150 million
	3.	New Senior Notes: $125 million
	4.	Equity Contribution by Train: $145 million
	5.	Assumed Liabilities: $70 million

Valuation Multiple:

	     - 	EBITDA Multiple Paid: 9.0x
	     - 	Calculation: Purchase Price / EBITDA = $540 million / $60 million = 9.0x

Rationale:

	     - 	Train & Co. believed that synergies from integrating HomeLux would quickly improve its EBITDA margins to match HomeMax’s 19%.
	     - 	The higher multiple reflected the anticipated operational improvements and strategic benefits.

Integration Challenges

	     - 	Integration issues arose, requiring more capital expenditures than planned.
	     - 	The onset of the housing market collapse in late 2007 severely impacted revenues and profitability.

4. Onset of Financial Distress

Financial Performance Analysis (2007-2011)

Let’s examine HomeMax’s financial performance post-acquisition:

Revenue and EBITDA Trends:

Year	Revenue ($ millions)	% Change in Revenue	EBITDA ($ millions)	EBITDA Margin (%)
2007	1,264.9	-	139.1	11.0%
2008	1,011.9	-20.0%	70.8	7.0%
2009	860.1	-15.0%	51.6	6.0%
2010	868.7	1.0%	52.1	6.0%
2011	886.1	2.0%	79.75	9.0%

Key Observations:

	     - 	Significant revenue declines in 2008 and 2009 due to the housing market collapse.
	     - 	EBITDA margins dropped from 11.0% in 2007 to as low as 6.0% in 2009 and 2010.
	     - 	Modest recovery in 2011, with EBITDA improving to $79.75 million.

Key Financial Ratios

	     - 	Leverage Ratio (2011): Total Debt / EBITDA = $625 million / $79.75 million ≈ 7.8x
	     - 	Interest Coverage Ratio (2011): EBITDA / Interest Expense = $79.75 million / $47 million ≈ 1.7x
	     - 	Free Cash Flow (2011): $10.75 million (positive after two years of negative cash flow)

Rationale:

	     - 	The high leverage ratio indicates significant financial risk.
	     - 	The low interest coverage ratio suggests potential difficulty in meeting interest obligations.
	     - 	The slight improvement in free cash flow signals operational recovery but may not be sufficient to service existing debt.

5. Financial Analysis and Distress Assessment

Operating Performance Breakdown

Revenue Analysis:

	     - 	The decline in revenues from 2007 to 2009 reflects the impact of the housing market downturn.
	     - 	The modest growth in 2010 and 2011 suggests stabilization but not a return to pre-crisis levels.

EBITDA Margin Analysis:

	     - 	The drop in EBITDA margins indicates increased operating inefficiencies, possibly due to integration issues with HomeLux and fixed costs not scaling down with revenue declines.
	     - 	The improvement in 2011 suggests that some operational challenges are being addressed.

Balance Sheet Examination

Assets:

	     - 	Cash: Increased to $28.6 million by the end of 2011.
	     - 	Accounts Receivable and Inventory: Reduced, possibly due to tighter working capital management.
	     - 	Goodwill: Remains high at $728.3 million, indicating potential impairment risk.

Liabilities:

	     - 	Accounts Payable: Reduced, which may impact supplier relationships.
	     - 	Total Debt: Remains unchanged at $625 million, indicating no debt reduction efforts.

Capital Structure Analysis

Debt Maturities:

	     - 	First Lien Loan ($250 million) and Second Lien Loan ($150 million): Both maturing on 12/31/2012.
	     - 	Senior Notes ($225 million): Maturing in 2014 and 2015.

Leverage Analysis:

	     - 	Total Debt: $625 million
	     - 	EBITDA (2011): $79.75 million
	     - 	Leverage Ratio: 7.8x (Total Debt / EBITDA)

Rationale:

	     - 	The high leverage ratio is unsustainable and poses refinancing challenges.
	     - 	Imminent debt maturities with low prospects of refinancing due to market conditions and overleverage.

Identification of Key Issues

	1.	Overleveraged Capital Structure: The company cannot service its existing debt with current EBITDA levels.
	2.	Liquidity Concerns: Imminent maturities of $400 million in secured debt with slim refinancing prospects.
	3.	Underwater Equity: The enterprise value is less than total debt, implying that Train & Co.’s equity investment is worthless in the current state.
	4.	Operational Risks: While there is some improvement, the company faces uncertainties in fully recovering to previous performance levels.

6. The Three-Step Restructuring Process

To address HomeMax’s distress and assess it as a potential investment, we’ll follow the three-step restructuring process:

Step 1: Valuation of HomeMax’s Assets

Enterprise Value Estimation

Methodology:

	     - 	Use the EBITDA multiples method, which is common in valuing companies like HomeMax.
	     - 	Select an appropriate EBITDA multiple based on industry standards and current market conditions.

Calculations:

	1.	Determine 2011 EBITDA:
	     - 	EBITDA (2011): $79.75 million
	2.	Select an Appropriate EBITDA Multiple:
	     - 	Based on the market conditions and similar companies, we use a multiple of 7.0x.
	     - 	Rationale: Although multiples were higher in previous years, the current market is more conservative due to economic uncertainties.
	3.	Calculate Enterprise Value (EV):
	     - 	EV = EBITDA × Multiple
	     - 	EV = $79.75 million × 7.0 = $558.25 million

Recovery Analysis

Determine the Amount Available for Debt Holders:

	     - 	The EV represents the total value available to satisfy the claims of all capital providers.

Compare EV to Outstanding Debt:

	     - 	Total Debt: $625 million
	     - 	EV ($558.25 million) < Total Debt ($625 million)
	     - 	This indicates that the company’s assets are insufficient to cover all debt obligations.

Identifying the Fulcrum Security

Capital Structure Hierarchy:

	1.	First Lien Loan (1L): $250 million (Senior Secured)
	2.	Second Lien Loan (2L): $150 million (Junior Secured)
	3.	Senior Notes: $225 million (Unsecured)
	4.	Equity: Held by Train & Co.

Recovery Waterfall:

	1.	First Lien Loan Recovery:
	     - 	Claim: $250 million
	     - 	Available EV: $558.25 million
	     - 	Recovery: Full ($250 million < $558.25 million)
	2.	Second Lien Loan Recovery:
	     - 	Claim: $150 million
	     - 	Remaining EV after 1L: $558.25 million - $250 million = $308.25 million
	     - 	Recovery: Full ($150 million < $308.25 million)
	3.	Senior Notes Recovery:
	     - 	Claim: $225 million
	     - 	Remaining EV after 1L and 2L: $308.25 million - $150 million = $158.25 million
	     - 	Recovery: Partial ($158.25 million < $225 million)
	     - 	Recovery Percentage: $158.25 million / $225 million ≈ 70%

Conclusion:

	     - 	The Senior Notes are the fulcrum security, as they are the class where the debt begins to be impaired and will likely receive equity in a restructuring.

Step 2: Determining the Appropriate Capital Structure

Assessing Debt Capacity

Objective:

	     - 	Determine a sustainable level of debt that the company can support post-restructuring.

Methodology:

	     - 	Use industry benchmarks for leverage ratios.
	     - 	Consider the company’s future EBITDA projections and market conditions.

Calculations:

	1.	Select a Target Leverage Ratio:
	     - 	Industry standards suggest a leverage ratio of 3.0x to 3.5x EBITDA is sustainable.
	     - 	Choose 3.5x for this case, given the company’s recovery signs.
	2.	Calculate Debt Capacity:
	     - 	Debt Capacity = EBITDA × Target Leverage Ratio
	     - 	Debt Capacity = $79.75 million × 3.5 = $279.125 million
	     - 	Round down to $275 million for simplicity and conservatism.

Capital Structure Optimization

Proposed New Capital Structure:

	1.	New First Lien Loan:
	     - 	Amount: $275 million
	     - 	Purpose: Refinance the existing 1L debt and provide working capital.
	2.	Conversion of 2L and Senior Notes to Equity:
	     - 	2L Lenders: Exchange debt for a combination of cash and equity.
	     - 	Senior Note Holders: Exchange debt for equity.
	     - 	Rationale: Reduces debt burden and aligns stakeholders’ interests in the company’s success.
	3.	Equity Allocation:
	     - 	Train & Co.: Retain a minimal equity stake to incentivize cooperation.
	     - 	Management: Grant equity to retain key personnel and motivate performance.

Benefits:

	     - 	Reduced Debt Service Obligations: Lower interest payments improve cash flow.
	     - 	Improved Financial Stability: A more manageable debt load reduces bankruptcy risk.
	     - 	Alignment of Interests: Creditors become equity holders, aligning their interests with the company’s success.

Step 3: Executing the Restructuring Plan

Negotiation Strategies

Engage with Stakeholders:

	     - 	Open communication with all creditor classes is essential.
	     - 	Understand each group’s priorities and constraints.

Key Negotiation Points:

	1.	First Lien Lenders (1L):
	     - 	Offer: Full repayment through refinancing.
	     - 	Objective: Secure their agreement to avoid default and maintain operations.
	2.	Second Lien Lenders (2L):
	     - 	Offer: Partial cash payment and equity in the reorganized company.
	     - 	Objective: Achieve full recovery through combined cash and equity value.
	3.	Senior Note Holders:
	     - 	Offer: Equity stake in the reorganized company.
	     - 	Objective: Maximize recovery and avoid the costs and uncertainties of bankruptcy.
	4.	Train & Co.:
	     - 	Offer: Retain a small equity stake.
	     - 	Objective: Incentivize cooperation and expedite the restructuring process.
	5.	Management:
	     - 	Offer: Equity grants.
	     - 	Objective: Retain key personnel and align their interests with the company’s performance.

Overcoming Potential Obstacles

Holdout Problem:

	     - 	Issue: Some creditors may refuse to participate, hoping for full repayment later.
	     - 	Solution: Structure the deal to make non-participation less attractive, such as:
	     - 	Conditioning the exchange offer on a high participation rate.
	     - 	Offering better terms for early participants.
	     - 	Highlighting the risks of bankruptcy if the restructuring fails.

Legal and Regulatory Considerations:

	     - 	Ensure compliance with securities laws and contractual obligations.
	     - 	May require consent from existing equity holders for issuing new shares.

7. Stakeholder Negotiations and Dynamics

Perspectives of Each Stakeholder Group

First Lien Lenders (1L)

	     - 	Position: Senior secured creditors with collateral coverage.
	     - 	Expectations: Full repayment with minimal risk.
	     - 	Negotiation Leverage: High, as they can enforce their claims through collateral.

Second Lien Lenders (2L)

	     - 	Position: Junior secured creditors with partial collateral coverage.
	     - 	Expectations: Full recovery but aware of refinancing limitations.
	     - 	Negotiation Leverage: Moderate, willing to accept equity for potential upside.

Senior Note Holders

	     - 	Position: Unsecured creditors facing significant impairment.
	     - 	Expectations: Maximize recovery, prefer to avoid bankruptcy costs.
	     - 	Negotiation Leverage: Limited, but can delay proceedings if not satisfied.

Train & Co.

	     - 	Position: Equity holders with investment underwater.
	     - 	Expectations: Retain some value and avoid complete loss.
	     - 	Negotiation Leverage: Limited, but their cooperation can facilitate a smoother restructuring.

Negotiation Dynamics and Strategies

	     - 	Alignment of Interests: Emphasize the benefits of a consensual restructuring over bankruptcy.
	     - 	Value Preservation: Highlight the costs and delays associated with bankruptcy proceedings.
	     - 	Future Upside: Offer equity participation to creditors for potential future gains.
	     - 	Coercive Measures: Use potential bankruptcy as leverage to encourage participation.

8. Proposed Restructuring Plan Details

Key Components of the Plan

	1.	New First Lien Loan:
	     - 	Amount: $275 million
	     - 	Terms: Market rates, secured by the company’s assets.
	     - 	Use of Proceeds: Repay existing 1L debt and provide working capital.
	2.	Equity Allocation:
	     - 	Total New Shares Issued: 9,900,000
	     - 	Allocation:
	     - 	Second Lien Lenders (2L): 44.06% (4,405,500 shares)
	     - 	Senior Note Holders: 50.99% (5,098,500 shares)
	     - 	Train & Co.: 2.98% (298,000 shares, including original shares)
	     - 	Management: 1.98% (198,000 shares)
	3.	Cash Payments:
	     - 	2L Lenders: Receive $25 million in cash from excess loan proceeds.

Detailed Recovery Calculations

Equity Value Determination

	1.	Enterprise Value (EV):
	     - 	EV: $558.25 million (as previously calculated)
	2.	Subtract New Debt:
	     - 	Equity Value = EV - New Debt
	     - 	Equity Value = $558.25 million - $275 million = $283.25 million
	3.	Equity Value per Share:
	     - 	Total Shares Post-Restructuring: 9,900,000 (new shares) + 100,000 (original shares) = 10,000,000 shares
	     - 	Equity Value per Share = Equity Value / Total Shares
	     - 	Equity Value per Share = $283.25 million / 10,000,000 shares = $28.325 per share

Second Lien Lenders (2L) Recovery

	1.	Cash Payment:
	     - 	Total Cash Received: $25 million
	     - 	Cash per $1,000 Face Value Note:
	     - 	Total 2L Debt: $150 million
	     - 	Number of $1,000 Notes: $150 million / $1,000 = 150,000 notes
	     - 	Cash per Note: $25 million / 150,000 notes = $166.67 per note
	2.	Equity Allocation:
	     - 	Total Shares Allocated: 4,405,500 shares
	     - 	Shares per Note: 4,405,500 shares / 150,000 notes ≈ 29.37 shares per note
	3.	Equity Value per Note:
	     - 	Equity Value per Note = Shares per Note × Equity Value per Share
	     - 	Equity Value per Note = 29.37 shares × $28.325 ≈ $831.76
	4.	Total Recovery per Note:
	     - 	Total Recovery = Cash per Note + Equity Value per Note
	     - 	Total Recovery = $166.67 + $831.76 ≈ $998.43 per $1,000 note
	5.	Recovery Percentage:
	     - 	Recovery % = Total Recovery per Note / Face Value
	     - 	Recovery % = $998.43 / $1,000 ≈ 99.84%

Senior Note Holders Recovery

	1.	Equity Allocation:
	     - 	Total Shares Allocated: 5,098,500 shares
	     - 	Total Senior Notes: $225 million
	     - 	Number of $1,000 Notes: $225 million / $1,000 = 225,000 notes
	     - 	Shares per Note: 5,098,500 shares / 225,000 notes ≈ 22.66 shares per note
	2.	Equity Value per Note:
	     - 	Equity Value per Note = Shares per Note × Equity Value per Share
	     - 	Equity Value per Note = 22.66 shares × $28.325 ≈ $642.12
	3.	Total Recovery per Note:
	     - 	Total Recovery = Equity Value per Note (no cash payment)
	     - 	Total Recovery = $642.12 per $1,000 note
	4.	Recovery Percentage:
	     - 	Recovery % = Total Recovery per Note / Face Value
	     - 	Recovery % = $642.12 / $1,000 ≈ 64.21%

Train & Co. Recovery

	1.	Equity Retained:
	     - 	Original Shares: 100,000 shares
	     - 	New Shares Allocated: 198,000 shares
	     - 	Total Shares: 298,000 shares
	2.	Equity Value:
	     - 	Equity Value = Total Shares × Equity Value per Share
	     - 	Equity Value = 298,000 shares × $28.325 ≈ $8.44 million
	3.	Recovery Percentage:
	     - 	Original Equity Investment: $262.5 million (from initial acquisition)
	     - 	Recovery % = Equity Value / Original Investment
	     - 	Recovery % = $8.44 million / $262.5 million ≈ 3.21%

Rationale:

	     - 	While Train & Co. recover only a small fraction of their initial investment, retaining an equity stake may provide upside potential if the company performs well post-restructuring.

Management Equity

	1.	Equity Granted: 198,000 shares
	2.	Equity Value:
	     - 	Equity Value = Shares × Equity Value per Share
	     - 	Equity Value = 198,000 shares × $28.325 ≈ $5.61 million

Rationale:

	     - 	Aligns management’s interests with company performance.
	     - 	Incentivizes management to drive operational improvements.

9. Calculations and Rationale

Enterprise Value and Valuation Multiples

Assumptions for Projections:

	     - 	Revenue Growth: Modest growth based on economic recovery.
	     - 	EBITDA Margins: Improvement due to operational efficiencies and cost reductions.

Projected EBITDA and Enterprise Value:

Year	EBITDA ($ millions)	Assumed EBITDA Multiple	Enterprise Value ($ millions)
2012	109.52	7.25x	109.52 × 7.25 = 794.02
2013	132.89	8.25x	132.89 × 8.25 = 1,096.34

Rationale:

	     - 	Higher EBITDA Multiples in Future Years: Reflects improved market conditions and company performance.
	     - 	Increased Enterprise Value: Due to both higher EBITDA and higher multiples.

Recovery Calculations for Each Creditor Class

Already detailed in Section 8.

Equity Allocation and Valuation

Equity Value per Share Over Time:

	     - 	2011: $28.325 per share
	     - 	2012 Projection:
	     - 	Equity Value = EV - Debt
	     - 	Equity Value = $794.02 million - $275 million = $519.02 million
	     - 	Equity Value per Share = $519.02 million / 10,000,000 shares = $51.90 per share
	     - 	2013 Projection:
	     - 	Equity Value = $1,096.34 million - $275 million = $821.34 million
	     - 	Equity Value per Share = $821.34 million / 10,000,000 shares = $82.13 per share

Rationale:

	     - 	Significant potential upside for equity holders if projections are met.
	     - 	Distressed investors can realize substantial returns by participating in the restructuring.

Expected Returns for Distressed Investors

Scenario Analysis for Senior Note Holders

Assumptions:

	     - 	Purchase Price of Notes: Bought at 50% of face value ($500 per $1,000 note)
	     - 	Shares Received per Note: 22.66 shares

Effective Cost per Share:

	     - 	Cost per Share = Purchase Price / Shares per Note
	     - 	Cost per Share = $500 / 22.66 ≈ $22.07 per share

Return Calculations:

	1.	Equity Value per Share in 2012: $51.90
	2.	Gain per Share: $51.90 - $22.07 = $29.83
	3.	Total Gain per Note: $29.83 × 22.66 ≈ $676.26
	4.	Cash on Cash Return:
	     - 	Total Recovery per Note: $51.90 × 22.66 ≈ $1,176.26
	     - 	Return Multiple: $1,176.26 / $500 ≈ 2.35x
	5.	Internal Rate of Return (IRR):
	     - 	Assuming a 2-year investment period (end of 2010 to end of 2012).
	     - 	IRR Calculation: Solving for IRR in the equation:
￼
