### Chapter 6: The Crisis Spills over to the Central Bank (Stages 5-6)

**This chapter continues to go through the dynamics I laid out in my archetype of a big debt crisis. Here we will focus on Stages 5-6, when problems spill over to the central bank.**

**Stage 5: When there is a debt crisis and interest rates can’t be lowered (e.g., they hit 0%), the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to ease credit and make it easier to service debt. It doesn’t literally “print money.” In doing this, it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on.**

Ultimately, the government can’t escape that it needs to find much more financing for its spending priorities. But at this stage, it typically experiences financing rates higher than it can afford—often because of mechanical selling of the currency and debt. At this stage, needing financing the government turns to the central bank. This puts the problem in the central bank’s court.

History shows that during such time central banks typically produce a lot of money and credit to buy the bonds. I view this as a red flag, but not yet a big red flag because of the power of central banks to control the production of money and credit. In the case of central governments and their debts, it will be difficult to avoid the squeeze if the deficits continue because the high debt burdens cause increasing amounts of government spending to be directed to debt service. We will get into an examination of the US government’s finances later.

**More specifically, the central bank steps in** to relieve the pressure on the government’s finances (or the finances of other systemically important entities) either through the direct purchase of assets or indirectly through guarantees and backstops. The central bank often takes losses on these assets if they were bought at uneconomical prices in the form of default, inflation, and/or rising interest rates. At this stage, the balance sheet hit is transferred from the government to the central bank and the holders of the currency.

**As previously explained, when there isn’t enough demand for government debt**, the central bank will be faced with the choice between either a) having interest rates rise enough to bring supply and demand into balance, which will reduce both the demand for credit and spending, or b) printing money and buying debt assets, which will expand the central bank’s balance sheet via quantitative easing, which means acquiring a lot of debt assets. If these things continue for a long time they should be viewed as early-stage red flags. Also, when governments shorten the maturities of their debt, which typically happens when there isn’t enough demand for their long-term debt, that should be viewed as an early-stage red flag, too. And, when both a) the total debt and b) the government debt that is held by the central bank rises because there isn’t enough free-market demand to buy the debt, that should be viewed as an early-stage red flag, as well. As shown in both charts below, these trends toward greater central bank holdings of bonds and shortening of maturities typically start nearly a decade before the crisis and reverse after it. Notice the acceleration of central bank bond buying and how the maturity of the government debt is rapidly shortening.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEuG1Db_jijFA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571384909?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=JYpX33O5k343MVFeRC-MeQZr-GYMOP5cUGZ1x8pbctI)

As mentioned earlier, when the system is working well, the demand to borrow from borrower-debtors and the willingness to lend by lender-creditors balance. However, when the free-market demand for the debt that is being sold is not adequate, the central government and the central bank take on more of the debt when the private sector can’t. The government can do this when the private sector can’t because lender-creditors will more readily lend to the government during times of stress because they believe that the central government will pay it back because it is the central bank that has the power to print money behind it so there is virtually no risk that it will default.**The risk becomes that the central bank will produce too much money and credit in order to prevent defaults, which will produce a lot of inflation that will make being paid back in devalued money a big risk for the lender-creditor. When this happens, I view it as a red flag, but not a big red flag because history shows that it can happen a lot before the supply and demand imbalance becomes a problem.**This started in 2008. It was previously called debt monetization and has this time around been called quantitative easing. In the United States, it came in four waves that added up to 18% of potential GDP, 5% of total debt, and 16% of government debt. In Europe, it also came in four waves that added up to 30% of potential GDP, 10% of total debt, and 36% of government debt. In Japan, it came in three waves that added up to 95% of potential GDP, 22% of total debt, and 46% of government debt.

**When central banks buy bonds, they take on the same set of risks that commercial banks and investors take on when they buy bonds. The only difference is that central banks have the powers to print money to monetize them and to account for their losses in ways that make them less apparent.**

More specifically, when the central bank buys the bond (say, from a bank), it pays for it by telling the bank it has a new deposit at the central bank. The central bank pays interest on that deposit (not that different from money you or I keep at a bank). Just like commercial banks can get into trouble if the interest they earn on their assets is below the interest they pay on deposits, it’s the same for central banks. If the interest rates the central bank pays on deposits rise above the interest that they are getting on the bonds they own, they will lose money and will have a negative cash flow. If they used mark-to-market accounting, they would have losses on the bonds, and as with banks and investors, if their losses become greater than their capital they have a negative net worth. In reality, at this stage no one cares much, but for reasons that I will explain, they should.

**Stage 6: If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. When that happens, that is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a significant negative net worth and is forced to print more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its debt liabilities. That is a big red flag because it signals the central bank’s death spiral (i.e., the dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see that lead them not to hold the debt assets, which leads to higher interest rates or the need to print more money which devalues the money which leads to more selling of the debt assets and the currency, and so on). That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke. I call this going broke because the central bank can’t make its debt service payments, though it doesn’t default on its debts because it prints money. When done in large amounts, that devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions.**

At this stage, the central bank typically ends up in a difficult situation, caught between the need to maintain policy that is at once easy enough to support a weak economy and a fiscally weak government but also tight enough to discourage savers and investors from fleeing the currency. This is a classic hallmark of an unsustainable situation, and it typically manifests in the following ways:

**a) Central banks have losses and negative net worths.**

**After the central bank has bought a lot of debt and interest rates have risen so debt prices have fallen and the central bank’s short-term costs of funds are greater than the returns on the debt they bought, central banks have big losses that are so big that they lead the central banks to have negative net worths. That is another red flag.**Still, all these red flags don’t signal the end of the Big Debt Cycle—they just show signs of the fading financial health of the system. It is not the end because central banks can still print plenty of money to provide ample money and credit and to fund their losses. Having said that, it is noteworthy that in some cases where the governments don’t want to have flimflam finances, the central government is required to put capital in the central bank to recapitalize it. When that happens, the central government has to get more capital to provide it, which will require it to get it by taxing, cutting spending, and/or borrowing which adds to the squeeze.

**When central banks buy a lot of debt, that lowers the value of the debt because it lowers the value of the money that the debt asset is promised to get. And when the short-term interest rates that they have to pay are high relative to the long-term interest that they get from the debt assets that they own, they have losses and can have a negative net worth.**This is a moderate red flag at first—several central banks have negative net equity (or equivalent) today, and it doesn’t hinder them much in the way of their operations. But at larger degrees of losses, it could begin a spiral that creates much bigger problems.

The advantage of the central banks doing such buying is that 1) it provides credit that wouldn’t have existed to keep interest lower than they would have been and 2) when interest rates rise and the bonds have losses, it will be the central bank that has the losses. This raises the question of whether or not central bank losses matter, and if so why. The answer is that central banks having losses certainly matters less than private sector investors having losses and having to appear to lender-creditors as creditworthy.**When central banks have big losses on their debt that signifies a step toward a more advanced stage near the end of the Big Debt Cycle, so I view it as a mid-cycle flag.**There is typically still no reason for a crisis at this stage because, as stated, small or moderate losses don’t matter much for the central bank. However, as these losses move from being small to being very large, they can create cash flow needs for the central bank that can only be met with a lot of money printing, which puts a significant downward pressure on the currency, as the central bank runs up a large interest bill on its liabilities (in an effort to keep savers in the currency) but earns little on its assets (in an effort to support the government) and ends up printing the difference. The table below describes historical cases where these cash flow losses became very large and necessitated a big monetization that contributed to a currency spiral:

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHwV0NNpP79_w/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571422217?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=WTT-a9uI9hibdxUiTuxO9IX2Zoqg3cpn2OMLVekU-OI)

**b) The central bank is forced to print money to monetize losses on its debt and other debts even though it worsens pressure on the currency.**

Faced with these circumstances, the central bank is ultimately forced to print money to monetize its losses and the losses of others. This can happen explicitly through the direct purchase of assets by the central bank or indirectly through guarantees and backstops. The central bank typically takes losses on these assets (often bought at uneconomical prices) through defaults, inflation, and/or rising interest rates—transferring the balance sheet hit from the government to the central bank and the holders of the currency.**Some of the hallmarks of this stage are:**

\- **An expanding central bank balance sheet** as money is printed to finance the government or to roll the debts of other stressed entities. The left chart below shows the central bank’s purchases of government bonds, but it’s worth noting that central bank actions can be much broader than this (up to and including the purchase of private assets like corporate bonds or equities). They can also include measures to guarantee and backstop stressed borrowers that don’t always show up on the balance sheet but still represent some transfer of purchasing power to stressed debtors as the central bank and government are on the hook for covering losses (e.g., Emergency Banking Act of 1933, Bank of Amsterdam’s backstop of the Dutch East India Company—both of which ultimately required monetization).

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQE71owsUEmbng/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571437001?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=jzs0Z4ewy3H4VFQjtGSSFlag8LEnadF097-vAIudV4c)

\- **The sale of reserves** as the central bank tries to defend the currency while simultaneously providing money and credit to those that need it. The result is that the composition of the central bank’s asset holdings shifts from hard assets (gold and FX reserves) to soft assets (claims on the government or financials). This contributes to the run on the currency (particularly when the currency is pegged) as investors see the central bank’s resources to defend the currency rapidly decreasing, forcing the central bank to sell reserves even faster until it reaches the point where a defense is no longer feasible. This dynamic is far more pronounced in the fixed rate cases.

\- **The monetization of debts combined with the sale of reserves causes the ratio of the central bank’s hard assets (reserves) to its liabilities (money) to decline, weakening the central bank’s ability to defend the currency.**This is another case where having a fixed versus a floating rate case is important. Pegged countries tend to have a more backed money supply but run into problems sooner when the ratio of reserves to money declines. They also tend to expend more reserves in the currency defense stage of the cycle.

### Chapter 7: The Prior Big Debt Crisis Recedes, a New Equilibrium Is Reached, and a New Cycle Can Begin (Stages 7-9)

**The cycle ends when a mix of market forces and policy-maker actions create a bottom and an upswing from there. This chapter lays out the dynamics and markers I look for in these times (Stages 7-9 of the archetype I showed in Chapter 4).**

**Stage 7: Debts are restructured and devalued. When managed in the best possible way (what I call a beautiful deleveraging), the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them) so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation.**

When the debt burdens become too great, a big restructuring and/or devaluation that substantially reduces their size and value will happen, either by itself or with the help of good management.

**The currency devalues and the remaining holders of the currency and the debt take big losses in real terms.**The loss of purchasing power continues until **a new monetary system is established** with enough credibility to entice investors and savers to hold the currency again. Typically, this involves a substantial write-down and restructuring of the debt.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHSva91mSigLw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571478708?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=bQVL8fwIom4Y0zl2KP_oZVs0OF3VktlHudCyT0DWCsc)

**Government debts devalue relative to real assets like gold, stocks, and commodities.**Perhaps this time, digital currencies like Bitcoin will benefit. The charts below show the average devaluation of currency and debts across the cases relative to 1) gold, 2) commodities, and 3) equities.**On average, gold outperforms holding the local debt at equal risk in these cases by roughly 60% from the start of the devaluation until the currency bottoms**. Notice the big difference in what happens in the fixed exchange rate and the variable (fiat) exchange rate cases.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHhSUq7xmUkAQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571506701?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=crBtghrA3q6dSujE8_sc9vxA5f-GC0f-Hv9mgdffZak)

You can see the individual returns of the various assets by case in the table below.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEOricbdZe1nw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571526704?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=sJvXU5mruCJ4refQFE920gHts2f3OgkoIBmFbXJK95w)

**When debts are restructured and/or devalued, it is typically a terrible time in markets and economies, but this terrible time reduces the debt burdens and establishes the foundation for the improvement.**In the archetypical case, debt levels rise significantly relative to the monetary base in the run-up to the crisis, requiring the private sector to absorb a much greater amount of government debt with the same quantity of base money in circulation (which is likely a part of why we see upward pressure on interest rates at first in many of our cases). Eventually, when the pressure becomes too great, the central bank steps in and monetizes the debt, resulting in an expansion of the monetary base and a decline in the debt-to-money ratio.

**The ratio of reserves to debt typically falls at first, then rises.**Typically, at this stage, we see reserves fall relative to debts—at first because debt levels are increasing quickly, then additionally because reserves are being sold in an attempt to defend the currency. After policy makers give up and let the currency go, we see this ratio improve as the devaluation of the currency mechanically reduces the value of local currency debts relative to hard currency assets and improves the country’s competitiveness, helping it to earn more in hard currency terms.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFOm5633aH8Cw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571542351?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=L56wTkKUEX0P7EY8oAnNE9Su7ffvGttMTMnVHHXdfR8)

The chart below shows how the path of government debts and the monetary base typically line up. Typically, we see government debt rise first (usually in response to some crisis) while money growth is by and large unchanged (and in fact slows at the point of the cycle where the central bank tries to mount a currency defense). The government typically tries to control things through various techniques like foreign exchange controls or managing the currency (e.g., sometimes having an official foreign exchange rate that is different from the market rate). These controls create market distortions and do more harm than good. After the central bank gives up and lets the currency go, the pace of money printing picks up and helps to produce inflation that improves the government’s nominal incomes relative to its debts. This dynamic was by and large similar across pegged and non-pegged cases.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHwZ4Jt-W2Hdw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571553967?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=iGR97sqyqULbWnCJQzaH1GA5u4gFXYfYw5tIL6zVy2I)

The next three charts show government debt against reserves; the fall in reserves relative to debts is driven mostly by the rise in government debt but also by the selling of reserves late in the cycle to try to fight off the collapse of the currency. After the selling stops and the currency devalues, we typically see an improvement in the ratio as the devaluation lowers the value of local currency government debts relative to any remaining hard currency assets.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFeRWBiLMlB1g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571606060?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=j38nrR984R6dyBGk0DLrmtasbTFuIOMuSACLfljB12g)

**Stage 8: At such times, extraordinary policies like extraordinary taxes and capital controls are commonly imposed.**

At this point, the government is cash-strapped and typically raises taxes to try to meet its financing need. The prospect of greater taxation puts additional pressure on households and businesses to move what they can out of the country. In response, governments often enact capital controls to try to stem these outflows, though at this point the economic pressure to leave the country and currency is too great for governments to stop the bleeding.

The charts below show a few different perspectives on tax rates across cases. You can see, for example, that both marginal income tax rates for top earners and inheritance tax rates rose by about 10% in the years going into the devaluation.\[1\]

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHcGG4cKemU5g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571625356?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=qHbjn3AHptVqGnRMq2N8aFsA6XNMx5lQtU9Nw02nYfU)

Higher tax rates typically go hand in hand with capital controls in order to try and prohibit money from fleeing the country in response. You can see just how common this was in the table below:

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQHxnivtRRHc3g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737571640237?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=C5jHPD7F4DFAyHS1Bzp-5Xhq7xEvBzfRO13U3dxxdUQ)

\[2\]

**Stage 9: The deleveraging process inevitably creates a reduction in the debt burdens that creates the return to equilibrium.**

Quite often, when there are inflationary depressions so the debt is devalued, at the end of the cycle, government reserves are raised through asset sales, and a strictly enforced transition from a rapidly declining currency to a relatively stable currency is achieved by linking the currency to a hard currency or a hard asset (e.g., gold) by the central bank while having very tight money and a very high real interest rate, which severely penalizes the borrower-debtors and rewards the lender-creditors, which leads to the buying of the currency/debt which stabilizes the currency/debt.

**At this stage, the currency has devalued and the remaining holders of the currency and the debt have taken big losses in real terms, which has relieved a lot of the debt burdens of the debtors.**Now, it doesn’t take much to back up the debt, stabilizing it and the currency. When managed well, the government raises reserves, sometimes by selling government-owned assets, sometimes by getting IMF or other loans requiring sound financial policies including austerity. At this stage, the interest rate is still high—in fact very high in relation to the prospective inflation rate and the prospective rate of depreciation in the currency, which means that the central bank can make the debt-money an attractive investment again, and debt in that currency very expensive, if they manage the situation well. This is when **a new** **and more stable monetary system is established** with enough credibility to entice investors and savers to hold the currency again. Typically, this follows a substantial write-down and restructuring of the debt along with a return to some form of hard money (e.g., a peg to gold or another stable currency). And this typically requires a set of fundamental adjustments that improve the country’s balance sheet and income statement.

**The five classic steps typically necessary to make the transition are:**

1.**A restructuring of the country’s debts to manageable levels** where reserve assets can cover a substantial portion of liabilities and the government’s debt service no longer exceeds its revenue growth. Typically, defaulting and restructuring foreign currency debts and some local currency debts is required, too.

The two charts below show an attribution of what has happened to government debt-to-GDP following the devaluation, on average across our case set. You can see below that in the average case, central government debt was at 89% of GDP around the time of the devaluation. The green bars show the factors that worked to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio down—on average 7% came from central bank purchases, 38% was due to inflation, 26% was due to positive growth in real GDP, 16% was due to primary surpluses, and 8% was due to defaults or restructuring of the debt; and the red bar showed what led it to rise—76% driven by continued interest payments. The net of these is that in the average case, debt falls from 89% to 70% of GDP and that rising inflation and rising real growth arising from aggressive stimulations were the big forces behind the debt burden reduction. Said differently, governments that have debt in their own currencies 1) made their interest and principal payments by having their central banks create money and credit, raise inflation, and stimulate real growth, and restructuring debts which raised nominal income growth relative to debt service payments and 2) restructured defaulted debts in the amounts shown. While this chart shows all cases, this was especially true in the cases in which the currencies were denominated in monies that the central banks could produce. In fact, in most cases the debt problems never went away as much as they remained a manageable burden handled in the way described. Of course, these are average numbers and the ranges around them are large, though the patterns are pretty consistent.

2.**A deep, painful fiscal policy adjustment** to make the country’s finances sustainable without requiring the printing of money to monetize the debt. Making some deep, painful fiscal policy adjustment from the central government and healthy balance of payments adjustments is usually required. It is typical to see a bigger improvement in the primary deficit before the government is able to reduce interest costs by rolling into lower rates.

3.**Obtaining sufficient quantities of reserves to defend the currency (or back the new currency if the old, collapsed currency is being replaced) is typically part of the process.**The devaluation of the currency typically helps with this both because the fall in the exchange rate increases the value of the country’s reserves relative to its nominal liabilities and because it improves the country’s competitiveness, helping to increase export incomes relative to import costs. In addition, we see a combination of asset sales to build up reserves further and occasionally borrowing from official creditors (which at this point are among the few parties still willing to lend). Also, typically government-owned companies and other assets are sold off at this stage, which brings in money for reserves and improves efficiencies of these businesses.

4.**High real interest rates** that more than adequately compensate investors for the risks of holding the currency. The charts below show the nominal interest rates on local currency and hard currency debts.

5.**Placing limits on what the central bank can do that would undermine sustainable finances of the new stable money.**

**When these conditions are met, it’s among the best times to hold the country’s currency and debt.**

**That is what the end stages of the typical Big Debt Cycle look like to me.**Let’s now return to the very big picture level and look at how that Big Debt Cycle has played out over the last 80 years.

\[1\] Note that tax rate data only covers the US, the UK, Japan, Germany, and France.

\[2\] While this diagram is not exhaustive, I include instances where I could find clear evidence of each occurring in the 20-year period. Relevant capital controls were defined as meaningful restrictions on investors moving their money to and from other countries and assets (although this does not include targeted measures directed only at single countries, such as sanctions).

\[3\] To show a clearer picture of how the government’s balance sheet evolves in the upswing and downswing of the cycle, these charts exclude a handful of recent cases (the US, Europe, the UK, and Japan post-financial crisis) that are still playing out.
