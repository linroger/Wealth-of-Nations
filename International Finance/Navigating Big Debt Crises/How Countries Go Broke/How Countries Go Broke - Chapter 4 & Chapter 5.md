## Part 2: The Archetypical Sequence Leading to Central Governments and Central Banks Going Broke

*The same basic sequence of events that has led central governments and central banks to go broke has happened repeatedly throughout history and it isn’t well understood. The purpose of this part is to describe it so that it is well understood. In this part, I provide a template of the typical case and the most important reasons for the two major types of cases: 1) those in which the debt is denominated in currencies that the country’s central bank can print, and 2) those in which the debt is denominated in currencies that the central bank can’t print. After I make that clear, in the next part I will review how the current Big Cycle, starting in 1944 and continuing until now, transpired relative to the archetypical, timeless and universal template described here.*

## Chapter 4: The Archetypical Sequence

**In examining 65 major debt crises over the last 100 years and in examining more closely the 35 cases in which the central government and/or the central bank went broke, I believe that I have come to understand big debt crises pretty well. What follows is the archetypical process, zooming in to the granular mechanics of what typically happens both leading up to central governments and central banks going broke and after. While I think this section is important because it shows how the template and actual developments have looked in detail, if you don’t want to go into all that detail, I suggest you read what is in bold and decide if you want to dive into the greater detail from there.**But first, there is one important factor to explain that affects how the cases transpire. That is between cases with hard money versus fiat money.

**Hard Money Versus Fiat Money**

**The cases I am about to describe come in two broad types that typically behave differently in ways that you should understand. The two big types are the hard currency cases and fiat currency cases. In brief, the way the hard currency cases work is that the governments have made promises to deliver money that they can’t print (e.g., gold, silver, or another currency that the parties view as relatively hard, like the dollar). Throughout history, in these cases, when coming up with these hard currencies that they couldn’t print to pay debts became tough, the governments have almost always reneged on their promises to pay in the currency that they couldn’t print, and the value of their money and the debt payments denominated in it tumbled at the moment the promise was broken.**

**After they broke their promise and haven't gone back to having a hard currency, they have what is called a fiat monetary system. In these cases, the currency’s value is based on the faith and incentives that the central banks provide.**The shift of most currencies from being hard to being fiat currencies started on August 15, 1971. I remember it well because I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time and was surprised by it; then I studied history and found that the exact same thing happened in April 1933, and I learned how they worked.

**In fiat monetary systems, central banks primarily use interest rates, their ability to monetize debt, and the tightness of money to provide the incentives of lender-creditors to lend and hold debt assets.**And throughout history they, like central governments and central bankers operating in hard currency regimes, have created too much debt (which are claims that people believe they can turn in to get money, which they expect they can use to buy things), so there are the same type of credit-debt dynamics at work—i.e., the governments create and allow their private sectors to create too much debt to be paid back which leads to printing money to make it easier to pay the debts which devalues money and makes the prices of things go up—except in fiat currency cases the devaluations don’t happen all at once at the moment the government breaks its promise to convert the paper money into the hard money storehold of wealth. They happen more gradually.

For example, we have seen this clearly exemplified in the Bank of Japan’s policies of aggressively monetizing a lot of debt and keeping real and nominal interest rates extremely low, which has resulted in its currency and the debt denominated in its currency being devalued. Since the start of 2013, the holders of Japanese government bonds have lost 60% versus gold, 45% versus US dollar debt, and 6% in domestic purchasing power (as average inflation was 1%). The devaluation came gradually rather than abruptly because the yen was a fiat currency, but it came for the same reasons it would have come if Japan had a hard currency—i.e., too much debt that needed to be monetized.

**In the charts that I will show you throughout this chapter, you will see three lines—the bold one in the middle will show all cases (the hard and the fiat currencies combined) and the two lighter lines will show you what happened on average in just the hard currency cases and what happened on average in just the fiat currency cases. For simplicity, I will explain the dynamic by referring to just the aggregate line.**

By the way, the big cycles through history have typically included currency regimes going back and forth between being hard and fiat because they each led to extreme consequences and required movements to the opposite—the hard currency regimes broke down with big devaluations because the governments couldn’t maintain debt growth in line with their monetary constraints, and the fiat monetary system broke down because of the loss of faith in the money/debt being a safe storehold of wealth.

**Nine Stages of the Final Crisis**

In the introduction I summarized the whole archetypical debt cycle. I am now going to focus on the final phase of the Big Debt Cycle, when the central government and the central bank both go broke. This final phase typically transpires in nine steps. While the sequence below is the archetypical one, there are very big variations in what happens and when it happens, and they don’t necessarily transpire in the exact sequence I describe. So, the things I am referring to here can be viewed as the unhealthy things that lead to the crisis and the steps that are classically taken to get out of the crisis. The more of these unhealthy things exist, the greater the risk of a “heart attack” where the central government and the central bank go broke. Said differently, there are many reasons a country goes broke—e.g., chronic overspending and debt accumulations; costly wars; costly shocks like droughts, floods, and pandemics; some mix of these things; etc. Whatever the causes, the below checklist adds up to a risk gauge because the more of the unhealthy things that exist, the higher the probability of a debt/currency crisis. Here is the sequence of unhealthy conditions that typifies the last stages of the Big Debt Cycle:

1. **The private sector and government get deeply into debt.**
2. **The private sector suffers a debt crisis, and the central government gets deeper in debt to help the private sector.**
3. **The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. That creates a debt problem. At that time there is either a) a shift in monetary and fiscal policy that brings the supply and demand for money and credit back into balance or b) a self-reinforcing net selling of the debt, which creates a severe debt liquidation crisis that runs its course and reduces the size of debt and debt service levels relative to incomes. Big net selling of the debt is the big red flag.**
4. **The selling of government debt leads to a simultaneous a) free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which leads to b) weakening of the economy, c) declining savings/reserves, and d) downward pressure on the currency. Because this tightening is too harmful for the economy, the central bank typically also eases credit and experiences a devaluation of the currency. That stage is easy to see in the market action via interest rates rising, led by long-term (bond) rates rising faster than short rates and the currency weakening simultaneously.**
5. **When there is a debt crisis and interest rates can’t be lowered (e.g., they hit 0% or long rates limit the decline of short rates), the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to try to keep long rates down and to ease credit to make it easier to service debt. It doesn’t literally print money. In doing this, it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on, which creates problems for the central bank if this debt selling and interest rate rising continue.**
6. **If the selling continues and interest rates continue to rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought. When that happens, that is notable but not a big red flag until the central bank has a significant negative net worth and is forced to print more money to cover the negative cash flow that it experiences due to less money coming in on its assets than has to go out to service its debt liabilities. That is a big red flag because it signals the central bank’s death spiral (i.e., the dynamic in which the rising interest rates cause problems that creditors see that lead them not to hold the debt assets which leads to higher interest rates or the need to print more money which devalues the money which leads to more selling of the debt assets and the currency, and so on). That is what I mean when I say the central bank goes broke. I call this going broke because the central bank can’t make its debt service payments, though it doesn’t default on its debts because it prints money. When done in large amounts, that devalues the money and creates inflationary recessions or depressions.**
7. **Debts are restructured and devalued. When managed in the best possible way, the government controllers of fiscal and monetary policy execute what I call a beautiful deleveraging in which the deflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., through debt restructurings) are balanced with the inflationary ways of reducing debt burdens (e.g., by monetizing them) so that the deleveraging occurs without having unacceptable amounts of either deflation or inflation.**
8. **At such times, extraordinary policies like extraordinary taxes and capital controls are commonly imposed.**
9. **The deleveraging process inevitably reduces the debt burdens and creates the return to equilibrium. One way or another the debt and debt service levels are brought back in line with the incomes that exist to service the debts. Quite often, there are inflationary depressions so the debt is devalued at the end of the cycle, government reserves are raised through asset sales, and a strictly enforced transition from a rapidly declining currency to a relatively stable currency is simultaneously achieved by linking the currency to a hard currency or a hard asset (e.g., gold) by the central bank, and the central government and private sector finances being brought back in line to be sustainable. At the early stage of this phase, it is imperative that the rewards of holding the currency and the debt denominated in it, and the penalties of owing money, are great in order to re-establish the creditability of the money and credit by rewarding the lender-creditors and penalizing the borrower-debtors. In this phase of the cycle there is very tight money and a very high real interest rate, which is very painful and required for a while. If it persists, the supply and demand for money, credit, debt, spending, and savings will inevitably fall back into line. How exactly this happens largely depends on whether the debt is denominated in a currency that the central bank can create and whether the debtors and creditors are primarily domestic so that the central government and the central bank have more flexibility and control over the process. If so, that makes the process less painful, and, if not, it is inevitably much more painful. Also, whether the currency is a widely used reserve currency matters a lot because when it is there will be greater marginal inclinations to buy it and the debt that it is stored in. Having said that, it should be noted that throughout history there has been a strong tendency for governments with such currencies to abuse that privilege by doing more than enough borrowing to lose that privilege, which makes their decline more abrupt and painful.**

In the next few chapters I will show you all this happening in charts.

## Chapter 5: The Private Sector and Central Government Debt Crisis (Stages 1-4)

**In Chapter 4, I laid out the archetypical sequence that you see across crises. Now I go into much more detail on each phase—showing the specific markers and dynamics I saw when I looked at historical cases. I will show this dynamic in charts accompanied by brief explanations. In the charts, the dark blue line shows the average of all cases, the thin red line shows the average of the fixed exchange rate cases, and the thin green line shows the average of fiat-variable exchange rate cases.**You will note that the timing and the distinctiveness of these events is clearer in the cases in which exchange rates are fixed (in which case they more cleanly intensify and then break) than in the fiat currency cases (in which the adjustments are more fluid). That is because in fixed rate cases you can see the pressures build up until there is a clear break, whereas in the variable exchange rate cases you will see these changes occur more gradually.

**Stage 1: The private sector and government get deep in debt.**

We see this in classic ways, such as:

\- In the years before the crisis, the government classically has **a large and growing stock of debt** as a result of chronic deficit spending. Typically, one sees **a rising share of spending going to consumption/social safety net and a declining share going to productivity-enhancing investment**, causing debts to increase without a commensurate increase in incomes. Typically, countries become so reliant on a large social safety net that cutting it becomes a political third rail (e.g., in Brazil today, the US today).

\- **The level of debt is typically high relative to the government’s ability to pay it back with tax revenues and the debt service burden is also high relative to the government’s incomes**, starting to crowd out spending on other line items that are considered essential. To cover these costs, more debt needs to be sold than the private sector wants to buy, a source of upward pressure on interest rates (further increasing debt service costs). Note the big differences in what happens in these cases between the floating rate currencies and the fixed rate currencies after the big default/devaluation moment. It reflects the fact that in the fixed exchange rate cases the debt restructuring is more severe and definitive, which sets the stage for a more abrupt and larger rebound. Fiat cases see a gradual increase in debt, as money printing from the central bank allows government spending to continue or even accelerate. Please note that the numbers in the x-axis represent months before and after the peak of the crisis.

\- The charts below show the typical amount of government borrowing (in total and excluding borrowing to cover interest payments) that was done in the years leading up to the devaluation. In 31 of the 35 cases we studied, we saw **large, persistent government deficits** going into the crisis.

\- It’s worth noting that sometimes the public sector balance sheet looks less problematic on its face. This is true when **there is heavy borrowing in the private sector that the public sector has to back up and when there are implicit public sector guarantees to backstop institutions such as banks that the government can’t afford to let fail**. Such cases might as well be public sector balance sheet problems.

\- **The buildup of debts requires large lending from foreigners to finance them.**That lending can be in borrowing the country’s currency (which increases the risk of devaluation) or a reserve currency (which increases the risk of default). This increases the country’s vulnerability to a pullback in foreign capital. Having said that, having a current account deficit doesn’t necessarily signal problems. It reflects capital coming into the country, which could be indicative of the attractiveness of the country’s capital markets. However, in circumstances in which the attractiveness of the country’s capital markets gets impaired by the need to issue a lot of debt and money quickly to deal with a crisis, the potential for foreign selling of the country’s currency and debt represents an added source of vulnerability. As shown in the next set of charts, steadily increasing current account and twin deficits typically lead the crisis by several years. When the crisis occurs, it takes the form of a big devaluation and a constriction of debt-financed demand (including for imports), which has the effect of reducing these deficits.

**Years of large borrowing from foreigners results in a substantial accumulated debt to foreigners**, which increasesthe country’s vulnerability to a pullback in foreign capital. The charts below on the left show the total net international investment position (assets owned abroad minus liabilities owed to the rest of the world) and an adjusted version on the right that measures the amount of liquid assets the country has available relative to the external debts it must service. By the time of the devaluation, the country is typically very low in liquid assets it can use to cover external debt service obligations.

**Stage 2: The private sector suffers a debt crisis, and the central government gets deeper in debt to help the private sector.**

Typically, this occurs at the stage of the cycle when the government’s balance sheet goes from being moderately stretched in the years ahead of the devaluation to extremely stretched when the government is forced to step in to address debt problems that emerge in the private sector.**When the private sector has financial problems, the government typically plays an increased role because it can get money and credit much more easily than the private sector can.**During these difficult times, it is easier for governments to borrow because there is much more willingness to lend to them because everyone knows that their central banks can print money and get it to governments to repay and because governments have the power to tax. Having this greater ability to borrow is especially true for those governments that have the most established reserve currencies because there is high demand to hold that currency/debt.

As a result, when debt conditions deteriorate and governments need to save the day, government debt increases faster than private sector debt. As shown in the charts below, it is typical for the government debt level to soar while the private sector’s debt level plunges about a year before the crisis, and for the government debt levels to rise a lot relative to private debt levels. In 15 of the 21 cases where we had data on both the government and the private sector balance sheet, we saw this pattern happen. When private debt is falling sharply and government debt is rising sharply, it is a short leading indicator of trouble.

**At this time, government debt problems tend to intensify.**We show a few more measures of this below.

**The stock of government debt grows in relation to 1) its revenues, 2) the hard assets it has available to repay its debts (usually in the form of reserves), and 3) the quantity of money in the economy** that is available to finance the debt (until the central bank eventually steps in to provide more money and credit to the government).

  

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHM1YTRx4Kisg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737145864288?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=iJvFTF2ondsPbkL0-Yrsu5MqyswfCQLDgiQ6_n_oZRY)

**Stage 3: The central government experiences a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt falls short of the supply of it. That creates a debt problem. If there is net selling of the debt, that creates a much worse problem, so** ***net selling of the debt is a big red flag.***

**The central government gets into financial trouble** when 1) its finances are squeezed by debt and debt service expenses that limit its ability to spend on what is essential and 2) the holders of the debt assets created to finance government spending want to sell those assets. This puts upward pressure on interest rates, further increasing the government’s financing costs and requiring either painful spending cuts or even more borrowing to cover those costs.

More specifically, when debt service becomes a very high percentage of income (e.g., 100%), it is a red flag because it means that it is a) squeezing out a lot of spending and/or b) requiring a lot of borrowing and debt rollovers that might not happen because lender-creditors see this situation and worry about it, leading them to not lend or sell their debt assets. There comes a time in the long-term debt cycle when the debt service becomes so large relative to the incomes that it either squeezes out other spending because the borrowing can’t be large enough to allow the avoidance of the squeeze, or because it is so large that it leads to a big demand shortage. In 25 of the 35 cases we studied, we saw government debt service as a percent of government revenues accelerate going into the crisis.

\- **Given the debts the government has built up (and the ongoing deficits it is running to compensate for a weak private sector), its debt and debt service burdens are on a path to continue climbing.**The charts below show the average projected path of government debt and interest expense at the time of devaluation across the historical cases. At the time of the eventual devaluation, we can see that the government was typically on a path toward indefinitely increasing debts and debt service absent a devaluation of those debts.

  

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEK8H0In6CNYA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737145901810?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=kL1ZIR0rZ3IdN9bny5vvOY0xCY_8bV_hxuX9UdJjmWU)

This hasn’t happened yet in the US, but it is moving toward happening. As far as Europe, Japan, and China go, government interest service in those places is around half that of the US as a percent of GDP—Europe and China because its government debts are lower (though the debts of other sectors are higher), and Japan because its interest rates have been much lower for a long time. But that can change quickly, especially in Japan where very high government debts (around 215% of GDP) could become a problem if refinanced at higher rates. As we will see later, the very large government debts, Bank of Japan bond purchases, and the BoJ artificially holding interest rates at extremely low levels led to terrible returns for government debt assets because of both the low yields on the debt and the depreciated value of the currency.

Faced with a large and growing debt burden and financing need, a classic next step is the pursuit of measures to paper over issues and **creative ways to source financing, including accounting tricks**:

1. **Use of policy and development banks** to create off-balance-sheet financing (frequently part of the playbook in Asian crises, e.g., Japan and Asian financial crises).
2. Use of **debt guarantees instead of direct spending** (Peru 1980 s, Turkey recently). The government will say that it guarantees losses for a certain type of debt, which encourages borrowing—effectively a subsidy. But it doesn’t show up in government spending until losses start to appear, so it can misleadingly seem “free” to the government. In 2017, the Turkish government rolled out a loan guarantee program for businesses in the midst of balance of payments pressure.
3. **Requiring or heavily incentivizing domestic players, especially banks, pensions, and insurers, to finance the government** (Turkey recently, Brazil recently). Sometimes this takes the form of extremely beneficial regulatory treatment of government debt (making a risky instrument seem risk-free), and sometimes manipulation of yield curve and financing rates to make it attractive (US during World War II), which is effectively backdoor monetary financing (because it incentivizes banks to lever up at short-term interest rates to lend to the government).
4. **Patriotic campaigns to get people to fund the government** (Turkey recently appealing for people to sell their dollars for lira, World War II appeals for people to buy government bonds, Korea 1990 s relatively successfully creating a campaign asking people to use their gold to pay back the IMF).
5. **“Paying” for increased spending with future cuts and tax increases that might never come** (Brazil recently, creating a constitutional amendment to limit spending, but creating plenty of outs when needed).
6. **Calling in favors from international creditors** and/or making geopolitical deals for financing (Turkey recently, UK setting up Sterling Area after World War II).
7. **Shortening maturities of debt**, since usually borrowers are more willing to lend for short periods than long (described further below).
8. **Capital controls** to keep money from leaving the country are common in relatively severe situations.

**Stage 4: The selling of the government’s debt leads to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit which leads to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempts to defend the currency. Because this tightening is too harmful for the economy, the central bank eventually simultaneously eases credit and allows a devaluation of the currency.**

**These events typically accelerate investors’ and savers’ flight from the country’s assets, bringing the run on the currency and the debt to a breaking point. Typically, the central bank attempts to defend the currency with monetary tightening and reserve sales but is ultimately forced to change course due to the painful economic effects of tightening and the inadequacy of its reserves.**

A relatively large red flag for me is when debts rise relative to the incomes that are necessary to service them to such an extent that smart investors recognize losses are inevitable (i.e., because there must be either a default or a lot of printing of money, currency weakness, and inflation to depreciate the debts in order to avoid a default).

When the lender-creditor loses faith that they will be adequately paid (because the debtors won’t be able to afford to pay debt service or because the amount of debt service isn’t sufficient—e.g., won’t adequately compensate the lender-creditor for inflation), there will be inadequate buying relative to the selling of debt so the price of debt will have to go down (so the interest rate will have to go up) until there is either less borrowing or more saving.

During times of risks of war or actual war this is worsened because risks of sanctions (i.e., confiscating debt assets), excessive borrowing, debt default, and devaluation increase. Wars or not, that is when the doom loop can kick in—i.e., when the upward pressure on interest rates weakens the economy and increases the government’s future borrowing needs (or requires big tax increases or spending cuts that would be excessively painful at this juncture) which then creates an even bigger supply/demand mismatch in the bond market and puts even more upward pressure on interest rates. That is when central banks have to come in to save the day by “printing money” and buying the debt and we have what we call quantitative easing (QE).

As you will see in the charts below, in these times there is a simultaneous plunge in foreign inflows to buy local bonds, government and corporate (left chart), and a spike in real rates as there is a classic failed attempt to support the currency via rising interest rates and tightening credit.

In these periods, we often see the government shorten the maturity of its issuance in order to make the bonds more palatable to the market.

When market participants see that these limitations are being reached there is selling, which worsens the supply/demand balance. When that becomes large the central bank is faced with the choice of a) allowing interest rates to rise to a level that will curtail borrowing and lead to greater desire to lend to the government by redirecting money and credit that would have gone to other things (e.g., the purchase of other investments), or b) printing money and buying the debt to make up for the demand shortfall. History shows and logic dictates that it will always choose b) over a), and that the best path is to balance a) and b). When that produces enough selling so that inflation rises when the economy is weak, the central bank is damned if it does print money and buy a lot of debt because it contributes to terrible currency weakness and inflation, and it’s damned if it doesn’t because it causes extremely tight money, extremely high interest rates, and a very bad economy.

That happens when the debt service squeeze becomes intolerable for the borrower-debtor and/or the lender-creditor doesn’t want to hold the debt (typically because it is not providing a high enough real return, the risk of default is perceived as high, and/or the risk of the central bank printing a lot of money thus devaluing it is high). When those things happen a doom loop downward spiral in the value of the government debt occurs until a new equilibrium level is reached when the debt is sufficiently destroyed or devalued so that the debt burdens are no longer excessive.

This hasn’t yet happened in the US, Europe, Japan, or China.

**Below, we walk through these dynamics in more detail.**

\- **There is a tightening and/or currency intervention to defend the currency, but the tightening is abandoned because it’s too harmful for the economy and the currency intervention is abandoned because it doesn’t work and is too costly, so the currency/debt devalues.**

This situation becomes untenable when investors and savers see what’s going on and make the logical decision to abandon the country’s assets and currency because there is a high risk that in one way or another they won’t get their buying power back. This brings the crisis to a head because it puts more pressure on the central bank to tighten at a time when doing so would likely produce unacceptably bad economic outcomes.**A few of the red flags of this more advanced stage are:**

\- **Interest rates rise because there is selling of the country’s debt assets and because the central bank typically attempts to tighten to defend the currency.**In the face of such depressed conditions, such an increase in real interest rates is unsustainable as it puts too much pressure on an economy that is already weak and on a government that is facing a debt spiral absent lower interest rates.

\- **The tightening worsens a weak economy** (which ultimately requires the tightening to be abandoned and the devaluation to occur).

\- While not always the case,**inflation tends to rise and become higher than desirable** going into the crisis (constraining the central bank’s ability to ease without risking undesirable high inflation).

  

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHj-Kpu3ggW-Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737146029239?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=C_w-ISfYMB9Y8YVfqrgH3RQJ2vwdQQVuGHusQPA-s90)

\- Due to the weak economy and the rising inflation, there is substantial pressure for the currency to fall. At this stage, there is a big divergence between the floating rate and fixed rate cases. The policy makers in fixed rate cases are fighting against currency depreciation. In fact, with high inflation the currency is getting more expensive right when they need a devaluation. In the floating rate cases, the currency is gradually selling off into the economic weakness.

\- For countries with hard currency debts,**credit** **spreads rise** as markets price in a greater likelihood of default.

  

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHugyRrTxqtqg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737146062538?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=fWwba68FFWamAVDF__-G4lHYY_MCWX-yrlay6THxL7Q)

\- **Risky assets price in higher risk premiums** (i.e., sell off), adding to the downward pressure on the economy.

\- **At this stage, the central bank typically sells reserves**. Remember that debt works for governments pretty much the same way it works for people and companies except that governments that have the debt denominated in their own currency and have the ability to print their own currency can print the money to pay off their debt. Also, as for people and companies, governments can build up savings to help them prevent financial problems when their incomes fall short of their expenses. For that reason, when looking at the riskiness of any debtor, including governments, one should also see what amount of liquid savings they have. Reserves are one of the main forms of liquid savings for governments. So are sovereign wealth funds. Watching their size, how fast they are being drawn down, and how close they are to running out is important to identifying the timing of debt problems. In the process, it pays to watch for the selling of foreign currency and buying of local currency, which is typically done. Because this reduces the money supply, it is a form of tightening. As shown in the chart below, the selling of reserves is typical at this stage of the cycle.

  

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFtSZoNGLxLKQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737146088202?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=N14vEjN9jMS-Azhmdfg9dWwBppqclzEg5Y2N2_yYF3I)

\- **Note that in the most severe cases, reserves are typically already low relative to the central bank’s liabilities (e.g., the stock of money that savers hold), which gives these central banks little firepower to fight the run on the currency. When that is the case, it becomes apparent that their currency defense will fail, which increases the betting against the currency and the fleeing of debt denominated in it.**

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQH4cWto4YI4qA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1737146100283?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=UrGeaBhefbJJfri8JInsmgKH8ypZvr2kDgipb9tWBxQ)

The table below shows in more detail past interventions of central banks via their reserves across all the cases with meaningful intervention. What you can see is that:

\- **Typically, before the central bank intervenes by selling reserves, the country has a modest war chest of reserves (on average around 5% of GDP covering 10% of the outstanding money supply and government debt outstanding).**

\- **To stem capital flight, during the intervention phase the central bank typically spends over half of its reserves in total to defend the currency** (reserves in global currency terms have fallen by 62% on average). Typically, a lot of this selling is concentrated in a relatively short period of time—for example, in the worst six-month period of intervention reserves decline by 49% in the median case.

\- **Typically, the currency falls** during the currency defense phase (gold rallies 42% in the median case)—though in some cases the central bank’s intervention is able to temporarily prop up the currency.

\- **Then, after a roughly two-year defense (though it of course varies by case)—the central bank gives up.**At this point the reserves back only a small amount of the money stock (6% on average) and a tiny amount of the government debt (3% on average).**After the central bank stops intervening, the currency falls further (and on average gold has rallied another 51% in the median case).**The different cases are shown below.

**At this stage, it becomes relatively clear that the currency is at best highly risky and at worst a very bad deal. This leads to not just investors leaving the debt/currency, but in many cases participants in the economy—most importantly banks, corporations, and households—making prudent/de-risking moves out of the debt and currency.**Here are many of the dynamics we saw in the cases we studied which I consider classic signs of being in the late stages of the debt cycle:

Corporate Treasury Actions

1. **Domestic companies decide to keep international revenue offshore principally in foreign FX** (i.e., dollars), not converting them back to local currency like they used to. Seeing their revenues swing in local currency terms even as dollar prices stay more stable, they begin to think of their local currency as the currency to hedge, even though in traditional investing they should hedge the foreign currencies.
2. **Domestic corporations decide to increase their amount of hedging of the local currency**, especially those with hard currency debts. Hedging involves a forward contract to sell the local currency and buy foreign currency, which lowers the forward exchange rate and drags down the spot exchange rate.
3. Similarly,**foreign corporations with domestic subsidiaries ensure cash is promptly swept out of the country**.
4. **Companies decide their foreign subsidiaries aren’t worth the hassle** —navigating the currency risk, political chaos, sometimes career risk, for a small expansion opportunity doesn’t make a lot of sense. New FDI projects are put on hold.

Domestic Bank Actions

**5\. The banks that were forced to buy the debts under government policies have to sell them when liquidity dries up** —accelerating the debt sell-off in the worst of the crisis.

**6\. Some of the central bank tactics to keep conditions stimulative (multiple interest rates, capital controls) make it more attractive to keep money offshore than onshore.**Domestic banks and corporations are often the ones best placed to make that market. Even if kept in the same currency, money leaving the domestic banking system often means selling government debt.

International Bank Actions

**7\. International lenders close lines of business that are too much of a headache** —trade financing, working capital lines of credit, etc.

**8\. Often, they** **literally sell or give away their bank subsidiaries when it is not worth the exposure to losses** that a small subsidiary has on the broader corporation (let alone the headache of paying attention to this corner of the business).

Large International Investor Actions

9\. Ironically, even as borrowing grows, more of it is held by players who can’t sell (e.g., banks), and the dollar value of the assets fall.**Liquidity dries up, pushing out large foreign investors who don’t like illiquid assets**.

**10\. There are moves out of the currency by large government reserve holders, often with geopolitical considerations** a big part of the decision.

11\. Often, big international reserve allocators can’t really sell their assets—it would be too disruptive to the market. Instead,**reserve managers start accumulating all new reserves in a different currency** —causing demand to dry up.

12\. Relatedly, international investors can’t sell their assets (too little liquidity), but **they don’t roll the exposures**.

The outflows from foreigners are classic and tend to lead the devaluation.

Domestic Saver Actions

**13\. Domestic savers decide they want diversification, and to some degree begin betting on inflation-hedge assets, which drives flows in that direction.****They convert bank deposits to hard currency**, requiring banks to sell local currency to buy foreign currency.

**14\. People buy real goods to get ahead of inflation.**Since a share of these real goods are imports, it creates a currency sale. This of course also fuels inflation and makes matters worse.

**15\. High-net-worth individuals, mostly concerned about wealth preservation and rising taxes and wealth confiscation, move money abroad.**

**16\. Domestic savers see holding foreign stocks as the more reliable bet.**More products pop up to make that possible.

**17\. Opening foreign bank accounts, since domestic banks look troubled, looks like the prudent move.**Those banks make it easy to exchange to other currencies (assuming the government hasn’t imposed capital controls; in many cases the government makes opening foreign bank accounts quite difficult).

More Traditional Speculative Trading

**18\. Bond vigilante market action emerges and becomes self-reinforcing.**

**19\. Equity investors pull out of the country as the environment deteriorates, which creates a negative currency impact.**
