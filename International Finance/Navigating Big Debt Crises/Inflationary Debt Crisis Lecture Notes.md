# Inflationary Debt Crisis Lecture Notes

## Introduction to Inflationary Debt Crises

1. **Overview of Inflationary Debt Crises**
   - Inflationary debt crises are characterized by the devaluation of currency and rising inflation.
   - These crises are distinct from deflationary debt crises,  which involve falling prices and economic contraction.
   - The archetypal inflationary debt crisis is derived from averaging 27 significant historical inflationary cycles.

1. **Comparison with Historical Cases**
   - The Weimar Republic's hyperinflation is a notable historical example.
   - Studying such cases provides insights into the dynamics of inflationary crises.

## Fundamental Concepts

1. **Currency and Debt Functions**
   - Currency and debt serve as:
	 - Mediums of exchange.
	 - Stores of wealth.
   - Debt represents both an asset and a liability.
	 - It is a promise to pay in a specific currency (e.g.,  dollars,  euros).

1. **Debt Holders' Expectations**
   - Debt holders expect to convert debt into money and subsequently into goods and services.
   - They are sensitive to:
	 - Inflation rates affecting purchasing power.
	 - Interest rates as compensation for holding debt.

1. **Central Banks' Role**
   - Central banks produce money and credit in their respective currencies.
   - They work symbiotically with borrowers and lenders to manage debt levels.
   - The challenge is to prevent the debt pile from leading to either deflationary or inflationary depressions.

## Policy Makers and Central Banks

1. **Balancing Opposing Forces**
   - Policy makers have significant power to redistribute burdens during debt crises.
   - Central banks often print currency to relieve debt crises,  stimulating spending but devaluing the currency.

1. **Currency Dynamics**
   - If a currency depreciates faster than its interest rate,  debt holders incur losses.
   - This dynamic can lead to inflationary depressions.

## Investor Behavior and Currency Dynamics

1. **Investor Reactions to Currency Weakness**
   - Investors may sell debt in a weakening currency and move assets to stronger currencies or non-currency stores of wealth (e.g.,  gold).

1. **Central Bank Dilemmas**
   - In times of economic weakness,  central banks struggle to raise interest rates enough to counteract currency depreciation.
   - This can lead to capital flight,  where money leaves the country for safer investments.

1. **Central Bank Responses**
   - Central banks face a choice between allowing credit markets to tighten or printing more money.
   - Printing money can exacerbate inflationary pressures.

## Managing Inflation and Growth

1. **Trade-offs in Monetary Policy**
   - Central banks manage inflation and growth by adjusting interest rates and liquidity.
   - These trade-offs are easier when money flows into a country's currency/debt.
   - They become more challenging when money flows out,  leading to potential inflationary depressions.

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Inflationary Depressions**
   - Inflationary depressions result from complex interactions between currency dynamics,  investor behavior,  and central bank policies.
   - Effective management requires balancing inflationary pressures with economic growth objectives.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Demand for Currency and Debt

1. **Impact of Demand on Currency/Debt**
   - Increased demand for a country's currency/debt:
	 - Pushes currency/debt prices up.
	 - Leads to lower inflation and higher growth,  assuming stable money and credit supply.
   - Decreased demand has the opposite effect:
	 - Currency/debt prices fall.
	 - Inflation rises and growth slows.

1. **Central Bank's Role in Managing Demand**
   - Central banks influence currency and interest rates through policy levers.
   - The balance between currency depreciation and interest rate adjustments is crucial.
   - In times of capital outflow:
	 - Real interest rates need to rise less if real exchange rates fall more.

## Capital Outflows and Currency Weakness

1. **Causes of Capital Outflows**
   - Occur in inhospitable environments:
	 - Economic,  debt,  or political issues.
   - Lead to significant currency depreciation.

1. **Consequences of Currency Weakness**
   - Increases debt costs for those borrowing in stronger currencies.
   - Further weakens the currency relative to stronger ones.
   - Countries with severe debt problems and foreign currency debt are most vulnerable.

## Inflationary Depressions and Currency Weakness

1. **Mechanism of Inflation in Depressions**
   - Currency weakness leads to inflation during depressions.
   - The cycle ends when:
	 - Debts are defaulted or money is created to ease the squeeze.
	 - Debt service requirements are reduced (e.g.,  forbearance).
	 - Currency depreciates more than inflation,  improving competitiveness.

1. **Role of Politics in Economic Adjustments**
   - Political factors can hinder or facilitate economic adjustments.
   - Severe political issues can lead to prolonged economic downturns.

## Vulnerability to Inflationary Deleveragings

1. **Characteristics of Vulnerable Countries**
   - Lack of a reserve currency.
   - Low foreign-exchange reserves.
   - Large foreign debt.
   - Large and increasing budget/[[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficits.
   - Negative real interest rates.
   - History of high inflation and negative returns.

1. **Iconic Case Studies**
   - The Weimar Republic in the 1920s is a classic example.
   - Differences between Weimar,  the US Great Depression,  and 2007–2011 are explored in further studies.

## Reserve-Currency Countries and Inflationary Depressions

1. **Potential for Inflationary Depressions**
   - Less likely in reserve-currency countries without significant foreign-currency debt.
   - Can occur after prolonged overuse of economic stimulation.
   - Typically emerge later in the deleveraging process.

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Inflationary Depressions**
   - Result from complex interactions between currency dynamics,  investor behavior,  and central bank policies.
   - Effective management requires balancing inflationary pressures with economic growth objectives.
   - Political stability is crucial for successful economic adjustments.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Reserve-Currency Countries and Inflationary Depressions

1. **Potential for Inflationary Depressions in Reserve-Currency Countries**
   - Even reserve-currency countries can experience capital outflows.
	 - This affects the trade-off between inflation and growth.
   - Allowing higher inflation to maintain growth can:
	 - Undermine demand for the currency.
	 - Erode reserve currency status.
	 - Transform deleveraging into an inflationary one.

## The Phases of the Classic Inflationary Debt Cycle

1. **Overview of Inflationary Debt Cycle**
   - Inflationary deleveragings follow five stages,  similar to deflationary ones but with key differences.
   - The archetype is based on 27 historical inflationary deleveragings with foreign currency debt.
   - Comparison with hyperinflationary cases highlights differences.

1. **Stages of Inflationary Deleveraging**
   - The cycle mirrors deflationary deleveragings until the depression stage.

### 1) The Early Part of the Cycle

1. **Healthy Upswing**
   - Favorable [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] due to strong fundamentals.
	 - Competitiveness and potential for productive investment.
   - Low debt levels and healthy balance sheets.
	 - Stimulates export sales and attracts foreign capital.
	 - Funds investments yielding productive growth.

1. **Capital Flows and Economic Growth**
   - Capital flows are volatile and crucial to monitor.
   - Early cycle characteristics:
	 - Debt and incomes rise at comparable rates.
	 - Strong debt and equity markets encourage investment.
	 - Borrowing by private sector,  government,  and banks is rational due to rising incomes.

1. **Positive,  Self-Reinforcing Cycle**
   - Improved currency demand enhances the cycle.
	 - Attractive opportunities for foreign investors.
	 - Favorable balance of payments due to export surplus.
   - Central bank benefits:
	 - More growth per unit of inflation.
	 - Options to appreciate currency,  lower interest rates,  or increase reserves.

1. **Central Bank Interventions**
   - Some central banks intervene in foreign exchange markets.
	 - Sell domestic currency for foreign currency to prevent appreciation.
   - Use acquired foreign currency to buy investment assets (e.g.,  bonds).
	 - Stored in foreign-exchange reserves.
	 - Reserves act as savings to cushion currency market movements.

By understanding these phases and dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Reserve Accumulation and Economic Stimulation

1. **Strategic Use of Reserves**
   - Central banks can use reserves to purchase desirable investment assets.
   - These assets may offer strategic returns or enhance economic stability.

1. **Economic Stimulation through Reserve Accumulation**
   - Accumulating reserves reduces upward pressure on the domestic currency.
	 - This maintains export competitiveness.
	 - It injects more money into the economy.

1. **Mechanism of Reserve Accumulation**
   - Central banks create more domestic currency to buy foreign currency.
	 - This increases the domestic money supply.
	 - Funds can be used to buy assets,  causing asset prices to rise.
	 - Alternatively,  funds can be lent out,  stimulating economic activity.

1. **Attractiveness of Currency Returns**
   - Currency returns become attractive due to:
	 - Foreign buyers needing to exchange their currency for the local currency.
	 - Central banks increasing the supply of domestic currency,  boosting asset prices in local terms.

1. **Impact of Favorable Balance of Payments**
   - A favorable balance of payments leads to:
	 - Currency appreciation and/or increased foreign-exchange reserves.
	 - Economic stimulation and rising markets.
	 - Investors benefiting from currency returns and asset appreciation.

1. **Currency Appreciation vs. Asset Appreciation**
   - As the currency appreciates,  asset appreciation may slow down.
   - The balance between currency and asset returns is crucial for investors.

## The Bubble Phase

1. **Emergence of the Bubble**
   - Bubbles form during virtuous cycles of strong [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] and economic conditions.
   - Initial capital inflows produce good returns,  attracting more capital.

1. **Characteristics of the Bubble Phase**
   - Currency and asset prices are bid up,  often financed by debt.
   - Prices become too high to yield adequate returns,  yet borrowing continues.
   - Debts rise rapidly relative to incomes.

1. **Self-Reinforcing Nature of Bubbles**
   - Inflows strengthen the currency,  making local assets desirable.
   - Money creation leads to rising prices,  further attracting investment.
   - Total returns for foreign investors (asset prices + currency appreciation) are attractive.

1. **Economic and Market Dynamics**
   - The country becomes a hot investment destination.
   - Assets become overbought,  leading to debt and stock-market bubbles.
   - Investors rush in,  fearing missing out on lucrative opportunities.

1. **Indicators of an Inflating Bubble**
   - High foreign [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]],  averaging around 10% of GDP.
   - Central bank accumulation of foreign-exchange reserves.
   - Real FX becomes overvalued by approximately 15% on a PPP basis.
   - Stock markets rally,  often over 20% annually leading to the peak.

1. **Risks of a Fully Long and Leveraged Market**
   - When markets are fully long,  leveraged,  and overpriced,  they are ripe for reversal.
   - The cycle of inflows and rising prices can reverse,  leading to potential downturns.

By understanding these phases and dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Motivations and Positions in Currency Markets

1. **Participants' Motivations to Be Long in Currency**
   - Most participants are motivated to be long the currency of a country experiencing a sustained investment wave.
   - This position is often taken implicitly or without full recognition.

1. **Foreign Businesses' Currency Strategies**
   - Foreign businesses setting up operations in a booming country may:
	 - Fund activities with their own currency to maintain liabilities in a potentially weaker currency.
	 - Prefer to hold deposits in the local currency.
	 - Avoid hedging currency exposures from local sales revenues.

1. **Local Businesses' Borrowing Practices**
   - Local businesses might borrow in weaker foreign currencies.
   - Foreign bankers are eager to lend due to the hot market conditions.

1. **Mechanisms Leading to Long Positions in Local Currency**
   - Sustained bull markets lead multinational entities to long positions in local currency through various channels:
	 - Influx of foreign capital finances a consumption boom.
	 - Imports rise faster than exports,  worsening the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]].

## Economic Growth and Investment Dynamics

1. **Investment and Growth Dynamics**
   - Investment in the country leads to strong growth and rising incomes.
   - Borrowers become more creditworthy,  and lenders are more willing to lend.

1. **Role of Export Prices**
   - High export prices,  often for commodities,  increase national income and incentivize investment.

1. **Emergence of the Bubble**
   - As the bubble emerges,  fewer productive investments are available.
   - More capital chases these limited opportunities.

1. **Erosion of Competitiveness**
   - Rising currency erodes the country's competitiveness.
   - Growth increasingly relies on debt rather than productivity gains.
   - The country becomes reliant on foreign financing.

## Foreign Currency Debt and Economic Indicators

1. **Foreign Currency Debt Dynamics**
   - Foreign currency-denominated debt rises.
   - Emerging countries often borrow abroad in foreign currencies due to:
	 - Underdeveloped local financial systems.
	 - Less faith in local currency lending.
	 - Limited domestic savings for lending.

1. **Asset Prices and Economic Strength**
   - Asset prices rise,  and the economy remains strong.
   - This leads to higher spending and obligations to pay foreign currency debt.

1. **Debt Cycle Dynamics**
   - Positive effects of debt cycles appear first,  followed by negative effects.
   - Debt burdens rise rapidly.

1. **Debt and GDP Indicators**
   - Debt to GDP rises at about 10% annually over three years.
   - Foreign-currency debt averages around 35% of total debt and 45% of GDP.
   - Economic activity is strong,  with GDP growth above potential,  leading to tight capacity.

## Archetype of Inflationary Deleveraging

1. **Archetype Charts and Economic Activity**
   - Charts illustrate debt and [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] trends in 27 inflationary deleveraging cases.
   - The "zero" point on charts represents the peak in economic activity.

1. **Bubble Phase Characteristics**
   - During the bubble,  debt as a percentage of GDP rises from 125% to 150%.
   - The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deteriorates by about 2% of GDP.

1. **Income and Spending Gap**
   - The gap between the country's income and spending widens.
   - Increasing capital inflows are needed to sustain growth in spending.

1. **Fragility at the Cycle's Peak**
   - Economic activity remains strong at the cycle's peak due to continued inflows.
   - Expectations of high growth drive asset prices and currency strength.
   - The country becomes fragile,  and minor events can trigger reversals.

## Summary of Conditions Leading to Inflationary Deleveragings

1. **Conditions Through Economic Upswings**
   - The conditions leading to the 27 inflationary deleveragings include:
	 - Strong capital inflows.
	 - Rising asset prices and currency appreciation.
	 - Increasing reliance on foreign financing.
	 - Growing debt burdens and economic fragility.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Case Analysis: Foreign-Denominated Debt and Economic Outcomes

1. **Differentiation of Cases**
   - Cases are categorized based on:
	 - Levels of foreign-denominated debt.
	 - Severity of economic outcomes.
	   - Measured by declines in growth and equity prices.
	   - Increases in unemployment and inflation.

1. **Correlation with Economic Pain**
   - Countries with high external reliance and significant asset bubbles:
	 - Experienced the most severe economic downturns.
	 - Suffered from extreme declines in growth and equity prices.
	 - Faced sharp increases in unemployment and inflation.

## The Top and Currency Defense

1. **Bubble Burst and Reversal**
   - The top-reversal/currency-defense phase begins when:
	 - The bubble bursts.
	 - High currency levels,  asset prices,  and debt growth rates become unsustainable.

1. **Cycle Reversal Dynamics**
   - A mirror-opposite cycle from the upswing is set in motion:
	 - Weakening capital inflows and asset prices.
	 - Deteriorating economic conditions.
	 - Further weakening of [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] and asset prices.

1. **Balance of Payments Crisis and Inflationary Depression**
   - The spiral leads to:
	 - A balance of payments crisis.
	 - An inflationary depression.

1. **Triggering Events**
   - Optimism at the top makes the economy vulnerable to minor events:
	 - Slowing foreign capital inflows.
	 - Increasing domestic capital outflows.

1. **Role of Trade Balances and Capital Flows**
   - Worsening trade balances contribute to the crisis:
	 - High currency levels and excessive domestic consumption lead to high imports.
   - Adverse shifts in [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are more critical.

## Causes of Top-Reversal

1. **Income and Credit Shocks**
   - Similar to financial difficulties faced by families or individuals:
	 - Loss of income or credit tightening.
	 - Big increases in costs (e.g.,  rising gasoline or heating oil prices).
	 - Difficulty in repaying borrowed amounts.

1. **Typical Crisis Cycle**
   - Crisis arises from the unsustainable pace of capital inflows slowing.
   - Often triggered by a shock (e.g.,  decline in oil prices for an oil producer).

1. **Categories of Causes**
   - **Income Drops from Exports**
	 - Currency appreciation makes exports expensive.
	 - Commodity-exporting countries suffer from falling commodity prices.
   - **Rising Costs of Imports or Borrowing**
   - **Declines in Capital Inflows**
	 - Foreign investors reduce net lending or investment.
	 - Causes include:
	   - Natural slowing of unsustainable pace.
	   - Economic or political concerns.
	   - Tightening of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] locally or abroad.
   - **Domestic Capital Flight**
	 - Citizens or companies seek to move money out of the country/currency.

## Balance of Payments Crisis Dynamics

1. **Initial Weakening of Capital Flows**
   - Often the first sign of a balance of payments crisis.
   - Directly causes growth to weaken:
	 - Reduced investment and consumption financing.

1. **Self-Reinforcing Weakening**
   - Domestic borrowers appear less creditworthy.
   - Foreigners become less willing to lend and provide capital.

1. **Economic Consequences**
   - Growth slows relative to potential as capital inflows slow.
   - Domestic capital outflows increase.
   - Export earnings fall due to:
	 - Falling prices.
	 - Decreased quantities sold.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Economic Slowdown and Capital Outflows

1. **Stagnation in Exports**
   - Exports typically plateau,  ceasing to rise.
   - This stagnation is a precursor to economic slowdown.

1. **Impact on Capital and Income Flows**
   - Shifts in capital and income flows lead to:
	 - Decline in asset prices.
	 - Increase in interest rates.
   - These changes slow economic growth,  which was previously bolstered by capital inflows.

1. **Deterioration of Company Fundamentals**
   - Worsening fundamentals of companies drive further capital outflows.
   - This creates a negative feedback loop,  exacerbating economic challenges.

## Debt Bust and Banking Failures

1. **Onset of a Debt Bust**
   - The economy experiences a debt bust characterized by:
	 - Falling asset prices.
	 - Bank failures.

1. **Increased Anxiety Among Stakeholders**
   - Asset and currency holders worry about potential restrictions on capital movement.
   - Policy makers are concerned about capital outflows and potential currency collapse.

1. **Balance of Payments Deterioration**
   - As the balance of payments worsens,  central banks face increased challenges:
	 - Currency depreciation.
	 - Rising interest rates.
	 - Declining reserves.

## Central Bank Currency Defense Strategies

1. **Typical Currency Defense Measures**
   - Central banks attempt to defend currencies by:
	 - Spending down reserves to fill the balance of payments deficit.
	 - Raising interest rates.

1. **Ineffectiveness of Currency Defenses**
   - These measures often fail because:
	 - Selling reserves and raising interest rates create opportunities for sellers.
	 - They do not achieve the necessary currency and interest rate levels for sustainable economic conditions.

1. **Critical Relationship in Currency Markets**
   - The relationship between interest rate differences and spot/forward currency pricing is crucial.
   - Expected currency depreciation is reflected in the forward price being lower than the spot price.

## Interest Rate and Currency Depreciation Dynamics

1. **Interest Rate Adjustments and Currency Expectations**
   - If the market expects a 5% currency depreciation over a year,  the currency must yield a 5% higher interest rate.
   - Short-term depreciation expectations require even higher interest rate adjustments.

1. **Economic Impact of High Interest Rates**
   - High interest rates,  necessary to counteract expected depreciation,  can severely contract an already weak economy.
   - A 5% monthly interest rate equates to an annual rate of about 80%,  which is unsustainable.

1. **Consequences of Managed Currency Decline**
   - Managed currency declines with falling reserves lead to expectations of continued depreciation.
   - This pushes up domestic interest rates,  tightening the economy further.

## Capital Withdrawals and Speculation

1. **Increased Capital Withdrawals**
   - Expectations of continued devaluation encourage capital withdrawals and speculation.
   - This widens the balance of payments gap.

1. **Central Bank Reserve Spending**
   - Central banks are forced to spend more reserves to defend the currency.
   - Eventually,  reserve spending must stop to avoid depleting savings.

1. **Policy Maker Responses**
   - Policy makers often make confident statements to reassure markets.
   - These actions typically precede the next stage of the cycle: letting the currency float.

## Forward Currency Pricing and Monetary Policy

1. **Forward Currency Price Dynamics**
   - During currency defense,  forward currency prices often decline ahead of spot prices.
   - This reflects the interest rate differential and spot/forward currency pricing relationship.

1. **Monetary Policy Tightening**
   - Tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] to support the currency increases the interest rate differential.
   - This artificially holds up the spot currency but exacerbates economic weakness.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Currency Defense and Forward Currency Pricing

1. **Forward Currency Pricing Dynamics**
   - Forward currency prices often decline ahead of spot prices during currency defense.
   - This reflects the interest rate differential and spot/forward currency pricing relationship.

1. **Whip-like Effect in Currency Markets**
   - The forward tends to lead the spot downward as the interest rate differential increases.
   - The spot eventually catches up after the currency is let go.
   - The fall in the spot exchange rate allows the interest differential to narrow.
   - This mechanically causes the forward to rally relative to the spot.

1. **Role of Capital Controls**
   - Capital controls are a third,  often last-ditch lever that seldom works.
   - They can seem attractive to policymakers as they directly reduce capital outflows.
   - However,  they usually fail because:
	 - Investors find ways to circumvent them.
	 - The act of trying to trap capital leads to increased desire to escape.
   - The inability to move money out of a country is analogous to a bank run.
   - Capital controls can be a temporary fix but not a sustained solution.

1. **Duration of Currency Defense Phase**
   - This phase is typically brief,  lasting around six months.
   - Reserves are drawn down by about 10 to 20 percent before the defense is abandoned.

## The Depression Phase (Often When the Currency Is Let Go)

1. **Analogy to Family Financial Troubles**
   - A country's inflationary deleveraging is analogous to a family struggling with payments.
   - Unlike a family,  a country can change the amount of currency that exists,  affecting its value.
   - This creates a lever for managing balance of payments pressures.

1. **Impact of Currency Devaluation**
   - Devaluation changes the price of a country's goods and services for foreigners.
   - It allows countries to offer price cuts to the rest of the world without domestic deflation.
   - A 30 percent currency devaluation equates to a 30 percent pay cut relative to the world,  not domestically.

1. **Policy Makers' Response to Currency Pressures**
   - After unsustainable currency support (e.g.,  expending reserves,  tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]],  imposing controls),  policymakers typically let the currency decline.
   - They generally try to smooth its fall.

1. **Typical Outcomes After Currency Is Let Go**
   - The currency experiences a significant initial depreciation,  averaging around 30 percent in real terms.
   - The decline is not offset by tighter short rates,  leading to significant losses from holding the currency (around 30 percent in the first year).
   - Policymakers attempt to smooth the decline by continuing to spend down reserves (by another 10 percent for a year into the bust).

1. **Central Banks' Strategy in Currency Defense**
   - Central banks should avoid defending currencies to the point of depleting reserves or raising interest rates excessively.
   - The dangers of low reserves and high interest rates outweigh the dangers of devaluation.
   - Devaluations are stimulative for the economy and markets,  which is beneficial during economic contraction.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics.

# Currency Decline and Economic Adjustments

## Effects of Currency Decline

1. **Asset Valuation and Export Stimulation**
   - Currency decline tends to increase the value of assets when measured in the weakened currency.
   - It stimulates export sales by making goods cheaper for foreign buyers.
   - Helps balance of payments adjustment by aligning spending with income.

1. **Impact on Imports and Domestic Production**
   - Currency decline makes imports more expensive,  reducing their volume.
   - This shift favors domestic producers by increasing demand for locally produced goods.
   - Assets in the weakened currency become more competitively priced and attractive to investors.

1. **Profit Margins and Export Competitiveness**
   - Exported goods benefit from better profit margins due to lower production costs in foreign currency terms.
   - Sets the stage for increased income from abroad through more [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] exports.

## Double-Edged Nature of Currency Declines

1. **Policy Management and Economic Pain**
   - The way policymakers manage currency declines significantly affects the economic adjustment's severity.
   - Poor management can exacerbate economic pain during the adjustment period.

1. **Inflationary Impact of Currency Declines**
   - Currency weakness leads to higher prices for imported goods,  contributing to inflation.
   - Much of the increased cost is passed on to consumers,  resulting in a sharp rise in inflation.

1. **Gradual vs. One-Off Devaluation**
   - Gradual and persistent currency declines lead to expectations of continued depreciation.
	 - Encourages capital withdrawal and speculation,  widening the balance of payments gap.
	 - Makes inflation more persistent,  feeding an inflation psychology.
   - A large,  one-off devaluation is generally preferable.
	 - Establishes a two-way market for the currency,  reducing expectations of further weakening.
	 - Higher inflation is less likely to be sustained.

## Policy Maker Strategies and Market Reactions

1. **Surprise Devaluation Benefits**
   - If a one-off devaluation is unexpected,  policymakers avoid spending reserves or raising interest rates to defend the currency.
   - This strategy is why policymakers often claim they will defend the currency until they stop doing so.

1. **Post-Devaluation Dynamics**
   - After letting the currency go,  savers are stung,  creating expectations and fears of further devaluation.
   - People rush to exit their positions in the currency,  leading to self-sustaining reversals.

1. **Asset-Liability Mismatches**
   - Many had acquired mismatches that were profitable but become unprofitable when the currency weakens.
   - The reversal forces spending to stop as capital becomes unavailable.

## Economic Ripple Effects

1. **Impact on Spending and Income**
   - The cessation of spending affects income,  causing job losses and reduced spending.
   - Economic growth grinds to a halt.

1. **Debt Problems and Capital Inflows**
   - Domestic banks face debt issues,  and foreigners become less willing to lend.
   - Capital inflows dry up,  falling by more than 5% of GDP in less than 12 months.
   - Capital outflows continue at a pace of -3 to -5% of GDP.

1. **Central Bank Printing Limitations**
   - Central banks are cautious about printing money,  as it risks worsening capital flight.
   - Printing is limited to 1-2% of GDP on average.

## Market Reactions and Asset Performance

1. **Investor Behavior and Asset Valuation**
   - Weaker growth prompts investors to withdraw funds,  turning previously valuable assets into liabilities.
   - Assets quickly transition from overbought to oversold,  causing prices to plummet.

1. **Interest Rates and Yield Curve**
   - Nominal short rates rise,  typically by about 20 percentage points,  and the yield curve inverts.

1. **Equity Market Performance**
   - Equities in local currency terms fall by around 50% on average.
   - Perform worse in foreign currency terms due to currency decline exacerbating the equity sell-off.

## Foreign-Denominated Debt Mismatches

1. **Significance of Foreign-Denominated Debt**
   - One of the most critical asset/liability mismatches is foreign-denominated debt.
   - Currency decline increases the burden of foreign-denominated debt,  exacerbating economic challenges.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of currency declines and their impact on inflationary depressions.

# Inflationary Depressions and Currency Dynamics

## Rising Debt Burden Due to Currency Depreciation

1. **Impact on Debtors with Foreign Currency Debt**
   - As the local currency depreciates,  the debt burden for those owing foreign currency debt increases when measured in local currency.
   - Debtors typically respond by:
	 - Selling local currency to repay debts.
	 - Putting on hedges to protect against further depreciation.
	 - Moving savings into foreign currency.
   - These actions contribute to further downward pressure on the local currency.

1. **Consequences of Rising Debt Service**
   - Debt service costs rise significantly,  often exceeding 5% of GDP.
	 - This is due to falling incomes and increased foreign currency-denominated debt service in local currency terms.
   - The squeeze on incomes and spending intensifies.

1. **Foreign Exchange (FX) Debt Burdens**
   - FX debt burdens increase for those who borrowed in foreign currency.
	 - Debt-to-GDP ratios rise by about 20% due to declining incomes and currency depreciation.

## Inflationary Pressures from Currency Decline

1. **Inflation Dynamics**
   - Currency declines lead to higher import costs,  driving up inflation.
   - Inflation typically rises by 15%,  peaking around 30%.
   - Elevated inflation persists for about two years from the peak.

1. **Economic and Political Reinforcement**
   - Various problems—debt,  economic,  political,  currency—reinforce each other.
   - Hidden issues like fraudulent accounting and corruption often surface during such times.

## Hitting the Bottom: The Catharsis Phase

1. **Investor Behavior and Market Dynamics**
   - The environment discourages foreign investment and encourages domestic capital flight.
   - The bottom is the opposite of the bubble stage,  where investors aggressively exit positions.
   - Panic selling leads to a supply/demand imbalance,  driving prices lower.

1. **Severity of the Downward Spiral**
   - This phase is the most severe and painful part of inflationary deleveraging.
   - The self-reinforcing downward spiral is rapid and intense.

1. **Catharsis and Economic Renewal**
   - "Hitting bottom" is so painful that it triggers radical changes in pricing and policies.
   - This crisis sows the seeds for change and renewal,  akin to a catharsis in theater or personal life.

## Economic Adjustments and Recovery

1. **Restoration of Balance of Payments**
   - The currency's cheapness leads to substantial cuts in import spending,  restoring balance of payments.
   - International aid (e.g.,  from the IMF,  BIS) may assist in necessary adjustments.

1. **Political and Economic Shifts**
   - Significant political shifts often occur,  moving from poor policies to sound economic strategies.
   - Key economic developments include:
	 - A significant fall in economic activity (GDP gap) by about 8%.
	 - Rising unemployment.
	 - The bottom in activity occurs after about one year,  with the GDP gap trough near -4%.

## Normalization and Return to Stability

1. **Achieving Currency Balance**
   - Normalization occurs when there is a balance between currency supply and demand relative to other currencies.
   - This balance is achieved through trade adjustments and,  more importantly,  [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]].

1. **Policy Maker Strategies for Currency Stability**
   - To retain capital,  policymakers must make it desirable to hold the currency.
   - They need to ensure a positive total return for the currency at an acceptable interest rate.
	 - The interest rate should not be too high for domestic conditions.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and currency dynamics,  ultimately leading to economic stabilization and recovery.

# Currency Defense and Economic Strategy

## The Currency Defense Phase

1. **Common Misconceptions**
   - Many believe defending the currency is the best strategy during the currency defense phase.
   - However,  allowing the currency to depreciate sharply and quickly is often more beneficial.

1. **Benefits of Currency Depreciation**
   - A lower currency level can:
	 - Improve the trade balance.
	 - Produce a positive total return.
	 - Align interest rates with domestic conditions.

1. **Investor Attraction Post-Devaluation**
   - Depreciation makes the currency more attractive to investors:
	 - Total returns (spot currency appreciation + interest rate difference) are likely positive.
	 - A sharply depreciated currency level requires a lower interest rate to attract investors.

## Ensuring Positive Total Returns

1. **Depreciation Strategy**
   - Depreciating the currency enough ensures positive total returns at a relatively low real interest rate.
   - This is crucial for weak domestic conditions.

1. **Influence of Balance of Payments and Central Bank Policies**
   - Balance of payments fundamentals and central bank actions determine currency returns.
   - These factors influence investor willingness to own or short the currency.

1. **Risks of Currency Devaluation**
   - Devaluing currencies is akin to using cocaine:
	 - Provides short-term stimulation.
	 - Can be ruinous if abused.

1. **Central Bank's Role**
   - Central banks must balance currency depreciation with tight policies to make currency ownership attractive.
   - Monitoring central bank actions is crucial before taking long positions.

## Avoiding Inflationary Spirals

1. **Investor Confidence and Currency Stability**
   - Prolonged negative returns and continuous currency decline can lead to inflationary spirals.
   - Central banks should aim for a currency level that stimulates the economy and balances payments.

1. **Chart Analysis**
   - Returns to holding the currency for foreigners start negative but improve about a year post-devaluation.

## Managing Debt and Liquidity

1. **Debt Limits and Systemic Institutions**
   - Even if a country hasn't hit its debt limits,  certain entities may have.
   - Policymakers must recapitalize important institutions and provide targeted liquidity.

1. **Targeted Liquidity Provision**
   - Printing money to provide liquidity can prevent a debt crisis and manage capital flight.
   - The inflationary impact of money printing must be carefully balanced.

## Economic Recovery and Stabilization

1. **Indicators of Economic Bottoming**
   - Import collapse improves the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] by about 8% of GDP.
   - Capital inflows stabilize,  and capital flight abates.
   - Countries often seek IMF or international support when reserves are low.

1. **Interest Rate Adjustments**
   - Short rates decrease after about a year,  while long rates remain elevated.
   - Short rates return to pre-crisis levels in around two years,  stimulating the economy.

1. **Currency and Inflation Dynamics**
   - As interest rates fall,  the forward currency price rallies relative to the spot.
   - Currency stabilization leads to reduced inflation,  reaching pre-crisis levels in about two years.

1. **Balance of Payments Adjustment**
   - Decline in domestic conditions helps close the balance of payments gap by reducing spending and imports.

## Conclusion

1. **Strategic Currency Management**
   - Effective currency management involves allowing depreciation to stimulate the economy while maintaining attractive returns.
   - Policymakers must balance short-term stimulation with long-term stability to avoid inflationary spirals.

1. **Tailored Approaches**
   - While these are general trends,  specific strategies depend on each country's unique circumstances.

# Inflationary Depressions and Economic Adjustments

## Economic Contraction and Current Account Adjustments

1. **Import Contraction and Economic Collapse**
   - During a crisis,  the average country's imports contract by approximately 10%.
   - This contraction is a result of collapsing economic growth and a significant equity market decline,  often exceeding 50%.

1. **Current Account Surplus Emergence**
   - The collapse in imports typically shifts the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] from a deficit to a surplus.
	 - Surplus of 2% of GDP from a deficit of -6% of GDP.
	 - This shift occurs about 18 months into the crisis.

1. **Role of Exports in Economic Recovery**
   - In the early crisis stages,  exports play a minor role and may contract.
	 - Other countries may also experience economic slowdowns.
   - Exports tend to rebound in subsequent years,  aiding recovery.

## Managing Economic Adjustments: Well-Managed vs. Poorly Managed

### Well-Managed Adjustments

1. **Currency Management**
   - Policymakers bluff about not allowing significant currency weakening.
   - When devaluation occurs,  it is a surprise and large enough to create a two-way market.
	 - This reduces expectations of further currency weakening.

1. **Closing External Imbalances**
   - Tight [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] aligns domestic demand with falling incomes.
   - Incentives are created for investors to remain in the currency.
	 - Higher interest rates compensate for currency depreciation risks.

1. **Smoothing the Downturn**
   - Reserves are used judiciously to manage foreign capital withdrawal.
   - Efforts are made to close external imbalances.

1. **Managing Bad Debts/Defaults**
   - Over-indebted entities work through debts,  with credit gaps filled elsewhere.

### Poorly Managed Adjustments

1. **Currency Management**
   - Policymakers are expected to allow currency weakness,  increasing downward pressure.
   - Initial devaluation is small,  leading to further devaluations.
	 - This expectation causes higher interest rates and inflation.

1. **Closing External Imbalances**
   - Loose [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] favors domestic conditions,  delaying necessary adjustments.
   - Capital controls or restrictive measures are used to stop capital outflows.

1. **Smoothing the Downturn**
   - Reliance on reserve sales maintains higher spending levels.

1. **Managing Bad Debts/Defaults**
   - Disorderly defaults increase uncertainty and capital flight.

## Recovery and Economic Renewal

1. **Recovery Timeline**
   - Recovery typically takes a few years,  with initial reluctance from burned investors.
   - Domestic goods and labor become attractive due to currency depreciation.
   - Higher exports and foreign direct investment stimulate growth.

1. **Financial Institution Support**
   - Protecting and recapitalizing critical financial institutions supports recovery.
   - Domestic financial pipelines are crucial for economic stabilization.

1. **Cycle Renewal**
   - The country enters a new virtuous cycle with productive investment opportunities.
   - Capital inflows drive growth and asset prices,  attracting more capital.

1. **Economic Indicators of Recovery**
   - Incomes and spending pick up after one to two years.
   - Full activity recovery takes about three years from the bottom.
   - Real FX remains undervalued,  aiding export competitiveness.
   - Capital inflows and equity recovery occur over four to five years.

## The Spiral from Transitory Inflationary Depression to Hyperinflation

1. **Potential for Hyperinflation**
   - While many recoveries are engineered successfully,  some inflationary depressions spiral into hyperinflation.
   - This occurs when policy mismanagement exacerbates economic imbalances.

1. **Factors Leading to Hyperinflation**
   - Persistent negative returns and continuous currency decline.
   - Inadequate policy responses to stabilize the economy and currency.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of inflationary depressions and economic adjustments,  ultimately leading to stabilization and recovery.

# Hyperinflations and Inflationary Spirals

## Introduction to Hyperinflations

1. **Definition and Characteristics**
   - Hyperinflations involve extreme inflation levels,  where prices of goods and services more than double annually.
   - They are coupled with severe economic hardship and significant losses of wealth.

1. **Prevalence and Importance**
   - Hyperinflations are more common than often perceived.
   - Understanding the transition from inflationary depressions to hyperinflations is crucial for economic policy and stability.

## Causes of Hyperinflations

1. **Policy Failures and Imbalances**
   - The primary cause is the failure of policymakers to address imbalances between external income,  spending,  and debt service.
   - Persistent money printing to fund external spending exacerbates the situation.

1. **Involuntary and Voluntary Money Printing**
   - In some cases,  such as Weimar Germany,  external debt obligations (e.g.,  war reparations) necessitate money printing.
   - In other cases,  policymakers choose to print money to sustain growth rather than align spending with income.

1. **Consequences of Sustained Money Printing**
   - Prolonged and large-scale money printing can lead to hyperinflation.
   - Stopping money printing during a crisis can cause liquidity shortages and economic contraction.

## Case Study: Weimar Germany

1. **External Debt Burden**
   - Weimar Germany faced a crushing external debt service burden due to war reparations.
   - Defaulting on these obligations was largely not an option.

1. **Capital Outflows and Inflation**
   - The required capital outflows were so significant that inflation problems were inevitable.
   - The case study of Weimar Germany provides detailed insights into these dynamics.

1. **Shortage of Cash and Economic Impact**
   - Hyperinflation led to a cash shortage,  severely impacting commerce.
   - By late October 1923,  the entire 1913 money stock could barely purchase a loaf of bread.

## Dynamics of the Inflationary Spiral

1. **Currency Decline and Inflation Psychology**
   - As the currency declines and money printing increases,  inflationary psychology sets in.
   - Currency depreciation leads to capital flight,  creating a feedback loop of inflation and money printing.

1. **Diminishing Effectiveness of Money Printing**
   - Over time,  money printing becomes less effective in stimulating growth.
   - More printed money is diverted to real or foreign assets rather than productive investments.

1. **Shift in Investor Behavior**
   - Investors prefer real assets (e.g.,  gold) and foreign currencies to hedge against inflation.
   - Domestic currency holders move away from investing in productive assets.

1. **Impact on Economic Growth**
   - The economy weakens as stocks suffer and no longer drive spending.
   - Currency devaluation fails to stimulate growth,  exacerbating the economic downturn.

## Self-Reinforcing Inflation Dynamics

1. **Persistent Inflation and Investor Behavior**
   - Continual currency declines lead to persistent inflation,  reinforcing inflation psychology.
   - Investors' behavior shifts,  further fueling the inflation spiral.

1. **Wage-Cost Spiral**
   - Inflation pressures spread to wages,  creating a wage-cost spiral.
   - Workers demand higher wages to maintain purchasing power,  further driving inflation.

## Conclusion

1. **Understanding Hyperinflations**
   - Hyperinflations result from complex interactions between policy failures,  currency dynamics,  and investor behavior.
   - Effective management requires addressing imbalances and avoiding excessive money printing.

1. **Lessons from Historical Cases**
   - Historical examples like Weimar Germany provide valuable insights into the causes and dynamics of hyperinflations.
   - Policymakers must learn from these cases to prevent similar economic crises in the future.

# Inflationary Spirals and Economic Dynamics

## Wage-Price Spiral and Currency Depreciation

1. **Compelled Wage Increases and Price Adjustments**
   - Producers raise prices to offset increased wage costs.
   - Wage indexing contracts exacerbate this cycle by automatically adjusting wages with inflation.

1. **Vicious Cycle of Inflation and Currency Depreciation**
   - Currency depreciation leads to rising internal prices.
   - Increased money supply further devalues the currency,  perpetuating the cycle.
   - Each currency decline prompts behavioral changes in savers and investors.

1. **Behavioral Shifts in Savers and Investors**
   - Savers,  having experienced losses,  seek to protect purchasing power.
	 - They short cash and invest in foreign and physical assets.
   - Inflation prompts bank depositors to demand quick access to funds.
	 - Deposits shift to short-term accounts,  reducing lending durations.

1. **Investor Concerns and Lending Practices**
   - Investors shorten lending durations or cease lending due to default risks.
   - Average debt maturities decrease during inflationary deleveragings.

## Financial System Illiquidity and Central Bank Responses

1. **Capital Withdrawal and Financial Illiquidity**
   - High inflation and money printing lower real interest rates,  making it cheap to short cash.
   - Capital withdrawal and rapid borrowing lead to financial system illiquidity.
   - Banks struggle to meet cash demands,  and businesses face contract fulfillment issues.

1. **Central Bank Dilemma: Illiquidity vs. Money Printing**
   - Central banks choose between extreme illiquidity and accelerated money printing.
   - They opt to print money,  providing liquidity to support banks and businesses.

1. **Consequences of Liquidity Provision**
   - Liquidity enables continued borrowing and investment abroad,  fueling inflation and depreciation.
   - Investors seek inflation hedges like real assets or gold.

## Foreign Currency Debt and Rising Debt Burdens

1. **Impact of Currency Depreciation on Foreign Currency Debt**
   - Currency falls increase debt burdens,  necessitating spending cuts and asset sales.
   - Initial stimulation from currency depreciation fades,  exacerbating debt burdens.

1. **Foreign Investor Demands and Debt Service**
   - Higher debt burdens lead foreign investors to demand higher interest rates.
   - Currency declines and inflation increase debt service costs,  complicating economic stimulation.

## Government Responses and Capital Flight

1. **Tax Increases and Wealth Preservation**
   - Governments raise taxes on income and wealth to address rising debt burdens.
   - Wealthy individuals,  facing eroding net worths,  engage in tax evasion and capital flight.

1. **Credit Creation and Economic Growth**
   - Weakening growth and lack of foreign lending hinder credit creation.
   - Domestic borrowing does not spur growth,  as funds are spent on foreign assets.

1. **Local Spending and GDP Contribution**
   - Local spending often does not contribute to GDP.
   - Investments in gold,  factories,  or imports serve as wealth stores rather than productive assets.

## Feedback Mechanisms and Loss of Currency Faith

1. **Escalating Inflation and Currency Declines**
   - Feedback mechanisms intensify inflation and currency declines.
   - People lose faith in the currency as a store of value,  holding minimal reserves.

1. **Conclusion: Understanding Inflationary Spirals**
   - Inflationary spirals result from complex interactions between wage-price dynamics,  currency depreciation,  and investor behavior.
   - Effective management requires addressing these feedback loops to restore economic stability.

# Hyperinflation and Economic Breakdown

## Breakdown of Money as a Unit of Account

1. **Challenges with Currency as a Unit of Account**
   - Hyperinflation leads to excessively long lists of zeros in currency values.
   - This makes the currency impractical for accounting purposes.

1. **Currency Instability and Medium of Exchange**
   - Currency instability discourages producers from accepting domestic currency.
   - Producers often demand payment in foreign currencies or barter.

1. **Shortage of Foreign Exchange and Illiquidity**
   - Foreign exchange shortages exacerbate illiquidity.
   - Demand collapses as currency loses its function as a medium of exchange.

1. **Limitations of Money Printing**
   - Money printing cannot alleviate this form of illiquidity.
   - Economic activity grinds to a halt,  leading to store closures and rising unemployment.

## Economic Contraction and Hyperinflation

1. **Rapid Economic Contraction**
   - Hyperinflation causes the economy to contract rapidly.
   - Currency declines,  once beneficial,  now create chaos.

1. **Impact on Financial Wealth**
   - Hyperinflation erodes financial wealth as assets fail to keep pace with inflation.
   - Financial assets lose value relative to currency depreciation.

1. **Extreme Wealth Redistributions**
   - Lenders' wealth is inflated away,  as are debtors' liabilities.
   - Wealth redistribution leads to economic and social upheaval.

## Political and Social Consequences

1. **Political Tensions and Clashes**
   - Economic contraction and wealth redistribution create political tensions.
   - Public servants,  like police officers,  may strike due to worthless wages.

1. **Disorder and Violence**
   - Disorder,  crime,  looting,  and violence peak during hyperinflation.
   - In Weimar Germany,  the government declared a "state of siege" to restore order.

## Investment Strategies During Hyperinflation

1. **Basic Investment Principles**
   - Short the currency and move money out of the country.
   - Invest in commodities and commodity industries (e.g.,  gold,  coal,  metals).

1. **Equities and Bonds**
   - Investing in equities becomes risky as inflation transitions to hyperinflation.
   - Share prices and exchange rates diverge,  making equities a poor investment.
   - Bonds are wiped out due to currency depreciation.

1. **Preferred Assets**
   - Gold becomes the preferred asset to hold during hyperinflation.
   - Shares,  despite rising in local currency,  are disastrous investments.

## Resolution of Hyperinflation

1. **Currency's Loss of Status**
   - Once hyperinflation occurs,  the currency loses its status as a store of wealth.
   - Recovery requires creating a new currency with strong backing.

1. **Classic Path to Ending Hyperinflation**
   - Countries typically phase out the old currency and introduce a new one.
   - The new currency must have very hard backing to restore confidence.

By understanding these dynamics,  policymakers and investors can better navigate the complexities of hyperinflation and its impact on the economy and society.
