# The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle
## Introduction to Credit and Debt
### Understanding Credit and Debt
- **Definition of Credit and Debt**
  - Credit is the provision of buying power in exchange for a promise to repay,  which constitutes debt.
  - The ability to make purchases through credit is beneficial,  while the lack of credit can hinder development.
- **The Problem with Debt**
  - Issues arise when there is an inability to repay debt.
  - The impact of rapid credit/debt growth depends on the productivity of the credit and the ability to service the debt.
### Perspectives on Debt
- **Financial Responsibility and Debt Aversion**
  - Financially responsible individuals often prefer saving over borrowing due to the perceived downsides of debt.
  - Personal experiences and upbringing can influence one's perspective on debt.
- **Societal Implications of Credit/Debt Growth**
  - Insufficient credit/debt growth can lead to economic problems due to missed opportunities.
  - Policy makers have tools to manage credit/debt growth that individuals do not possess.
## The Role of Credit in Economic Growth
### Productive Use of Borrowed Money
- **Desirability of Credit**
  - Credit is desirable if it is used productively enough to generate income to service the debt.
  - Proper allocation of resources benefits both lenders and borrowers.
- **Secondary and Indirect Economics**
  - Consideration of secondary economic effects is crucial,  such as the impact of education and infrastructure on productivity and crime reduction.
### Lending Standards and Development
- **Impact of Lending Standards**
  - Tight lending standards may reduce debt problems but also limit development.
  - Looser standards can promote development but may lead to future debt issues.
## Evaluating Debt and Debt Cycles
### Cost of Bad Debt vs. Lack of Spending
- **Example of a Subway System**
  - A subway system financed by debt may exceed budget expectations,  but the long-term benefits could justify the additional cost.
  - Bad debt losses can be socialized and spread over time to mitigate immediate economic impact.
### Policy Makers' Role in Managing Debt
- **Spreading Out Losses**
  - The ability of policy makers to spread out losses from bad debts is crucial in managing debt crises.
  - Factors influencing this ability include control over currency and influence on creditor-debtor relationships.
## Debt Crises and Economic Cycles
### Inevitability of Debt Crises
- **Historical Context**
  - Few countries have avoided debt crises due to imperfect lending and psychological factors leading to bubbles and busts.
  - Policy makers often err on the side of loose credit for short-term growth benefits.
### Cyclical Nature of Debt Crises
- **Understanding Economic Cycles**
  - Economic cycles are driven by expansions and contractions in credit,  following logical patterns.
  - Borrowing creates cycles of spending more than income,  followed by periods of spending less to repay debt.
- **Monopoly® as an Economic Model**
  - The game of Monopoly® illustrates how credit cycles work,  with property and cash dynamics reflecting economic principles.
## Managing Debt Crises
### Types of Debt Crises
- **Deflationary vs. Inflationary Crises**
  - Debt crises can be deflationary or inflationary,  influenced by the amount of foreign currency debt.
  - Severe debt crises occur when interest rate reductions are no longer effective.
### Policy Makers' Tools
- **Levers for Managing Debt**
  - Austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  central bank interventions,  and transfers of money/credit are tools available to policy makers.
  - The balance between these levers determines the effectiveness of managing debt crises.
### The Template for Long-Term Debt Cycles
- **Examination of Historical Debt Cycles**
  - Analysis of 48 big debt cycles reveals patterns in how debt and debt service costs rise relative to income.
  - Long-term debt cycles are more extreme than short-term cycles due to higher debt burdens and less effective monetary policies.
## Conclusion
### Key Takeaways
- **Importance of Policy Makers' Knowledge and Authority**
  - Effective management of debt crises requires knowledgeable policy makers with the authority to implement necessary measures.
  - The political and economic consequences of debt management decisions must be carefully considered.
- **Potential for Managing Debt Crises**
  - Most debt crises can be managed effectively if debts are denominated in a country's own currency.
  - The biggest risks arise from policy makers' failures and the political challenges of implementing necessary adjustments.

## Detailed Analysis of Debt Cycles
### The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
- **Early Part of the Cycle**
  - In the early part of the cycle,  debt is not growing faster than incomes,  even though debt growth is strong.
  - Debt growth is used to finance activities that produce fast income growth,  such as business expansion.
- **The Bubble**
  - In the first stage of the bubble,  debts rise faster than incomes,  producing accelerating strong asset returns and growth.
  - Rising incomes,  net-worths,  and asset values raise borrowers’ capacities to borrow,  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.
#### The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
- **Bull Market Dynamics**
  - Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets,  initially driven by lower interest rates.
  - As assets go up in value,  net worths and spending/income levels rise,  increasing confidence in ongoing prosperity.
- **Emergence of a Bubble**
  - The boom encourages new buyers to enter the market,  fueling the emergence of a bubble.
  - Uneconomic lending and the bubble occur due to implicit or explicit government guarantees encouraging reckless lending.
- **Shadow Banking and Financial Engineering**
  - New types of lending institutions develop,  often less regulated,  contributing to the bubble.
  - Financial engineering and new lending vehicles are frequently invented,  reinforcing the bubble by increasing speculators’ equity.
- **Market Dynamics and Consensus**
  - Rising stock prices lead to more spending and investment,  raising earnings and stock prices further.
  - Large asset-liability mismatches increase,  with entities borrowing short-term to lend long-term or investing in riskier assets.
- **Debt Service Costs and Economic Vulnerability**
  - Debts rise fast,  and debt service costs rise even faster,  making the economy vulnerable as the bubble nears its top.
  - Total debt-to-income levels average around 300 percent of GDP,  indicating the archetypal bubble's characteristics.
### Managing the Aftermath of a Bubble
- **Deleveraging and Economic Contraction**
  - When promises to deliver money can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in,  deleveraging begins.
  - Borrowing is a way of pulling spending forward,  necessitating spending cuts when the bubble bursts.
- **Government Intervention and [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]**
  - The free-market credit system ceases to work well,  requiring government intervention as the central bank becomes a lender of last resort.
  - [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] is necessary to reduce claims on future spending relative to available money.
- **Historical Context and Lessons**
  - The dynamic of long-term debt cycles has existed for as long as there has been credit,  with historical examples like the Year of Jubilee.
  - Understanding the roles of money as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth is crucial in managing debt cycles.
### Conclusion
- **Balancing Economic Forces**
  - The balance between proletariat-workers and capitalists-investors,  along with government rules,  shapes the economic landscape.
  - Effective management of debt cycles requires understanding the interplay between these groups and the economic forces at play.

  - The balance between proletariat-workers and capitalists-investors,  along with government rules,  shapes the economic landscape.
  - Effective management of debt cycles requires understanding the interplay between these groups and the economic forces at play.
#### The Role of Monetary Policy
- **Monetary Policy and Bubble Inflation**
  - In many cases,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it,  especially when inflation and growth are both good.
  - Central banks,  focusing on inflation and growth,  are often reluctant to adequately tighten money during productivity booms.
- **Historical Examples**
  - This occurred in Japan in the late 1980s,  and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s.
  - Central banks typically do not target the management of bubbles,  which can lead to unsustainable debt growth.
- **Central Bank Responsibilities**
  - It is crucial for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level.
  - Central bankers sometimes claim it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it is not their role to assess and control them.
- **Consequences of Ignoring Bubbles**
  - The economic pain of allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is significant,  and policy makers should not ignore them.
  - Central banks typically fall behind the curve during such periods,  and borrowers are not yet squeezed by higher debt-service costs.
- **Reversal of Bubble Dynamics**
  - When the bubble pops,  falling asset prices decrease both the equity and collateral values of leveraged speculators.
  - Lenders pull back,  forcing speculators to sell,  driving down prices even more,  and causing liquidity problems.
#### Spotting Bubbles
- **Characteristics of Bubbles**
  - Prices are high relative to traditional measures,  and there is broad bullish sentiment.
  - Purchases are being financed by high leverage,  and new buyers have entered the market.
- **Monetary Policy Influence**
  - Stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] threatens to inflate the bubble even more,  while tight policy can cause its popping.
- **Debt Crisis Indicators**
  - To anticipate a debt crisis,  one must look at the specific debt-service abilities of individual entities,  not just economy-wide averages.
### The Top of the Market
- **Market Reversal Dynamics**
  - When prices have been driven by leveraged buying,  the market becomes ripe for a reversal.
  - Tops are often triggered when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise.
- **Economic Indicators**
  - The fastest rate of tightening typically comes about five months prior to the top of the stock market.
  - The economy operates at a high rate,  with demand pressing up against the capacity to produce.
- **Impact of Tightening**
  - The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive,  weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending.
  - The more leverage that exists,  the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows.
### The "Depression" Phase
- **Characteristics of Depressions**
  - In depressions,  risk-free interest rates can’t be cut materially because they have reached close to 0 percent.
  - Credit spreads are wide,  creating a formula for a depression.
- **Government Response**
  - In well-managed cases,  central banks lower rates quickly and move on to alternative means of stimulating the economy.
  - Debt defaults and restructurings hit various players,  especially leveraged lenders,  like an avalanche.
- **Self-Reinforcing Debt Spirals**
  - A self-reinforcing spiral of developments can happen,  squeezing the debtor and leading to a deadly result.
  - Interest rate cuts don’t help lending institutions with liquidity problems and suffering from runs.
- **Managing Depressions**
  - Policies that reduce debt burdens include austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  debt monetization/money printing,  and wealth transfers.
  - The key is to balance deflationary and depressive forces with inflationary and stimulative ones.

  - The more leverage that exists,  the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows.
### The "Depression" Phase
- **Characteristics of Depressions**
  - In depressions,  risk-free interest rates can’t be cut materially because they have reached close to 0 percent.
  - Credit spreads are wide,  creating a formula for a depression.
- **Government Response**
  - In well-managed cases,  central banks lower rates quickly and move on to alternative means of stimulating the economy.
  - Debt defaults and restructurings hit various players,  especially leveraged lenders,  like an avalanche.
- **Self-Reinforcing Debt Spirals**
  - A self-reinforcing spiral of developments can happen,  squeezing the debtor and leading to a deadly result.
  - Interest rate cuts don’t help lending institutions with liquidity problems and suffering from runs.
- **Managing Depressions**
  - Policies that reduce debt burdens include austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  debt monetization/money printing,  and wealth transfers.
  - The key is to balance deflationary and depressive forces with inflationary and stimulative ones.
#### Austerity
- **Austerity Measures**
  - In the depression phase,  policy makers typically try austerity because that’s the obvious thing to do.
  - It’s natural to want to let those who got themselves and others in trouble to bear the costs.
  - The problem is that even deep austerity doesn’t bring debt and income back into balance.
  - When spending is cut,  incomes are also cut,  so it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in the debt/income ratios.
  - As the economy contracts,  government revenues typically fall.
  - At the same time,  demands on the government increase.
  - As a result,  deficits typically increase.
  - Seeking to be fiscally responsible,  at this point governments tend to raise taxes.
  - Both moves are big mistakes.
#### “Printing Money” to Stop the Bleeding and Stimulate the Economy
- **Government and Central Bank Actions**
  - Quite often “runs” on lending institutions occur,  especially those that aren’t protected by government guarantees.
  - That puts the central bank and the central government in the position of having to decide which depositors/lenders should be protected from losses and which should be allowed to sustain them,  and which institutions are systemically important and should be saved—and how to do these things in a way that maximizes the safety of the financial/economic system while minimizing costs to the government/taxpayers.
  - At such times all sorts of guarantees are offered to systemically critical financial institutions—and quite often some of these institutions are nationalized.
  - Typically there are a lot of laws and politics that affect how quickly and how well this is done.
  - Some of the money that is needed comes from the government \(i.e.,  it is appropriated through the budget process\) and some from the central banks \(by “printing”\).
  - Governments inevitably do both,  though in varying degrees.
  - In addition to providing money to some essential banks,  governments also typically provide money to some nonbank entities they consider essential.
  - Next,  they must ease the credit crunch and stimulate the overall economy.
  - Since the government is likely having trouble raising funds through taxation and borrowing,  central banks are forced to choose between “printing” still more money to buy their governments’ debts or allowing their governments and their private sector to compete for the limited supply of money,  which will only tighten money further.
  - Inevitably,  they choose to print.
  - Typically,  though not necessarily,  these moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts fail to rectify the imbalance and reverse the deleveraging process.
  - However,  those early efforts do typically cause temporary periods of relief that are manifest in bear-market rallies in financial assets and increased economic activity.
  - During the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market \(of between 16 percent and 48 percent\) in a bear market that declined a total of 89 percent.
  - All of those rallies were triggered by government actions that were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance.
  - When they are managed well,  those shifts in policies to “print money, ” buy assets,  and provide guarantees are what moves the debt cycle from its depression/“ugly deleveraging” phase to its expansion/“beautiful deleveraging” phase.
  - The chart below shows how this “money printing” happened in the US in the 1930s and again after 2008.
  - While highly stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is a critical part of a deleveraging,  it is typically not sufficient.
  - When risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail,  policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running.
  - They must act immediately to:
    - **Curtail panic and guarantee liabilities.** Governments can increase guarantees on deposits and debt issuance. Central banks can provide systemically important institutions \(i.e.,  institutions whose failures would threaten the ongoing operating of the financial system and/or that of the economy\) with injections of money. Occasionally,  governments can force liquidity to remain in the banking system by imposing deposit freezes,  which is generally undesirable because it intensifies the panic,  but is sometimes necessary because there is no other way of providing that money/liquidity. Policy makers providing guarantees in order to provide support is often easier and preferable to providing cash. Because coming up with guarantees doesn’t require coming up with actual money and all that’s required to do that \(e.g.,  obtaining approvals,  doing transactions,  changing income statements and balance sheets\) it’s typically easier and quicker. Guarantees also have the nice aspect of only kicking in when the worst case scenario happens. They are so powerful that they work even when just implied by governments that have controls of their own printing presses. That can lead to bad lending because lenders get too reliant on the guarantor and no longer care about the creditworthiness of the borrower. For that reason,  governments need to be careful to use guarantees sparingly.
    - **Provide liquidity.** When private credit is contracting and liquidity is tight,  the central bank can ensure that sufficient liquidity is provided to the financial system by lending against a widening range of collateral or to an increasingly wide range of financial institutions that are not normally considered part of their lending practices.
    - **Support the solvency of systemically important institutions.** The first step is usually to incentivize the private sector to address the problem,  often by supporting mergers between failed banks and healthy banks and by regulatory pushes to issue more capital to the private sector. In addition,  accounting adjustments can be made to reduce the immediate need for capital to maintain solvency,  buying more time for the institutions to earn their way out of their problems.
    - **Recapitalize/nationalize/cover losses of systemically important financial institutions.** When the above approaches are insufficient to deal with the solvency problems of systemically important financial institutions,  governments must step in to recapitalize failed banks. Moving to stabilize lenders and maintain the credit supply is critical to preventing a crisis from getting worse. Certain institutions are part of the plumbing of the system; one would hate to lose them even if they’re not making money at the moment. It would be like losing a shipping port in a depression because the port goes broke. You want the port to continue to operate and ships to come in,  so you have to protect it one way or another—whether through a nationalization,  loans,  or capital injections.
#### Debt Defaults/Restructurings
- **Cleansing Bad Debts**
  - Ultimately,  the process of cleansing existing bad debts is critical for the future flow of money and credit and for a return to prosperity.
  - The challenge for policy makers is to allow that process to work itself out in an orderly way that ensures economic and social stability.
  - The best-managed cases are those in which policy makers:
    - Swiftly recognize the magnitude of the credit problems.
    - Don’t save every institution that is expendable,  balancing the benefits of allowing broke institutions to fail and be restructured with the risks that such failures can have detrimental effects on other creditworthy lenders and borrowers.
    - Create or restore robust credit pipes that allow for future borrowing by creditworthy borrowers.
    - Ensure acceptable growth and inflation conditions while the bad debts are being worked out.
  - Longer term,  the most important decision that policy makers have to make is whether they will change the system to fix the root causes of the debt problems or simply restructure the debts so that the pain is distributed over the population and over time so that the debt does not impose an intolerable burden.
  - These things rarely happen right away.
  - Policy makers typically fail to recognize the magnitude of the problem initially,  instead enacting a number of one-off policies that are insufficient to move the needle.
  - It is only after what is usually a couple of years and a lot of unnecessary economic pain that they finally act decisively.
  - How quickly and aggressively policy makers respond is among the most important factors in determining the severity and length of the depression.
  - The question of exactly how these costs are divided between the government \(which means the society as a whole\) and the bond holders \(of varying seniorities\),  equity holders,  depositors,  etc.,  is an important one.
  - Typically,  nonsystemically important institutions are forced to absorb their losses,  and if they fail,  are allowed to go bankrupt.
  - The resolution of these institutions can take several different forms.
  - In many cases \(about 80 percent of the cases we studied\),  they are merged with healthy institutions.
  - In some other cases,  the assets are liquidated or transferred to an “asset-management company” \(AMC\) set up by the government to be sold piecemeal.
  - In some cases,  policy makers recognize that ensuring the viability of the whole banking system is critical and liquidity and solvency measures are taken at the banking system level.
  - In recent years it has become common for guarantees of bank liabilities to be issued in countries in the developed world.
  - In rare cases,  government-financed bank recapitalization is done across all banks,  rather than focused solely on systemically important institutions.
  - There are relatively clear lines for which creditors receive protections:
    - **Small depositors are given preference and experience minimal or no losses \(in nearly every case\).** Often this is explicitly defined as part of a deposit insurance scheme. Coverage is usually expanded during the crisis period in order to ensure liquidity for the banks. Even in cases where there isn’t an explicit deposit insurance scheme,  depositors are often prioritized. In around 30 percent of cases studied,  depositors did take losses,  though they were often on foreign-exchange deposits through conversion at below-market exchange rates.
    - **In most cases when institutions fail,  equity,  subordinated debt,  and large depositors absorb losses regardless of whether the institution was systemically important or not.** Protection of senior and subordinated debt holders,  and equity recapitalizations that are simply dilutive to existing equity holders,  are seen mostly in the developed world.
    - **Sometimes policy makers prioritize domestic creditors over foreign creditors,  especially when their loans are to private-sector players and are lower down in the capital structure.** This is especially true as deposit insurance programs run low on funds. But at the same time governments often end up prioritizing the payment of loans from multinational institutions like the IMF and BIS,  as it’s important to maintain availability of support from these public entities,  who effectively act as lenders of last resort to countries under stress.
  - Typically,  the process of dealing with the failed lenders is accompanied by a spate of regulatory reforms.
  - Sometimes these changes are modest and sometimes they are very large; sometimes they are for the better and sometimes they are for the worse.
  - They range from changes in how banks operate \(e.g.,  putting in deposit guarantees in the 1930s or [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] and the Volcker rule in 2010 in the US\) to labor market reforms,  from requiring banks to improve credit standards to opening the banking system to competition \(including foreign entrants\) to raising capital requirements and removing protections to lenders.
  - Politics plays a big role in determining what reforms are made.
  - In some cases,  such reforms end up distorting private-sector market-based incentives on the flow of lending,  which can limit the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers and/or increase the risks of future credit problems emerging.
  - In other cases,  they improve the flow of credit,  protect households,  and reduce the risk of debt problems in the future.
  - There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed:
    - They are either transferred to a separate entity \(an AMC\) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal \(about 40 percent of the cases studied\) or they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage \(about 60 percent of cases\).
  - There are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans:
    - Restructuring \(e.g.,  working out the loans through extended terms\).
    - Debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures.
    - Direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties.
    - Securitizations.
  - The use of an AMC generally accelerates the management of the debt problem because it frees up existing banks to return to lending and helps consolidate the bad debts to a centralized entity that can manage sales and restructurings.
  - Selling assets to AMCs also often serves as a mechanism to engage in transfers to banks by pricing them at above market prices.
  - AMCs are typically publicly owned entities that are mandated to sell the assets within some targeted time frame \(e.g.,  10 years\) while minimizing costs to the taxpayer and disruptions of asset markets.
  - They do this by seeking to quickly sell off the performing assets of failed institutions and working over time to manage and sell off nonperforming assets.
  - In some cases AMCs have explicit goals to restructure the nonperforming debts to reduce debt burdens.
  - They are generally financed by some form of direct or pseudo-government debt issuance,  and they cannot work well when legal,  political,  or funding constraints limit their ability to recognize bad debts and restructure them.
  - Allowing the original lender to manage its bad debts often occurs when the original lender is state-sponsored,  which makes it closer to a public AMC.
  - In other cases losses may be allowed to sit on the lender’s balance sheet if they are not too large,  if the technical expertise to create a centralized AMC doesn’t exist,  or if effective resolution mechanisms already exist.
  - Much as with lenders,  there is usually a relatively clear distinction between how systemically or strategically important borrowers are handled and how those that aren’t are.
    - For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones,  policy makers generally take steps to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps,  through reducing the existing debts,  lowering interest rates,  or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity. This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts.
    - Nonsystemically important borrowers are usually left to restructure their loans with private lenders or are allowed to go bankrupt and are liquidated.
    - Central governments often take steps to help reduce the debt burdens on the household sector. AMCs may also take steps to restructure debt burdens rather than foreclosing on the loans as part of their goal of maximizing recovery values.
# The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle
## Introduction to Credit and Debt
### Understanding Credit and Debt
- **Definition of Credit and Debt**
  - Credit is the provision of buying power in exchange for a promise to repay,  which constitutes debt.
  - The ability to make purchases through credit is beneficial,  while the lack of credit can hinder development.
- **The Problem with Debt**
  - Issues arise when there is an inability to repay debt.
  - The impact of rapid credit/debt growth depends on the productivity of the credit and the ability to service the debt.
### Perspectives on Debt
- **Financial Responsibility and Debt Aversion**
  - Financially responsible individuals often prefer saving over borrowing due to the perceived downsides of debt.
  - Personal experiences and upbringing can influence one's perspective on debt.
- **Societal Implications of Credit/Debt Growth**
  - Insufficient credit/debt growth can lead to economic problems due to missed opportunities.
  - Policy makers have tools to manage credit/debt growth that individuals do not possess.
## The Role of Credit in Economic Growth
### Productive Use of Borrowed Money
- **Desirability of Credit**
  - Credit is desirable if it is used productively enough to generate income to service the debt.
  - Proper allocation of resources benefits both lenders and borrowers.
- **Secondary and Indirect Economics**
  - Consideration of secondary economic effects is crucial,  such as the impact of education and infrastructure on productivity and crime reduction.
### Lending Standards and Development
- **Impact of Lending Standards**
  - Tight lending standards may reduce debt problems but also limit development.
  - Looser standards can promote development but may lead to future debt issues.
## Evaluating Debt and Debt Cycles
### Cost of Bad Debt vs. Lack of Spending
- **Example of a Subway System**
  - A subway system financed by debt may exceed budget expectations,  but the long-term benefits could justify the additional cost.
  - Bad debt losses can be socialized and spread over time to mitigate immediate economic impact.
### Policy Makers' Role in Managing Debt
- **Spreading Out Losses**
  - The ability of policy makers to spread out losses from bad debts is crucial in managing debt crises.
  - Factors influencing this ability include control over currency and influence on creditor-debtor relationships.
## Debt Crises and Economic Cycles
### Inevitability of Debt Crises
- **Historical Context**
  - Few countries have avoided debt crises due to imperfect lending and psychological factors leading to bubbles and busts.
  - Policy makers often err on the side of loose credit for short-term growth benefits.
### Cyclical Nature of Debt Crises
- **Understanding Economic Cycles**
  - Economic cycles are driven by expansions and contractions in credit,  following logical patterns.
  - Borrowing creates cycles of spending more than income,  followed by periods of spending less to repay debt.
- **Monopoly® as an Economic Model**
  - The game of Monopoly® illustrates how credit cycles work,  with property and cash dynamics reflecting economic principles.
## Managing Debt Crises
### Types of Debt Crises
- **Deflationary vs. Inflationary Crises**
  - Debt crises can be deflationary or inflationary,  influenced by the amount of foreign currency debt.
  - Severe debt crises occur when interest rate reductions are no longer effective.
### Policy Makers' Tools
- **Levers for Managing Debt**
  - Austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  central bank interventions,  and transfers of money/credit are tools available to policy makers.
  - The balance between these levers determines the effectiveness of managing debt crises.
### The Template for Long-Term Debt Cycles
- **Examination of Historical Debt Cycles**
  - Analysis of 48 big debt cycles reveals patterns in how debt and debt service costs rise relative to income.
  - Long-term debt cycles are more extreme than short-term cycles due to higher debt burdens and less effective monetary policies.
## Conclusion
### Key Takeaways
- **Importance of Policy Makers' Knowledge and Authority**
  - Effective management of debt crises requires knowledgeable policy makers with the authority to implement necessary measures.
  - The political and economic consequences of debt management decisions must be carefully considered.
- **Potential for Managing Debt Crises**
  - Most debt crises can be managed effectively if debts are denominated in a country's own currency.
  - The biggest risks arise from policy makers' failures and the political challenges of implementing necessary adjustments.
## Detailed Analysis of Debt Cycles
### The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
- **Early Part of the Cycle**
  - In the early part of the cycle,  debt is not growing faster than incomes,  even though debt growth is strong.
  - Debt growth is used to finance activities that produce fast income growth,  such as business expansion.
- **The Bubble**
  - In the first stage of the bubble,  debts rise faster than incomes,  producing accelerating strong asset returns and growth.
  - Rising incomes,  net-worths,  and asset values raise borrowers’ capacities to borrow,  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.
#### The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
- **Bull Market Dynamics**
  - Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets,  initially driven by lower interest rates.
  - As assets go up in value,  net worths and spending/income levels rise,  increasing confidence in ongoing prosperity.
- **Emergence of a Bubble**
  - The boom encourages new buyers to enter the market,  fueling the emergence of a bubble.
  - Uneconomic lending and the bubble occur due to implicit or explicit government guarantees encouraging reckless lending.
- **Shadow Banking and Financial Engineering**
  - New types of lending institutions develop,  often less regulated,  contributing to the bubble.
  - Financial engineering and new lending vehicles are frequently invented,  reinforcing the bubble by increasing speculators’ equity.
- **Market Dynamics and Consensus**
  - Rising stock prices lead to more spending and investment,  raising earnings and stock prices further.
  - Large asset-liability mismatches increase,  with entities borrowing short-term to lend long-term or investing in riskier assets.
- **Debt Service Costs and Economic Vulnerability**
  - Debts rise fast,  and debt service costs rise even faster,  making the economy vulnerable as the bubble nears its top.
  - Total debt-to-income levels average around 300 percent of GDP,  indicating the archetypal bubble's characteristics.
### Managing the Aftermath of a Bubble
- **Deleveraging and Economic Contraction**
  - When promises to deliver money can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in,  deleveraging begins.
  - Borrowing is a way of pulling spending forward,  necessitating spending cuts when the bubble bursts.
- **Government Intervention and [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]**
  - The free-market credit system ceases to work well,  requiring government intervention as the central bank becomes a lender of last resort.
  - [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] is necessary to reduce claims on future spending relative to available money.
- **Historical Context and Lessons**
  - The dynamic of long-term debt cycles has existed for as long as there has been credit,  with historical examples like the Year of Jubilee.
  - Understanding the roles of money as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth is crucial in managing debt cycles.
### Conclusion
- **Balancing Economic Forces**
  - The balance between proletariat-workers and capitalists-investors,  along with government rules,  shapes the economic landscape.
  - Effective management of debt cycles requires understanding the interplay between these groups and the economic forces at play.
#### The Role of Monetary Policy
- **Monetary Policy and Bubble Inflation**
  - In many cases,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it,  especially when inflation and growth are both good.
  - Central banks,  focusing on inflation and growth,  are often reluctant to adequately tighten money during productivity booms.
- **Historical Examples**
  - This occurred in Japan in the late 1980s,  and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s.
  - Central banks typically do not target the management of bubbles,  which can lead to unsustainable debt growth.
- **Central Bank Responsibilities**
  - It is crucial for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level.
  - Central bankers sometimes claim it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it is not their role to assess and control them.
- **Consequences of Ignoring Bubbles**
  - The economic pain of allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is significant,  and policy makers should not ignore them.
  - Central banks typically fall behind the curve during such periods,  and borrowers are not yet squeezed by higher debt-service costs.
- **Reversal of Bubble Dynamics**
  - When the bubble pops,  falling asset prices decrease both the equity and collateral values of leveraged speculators.
  - Lenders pull back,  forcing speculators to sell,  driving down prices even more,  and causing liquidity problems.
#### Spotting Bubbles
- **Characteristics of Bubbles**
  - Prices are high relative to traditional measures,  and there is broad bullish sentiment.
  - Purchases are being financed by high leverage,  and new buyers have entered the market.
- **Monetary Policy Influence**
  - Stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] threatens to inflate the bubble even more,  while tight policy can cause its popping.
- **Debt Crisis Indicators**
  - To anticipate a debt crisis,  one must look at the specific debt-service abilities of individual entities,  not just economy-wide averages.
### The Top of the Market
- **Market Reversal Dynamics**
  - When prices have been driven by leveraged buying,  the market becomes ripe for a reversal.
  - Tops are often triggered when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise.
- **Economic Indicators**
  - The fastest rate of tightening typically comes about five months prior to the top of the stock market.
  - The economy operates at a high rate,  with demand pressing up against the capacity to produce.
- **Impact of Tightening**
  - The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive,  weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending.
  - The more leverage that exists,  the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows.
### The "Depression" Phase
- **Characteristics of Depressions**
  - In depressions,  risk-free interest rates can’t be cut materially because they have reached close to 0 percent.
  - Credit spreads are wide,  creating a formula for a depression.
- **Government Response**
  - In well-managed cases,  central banks lower rates quickly and move on to alternative means of stimulating the economy.
  - Debt defaults and restructurings hit various players,  especially leveraged lenders,  like an avalanche.
- **Self-Reinforcing Debt Spirals**
  - A self-reinforcing spiral of developments can happen,  squeezing the debtor and leading to a deadly result.
  - Interest rate cuts don’t help lending institutions with liquidity problems and suffering from runs.
- **Managing Depressions**
  - Policies that reduce debt burdens include austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  debt monetization/money printing,  and wealth transfers.
  - The key is to balance deflationary and depressive forces with inflationary and stimulative ones.
#### Austerity
- **Austerity Measures**
  - In the depression phase,  policy makers typically try austerity because that’s the obvious thing to do.
  - It’s natural to want to let those who got themselves and others in trouble to bear the costs.
  - The problem is that even deep austerity doesn’t bring debt and income back into balance.
  - When spending is cut,  incomes are also cut,  so it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in the debt/income ratios.
  - As the economy contracts,  government revenues typically fall.
  - At the same time,  demands on the government increase.
  - As a result,  deficits typically increase.
  - Seeking to be fiscally responsible,  at this point governments tend to raise taxes.
  - Both moves are big mistakes.
#### “Printing Money” to Stop the Bleeding and Stimulate the Economy
- **Government and Central Bank Actions**
  - Quite often “runs” on lending institutions occur,  especially those that aren’t protected by government guarantees.
  - That puts the central bank and the central government in the position of having to decide which depositors/lenders should be protected from losses and which should be allowed to sustain them,  and which institutions are systemically important and should be saved—and how to do these things in a way that maximizes the safety of the financial/economic system while minimizing costs to the government/taxpayers.
  - At such times all sorts of guarantees are offered to systemically critical financial institutions—and quite often some of these institutions are nationalized.
  - Typically there are a lot of laws and politics that affect how quickly and how well this is done.
  - Some of the money that is needed comes from the government \(i.e.,  it is appropriated through the budget process\) and some from the central banks \(by “printing”\).

  - Policy makers typically fail to recognize the magnitude of the problem initially,  instead enacting a number of one-off policies that are insufficient to move the needle.
  - It is only after what is usually a couple of years and a lot of unnecessary economic pain that they finally act decisively.
  - How quickly and aggressively policy makers respond is among the most important factors in determining the severity and length of the depression.
  - The question of exactly how these costs are divided between the government \(which means the society as a whole\) and the bond holders \(of varying seniorities\),  equity holders,  depositors,  etc.,  is an important one.
  - Typically,  nonsystemically important institutions are forced to absorb their losses,  and if they fail,  are allowed to go bankrupt.
  - The resolution of these institutions can take several different forms.
  - In many cases \(about 80 percent of the cases we studied\),  they are merged with healthy institutions.
  - In some other cases,  the assets are liquidated or transferred to an “asset-management company” \(AMC\) set up by the government to be sold piecemeal.
  - In some cases,  policy makers recognize that ensuring the viability of the whole banking system is critical and liquidity and solvency measures are taken at the banking system level.
  - In recent years it has become common for guarantees of bank liabilities to be issued in countries in the developed world.
  - In rare cases,  government-financed bank recapitalization is done across all banks,  rather than focused solely on systemically important institutions.
  - There are relatively clear lines for which creditors receive protections:
    - **Small depositors are given preference and experience minimal or no losses \(in nearly every case\).** Often this is explicitly defined as part of a deposit insurance scheme. Coverage is usually expanded during the crisis period in order to ensure liquidity for the banks. Even in cases where there isn’t an explicit deposit insurance scheme,  depositors are often prioritized. In around 30 percent of cases studied,  depositors did take losses,  though they were often on foreign-exchange deposits through conversion at below-market exchange rates.
    - **In most cases when institutions fail,  equity,  subordinated debt,  and large depositors absorb losses regardless of whether the institution was systemically important or not.** Protection of senior and subordinated debt holders,  and equity recapitalizations that are simply dilutive to existing equity holders,  are seen mostly in the developed world.
    - **Sometimes policy makers prioritize domestic creditors over foreign creditors,  especially when their loans are to private-sector players and are lower down in the capital structure.** This is especially true as deposit insurance programs run low on funds. But at the same time governments often end up prioritizing the payment of loans from multinational institutions like the IMF and BIS,  as it’s important to maintain availability of support from these public entities,  who effectively act as lenders of last resort to countries under stress.
  - Typically,  the process of dealing with the failed lenders is accompanied by a spate of regulatory reforms.
  - Sometimes these changes are modest and sometimes they are very large; sometimes they are for the better and sometimes they are for the worse.
  - They range from changes in how banks operate \(e.g.,  putting in deposit guarantees in the 1930s or [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] and the Volcker rule in 2010 in the US\) to labor market reforms,  from requiring banks to improve credit standards to opening the banking system to competition \(including foreign entrants\) to raising capital requirements and removing protections to lenders.
  - Politics plays a big role in determining what reforms are made.
  - In some cases,  such reforms end up distorting private-sector market-based incentives on the flow of lending,  which can limit the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers and/or increase the risks of future credit problems emerging.
  - In other cases,  they improve the flow of credit,  protect households,  and reduce the risk of debt problems in the future.
  - There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed:
    - They are either transferred to a separate entity \(an AMC\) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal \(about 40 percent of the cases studied\) or they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage \(about 60 percent of cases\).
  - There are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans:
    - Restructuring \(e.g.,  working out the loans through extended terms\).
    - Debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures.
    - Direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties.
    - Securitizations.
  - The use of an AMC generally accelerates the management of the debt problem because it frees up existing banks to return to lending and helps consolidate the bad debts to a centralized entity that can manage sales and restructurings.
  - Selling assets to AMCs also often serves as a mechanism to engage in transfers to banks by pricing them at above market prices.
  - AMCs are typically publicly owned entities that are mandated to sell the assets within some targeted time frame \(e.g.,  10 years\) while minimizing costs to the taxpayer and disruptions of asset markets.
  - They do this by seeking to quickly sell off the performing assets of failed institutions and working over time to manage and sell off nonperforming assets.
  - In some cases AMCs have explicit goals to restructure the nonperforming debts to reduce debt burdens.
  - They are generally financed by some form of direct or pseudo-government debt issuance,  and they cannot work well when legal,  political,  or funding constraints limit their ability to recognize bad debts and restructure them.
  - Allowing the original lender to manage its bad debts often occurs when the original lender is state-sponsored,  which makes it closer to a public AMC.
  - In other cases losses may be allowed to sit on the lender’s balance sheet if they are not too large,  if the technical expertise to create a centralized AMC doesn’t exist,  or if effective resolution mechanisms already exist.
  - Much as with lenders,  there is usually a relatively clear distinction between how systemically or strategically important borrowers are handled and how those that aren’t are.
    - For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones,  policy makers generally take steps to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps,  through reducing the existing debts,  lowering interest rates,  or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity. This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts.
    - Nonsystemically important borrowers are usually left to restructure their loans with private lenders or are allowed to go bankrupt and are liquidated.
    - Central governments often take steps to help reduce the debt burdens on the household sector. AMCs may also take steps to restructure debt burdens rather than foreclosing on the loans as part of their goal of maximizing recovery values.
#### Redistributing Wealth
- **Wealth Gaps and Economic Conflict**
  - Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and become particularly galling for the less privileged during hard times.
  - As a general rule,  if rich people share a budget with poor people and there is an economic downturn,  there will be economic and political conflict.
  - It is during such times that populism on both the left and the right tends to emerge.
  - How well the people and the political system handle this is key to how well the economy and the society weather the period.
  - Both inequality and populism are on the rise in the US today,  much as they were in the 1930s.
  - In both cases,  the net worth of the top 0.1 percent of the population equaled approximately that of the bottom 90 percent combined.
  - In some cases,  raising taxes on the rich becomes politically attractive because the rich made a lot of money in the boom—especially those working in the financial sector—and are perceived to have caused the problems because of their greed.
  - The central bank’s purchases of financial assets also disproportionately benefit the rich,  because the rich own many more such assets.
  - Big political shifts to the left typically hasten redistributive efforts.
  - This typically drives the rich to try to move their money in ways and to places that provide protection,  which itself has effects on asset and currency markets.
  - It can also cause an economic “hollowing out” of those areas because the big income earners,  who are also the big income taxpayers,  leave,  reducing overall tax revenues and leading these areas to suffer sharp declines in property values and reductions in services.
  - Typically,  increased taxation takes the form of greater income,  property,  and consumption taxes because these forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues.
  - Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also increased,  though these typically raise very little money because so much wealth is illiquid that it is practically difficult to collect on,  and forcing the taxpayer to sell liquid assets to make their tax payments undermines capital formation.
  - Regardless,  transfers rarely occur in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging \(unless there are “revolutions” and huge amounts of property are nationalized\).
### The “Beautiful Deleveraging”
- **Achieving a Balanced Deleveraging**
  - A “beautiful deleveraging” happens when the four levers are moved in a balanced way so as to reduce intolerable shocks and produce positive growth with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation.
  - More specifically,  deleveragings become beautiful when there is enough stimulation \(i.e.,  through “printing of money”/debt monetization and currency devaluation\) to offset the deflationary deleveraging forces \(austerity/defaults\) and bring the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate—but not so much stimulation that inflation is accelerated,  the currency is devaluated,  and a new debt bubble arises.
  - The best way of negating the deflationary depression is for the central bank to provide adequate liquidity and credit support,  and,  depending on different key entities’ needs for capital,  for the central government to provide that too.
  - Recall that spending comes in the form of either money or credit.
  - When increased spending cannot be financed with increased debt because there is too much debt relative to the amount of money there is to service the debt,  increased spending and debt-service relief must come from increased money.
  - This means that the central bank has to increase the amount of money in the system.
  - The central bank can do this by lending against a wider range of collateral \(both of lower quality and longer maturity\) and also by buying \(monetizing\) lower-quality and/or longer-term debt.
  - This produces relief and,  if it’s done in the right amounts,  allows a deleveraging to occur with positive growth.
  - The right amounts are those that a\) neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit market collapse and b\) get the nominal growth rate marginally above the nominal interest rate to tolerably spread out the deleveraging process.
  - So,  what do I mean by that? Basically,  income needs to grow faster than debt.
  - For example: Let’s assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-income ratio of 100 percent. That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year.
  - Now think about the interest rate on that debt. Let’s say it’s 2 percent. If debt is 100 and the interest rate is 2 percent,  then if no debt is repaid it will be 102 after one year.
  - If income is 100 and it grows at 1 percent,  then income will be 101,  so the debt burden will increase from 100/100 to 102/101.
  - So for the burdens from existing debt not to increase,  nominal income growth must be higher than nominal interest rates,  and the higher the better \(provided it is not so high that it produces unacceptable inflation and/or unacceptable currency declines\).
  - People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won’t if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this reflationary force.
  - That’s not a theory—it’s been repeatedly proven out in history.
  - Remember,  spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices as a dollar of spending paid for with credit.
  - By “printing money, ” the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money.
  - This “printing” takes the form of central bank purchases of government securities and nongovernment assets such as corporate securities,  equities,  and other assets,  which is reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity are contracting.
  - Traditional economists see that as the velocity of money declining,  but it’s nothing of the sort.
  - What is happening at such times is that credit destruction is being offset by money creation.
  - If the balance between replacing credit and actively stimulating the economy is right,  this isn’t inflationary.
  - But there is such a thing as abusive use of stimulants.
  - Because stimulants work so well relative to the alternatives,  there is a real risk that they can be abused,  causing an “ugly inflationary deleveraging” \(like the Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920s,  or those in Argentina and Brazil in the 1980s\).
  - The key is to avoid printing too much money.
  - If policy makers achieve the right balance,  a deleveraging isn’t so dramatic.
  - Getting this balance right is much more difficult in countries that have a large percentage of debt denominated in foreign currency and owned by foreign investors \(as in Weimar Germany and the South American countries\) because that debt can’t be monetized or restructured as easily.
  - Printing money/debt monetization and government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won’t work,  though these tools are of little value in countries that are constrained from printing or don’t have assets to back printing up and can’t easily negotiate the redistributions of the debt burdens.
  - All of the deleveragings that we have studied \(which is most of those that occurred over the past hundred years\) eventually led to big waves of money creation,  fiscal deficits,  and currency devaluations \(against gold,  commodities,  and stocks\).
  - In different cases,  policy makers have varied which exact combination of the levers they used,  typically as a function of the nature of their monetary systems.
  - The chart below conveys the archetypal path of money printing in deflationary deleveragings over the 21 cases.
  - The money printing occurs in two classic waves—central banks first provide liquidity to stressed institutions,  and then they conduct large-scale asset purchases to broadly stimulate the economy.
  - Below we show the average real exchange rate versus trade partners,  which reflects the strength/weakness of a currency relative to the country’s trade partners.
  - Typically,  governments with gold-,  commodity-,  or foreign-currency-pegged money systems are forced to have tighter monetary policies to protect the value of their currency than governments with fiat monetary systems.
  - But eventually the debt contractions become so painful that they relent,  break the link,  and print \(i.e.,  either they abandon these systems or change the amount/pricing of the commodity that they will exchange for a unit of money\).
  - For example,  when the value of the dollar \(and therefore the amount of money\) was tied to gold during the Great Depression,  suspending the promise to convert dollars into gold so that the currency could be devalued and more money created was key to creating the bottoms in the stock and commodity markets and the economy.
  - Printing money,  making asset purchases,  and providing guarantees were much easier to do in the 2008 financial crisis,  as they didn’t require a legalized and official change in the currency regime.
  - The chart below shows the archetypal path of gold prices.
  - In the US Great Depression,  gold rose overnight when Roosevelt broke the gold peg,  and during the more recent financial crisis,  Fed moves helped push down the value of the dollar versus all currencies,  including gold.
  - In the end,  policy makers always print.
  - That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit,  big restructurings wipe out too much wealth too fast,  and transfers of wealth from haves to have-nots don’t happen in sufficient size without revolutions.
  - Also,  printing money is not inflationary if the size and character of the money creation offsets the size and character of the credit contraction.
  - It is simply negating deflation.
  - In virtually all past deleveragings,  policy makers had to discover this for themselves after they first tried other paths without satisfactory results.
  - History has shown that those who did it quickly and well \(like the US in 2008–09\) have derived much better results than those who did it late \(like the US in 1930–33\).
  - The table below summarizes the typical amount of printing and currency devaluation required to create the turn from a depression to a “beautiful deleveraging.”
  - On average the printing of money has been around 4 percent of GDP per year.
  - There is a large initial currency devaluation of around 50 percent against gold,  and deficits widen to about 6 percent of GDP.
  - On average,  this aggressive stimulation comes two to three years into the depression,  after stocks have fallen more than 50 percent,  economic activity has fallen about 10 percent,  and unemployment has risen to around 10 to 15 percent,  though there is a lot of variation.
  - I’m providing these numbers only as broad indicators,  since circumstances vary considerably.
  - When looking at the differences \(which are very interesting but beyond the scope of this study\),  it is clear that when monetary and fiscal policies are rolled out faster and smarter,  the results are much better than these averages.
  - To reiterate,  the key to having a beautiful deleveraging lies in balancing the inflationary forces against the deflationary ones.
  - That’s because too much money printing can also produce an ugly inflationary deleveraging \(which we will go through later\).
  - The right amounts of stimulus are those that a\) neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit-market collapse and b\) get the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate by enough to relieve the debt burdens,  but not by so much that it leads to a run on debt assets.
  - In summary,  when all is said and done,  only a few things distinguish whether a deleveraging is managed well or poorly.
  - I have outlined them below.
  - A lot of pain can be avoided if policy makers can learn from the common pitfalls and understand the policies characteristic of beautiful deleveragings.
**Well Managed**
- Central banks consider growth in debt and its effects on asset markets in managing policy. If they can prevent the bubble,  they can prevent the bust.
- Central banks use macroprudential policies to target restraints in debt growth where bubbles are emerging and allow debt growth where it is not excessive.
- Fiscal policies are tightened.
**Poorly Managed**
- Big bubbles are fueled by speculators and lenders over-extrapolating past successes and making further debt-financed investments,  and by central banks focusing just on inflation and/or growth and not considering debt bubbles in investment assets,  thus keeping credit cheap for too long.
**Top**
- Central banks constrict the bubble either with the control of broad [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] or with well-chosen macroprudential policies and then ease selectively \(via macroprudential policies\).
- Central banks continue to tighten well after bursting the bubble.
**Depression**
- Central banks provide ample liquidity,  ease short rates quickly until they hit 0%,  and then pursue aggressive monetizations,  using aggressive targeted macroprudential policies.
- Governments pursue aggressive and sustained fiscal stimulus,  easing past the turn.
- Systemically important institutions are protected.
- Central banks are slower to cut rates,  provide more limited liquidity,  and tighten too early. They also wait too long to pursue aggressive monetization.
- Governments pursue austerity without adequately easing.
- Systemically important institutions are left damaged or failed.
**Beautiful Deleveraging**
- Reflations begin with aggressive monetizations through asset purchases or big currency declines,  enough to bring nominal growth above nominal rates.
- Stimulative macroprudential policies are targeted to protect systemically important entities and to stimulate high-quality credit growth.
- Nonsystemically important institutions are allowed to fail in an orderly way.
- Policy makers balance the depressive forces of defaults and austerity with the reflationary forces of debt monetization,  currency declines,  and fiscal stimulus.
- Initial monetizations stutter and start. Asset purchases are more muted and consist more of cash-like instruments rather than risky assets,  so that purchases don’t produce a wealth effect. Stimulation of the central bank is undermined by fiscal austerity.
- Overindebted entities are protected even though they are not systemically important,  leading to zombie banks and malaise.
- Ugly inflationary depressions arise in cases where policy makers allow faith in the currency to collapse and print too much money.
### “Pushing on a String”
- **Challenges in Late Debt Cycles**
  - Late in the long-term debt cycle,  central bankers sometimes struggle to convert their stimulative policies into increased spending because the effects of lowering interest rates and central banks’ purchases of debt assets have diminished.
  - At such times the economy enters a period of low growth and low returns on assets,  and central bankers have to move to other forms of monetary stimulation in which money and credit go more directly to support spenders.
  - When policy makers faced these conditions in the 1930s,  they coined the phrase “pushing on a string.”
  - One of the biggest risks at this stage is that if there is too much printing of money/monetization and too severe a currency devaluation relative to the amounts of the deflationary alternatives,  an “ugly inflationary deleveraging” can occur.
  - To help understand the different kinds of monetary policies that can be used throughout a deleveraging,  I think of them as coming in three different styles,  each with its own effects on the economy and markets.
#### Monetary Policy 1
- **Interest-rate Driven Monetary Policy**
  - Interest-rate driven [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] \(which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1\) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy.
  - When central banks reduce interest rates,  they stimulate the economy by a\) producing a positive wealth effect \(because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most investments\); b\) making it easier to buy items on credit \(because the monthly payments decline\),  raising demand—especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c\) reducing debt-service burdens \(which improves cash flows and spending\).
  - MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis,  but when short-term interest rates hit around 0 percent,  it no longer works effectively,  so central banks must go to the second type.
#### Monetary Policy 2
- **Quantitative Easing**
  - “Quantitative easing” \(QE\) as it is now called \(i.e.,  “printing money” and buying financial assets,  typically debt assets\),  is Monetary Policy 2.
  - It works by affecting the behavior of investors/savers as opposed to borrowers/spenders,  because it is driven by purchases of financial assets,  typically debt assets that impact investors/savers the most.
  - When the central bank buys a bond,  it gives investors/savers cash,  which they typically use to buy another financial asset that they think is more attractive.
  - What they do with that money and credit makes all the difference in the world.
  - When they invest in the sort of assets that finance spending,  that stimulates the economy.
  - When they invest in those that don’t \(such as financial assets\),  there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who have enjoyed the market gains than from those who haven’t.
  - In other words,  QE certainly benefits investors/savers \(i.e.,  those who own financial assets\) much more than people who don’t,  thus widening the wealth gap.
  - While MP2 is generally less effective than interest-rate changes,  it is most effective when risk and liquidity premiums are large,  because it causes those premiums to fall.
  - When risk premiums are large,  and money is added to the system,  actual risks are reduced at the same time that there is more money seeking returns,  which triggers purchases of riskier assets that are offering higher expected returns,  driving their prices up and producing a positive wealth effect.
  - But over time,  the use of QE to stimulate the economy declines in effectiveness because risk premiums are pushed down and asset prices are pushed up to levels beyond which they are difficult to push further,  and the wealth effect diminishes.
  - In other words,  at higher prices and lower expected returns,  the compensation for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up,  which would drive prospective returns down further.
  - In fact,  the reward-to-risk ratio could make those who are long a lot of assets view that terribly returning asset called cash as more appealing.
  - As a result,  QE becomes less and less effective.
  - If they provide QE and private credit growth doesn’t pick up,  policy makers feel like they are pushing on a string.
  - At this stage,  policy makers sometimes monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for its declining effectiveness.
  - While this can help for a bit,  there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency’s suitability as a store hold of value.
  - This can lead them to start moving to alternative currencies,  such as gold.
  - The fundamental economic challenge most economies have in this phase is that the claims on purchasing power are greater than the abilities to meet them.
  - Think of it this way: There are only goods and services. Financial assets are claims on them.
  - In other words,  holders of investments/assets \(i.e.,  capitalists-investors\) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power to get goods and services.
  - At the same time,  workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services.
  - But since debt/money/currency have no intrinsic value,  the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy,  so they have to be devalued or restructured.
  - In other words,  when there are too many debt liabilities/assets,  they either have to be reduced via [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]s or monetized.
  - Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary.
  - But monetization simply swaps one IOU \(debt\) for another \(newly printed money\).
  - The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme.
  - Since there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs,  there’s a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever.
  - Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose a structural challenge for [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].
  - With Monetary Policy 1 \(interest rates\) and Monetary Policy 2 \(QE\) at their limits,  the central bank has very little ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—i.e.,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] has little “gas in the tank.”
  - This typically happens in the later years of the long-term debt cycle \(e.g.,  1937-38 and now in the US\),  which can lead to “pushing on a string.”
  - When this happens,  policy makers need to look beyond QE to the new forms of monetary and fiscal policy characterized by Monetary Policy 3.
#### Monetary Policy 3
- **Direct Support to Spenders**
  - Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it.
  - Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend the incremental money and credit they get than less wealthy people,  when the wealth gap is large and the economy is weak,  directing spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive.
  - Logic and history show us that there is a continuum of actions to stimulate spending that have varying degrees of control to them.
  - At one end are coordinated fiscal and monetary actions,  in which fiscal policy makers provide stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities to spend.
  - At the other end,  the central bank can provide “helicopter money” by sending cash directly to citizens without coordination with fiscal policy makers.
  - Typically,  though not always,  there is a coordination of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and fiscal policy in a way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services.
  - Central banks can also exert influence through macroprudential policies that help to shape things in ways that are similar to how fiscal policies might.
  - For simplicity,  I have organized that continuum and provided references to specific prior cases of each below.
    - **An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending.** Sometimes this is paired with QE that buys most of the new issuance \(e.g.,  in Japan in the 1930s,  US during World War II,  US and UK in the 2000s\).
    - **Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending,  where the Treasury isn’t on the hook for the debt**,  because:
      - The central bank can print money to cover debt payments \(e.g.,  Germany in the 1930s\).
      - The central bank can lend to entities other than the government that will use it for stimulus projects \(e.g.,  lending to development banks in China in 2008\).
    - **Not bothering to go through issuing debt,  and instead giving newly printed money directly to the government to spend.** Past cases have included printing fiat currency \(e.g.,  in Imperial China,  the American Revolution,  the US Civil War,  Germany in the 1930s,  and the UK during World War I\) or debasing hard currency \(Ancient Rome,  Imperial China,  16th-century England\).
    - **Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households \(i.e.,  “helicopter money”\).** When we refer to “helicopter money, ” we mean directing money into the hands of spenders \(e.g.,  US veterans’ bonuses during the Great Depression,  Imperial China\). How that money is directed could take different forms—the basic variants are either to direct the same amount to everyone or aim for some degree of helping one or more groups over others \(e.g.,  giving money to the poor rather than to the rich\). The money can be provided as a one-off or over time \(perhaps as a universal basic income\). All of these variants can be paired with an incentive to spend it—such as the money disappearing if it’s not spent within a year. The money could also be directed to specific investment accounts \(like retirement,  education,  or accounts earmarked for small-business investments\) targeted toward socially desirable spending/investment. Another potential way to craft the policy is to distribute returns/holdings from QE to households instead of to the government.
    - **Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation** \(the “year of Jubilee”\) as occurred in Ancient Rome,  the Great Depression,  and Iceland.
  - While I won’t offer opinions on each of these,  I will say that the most effective approaches involve fiscal/monetary coordination,  because that ensures that both the providing and the spending of money will occur.
  - If central banks just give people money \(helicopter money\),  that’s typically less adequate than giving them that money with incentives to spend it.
  - However,  sometimes it is difficult for those who set [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] to coordinate with those who set fiscal policy,  in which case other approaches are used.
# The Archetypal Big Debt Cycle
## Introduction to Credit and Debt
### Understanding Credit and Debt
- **Definition of Credit and Debt**
  - Credit is the provision of buying power in exchange for a promise to repay,  which constitutes debt.
  - The ability to make purchases through credit is beneficial,  while the lack of credit can hinder development.
- **The Problem with Debt**
  - Issues arise when there is an inability to repay debt.
  - The impact of rapid credit/debt growth depends on the productivity of the credit and the ability to service the debt.
### Perspectives on Debt
- **Financial Responsibility and Debt Aversion**
  - Financially responsible individuals often prefer saving over borrowing due to the perceived downsides of debt.
  - Personal experiences and upbringing can influence one's perspective on debt.
- **Societal Implications of Credit/Debt Growth**
  - Insufficient credit/debt growth can lead to economic problems due to missed opportunities.
  - Policy makers have tools to manage credit/debt growth that individuals do not possess.
## The Role of Credit in Economic Growth
### Productive Use of Borrowed Money
- **Desirability of Credit**
  - Credit is desirable if it is used productively enough to generate income to service the debt.
  - Proper allocation of resources benefits both lenders and borrowers.
- **Secondary and Indirect Economics**
  - Consideration of secondary economic effects is crucial,  such as the impact of education and infrastructure on productivity and crime reduction.
### Lending Standards and Development
- **Impact of Lending Standards**
  - Tight lending standards may reduce debt problems but also limit development.
  - Looser standards can promote development but may lead to future debt issues.
## Evaluating Debt and Debt Cycles
### Cost of Bad Debt vs. Lack of Spending
- **Example of a Subway System**
  - A subway system financed by debt may exceed budget expectations,  but the long-term benefits could justify the additional cost.
  - Bad debt losses can be socialized and spread over time to mitigate immediate economic impact.
### Policy Makers' Role in Managing Debt
- **Spreading Out Losses**
  - The ability of policy makers to spread out losses from bad debts is crucial in managing debt crises.
  - Factors influencing this ability include control over currency and influence on creditor-debtor relationships.
## Debt Crises and Economic Cycles
### Inevitability of Debt Crises
- **Historical Context**
  - Few countries have avoided debt crises due to imperfect lending and psychological factors leading to bubbles and busts.
  - Policy makers often err on the side of loose credit for short-term growth benefits.
### Cyclical Nature of Debt Crises
- **Understanding Economic Cycles**
  - Economic cycles are driven by expansions and contractions in credit,  following logical patterns.
  - Borrowing creates cycles of spending more than income,  followed by periods of spending less to repay debt.
- **Monopoly® as an Economic Model**
  - The game of Monopoly® illustrates how credit cycles work,  with property and cash dynamics reflecting economic principles.
## Managing Debt Crises
### Types of Debt Crises
- **Deflationary vs. Inflationary Crises**
  - Debt crises can be deflationary or inflationary,  influenced by the amount of foreign currency debt.
  - Severe debt crises occur when interest rate reductions are no longer effective.
### Policy Makers' Tools
- **Levers for Managing Debt**
  - Austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  central bank interventions,  and transfers of money/credit are tools available to policy makers.
  - The balance between these levers determines the effectiveness of managing debt crises.
### The Template for Long-Term Debt Cycles
- **Examination of Historical Debt Cycles**
  - Analysis of 48 big debt cycles reveals patterns in how debt and debt service costs rise relative to income.
  - Long-term debt cycles are more extreme than short-term cycles due to higher debt burdens and less effective monetary policies.
## Conclusion
### Key Takeaways
- **Importance of Policy Makers' Knowledge and Authority**
  - Effective management of debt crises requires knowledgeable policy makers with the authority to implement necessary measures.
  - The political and economic consequences of debt management decisions must be carefully considered.
- **Potential for Managing Debt Crises**
  - Most debt crises can be managed effectively if debts are denominated in a country's own currency.
  - The biggest risks arise from policy makers' failures and the political challenges of implementing necessary adjustments.
## Detailed Analysis of Debt Cycles
### The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle
- **Early Part of the Cycle**
  - In the early part of the cycle,  debt is not growing faster than incomes,  even though debt growth is strong.
  - Debt growth is used to finance activities that produce fast income growth,  such as business expansion.
- **The Bubble**
  - In the first stage of the bubble,  debts rise faster than incomes,  producing accelerating strong asset returns and growth.
  - Rising incomes,  net-worths,  and asset values raise borrowers’ capacities to borrow,  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.
#### The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
- **Bull Market Dynamics**
  - Bubbles usually start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets,  initially driven by lower interest rates.
  - As assets go up in value,  net worths and spending/income levels rise,  increasing confidence in ongoing prosperity.
- **Emergence of a Bubble**
  - The boom encourages new buyers to enter the market,  fueling the emergence of a bubble.
  - Uneconomic lending and the bubble occur due to implicit or explicit government guarantees encouraging reckless lending.
- **Shadow Banking and Financial Engineering**
  - New types of lending institutions develop,  often less regulated,  contributing to the bubble.
  - Financial engineering and new lending vehicles are frequently invented,  reinforcing the bubble by increasing speculators’ equity.
- **Market Dynamics and Consensus**
  - Rising stock prices lead to more spending and investment,  raising earnings and stock prices further.
  - Large asset-liability mismatches increase,  with entities borrowing short-term to lend long-term or investing in riskier assets.
- **Debt Service Costs and Economic Vulnerability**
  - Debts rise fast,  and debt service costs rise even faster,  making the economy vulnerable as the bubble nears its top.
  - Total debt-to-income levels average around 300 percent of GDP,  indicating the archetypal bubble's characteristics.
### Managing the Aftermath of a Bubble
- **Deleveraging and Economic Contraction**
  - When promises to deliver money can’t rise any more relative to the money and credit coming in,  deleveraging begins.
  - Borrowing is a way of pulling spending forward,  necessitating spending cuts when the bubble bursts.
- **Government Intervention and [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]**
  - The free-market credit system ceases to work well,  requiring government intervention as the central bank becomes a lender of last resort.
  - [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] is necessary to reduce claims on future spending relative to available money.
- **Historical Context and Lessons**
  - The dynamic of long-term debt cycles has existed for as long as there has been credit,  with historical examples like the Year of Jubilee.
  - Understanding the roles of money as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth is crucial in managing debt cycles.
### Conclusion
- **Balancing Economic Forces**
  - The balance between proletariat-workers and capitalists-investors,  along with government rules,  shapes the economic landscape.
  - Effective management of debt cycles requires understanding the interplay between these groups and the economic forces at play.
#### The Role of Monetary Policy
- **Monetary Policy and Bubble Inflation**
  - In many cases,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] helps inflate the bubble rather than constrain it,  especially when inflation and growth are both good.
  - Central banks,  focusing on inflation and growth,  are often reluctant to adequately tighten money during productivity booms.
- **Historical Examples**
  - This occurred in Japan in the late 1980s,  and in much of the world in the late 1920s and mid-2000s.
  - Central banks typically do not target the management of bubbles,  which can lead to unsustainable debt growth.
- **Central Bank Responsibilities**
  - It is crucial for central banks to target debt growth with an eye toward keeping it at a sustainable level.
  - Central bankers sometimes claim it is too hard to spot bubbles and that it is not their role to assess and control them.
- **Consequences of Ignoring Bubbles**
  - The economic pain of allowing a large bubble to inflate and then burst is significant,  and policy makers should not ignore them.
  - Central banks typically fall behind the curve during such periods,  and borrowers are not yet squeezed by higher debt-service costs.
- **Reversal of Bubble Dynamics**
  - When the bubble pops,  falling asset prices decrease both the equity and collateral values of leveraged speculators.
  - Lenders pull back,  forcing speculators to sell,  driving down prices even more,  and causing liquidity problems.
#### Spotting Bubbles
- **Characteristics of Bubbles**
  - Prices are high relative to traditional measures,  and there is broad bullish sentiment.
  - Purchases are being financed by high leverage,  and new buyers have entered the market.
- **Monetary Policy Influence**
  - Stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] threatens to inflate the bubble even more,  while tight policy can cause its popping.
- **Debt Crisis Indicators**
  - To anticipate a debt crisis,  one must look at the specific debt-service abilities of individual entities,  not just economy-wide averages.
### The Top of the Market
- **Market Reversal Dynamics**
  - When prices have been driven by leveraged buying,  the market becomes ripe for a reversal.
  - Tops are often triggered when the central bank starts to tighten and interest rates rise.
- **Economic Indicators**
  - The fastest rate of tightening typically comes about five months prior to the top of the stock market.
  - The economy operates at a high rate,  with demand pressing up against the capacity to produce.
- **Impact of Tightening**
  - The increase in short-term interest rates makes holding cash more attractive,  weakening riskier asset prices and slowing lending.
  - The more leverage that exists,  the less tightening it takes to prick the bubble and the bigger the bust that follows.
### The "Depression" Phase
- **Characteristics of Depressions**
  - In depressions,  risk-free interest rates can’t be cut materially because they have reached close to 0 percent.
  - Credit spreads are wide,  creating a formula for a depression.
- **Government Response**
  - In well-managed cases,  central banks lower rates quickly and move on to alternative means of stimulating the economy.
  - Debt defaults and restructurings hit various players,  especially leveraged lenders,  like an avalanche.
- **Self-Reinforcing Debt Spirals**
  - A self-reinforcing spiral of developments can happen,  squeezing the debtor and leading to a deadly result.
  - Interest rate cuts don’t help lending institutions with liquidity problems and suffering from runs.
- **Managing Depressions**
  - Policies that reduce debt burdens include austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  debt monetization/money printing,  and wealth transfers.
  - The key is to balance deflationary and depressive forces with inflationary and stimulative ones.
#### Austerity
- **Austerity Measures**
  - In the depression phase,  policy makers typically try austerity because that’s the obvious thing to do.
  - It’s natural to want to let those who got themselves and others in trouble to bear the costs.
  - The problem is that even deep austerity doesn’t bring debt and income back into balance.
  - When spending is cut,  incomes are also cut,  so it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in the debt/income ratios.
  - As the economy contracts,  government revenues typically fall.
  - At the same time,  demands on the government increase.
  - As a result,  deficits typically increase.
  - Seeking to be fiscally responsible,  at this point governments tend to raise taxes.
  - Both moves are big mistakes.
#### “Printing Money” to Stop the Bleeding and Stimulate the Economy
- **Government and Central Bank Actions**
  - Quite often “runs” on lending institutions occur,  especially those that aren’t protected by government guarantees.
  - That puts the central bank and the central government in the position of having to decide which depositors/lenders should be protected from losses and which should be allowed to sustain them,  and which institutions are systemically important and should be saved—and how to do these things in a way that maximizes the safety of the financial/economic system while minimizing costs to the government/taxpayers.
  - At such times all sorts of guarantees are offered to systemically critical financial institutions—and quite often some of these institutions are nationalized.
  - Typically there are a lot of laws and politics that affect how quickly and how well this is done.
  - Some of the money that is needed comes from the government \(i.e.,  it is appropriated through the budget process\) and some from the central banks \(by “printing”\).
  - Governments inevitably do both,  though in varying degrees.
  - In addition to providing money to some essential banks,  governments also typically provide money to some nonbank entities they consider essential.
  - Next,  they must ease the credit crunch and stimulate the overall economy.
  - Since the government is likely having trouble raising funds through taxation and borrowing,  central banks are forced to choose between “printing” still more money to buy their governments’ debts or allowing their governments and their private sector to compete for the limited supply of money,  which will only tighten money further.
  - Inevitably,  they choose to print.
  - Typically,  though not necessarily,  these moves come in progressively larger doses as more modest initial attempts fail to rectify the imbalance and reverse the deleveraging process.
  - However,  those early efforts do typically cause temporary periods of relief that are manifest in bear-market rallies in financial assets and increased economic activity.
  - During the Great Depression there were six big rallies in the stock market \(of between 16 percent and 48 percent\) in a bear market that declined a total of 89 percent.
  - All of those rallies were triggered by government actions that were intended to reduce the fundamental imbalance.
  - When they are managed well,  those shifts in policies to “print money, ” buy assets,  and provide guarantees are what moves the debt cycle from its depression/“ugly deleveraging” phase to its expansion/“beautiful deleveraging” phase.
  - The chart below shows how this “money printing” happened in the US in the 1930s and again after 2008.
  - While highly stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is a critical part of a deleveraging,  it is typically not sufficient.
  - When risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail,  policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running.
  - They must act immediately to:
    - **Curtail panic and guarantee liabilities.** Governments can increase guarantees on deposits and debt issuance. Central banks can provide systemically important institutions \(i.e.,  institutions whose failures would threaten the ongoing operating of the financial system and/or that of the economy\) with injections of money. Occasionally,  governments can force liquidity to remain in the banking system by imposing deposit freezes,  which is generally undesirable because it intensifies the panic,  but is sometimes necessary because there is no other way of providing that money/liquidity. Policy makers providing guarantees in order to provide support is often easier and preferable to providing cash. Because coming up with guarantees doesn’t require coming up with actual money and all that’s required to do that \(e.g.,  obtaining approvals,  doing transactions,  changing income statements and balance sheets\) it’s typically easier and quicker. Guarantees also have the nice aspect of only kicking in when the worst case scenario happens. They are so powerful that they work even when just implied by governments that have controls of their own printing presses. That can lead to bad lending because lenders get too reliant on the guarantor and no longer care about the creditworthiness of the borrower. For that reason,  governments need to be careful to use guarantees sparingly.
    - **Provide liquidity.** When private credit is contracting and liquidity is tight,  the central bank can ensure that sufficient liquidity is provided to the financial system by lending against a widening range of collateral or to an increasingly wide range of financial institutions that are not normally considered part of their lending practices.
    - **Support the solvency of systemically important institutions.** The first step is usually to incentivize the private sector to address the problem,  often by supporting mergers between failed banks and healthy banks and by regulatory pushes to issue more capital to the private sector. In addition,  accounting adjustments can be made to reduce the immediate need for capital to maintain solvency,  buying more time for the institutions to earn their way out of their problems.
    - **Recapitalize/nationalize/cover losses of systemically important financial institutions.** When the above approaches are insufficient to deal with the solvency problems of systemically important financial institutions,  governments must step in to recapitalize failed banks. Moving to stabilize lenders and maintain the credit supply is critical to preventing a crisis from getting worse. Certain institutions are part of the plumbing of the system; one would hate to lose them even if they’re not making money at the moment. It would be like losing a shipping port in a depression because the port goes broke. You want the port to continue to operate and ships to come in,  so you have to protect it one way or another—whether through a nationalization,  loans,  or capital injections.
#### Debt Defaults/Restructurings
- **Cleansing Bad Debts**
  - Ultimately,  the process of cleansing existing bad debts is critical for the future flow of money and credit and for a return to prosperity.
  - The challenge for policy makers is to allow that process to work itself out in an orderly way that ensures economic and social stability.
  - The best-managed cases are those in which policy makers:
    - Swiftly recognize the magnitude of the credit problems.
    - Don’t save every institution that is expendable,  balancing the benefits of allowing broke institutions to fail and be restructured with the risks that such failures can have detrimental effects on other creditworthy lenders and borrowers.
    - Create or restore robust credit pipes that allow for future borrowing by creditworthy borrowers.
    - Ensure acceptable growth and inflation conditions while the bad debts are being worked out.
  - Longer term,  the most important decision that policy makers have to make is whether they will change the system to fix the root causes of the debt problems or simply restructure the debts so that the pain is distributed over the population and over time so that the debt does not impose an intolerable burden.
  - These things rarely happen right away.
  - Policy makers typically fail to recognize the magnitude of the problem initially,  instead enacting a number of one-off policies that are insufficient to move the needle.
  - It is only after what is usually a couple of years and a lot of unnecessary economic pain that they finally act decisively.
  - How quickly and aggressively policy makers respond is among the most important factors in determining the severity and length of the depression.
  - The question of exactly how these costs are divided between the government \(which means the society as a whole\) and the bond holders \(of varying seniorities\),  equity holders,  depositors,  etc.,  is an important one.
  - Typically,  nonsystemically important institutions are forced to absorb their losses,  and if they fail,  are allowed to go bankrupt.
  - The resolution of these institutions can take several different forms.
  - In many cases \(about 80 percent of the cases we studied\),  they are merged with healthy institutions.
  - In some other cases,  the assets are liquidated or transferred to an “asset-management company” \(AMC\) set up by the government to be sold piecemeal.
  - In some cases,  policy makers recognize that ensuring the viability of the whole banking system is critical and liquidity and solvency measures are taken at the banking system level.
  - In recent years it has become common for guarantees of bank liabilities to be issued in countries in the developed world.
  - In rare cases,  government-financed bank recapitalization is done across all banks,  rather than focused solely on systemically important institutions.
  - There are relatively clear lines for which creditors receive protections:
    - **Small depositors are given preference and experience minimal or no losses \(in nearly every case\).** Often this is explicitly defined as part of a deposit insurance scheme. Coverage is usually expanded during the crisis period in order to ensure liquidity for the banks. Even in cases where there isn’t an explicit deposit insurance scheme,  depositors are often prioritized. In around 30 percent of cases studied,  depositors did take losses,  though they were often on foreign-exchange deposits through conversion at below-market exchange rates.
    - **In most cases when institutions fail,  equity,  subordinated debt,  and large depositors absorb losses regardless of whether the institution was systemically important or not.** Protection of senior and subordinated debt holders,  and equity recapitalizations that are simply dilutive to existing equity holders,  are seen mostly in the developed world.
    - **Sometimes policy makers prioritize domestic creditors over foreign creditors,  especially when their loans are to private-sector players and are lower down in the capital structure.** This is especially true as deposit insurance programs run low on funds. But at the same time governments often end up prioritizing the payment of loans from multinational institutions like the IMF and BIS,  as it’s important to maintain availability of support from these public entities,  who effectively act as lenders of last resort to countries under stress.
  - Typically,  the process of dealing with the failed lenders is accompanied by a spate of regulatory reforms.
  - Sometimes these changes are modest and sometimes they are very large; sometimes they are for the better and sometimes they are for the worse.
  - They range from changes in how banks operate \(e.g.,  putting in deposit guarantees in the 1930s or [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]] and the Volcker rule in 2010 in the US\) to labor market reforms,  from requiring banks to improve credit standards to opening the banking system to competition \(including foreign entrants\) to raising capital requirements and removing protections to lenders.
  - Politics plays a big role in determining what reforms are made.
  - In some cases,  such reforms end up distorting private-sector market-based incentives on the flow of lending,  which can limit the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers and/or increase the risks of future credit problems emerging.
  - In other cases,  they improve the flow of credit,  protect households,  and reduce the risk of debt problems in the future.
  - There are two main ways in which failed lenders’ assets or existing lenders’ bad assets are managed:
    - They are either transferred to a separate entity \(an AMC\) to manage the restructuring and asset disposal \(about 40 percent of the cases studied\) or they remain on the balance sheet of the original lending institution to manage \(about 60 percent of cases\).
  - There are several main levers for disposing of the nonperforming loans:
    - Restructuring \(e.g.,  working out the loans through extended terms\).
    - Debt-for-equity swaps and asset seizures.
    - Direct sales of the loans or assets to third parties.
    - Securitizations.
  - The use of an AMC generally accelerates the management of the debt problem because it frees up existing banks to return to lending and helps consolidate the bad debts to a centralized entity that can manage sales and restructurings.
  - Selling assets to AMCs also often serves as a mechanism to engage in transfers to banks by pricing them at above market prices.
  - AMCs are typically publicly owned entities that are mandated to sell the assets within some targeted time frame \(e.g.,  10 years\) while minimizing costs to the taxpayer and disruptions of asset markets.
  - They do this by seeking to quickly sell off the performing assets of failed institutions and working over time to manage and sell off nonperforming assets.
  - In some cases AMCs have explicit goals to restructure the nonperforming debts to reduce debt burdens.
  - They are generally financed by some form of direct or pseudo-government debt issuance,  and they cannot work well when legal,  political,  or funding constraints limit their ability to recognize bad debts and restructure them.
  - Allowing the original lender to manage its bad debts often occurs when the original lender is state-sponsored,  which makes it closer to a public AMC.
  - In other cases losses may be allowed to sit on the lender’s balance sheet if they are not too large,  if the technical expertise to create a centralized AMC doesn’t exist,  or if effective resolution mechanisms already exist.
  - Much as with lenders,  there is usually a relatively clear distinction between how systemically or strategically important borrowers are handled and how those that aren’t are.
    - For systemically important borrowers or strategically important ones,  policy makers generally take steps to ensure that the businesses remain intact as entities. In general this occurs through a restructuring of the debts to make the ongoing debt service manageable. This can occur through debt-for-equity swaps,  through reducing the existing debts,  lowering interest rates,  or terming out the borrowing. Occasionally policy makers also introduce new lending programs to these borrowers to ensure their ongoing liquidity. This process is often explicitly one of the goals of AMCs set up to manage bad debts.
    - Nonsystemically important borrowers are usually left to restructure their loans with private lenders or are allowed to go bankrupt and are liquidated.
    - Central governments often take steps to help reduce the debt burdens on the household sector. AMCs may also take steps to restructure debt burdens rather than foreclosing on the loans as part of their goal of maximizing recovery values.
#### Redistributing Wealth
- **Wealth Gaps and Economic Conflict**
  - Wealth gaps increase during bubbles and become particularly galling for the less privileged during hard times.
  - As a general rule,  if rich people share a budget with poor people and there is an economic downturn,  there will be economic and political conflict.
  - It is during such times that populism on both the left and the right tends to emerge.
  - How well the people and the political system handle this is key to how well the economy and the society weather the period.
  - Both inequality and populism are on the rise in the US today,  much as they were in the 1930s.
  - In both cases,  the net worth of the top 0.1 percent of the population equaled approximately that of the bottom 90 percent combined.
  - In some cases,  raising taxes on the rich becomes politically attractive because the rich made a lot of money in the boom—especially those working in the financial sector—and are perceived to have caused the problems because of their greed.
  - The central bank’s purchases of financial assets also disproportionately benefit the rich,  because the rich own many more such assets.
  - Big political shifts to the left typically hasten redistributive efforts.
  - This typically drives the rich to try to move their money in ways and to places that provide protection,  which itself has effects on asset and currency markets.
  - It can also cause an economic “hollowing out” of those areas because the big income earners,  who are also the big income taxpayers,  leave,  reducing overall tax revenues and leading these areas to suffer sharp declines in property values and reductions in services.
  - Typically,  increased taxation takes the form of greater income,  property,  and consumption taxes because these forms of taxation are the most effective at raising revenues.
  - Wealth and inheritance taxes are sometimes also increased,  though these typically raise very little money because so much wealth is illiquid that it is practically difficult to collect on,  and forcing the taxpayer to sell liquid assets to make their tax payments undermines capital formation.
  - Regardless,  transfers rarely occur in amounts that contribute meaningfully to the deleveraging \(unless there are “revolutions” and huge amounts of property are nationalized\).
### The “Beautiful Deleveraging”
- **Achieving a Balanced Deleveraging**
  - A “beautiful deleveraging” happens when the four levers are moved in a balanced way so as to reduce intolerable shocks and produce positive growth with falling debt burdens and acceptable inflation.
  - More specifically,  deleveragings become beautiful when there is enough stimulation \(i.e.,  through “printing of money”/debt monetization and currency devaluation\) to offset the deflationary deleveraging forces \(austerity/defaults\) and bring the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate—but not so much stimulation that inflation is accelerated,  the currency is devaluated,  and a new debt bubble arises.
  - The best way of negating the deflationary depression is for the central bank to provide adequate liquidity and credit support,  and,  depending on different key entities’ needs for capital,  for the central government to provide that too.
  - Recall that spending comes in the form of either money or credit.
  - When increased spending cannot be financed with increased debt because there is too much debt relative to the amount of money there is to service the debt,  increased spending and debt-service relief must come from increased money.
  - This means that the central bank has to increase the amount of money in the system.
  - The central bank can do this by lending against a wider range of collateral \(both of lower quality and longer maturity\) and also by buying \(monetizing\) lower-quality and/or longer-term debt.
  - This produces relief and,  if it’s done in the right amounts,  allows a deleveraging to occur with positive growth.
  - The right amounts are those that a\) neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit market collapse and b\) get the nominal growth rate marginally above the nominal interest rate to tolerably spread out the deleveraging process.
  - So,  what do I mean by that? Basically,  income needs to grow faster than debt.
  - For example: Let’s assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-income ratio of 100 percent. That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the entire country makes in a year.
  - Now think about the interest rate on that debt. Let’s say it’s 2 percent. If debt is 100 and the interest rate is 2 percent,  then if no debt is repaid it will be 102 after one year.
  - If income is 100 and it grows at 1 percent,  then income will be 101,  so the debt burden will increase from 100/100 to 102/101.
  - So for the burdens from existing debt not to increase,  nominal income growth must be higher than nominal interest rates,  and the higher the better \(provided it is not so high that it produces unacceptable inflation and/or unacceptable currency declines\).
  - People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won’t if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this reflationary force.
  - That’s not a theory—it’s been repeatedly proven out in history.
  - Remember,  spending is what matters. A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on prices as a dollar of spending paid for with credit.
  - By “printing money, ” the central bank can make up for the disappearance of credit with an increase in the amount of money.
  - This “printing” takes the form of central bank purchases of government securities and nongovernment assets such as corporate securities,  equities,  and other assets,  which is reflected in money growing at an extremely fast rate at the same time as credit and real economic activity are contracting.
  - Traditional economists see that as the velocity of money declining,  but it’s nothing of the sort.
  - What is happening at such times is that credit destruction is being offset by money creation.
  - If the balance between replacing credit and actively stimulating the economy is right,  this isn’t inflationary.
  - But there is such a thing as abusive use of stimulants.
  - Because stimulants work so well relative to the alternatives,  there is a real risk that they can be abused,  causing an “ugly inflationary deleveraging” \(like the Weimar hyperinflation of the 1920s,  or those in Argentina and Brazil in the 1980s\).
  - The key is to avoid printing too much money.
  - If policy makers achieve the right balance,  a deleveraging isn’t so dramatic.
  - Getting this balance right is much more difficult in countries that have a large percentage of debt denominated in foreign currency and owned by foreign investors \(as in Weimar Germany and the South American countries\) because that debt can’t be monetized or restructured as easily.
  - Printing money/debt monetization and government guarantees are inevitable in depressions in which interest rate cuts won’t work,  though these tools are of little value in countries that are constrained from printing or don’t have assets to back printing up and can’t easily negotiate the redistributions of the debt burdens.
  - All of the deleveragings that we have studied \(which is most of those that occurred over the past hundred years\) eventually led to big waves of money creation,  fiscal deficits,  and currency devaluations \(against gold,  commodities,  and stocks\).
  - In different cases,  policy makers have varied which exact combination of the levers they used,  typically as a function of the nature of their monetary systems.
  - The chart below conveys the archetypal path of money printing in deflationary deleveragings over the 21 cases.
  - The money printing occurs in two classic waves—central banks first provide liquidity to stressed institutions,  and then they conduct large-scale asset purchases to broadly stimulate the economy.
  - Below we show the average real exchange rate versus trade partners,  which reflects the strength/weakness of a currency relative to the country’s trade partners.
  - Typically,  governments with gold-,  commodity-,  or foreign-currency-pegged money systems are forced to have tighter monetary policies to protect the value of their currency than governments with fiat monetary systems.
  - But eventually the debt contractions become so painful that they relent,  break the link,  and print \(i.e.,  either they abandon these systems or change the amount/pricing of the commodity that they will exchange for a unit of money\).
  - For example,  when the value of the dollar \(and therefore the amount of money\) was tied to gold during the Great Depression,  suspending the promise to convert dollars into gold so that the currency could be devalued and more money created was key to creating the bottoms in the stock and commodity markets and the economy.
  - Printing money,  making asset purchases,  and providing guarantees were much easier to do in the 2008 financial crisis,  as they didn’t require a legalized and official change in the currency regime.
  - The chart below shows the archetypal path of gold prices.
  - In the US Great Depression,  gold rose overnight when Roosevelt broke the gold peg,  and during the more recent financial crisis,  Fed moves helped push down the value of the dollar versus all currencies,  including gold.
  - In the end,  policy makers always print.
  - That is because austerity causes more pain than benefit,  big restructurings wipe out too much wealth too fast,  and transfers of wealth from haves to have-nots don’t happen in sufficient size without revolutions.
  - Also,  printing money is not inflationary if the size and character of the money creation offsets the size and character of the credit contraction.
  - It is simply negating deflation.
  - In virtually all past deleveragings,  policy makers had to discover this for themselves after they first tried other paths without satisfactory results.
  - History has shown that those who did it quickly and well \(like the US in 2008–09\) have derived much better results than those who did it late \(like the US in 1930–33\).
  - The table below summarizes the typical amount of printing and currency devaluation required to create the turn from a depression to a “beautiful deleveraging.”
  - On average the printing of money has been around 4 percent of GDP per year.
  - There is a large initial currency devaluation of around 50 percent against gold,  and deficits widen to about 6 percent of GDP.
  - On average,  this aggressive stimulation comes two to three years into the depression,  after stocks have fallen more than 50 percent,  economic activity has fallen about 10 percent,  and unemployment has risen to around 10 to 15 percent,  though there is a lot of variation.
  - I’m providing these numbers only as broad indicators,  since circumstances vary considerably.
  - When looking at the differences \(which are very interesting but beyond the scope of this study\),  it is clear that when monetary and fiscal policies are rolled out faster and smarter,  the results are much better than these averages.
  - To reiterate,  the key to having a beautiful deleveraging lies in balancing the inflationary forces against the deflationary ones.
  - That’s because too much money printing can also produce an ugly inflationary deleveraging \(which we will go through later\).
  - The right amounts of stimulus are those that a\) neutralize what would otherwise be a deflationary credit-market collapse and b\) get the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate by enough to relieve the debt burdens,  but not by so much that it leads to a run on debt assets.
  - In summary,  when all is said and done,  only a few things distinguish whether a deleveraging is managed well or poorly.
  - I have outlined them below.
  - A lot of pain can be avoided if policy makers can learn from the common pitfalls and understand the policies characteristic of beautiful deleveragings.
**Well Managed**
- Central banks consider growth in debt and its effects on asset markets in managing policy. If they can prevent the bubble,  they can prevent the bust.
- Central banks use macroprudential policies to target restraints in debt growth where bubbles are emerging and allow debt growth where it is not excessive.
- Fiscal policies are tightened.
**Poorly Managed**
- Big bubbles are fueled by speculators and lenders over-extrapolating past successes and making further debt-financed investments,  and by central banks focusing just on inflation and/or growth and not considering debt bubbles in investment assets,  thus keeping credit cheap for too long.
**Top**
- Central banks constrict the bubble either with the control of broad [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] or with well-chosen macroprudential policies and then ease selectively \(via macroprudential policies\).
- Central banks continue to tighten well after bursting the bubble.
**Depression**
- Central banks provide ample liquidity,  ease short rates quickly until they hit 0%,  and then pursue aggressive monetizations,  using aggressive targeted macroprudential policies.
- Governments pursue aggressive and sustained fiscal stimulus,  easing past the turn.
- Systemically important institutions are protected.
- Central banks are slower to cut rates,  provide more limited liquidity,  and tighten too early. They also wait too long to pursue aggressive monetization.
- Governments pursue austerity without adequately easing.
- Systemically important institutions are left damaged or failed.
**Beautiful Deleveraging**
- Reflations begin with aggressive monetizations through asset purchases or big currency declines,  enough to bring nominal growth above nominal rates.
- Stimulative macroprudential policies are targeted to protect systemically important entities and to stimulate high-quality credit growth.
- Nonsystemically important institutions are allowed to fail in an orderly way.
- Policy makers balance the depressive forces of defaults and austerity with the reflationary forces of debt monetization,  currency declines,  and fiscal stimulus.
- Initial monetizations stutter and start. Asset purchases are more muted and consist more of cash-like instruments rather than risky assets,  so that purchases don’t produce a wealth effect. Stimulation of the central bank is undermined by fiscal austerity.
- Overindebted entities are protected even though they are not systemically important,  leading to zombie banks and malaise.
- Ugly inflationary depressions arise in cases where policy makers allow faith in the currency to collapse and print too much money.
### “Pushing on a String”
- **Challenges in Late Debt Cycles**
  - Late in the long-term debt cycle,  central bankers sometimes struggle to convert their stimulative policies into increased spending because the effects of lowering interest rates and central banks’ purchases of debt assets have diminished.
  - At such times the economy enters a period of low growth and low returns on assets,  and central bankers have to move to other forms of monetary stimulation in which money and credit go more directly to support spenders.
  - When policy makers faced these conditions in the 1930s,  they coined the phrase “pushing on a string.”
  - One of the biggest risks at this stage is that if there is too much printing of money/monetization and too severe a currency devaluation relative to the amounts of the deflationary alternatives,  an “ugly inflationary deleveraging” can occur.
  - To help understand the different kinds of monetary policies that can be used throughout a deleveraging,  I think of them as coming in three different styles,  each with its own effects on the economy and markets.
#### Monetary Policy 1
- **Interest-rate Driven Monetary Policy**
  - Interest-rate driven [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] \(which I’ll call Monetary Policy 1\) is the most effective because it has the broadest impact on the economy.
  - When central banks reduce interest rates,  they stimulate the economy by a\) producing a positive wealth effect \(because the lower interest rate raises the present value of most investments\); b\) making it easier to buy items on credit \(because the monthly payments decline\),  raising demand—especially for interest-rate-sensitive items like durable goods and housing; and c\) reducing debt-service burdens \(which improves cash flows and spending\).
  - MP1 is typically the first approach to a debt crisis,  but when short-term interest rates hit around 0 percent,  it no longer works effectively,  so central banks must go to the second type.
#### Monetary Policy 2
- **Quantitative Easing**
  - “Quantitative easing” \(QE\) as it is now called \(i.e.,  “printing money” and buying financial assets,  typically debt assets\),  is Monetary Policy 2.
  - It works by affecting the behavior of investors/savers as opposed to borrowers/spenders,  because it is driven by purchases of financial assets,  typically debt assets that impact investors/savers the most.
  - When the central bank buys a bond,  it gives investors/savers cash,  which they typically use to buy another financial asset that they think is more attractive.
  - What they do with that money and credit makes all the difference in the world.
  - When they invest in the sort of assets that finance spending,  that stimulates the economy.
  - When they invest in those that don’t \(such as financial assets\),  there must be very large market gains before any money trickles down into spending—and that spending comes more from those who have enjoyed the market gains than from those who haven’t.
  - In other words,  QE certainly benefits investors/savers \(i.e.,  those who own financial assets\) much more than people who don’t,  thus widening the wealth gap.
  - While MP2 is generally less effective than interest-rate changes,  it is most effective when risk and liquidity premiums are large,  because it causes those premiums to fall.
  - When risk premiums are large,  and money is added to the system,  actual risks are reduced at the same time that there is more money seeking returns,  which triggers purchases of riskier assets that are offering higher expected returns,  driving their prices up and producing a positive wealth effect.
  - But over time,  the use of QE to stimulate the economy declines in effectiveness because risk premiums are pushed down and asset prices are pushed up to levels beyond which they are difficult to push further,  and the wealth effect diminishes.
  - In other words,  at higher prices and lower expected returns,  the compensation for taking risk becomes too small to get investors to bid prices up,  which would drive prospective returns down further.
  - In fact,  the reward-to-risk ratio could make those who are long a lot of assets view that terribly returning asset called cash as more appealing.
  - As a result,  QE becomes less and less effective.
  - If they provide QE and private credit growth doesn’t pick up,  policy makers feel like they are pushing on a string.
  - At this stage,  policy makers sometimes monetize debt in even larger quantities in an attempt to compensate for its declining effectiveness.
  - While this can help for a bit,  there is a real risk that prolonged monetization will lead people to question the currency’s suitability as a store hold of value.
  - This can lead them to start moving to alternative currencies,  such as gold.
  - The fundamental economic challenge most economies have in this phase is that the claims on purchasing power are greater than the abilities to meet them.
  - Think of it this way: There are only goods and services. Financial assets are claims on them.
  - In other words,  holders of investments/assets \(i.e.,  capitalists-investors\) believe that they can convert their holdings into purchasing power to get goods and services.
  - At the same time,  workers expect to be able to exchange a unit’s worth of their contribution to the production of goods and services into buying power for goods and services.
  - But since debt/money/currency have no intrinsic value,  the claims on them are greater than the value of what they are supposed to be able to buy,  so they have to be devalued or restructured.
  - In other words,  when there are too many debt liabilities/assets,  they either have to be reduced via [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]]s or monetized.
  - Policy makers tend to use monetization at this stage primarily because it is stimulative rather than contractionary.
  - But monetization simply swaps one IOU \(debt\) for another \(newly printed money\).
  - The situation is analogous to a Ponzi scheme.
  - Since there aren’t enough goods and services likely to be produced to back up all the IOUs,  there’s a worry that people may not be willing to work in return for IOUs forever.
  - Low interest rates together with low premiums on risky assets pose a structural challenge for [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].
  - With Monetary Policy 1 \(interest rates\) and Monetary Policy 2 \(QE\) at their limits,  the central bank has very little ability to provide stimulus through these two channels—i.e.,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] has little “gas in the tank.”
  - This typically happens in the later years of the long-term debt cycle \(e.g.,  1937-38 and now in the US\),  which can lead to “pushing on a string.”
  - When this happens,  policy makers need to look beyond QE to the new forms of monetary and fiscal policy characterized by Monetary Policy 3.
#### Monetary Policy 3
- **Direct Support to Spenders**
  - Monetary Policy 3 puts money more directly into the hands of spenders instead of investors/savers and incentivizes them to spend it.
  - Because wealthy people have fewer incentives to spend the incremental money and credit they get than less wealthy people,  when the wealth gap is large and the economy is weak,  directing spending opportunities at less wealthy people is more productive.
  - Logic and history show us that there is a continuum of actions to stimulate spending that have varying degrees of control to them.
  - At one end are coordinated fiscal and monetary actions,  in which fiscal policy makers provide stimulus directly through government spending or indirectly by providing incentives for nongovernment entities to spend.
  - At the other end,  the central bank can provide “helicopter money” by sending cash directly to citizens without coordination with fiscal policy makers.
  - Typically,  though not always,  there is a coordination of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and fiscal policy in a way that creates incentives for people to spend on goods and services.
  - Central banks can also exert influence through macroprudential policies that help to shape things in ways that are similar to how fiscal policies might.
  - For simplicity,  I have organized that continuum and provided references to specific prior cases of each below.
    - **An increase in debt-financed fiscal spending.** Sometimes this is paired with QE that buys most of the new issuance \(e.g.,  in Japan in the 1930s,  US during World War II,  US and UK in the 2000s\).
    - **Increase in debt-financed fiscal spending,  where the Treasury isn’t on the hook for the debt**,  because:
      - The central bank can print money to cover debt payments \(e.g.,  Germany in the 1930s\).
      - The central bank can lend to entities other than the government that will use it for stimulus projects \(e.g.,  lending to development banks in China in 2008\).
    - **Not bothering to go through issuing debt,  and instead giving newly printed money directly to the government to spend.** Past cases have included printing fiat currency \(e.g.,  in Imperial China,  the American Revolution,  the US Civil War,  Germany in the 1930s,  and the UK during World War I\) or debasing hard currency \(Ancient Rome,  Imperial China,  16th-century England\).
    - **Printing money and doing direct cash transfers to households \(i.e.,  “helicopter money”\).** When we refer to “helicopter money, ” we mean directing money into the hands of spenders \(e.g.,  US veterans’ bonuses during the Great Depression,  Imperial China\). How that money is directed could take different forms—the basic variants are either to direct the same amount to everyone or aim for some degree of helping one or more groups over others \(e.g.,  giving money to the poor rather than to the rich\). The money can be provided as a one-off or over time \(perhaps as a universal basic income\). All of these variants can be paired with an incentive to spend it—such as the money disappearing if it’s not spent within a year. The money could also be directed to specific investment accounts \(like retirement,  education,  or accounts earmarked for small-business investments\) targeted toward socially desirable spending/investment. Another potential way to craft the policy is to distribute returns/holdings from QE to households instead of to the government.
    - **Big debt write-down accompanied by big money creation** \(the “year of Jubilee”\) as occurred in Ancient Rome,  the Great Depression,  and Iceland.
  - While I won’t offer opinions on each of these,  I will say that the most effective approaches involve fiscal/monetary coordination,  because that ensures that both the providing and the spending of money will occur.
  - If central banks just give people money \(helicopter money\),  that’s typically less adequate than giving them that money with incentives to spend it.
  - However,  sometimes it is difficult for those who set [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] to coordinate with those who set fiscal policy,  in which case other approaches are used.
Also,  keep in mind that sometimes the policies don’t fall exactly into these categories,  as they have elements of more than one of them. For example,  if the government gives a tax break,  that’s probably not helicopter money,  but it depends on how it’s financed. The government can also spend money directly without a loan financed by the central bank—that is helicopter money through fiscal channels. While central banks influence the costs and availabilities of credit for the economy as whole,  they also have powers to influence the costs and availabilities of credit for targeted parts of the financial system through their regulatory authorities. These policies,  which are called macroprudential policies,  are especially important when it’s desirable to differentiate entities—e.g.,  when it is desirable to restrict credit to an overly indebted area while simultaneously stimulating the rest of the economy,  or when its desirable to provide credit to some targeted entities but not provide it broadly. Macroprudential policies take numerous forms that are valuable in different ways in all seven stages of the big debt cycle.
### Normalization
- **Recovery and Economic Activity**
  - Eventually the system gets back to normal,  though the recovery in economic activity and capital formation tends to be slow,  even during a beautiful deleveraging.
  - It typically takes roughly 5 to 10 years \(hence the term “lost decade”\) for real economic activity to reach its former peak level.
  - And it typically takes longer,  around a decade,  for stock prices to reach former highs,  because it takes a very long time for investors to become comfortable taking the risk of holding equities again \(i.e.,  equity risk premiums are high\).
