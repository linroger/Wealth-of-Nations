# US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (2007–2011)

This section provides a detailed account of the most recent big US debt crisis,  focusing on the period from 2007 to 2011. It was written with reference to the template laid out in the “Archetypal Big Debt Cycle” section but also pays close attention to the enormous number of particulars that occurred during this period. Please note how well the particulars of this case fit with the generalizations described in the template. For example,  when you read about the pooling and securitization of mortgages,  the levering up of investment banks,  and the rapid growth of derivatives that were traded off of regulated exchanges,  see these as new ways of providing leverage outside the protection and regulation of authorities. If you don’t make the connection between the particulars of this case and the generalization,  then you will miss how classic this debt crisis really was.

In providing you with this narrative,  I’m also hoping to convey an up-close feeling of what it was like to go through the experience day-by-day. I encourage you,  at each point,  to think about what you would do a\) as an investor and b\) as a policy maker. I will give you that experience by describing the timeline week-by-week \(and sometimes day-by-day\),  while showing on the sides of each page a “newsfeed” \(primarily *New York Times* articles\). I will also include excerpts from Bridgewater *Daily Observations*,  which show what we were thinking at the time. However,  I will not describe how we moved our investment positions around because how we do that is proprietary. Because there is so much here,  I’ve organized it so that it’s easy to skim by reading just the bold passages.

### The Emerging Bubble: 2004–2006

In the early and healthy part of the typical debt cycle,  debt grows appropriately in line with income growth because the debt is being used to finance activities that produce fast income growth to service debts. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a proxy of whether or not this is happening in a balanced way,  but a rough one because,  at first,  the amount of income a debt will produce is a matter of conjecture. During the 1990 s,  debt-to-GDP ratios increased only a little in the US—and it was a period of relatively strong income growth and low unemployment. The 2001 recession,  which was caused by the tightening of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]],  the bursting of the dot-com bubble,  and the shock of the 9/11 terrorist attacks,  prompted the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates all the way from 6.5 percent to 1 percent. Note how close the US rate was to 0 percent at this point. The big rate cuts stimulated borrowing and spending,  especially by households. This made the 2001 recession a short-lived and shallow one,  but it set the stage for the subsequent bubble period,  which was building most rapidly between 2004 and 2006.

During this period,  US economic conditions looked excellent by most measures. Growth was relatively steady at 3 to 4 percent,  the unemployment rate was below its long term average at between 4 and 5 percent,  and inflation was mostly between 2 and 3.5 percent—a bit higher than desirable,  but not worrisome by traditional measures. At the same time,  the economy was classically entering its “late cycle” phase as capacity constraints began to appear \(e.g.,  the GDP gap was 2 percent and growth in demand was above growth in capacity\). Financial and housing markets were very strong,  financed by debt. The Federal Reserve,  focusing on growth,  inflation,  and the GDP gap more than debt growth,  increased interest rates gradually,  from the lows of 1 percent in 2004 to just over 5 percent in 2006.

That was not enough to slow debt-financed asset appreciation. Over those three years,  the S&P 500 returned 35 percent,  as earnings grew by 32 percent. While these 10 percent per year gains were good,  they were not anywhere near the gains seen during the dot-com bubble of the late 1990 s. With the economy strong,  inflation moderate,  and asset prices appreciating well,  the economy appeared to most people as though it was in **a “Goldilocks” period—not too hot and not too cold**. Debt/GDP grew at an average rate of 12.6 percent during the period. **Typically that’s when bubbles emerge because central banks focus on inflation and growth \(which isn’t a problem\) and they don’t adequately worry about debt-financed purchases of investment assets.**

**Because debt bubbles typically emerge in one or a couple of markets,  they are often hidden beneath the averages and can only be seen by doing pro forma financial stress tests of the significant areas to see how they would hold up and what the knock-on effects of them not holding up would be.**

#### The Housing Market Debt Bubble

In this case,  the most important area in which the bubble was emerging was housing. From 2004 to 2006,  home prices increased around 30 percent and had increased more than 80 percent since 2000,  supported by increasingly liberal lending practices. That was the fastest pace of real housing price increases in a century,  except for the immediate post-WWII period. The price rise was classically self-reinforcing in a way that often creates bubbles. Because most houses are bought with borrowed money,  **home price gains have magnified impacts on equity values**. For example,  if a household used their savings of $50,        000 as a down-payment on a $250,  000 house,  and that house went up in value to $350,  000,  then the household’s investment tripled. This allowed for more borrowing and attracted other buyers and other lenders to finance them,  as this lending was very profitable.

Household debt rose from 85 percent of household disposable income in 2000 to about 120 percent in 2006. Credit standards were lowered,  and while all income quintiles increased their debt substantially over the period,  the biggest percentage increase in debt between 2001 and 2007 was among borrowers in the bottom quintile of income earners. 1 As mortgage lending practices became more liberal,  even non-home buyers ran up debts by borrowing against their home equity—home equity loans and cash-out refinancing totaled $500 billion in 2005,  up five times compared to 1998.2 That pushed overall US debt to over 300 percent of GDP.

**The more prices went up,  the more credit standards were lowered \(even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen\),  but both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying houses on borrowed money to be very profitable.** The credit-fueled buying drove up prices even more,  creating self-reinforcing expectations and drawing in new borrowers/lenders who did not want to miss out on the action. This is classic in bubble periods.

The US housing market was showing **every sign of a classic bubble**. To repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:

1. **1\) Prices are high relative to traditional measures.**
1. **2\) Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these high levels.**
1. **3\) There is broad bullish sentiment.**
1. **4\) Purchases are being financed by high leverage.**
1. **5\) Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases \(e.g.,  built inventory,  contracted forward purchases,  etc.\) to speculate or protect themselves against future price gains.**
1. **6\) New buyers \(i.e.,  those who weren’t previously in the market\) have entered the market.**
1. **7\) Stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] helps inflate the bubble,  and tight policy contributes to its popping.**

All of these were true for the US housing market. Prices rose quickly and were widely expected to continue doing so \(e.g.,  “home flippers” would buy a home,  do some renovations,  and aim to take advantage of rising prices to make a short-term profit\). Homebuilders were ramping up supply that wouldn’t come on line for months or years,  in anticipation of high prices being sustained—new single family home construction doubled between 1995 and 2005.3 As people saw their friends and neighbors becoming richer through homeownership,  more people wanted to buy homes. At the peak of the bubble,  just shy of 8 percent of households were buying a home each year \(around 50 percent more than today\). A *TIME* magazine cover from the summer of 2005 \(roughly the peak\) conveyed the speculative mania,  asking “Will Your House Make You Rich?”

In other words,  there was **leveraging up to bet more aggressively on prices continuing to increase. At the same time,  supplies were increasing as the higher prices encouraged production. Logic should dictate precisely the opposite behavior: those betting on price changes ought to be more inclined to deleverage or sell,  and those who lend to them should be more cautious when these things are happening. However,  this sort of nonsensical thinking is typical in bubbles**.

Just as there was a mania to buy houses,  there was a mania to lend to people to buy houses. The chart on the left on the next page shows aggregate mortgage rates. As a result of the Fed’s easy monetary policies,  they fell to lows in 2003 not seen since the 1950 s,  and stayed near those lows well into the housing bubble. Leveraging up took off in 2003-2007,  even after rates rose by about 1.5 percent in 2005-2007. The chart on the right shows the loan-to-value ratio of new housing loans—higher numbers mean mortgages had smaller down-payments and larger loans. The fast increase to 80 percent was an indication that banks were more eager to loan and willing to make riskier bets. Other signs of housing loan froth were common. Banks often didn’t require borrowers to show proof of income before receiving a mortgage and they pushed adjustable rate mortgages that enticed borrowers with low “teaser” rates now before rates increased later on. “Subprime” mortgages \(e.g.,  riskier ones\) became 20 percent of the market. And as we’ll discuss later in much more detail,  banks were able to package this debt in ways that obscured its underlying risks \(i.e.,  “securitization”\),  helping fuel the easy availability of credit and low interest rates.

For all of the debt build-up and frenzied housing activity,  the economy didn’t overheat and inflation remained moderate,  so the Fed,  looking at the average numbers,  remained unconcerned. **It is typically the case that the worst debt bubbles \(e.g.,  the US in 1929,  Japan in 1989\) are not accompanied by high and rising goods and services inflation,  but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. Typically,  central banks make the mistake of accommodating the debt growth because they are focused on goods and services inflation \(as measured by the CPI\) and/or growth. They are not focused on debt growth,  which is what they are creating,  and on whether the debts will produce the incomes to service them**,  which is what they should be thinking about if they want to prevent bad debt crises.

As you can see in the charts below,  as inflation was mostly between 2 and 3.5 percent—a bit higher than desirable but not worrisome—the Fed kept interest rates low well into the expansion. In fact,  US short-term interest rates were below inflation \(i.e.,  real short-term borrowing costs were negative\) from late 2001 until early 2006. Even when the Fed did begin raising short-term rates in mid-2004,  long-term nominal interest rates remained roughly flat,  and real long-term interest rates declined.

As shown below,  the same was broadly true across the developed world.

For all these reasons,  a global financial bubble was emerging.

In the middle of 2006,  Hank Paulson was confirmed as George W. Bush’s Treasury Secretary. He came to that job from the position of chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs,  which gave him an exposure to the markets that made him generally concerned about the excesses in the financial markets,  so he convened and held regular meetings with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets,  which was comprised of the top members of the Bush economic team and key regulators. 4 The primary benefit of these meetings was that they built close working relationships among the members,  most importantly between Paulson,  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke,  and New York Fed President Tim Geithner,  and their agencies.

**In all financial crises,  the personalities,  capabilities,  and ability to work well together play crucial roles in influencing the outcomes.** In this case,  the most important relationships were between Paulson \(an extroverted former CEO who was used to making bold decisions\),  Bernanke \(an introverted economist who was well-schooled in the Great Depression\),  and Geithner \(a practical operator experienced in the workings of government economic policy making\). Their complementary qualities,  in combination with their often hourly coordination and their shared willingness to be bold and quickly evolve policies based on new learnings,  were critical to their navigating through this crisis.

While all three men had concerns about the “dry tinder and gathering storm,  ” and tried to lean against the excesses that they perceived,  the problems weren’t clear enough to them to prompt them to move quickly or forcefully enough to prevent what was to come. They noted the excesses in the subprime market,  but none saw these excesses spilling over to the overall housing market,  which had not seen a nationwide decline since World War II. Paulson,  however,  was very concerned about the risks posed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \(known as Government Supported Entities,  or GSEs\),  which Larry Summers also highlighted when he was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. That prompted Paulson to get President Bush’s support in the fall of 2006 to begin working on legislation with Barney Frank \(then the ranking minority member of the House Financial Services Committee\) to reform those entities,  though that push didn’t lead to progress until the crisis came to a head in the summer of 2008.5

#### The Emerging Broader-Based Bubble

The broader economy also showed signs of a bubble. Savings rates declined from low to lower and the US aggressively sucked in capital from abroad. US manufacturing employment fell and the US was rapidly losing global export market share to emerging countries,  especially China. However,  the increase in housing-related activity camouflaged this; for instance,  construction employment in support of building houses increasingly financed by debt rose by around 50 percent compared to 1995.

In addition,  a lot of money to fund consumption was also borrowed via mortgages and other types of debt instruments. **High debt growth to fund consumption rather than investment is a red flag,  since consumption doesn’t produce an income,  while investment might.**

Typical of such periods,  a lot of foreign money came pouring in to participate in the bubble,  as reflected in both capital inflows and our [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficit swelling \(to 6 percent of GDP\). A lot of this money was coming from emerging economies such as China,  which were running huge [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surpluses at the time and were choosing to save/invest in US assets. Strong capital inflows allowed US citizens to borrow so they could continue consuming more than they were earning.

Strong demand for US assets abroad also helped keep long-term borrowing costs low even as the Fed began raising short-term interest rates in late 2004.

Many of these flows went to lending that would not produce the income to service the debts. They supported a dynamic that was unsustainable: The savings rate can’t fall indefinitely,  and the wave of lending can’t increase forever. As the debts came due,  there would be cash flow problems. When we ran our pro forma financial numbers,  we could see that when all these flows tapered off,  there would be cash flow problems.

**During this period,  lending increased and became riskier,  and it increasingly occurred outside the regulated and protected banking system. Growth of new ways of lending outside of the normal banking system—often called the “shadow banking” system—is a common feature of bubble periods. Typically,  financial institutions build new channels that get around the more established and better-regulated ones because it is initially advantageous to everyone involved. Fewer regulations make it cheaper to lend,  borrowers get lower rates and easier terms,  and investors get a small boost to returns. Often,  shadow banks are able to make these new debt assets seem safe to investors via guarantees or through the way the assets are combined and packaged. Without having been through a crisis to stress-test them,  it can be hard to tell if they really are as safe as they’re made out to be. Often,  these “innovations” lead to the crisis. That was true in this case.**

In the early-to-mid-2000 s,  a number of new channels for increasing leverage popped up,  and a number of existing less-regulated channels became larger. Many of these were short-term in nature and unregulated and thus were particularly vulnerable. During the bubble,  there were five key components that helped fuel leveraging outside the traditional banking system:

1. 1\) Use of repo agreements and [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. These developed into huge channels through which banks and corporations could borrow over short periods of time. Ben Bernanke notes that “repo liabilities of US broker dealers increased by a factor of 2.5 in the four years before the crisis.”6
1. 2\) Large institutional depositors outside the protected banking system. Demand for Treasury securities,  especially from foreign investors,  outstripped supply,  so there was a shortage of safe assets for investors. This led to demand for substitutes like asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and repo.
1. 3\) Development of [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  a short-term savings vehicle which promised higher returns than bank accounts without much additional risk.
1. 4\) [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] of dollar lending,  leading to the explosion of dollar borrowing and lending outside of US banks.
1. 5\) Securitization of lending,  where banks take their traditional loans \(auto loans,  home loans,  etc.\) and sell them to other investors. This creates a “moral hazard” problem in which banks have an incentive to make risky loans since they can sell them and not bear the consequences \(as long as investors remain willing to buy\).

The US financial regulatory system did not keep pace with these developments. It did not provide adequate regulatory visibility into the shadow banks and markets,  nor did it provide the authorities with the powers they needed to curb their excesses,  though,  as is typical,  that wasn’t apparent at first. Banks and shadow banks at the time were inadequately capitalized and over-leveraged. This meant they didn’t have much cushion and would be exposed to solvency problems in a downturn. In the 1990 s and early 2000 s era of financial liberalization and financial engineering,  regulators were more concerned about the US financial industry staying competitive with London,  which discouraged them from pulling in the reins.

If the debt boom had been financed largely by the banking system,  it would have been dramatically easier to manage and the run easier to contain. It still would have been a bad crisis with a bad recession,  but not as bad as this crisis turned out to be. There would have been less forced selling and a less dangerous margin spiral,  as the FDIC’s systemic risk exemption powers to guarantee liabilities,  combined with deposit insurance and the Fed’s discount window,  would have had more power and reach.

So it was not just low interest rates that fueled the bubble,  but rather a combination of easy money,  lax regulation,  and risky financial innovations. As the Fed was looking at inflation and not debt growth when setting interest rates,  and as policy makers allowed the lax regulation of shadow lending channels to continue,  the bubble was allowed to grow.

**Borrowers and lenders had severe asset/liability mismatches,  which left them especially vulnerable in a downturn. This is a classic ingredient of a severe debt crisis. Most commonly these mismatches come in the following forms:**

1. **1\) Borrowing short-term and lending long-term,  leaving them to be squeezed when those who lent to them short-term don’t want to lend to them anymore or only want to lend to them at interest rates much higher than what they are earning on the loans they have already made.**
1. **2\) Lending to risky borrowers who will pay higher interest rates than they borrowed at in order to collect the credit spread—until the default rates pick up to a level greater than the credit spread.**
1. **3\) Borrowing in one currency and lending/investing in another. When the currency they borrowed in rises,  it forces borrowers to pay back the loan at a higher exchange rate or a higher interest rate than they can manage.**

All these things happened during this bubble,  which made these financial intermediaries and those who trusted them with their money very vulnerable to runs and credit problems.

One classic asset/liability mismatch that developed occurred via European banks actively borrowing dollars with short-term debt and then lending them to the world. When dollar credit tightened in the summer of 2007,  these banks lost access to funding from the US money markets and became transmitters of contagion around the world.

Still,  the economy continued to grow above potential. The GDP gap rose to 3 percent,  while inflation rose to 3.7 percent. The Fed continued to tighten to bring the nominal short rate to 5.25 percent and the real short rate to 1.5 percent in 2007.

By 2007,  I was sure that we were in a bubble because it had all the classic signs previously described,  plus when we did cash flow projections for companies and financial institutions,  we suspected that they would not be able to secure the amount of new lending they needed to allow them to roll over their debts that were coming due,  while at the same time increasing their borrowing to sustain what they were doing. Without that new lending,  there would be a debt crisis. We regularly reported our thinking and estimates to policy makers,  giving them the choice of believing our numbers so that they could be better prepared,  or correcting our numbers so that we could see where we were wrong. They typically took the research in without comment but with questions.

### ****The Top: 2007

#### The First Half of 2007

Keep in mind that up until this time,  hardly anyone was concerned about hardly anything because both the markets and the economy were doing great. Stocks were reaching new highs,  the job market remained strong,  retail sales were strong,  and so was consumer sentiment.

However the housing market and its most aggressive financers began to show some cracks. As the SEC wrote in a memo on January 4,  “\[t\]here is a broad recognition that,  with the refinancing and real estate booms over,  the business model of many of the smaller subprime originators is no longer viable.”7

Markets were flatter between February and March,  and overall market volatility was pretty low and priced to stay that way. Credit spreads,  a measure of the perception of the risk of lending to private companies,  were relatively low compared to historical norms. In other words,  the market was tranquil and priced to stay that way.

Problems emanating out of subprime mortgage lenders—those that focused on mortgages for less credit-worthy borrowers—continued to grow,  with some facing considerable losses,  but they did not affect the broader economy and markets. Still,  bigger banks were starting to report a rise in bad mortgage debts. We summarized the situation \(in our March 13 *Daily Observations*\) as follows:

**\(BDO\) March 13: Subprime Mortgage Fallout**

Subprime mortgages have been grabbing the headlines,  with several of the larger subprime mortgage lenders teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. The story of how the subprime mortgage sector is blowing up even with a relatively strong economy relates closely to the liquidity that is bubbling up in markets around the world. **Over the last few years,  investment banks have been hard at work creating fancy new products where they can package up a bunch of assets and sell the package for more than the sum of the parts** \(CDOs,  CMOs,  synthetic CDOs,  etc.\). They do this by tranching them up and getting the ratings agencies to rate the best slice AAA,  the next slice AA,  and so on. This financial “innovation” makes everyone happy: insurance companies get an AAA-rated bond that yields a few basis points more than their other AAA options,  and so on down the line. Often hedge funds end up with the bottom piece,  and that makes them happy because they get a lot of leverage/volatility. **This innovation opens up a source of credit to many risky borrowers \(not just households\) who previously would have had trouble accessing credit markets. The explosion in subprime mortgages is closely related to this new source of credit.** Originators paid less and less attention to underwriting standards because they were just going to hand off the mortgages to the investment banks. The investment banks were eager to package them up and sell them to investors. The investors were getting 5 bps more yield for the same credit rating. Lending standards slipped to absurdly low levels,  and then a small up-tick in delinquencies caused the banks to refuse to buy the loans and the originators to be stuck with the losses.

…The thing that is really hammering the subprime lenders is “early payment defaults.” The agreements with the investment banks who bought the subprime loans contained provisions that the lender would have to buy back the loans if the borrower missed one of the first few payments. Without fraud,  it is very rare for a borrower to miss the first payment on a mortgage. In December,  New Century,  the second biggest subprime lender in 2006,  disclosed that borrowers had failed to make the first payment on fully 2.5% of their loans. When the banks/investors demanded New Century buy back these loans,  New Century couldn’t come up with the cash. Several dozen smaller subprime lenders have gone bust this way in the last few months,  although New Century is the biggest.

Most people thought that these troubles in one corner of the financial markets would not cause meaningful contagion elsewhere. On March 28,  Chairman Bernanke said in Congressional testimony that “the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained.”8 I had a similar assessment at the time,  though I was more concerned about the extent of leverage and tightening going on in this bubble.

The US stock market continued to rally through April and May,  hitting new records. The shaded portion of the chart shows the rally in the first half of the year.

In mid-June,  10-year Treasury yields hit 5.3 percent \(the highest point since 2002\),  and in mid-July,  the 90-day T-bill rate hit 5 percent,  meaning the yield curve was very flat. That was the [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] peak because of what came next.

**As interest rates rise,  so do debt service payments \(both on new items bought on credit,  as well as on previously acquired credit that was financed with variable rate debt\). This discourages additional borrowing \(as credit becomes more expensive\) and reduces disposable income \(as more money is spent on debt service\). Because people borrow less and have less money left over to spend,  spending slows,  and since one person’s spending is another person’s income,  incomes drop,  and so on and so forth. When people spend less,  prices go down,  and economic activity decreases.**

**Simultaneously,  as short-term interest rates rise and the yield curve flattens or inverts,  liquidity declines,  and the return on holding short duration assets \(such as cash\) increases as their yields rise. As these assets become relatively more attractive to hold in relation to longer duration financial assets \(such as bonds,  equities,  and real estate\),  as well as those assets with lower grade credit ratings \(as the spread to these assets declines\),  money moves out of financial assets,  causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices in turn create negative wealth effects,  which feed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes.**

**The tightening popped the bubble.** As interest rates rose,  home prices began to decline,  since debt service payments on new homes would be higher,  and interest payments on many existing mortgages rose quickly because many subprime borrowers had taken out adjustable rate mortgages \(ARMs\). As interest rates rose,  so did their debt service payments. By June,  these tightening pressures flowed through to the first broad sign of financial distress: rising foreclosures and delinquencies started to translate into meaningful losses for bigger banks. In mid-June,  two hedge funds run out of the investment bank Bear Stearns that invested in subprime mortgage-backed securities \(MBS\)—one of them leveraged about 20:19—faced growing losses and a wave of investor redemptions. That required them to do a fire-sale of $3.6 billion of the securities,         a large amount for the market. 10 The leveraged financial buying shifted into deleveraging selling. As the prices of securities they held fell,         the hedge funds faced huge losses and forced liquidations. In the end,         Bear Stearns promised a $3.2 billion loan to bail out one of the funds \(later reduced to $1.6 billion\),  and other banks that seized collateral from the hedge funds cooperated to ensure that the market remained stable \(e.g.,  not selling more subprime MBS\). The funds would eventually be wiped out. These were relatively small funds,  and the initial reverberations were limited.

#### ****The Summer of 2007

Economic growth remained healthy and US equity markets hit new highs in mid-July. The most prominent question was whether the Fed’s next move would be to tighten because of inflation concerns,  or ease because of housing concerns.

Stress in the housing market was gradually building. The indices of subprime MBS \(called the ABX indices\) continued to see big price declines \(even the AAA bonds,  which were likely seen as “riskless” when purchased,  fell around 5 percent\),  and some of the mortgage lenders started reporting increasing numbers of borrowers missing loan payments. One large mortgage lender looked to be closer to bankruptcy,  and a small German bank exposed to mortgage loans faced big losses and ended up needing to be acquired by Germany’s state bank. New home sales were falling very quickly. As this news emerged,  the markets sold off a bit \(ending July down 6 percent from the peak\).

I expected this debt crisis to be self-reinforcing because of the impact that mark-to-market accounting and high leverage would have on lenders. **Debt crises and downturns are self-reinforcing behaviors because as losses occur,  both lenders and borrowers are less able to lend and borrow,  which worsens conditions. For example,  when losses occur,  one’s capital declines,  and because there are limits to how much one can hold in assets relative to one’s capital,  that means assets have to be sold,  or the buying of assets has to be curtailed. That in turn makes asset prices and lending weaker,  producing more losses and reinforcing the cycle further.** Because we could get very detailed financial information on banks that allowed us to know their exposures,  we could estimate what the values and losses on their positions would be by knowing the pricing of analogous liquid assets. As a result,  we constantly did our mark-to-market stress tests,  which showed us that the financial sector and those dependent on it were incurring losses before they reported them. We could also get detailed financial information on public companies and our pro forma financial projections showed that many were facing debt squeezes.

Here is what I wrote to our clients and policy makers at the time.

**\(BDO\) July 26: Is This the Big One?**

You know our view about the crazy lending and leveraging practices going on,  creating a pervasive fragility in the financial system,  leading us to believe that interest rates will rise until there is a cracking of the financial system,  at which time everything will reverse \(i.e. there will be a move to focusing on fear from focusing on greed,  volatilities will increase,  and carry and credit spreads will blow out\). We had \(and now have\) no idea exactly when this will occur and if what’s happening now is the big one. We just know that 1\) we want to avoid or fade this lunacy and 2\) no one knows how this financial market contagion will play out.

How it will play out is a function of who is carrying what positions and how these positions and players knock up against each other. **A few months ago we undertook an extensive study to see which market players held what positions,  especially via the derivatives markets.** So we read all the studies by government overseers and financial intermediaries,  we gathered and examined all the data we could obtain,  and we delved into 10-K reports of financial intermediaries. **And we concluded that no one has a clue. That is because one can only vaguely examine these exposures one level deep.** In other words,  while it is easy to see some parties’ exposures \(particularly those of regulated financial intermediaries\),  it is impossible to see who is carrying these and other positions in order to ascertain the net positions of the important parties. For example,  the dealers who are at the epicenter of this know who their counterparties are,  but they don’t know their counterparties’ total positions. But we do know that these exposures have grown rapidly \(about four times as large as five years ago\) and are huge \(about $400 trillion\).

At the time,  growth still looked good as the debt and tightening conditions hadn’t yet passed through to the economy. On July 31,  we wrote: “Tuesday’s slew of stats continued to convey a picture that the real economy was just fine heading into the recent market action,  ” but we were extremely concerned that the Fed was too sanguine. In its August 7 [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] statement,  the Fed said: “Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks,  credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses,  and the housing correction is ongoing. Nevertheless,  the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters,  supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.”

In early August 2007,  the mortgage market began to seriously unravel. On August 9,  BNP Paribas,  France’s largest bank and one of the largest in the world by assets,  froze $2.2 billion worth of investments in three of its funds because its holdings in US subprime mortgages had exposed it to big losses. Banks in Europe became more nervous about lending to each other,  prompting the European Central Bank \(ECB\) to inject 95 billion euros into the banking system to get rates back to the ECB’s target,  and another 61 billion the next day. The US also saw a squeeze in safe Treasury bills and higher yields on riskier [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and interbank lending rates. Money market funds,  the main holders of asset-backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  saw hits to their asset values and required assistance from their sponsors,  banks,  and fund families in order to avoid “breaking the buck.” \(By “breaking the buck” I mean falling in value below the amount deposited,  which is something depositors assumed would never happen but did.\)

The unraveling could be seen in interbank markets. The following chart shows a classic measure of interbank stress,  the TED spread,  in which a higher number means banks are demanding a higher interest rate to compensate for the risks of lending to each other. It was clear that the top in the debt cycle was being made.

Here is what I wrote to clients and policy makers the next day:

**\(BDO\) August 10: This Is the Big One**

By that,  we mean that this is the financial market unraveling that we’ve been expecting—the one in which there is an unwinding of widely held,  irresponsibly created positions that occurred as a result of financial middlemen pressing to invest for high returns the immense amount of liquidity that has been flooding the financial system—i.e.,  another 1998 or 1994 \(which occurred for the same reasons\),  just bigger. I want to reemphasize that what we know about this is less than what we don’t know because how exactly the cards will fall will depend on who is holding what positions and how they all knock on with each other. Despite us doing an awful lot of work to try to get this all mapped out over the last two years,  we couldn’t map this out to an extent that’s worth much because our knowledge of these positions is so imprecise and the array of possible permutations is so wide that forecasting where we will be in a couple of weeks is a bit like predicting how a hurricane will run its course two weeks ahead. We are also highly confident that others,  including the key regulators \(who have the best windows in\),  can’t give you a forecast that’s much more reliable,  so they are reacting to events. However,  having seen this dynamic \(i.e.,  a self-reinforcing panic move away from high risk investments to low risk investments in which badly positioned leveraged players get squeezed\) many times before \(1998 is the most recent case\),  we are pretty confident we know some things about how it will play out. This will run through the system with the speed of a hurricane \(over the next four to six months\),  and it will leave weaker financial credits dead or damaged and stronger financial credits in the catbird seat…

…We have a game-plan \(developed over many years\) that we have confidence in because we planned for times like this,  but for safety’s sake,  we are checking that all the hatches are battened down and that the expensive radar we’ve developed is working well. That game-plan doesn’t just pertain to our investment strategy; it includes our strategy for handling counterparty risks and transactions costs in an environment of extreme risk-aversion and illiquidity.

What I was referring to as a game plan for this is what we called a “Depression gauge.” Because big debt crises and depressions had happened many times before and we had the template explained in this study,  we had created this gauge as a simple algorithm based on the proximity of interest rates to 0 percent,  a few measures of debt vulnerability,  and indications of the beginning of debt deleveraging that would lead us to change our overall portfolio and risk controls \(including our counterparty risks\).

Less than a week later,  news emerged that Countrywide,  the US’s largest mortgage issuer,  had exhausted its credit line,  and was at risk of declaring bankruptcy. While notable because it was a canary in the coal mine,  Countrywide was not a systemically important financial institution.

Over the next several days,  stocks fell sharply and yields on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] spiked. The Bank of Japan,  the ECB,  and the Fed all responded to the market stress by providing liquidity to banks. The worst of the stock sell-off ended when the Fed surprisingly cut interest rates by 0.5 percent—doing so between its regularly scheduled meetings—an unusual move. Chairman Bernanke said he would do more if needed. 11 And Bank of America shored up Countrywide by investing $2 billion in exchange for a large stake in the company. These moves alleviated most of the funding strains in the market,  and equities recovered a bit. Below is a chart of the stock market up until that time. Note that it was still near its highs.

Coming out of this episode,  most policy makers and investors thought that the problems in the risky part of the mortgage market would be contained,  so the flow-through to the real economy wouldn’t be substantial. Based on our calculations,  we saw it differently and wrote: “the day of reckoning will be pushed forward,  probably to when there is a big tightening by the Fed or a big turndown in the economy.”

**Why Banks and Investors Were So Exposed to Risky Mortgage Securities** Why were investors,  banks,  rating agencies and policy makers misled into thinking mortgage securities were less risky than they actually were? A key reason is the way risk is analyzed. Consider the conventional way investors think about risk. At the time,  Value at Risk \(VAR\),  which is a measure of recent volatility in markets and portfolios,  was commonly used by investment firms and commercial banks to determine the likely magnitude and occurrence of losses. It typically uses recent volatility as the main input to how much risk \(i.e.,  what size positions\) one could comfortably take. As a simplifying illustration,  imagine an investor that never wants to lose more than 20 percent. If the most that a subprime mortgage has ever lost in a month is 5 percent,  then investors might plug that 5 percent number into a model that then says its “safe” for them to borrow until they own three times leveraged subprime.

This way of thinking about risk caused many investors to increase their exposures beyond what would normally be seen as prudent. They looked at the **recent volatility in their VAR calculations,  and by and large expected it to continue moving forward. This is human nature and it was dumb because past volatility and past correlations aren’t reliable forecasts of future risks.** But it was very profitable. In fact,  when we were cutting back on our positions,  our clients urged us to increase them because our VAR was low. We explained why we didn’t do that. Extrapolating current conditions forward and imagining that they will be just a slightly different version of today is to us bad relative to considering the true range of possibilities going forward. If anything,  I believe that one should bet on the opposite of what happened lately,  because boring years tend to sow the seeds of future instability,  as well as making the next downturn worse. **That’s because low volatility and benign VAR estimates encourage increased leverage.** At the time,  some [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratios]] were nearing 100:1. To me,  leverage is a much better indicator of future volatility than VAR.

In 2007,  many banks and investors were heavily exposed to subprime mortgages,  since the instruments had not yet had a loss cycle or experienced much volatility. VAR was also self-reinforcing on the down side,  because increased market volatility at the peak of the crisis in 2008 made their statistical riskiness look even higher,  causing even more selling.

#### The Fall of 2007

With stocks on the rebound after the bumpy summer,  policy makers started to consider how they should approach the problems emanating from the mortgage market over the longer term.

Beginning in the fall of 2006,  Paulson and the Treasury had begun working with Barney Frank and the House Financial Services Committee to reform Fannie and Freddie. They focused on curbing the excesses and increasing the authority of the regulator. A bill passed the House in the spring of 2007 but,  stalled in the Senate. Due to significant political opposition,  there was no possibility of getting Federal funding to modify mortgages for struggling homeowners. So the Bush Treasury worked with lenders,  mortgage servicers,  and counselors to motivate these private sector institutions to modify and restructure mortgages with some modest but meaningful success. Also,  the Treasury began working with the Fed to jointly develop what they dubbed as the “break the glass” option to go to Congress and get the authority to purchase illiquid mortgage securities if and when this became politically feasible. This was the forerunner of what would become the Troubled Asset Relief Program,  or TARP.

The Fed signaled its willingness to ease [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] to mitigate any spillover effects the mortgage-related stress might have on the broader economy. Although the data and news showed a steady deterioration in fundamentals,  most market participants believed that policy makers would be able to make it through smoothly.

Bernanke began a push within the Fed \(in close collaboration with Hank Paulson and the Treasury staff\) toward what they dubbed “blue-sky thinking”—unrestricted brainstorming in anticipation of the possibility that conventional policy easing might not be enough. 12 **As financial contagion spreads beyond the banking sector,  increasing numbers of players in the real economy can no longer access credit through the usual channels.** In what would become a crucial pillar of the Fed’s response to the crisis,  **Bernanke considered the possibility of the Fed lending directly to a broader range of counterparties than just depository institutions.** This would be a big,  bold move,  and so unprecedented that Bernanke had to check the rulebook to see if it was allowed. The provision of the Federal Reserve Act that authorized such lending—Section 13\(3\)—hadn’t been invoked since the Great Depression,  but it was still valid. **Knowing which needed actions in a crisis are permitted \(or not permitted\) by law and how to have them approved is a classic challenge in democracies with rigid regulations and robust checks and balances systems.**

Worsening circumstances led to expectations for a rate cut from the Fed. Still,  there were reasons to ease and reasons not to ease. Two considerations especially weighed against easing. The first concerned inflation: the dollar had been steadily weakening and oil prices steadily rising. Easing would contribute to dollar weakness,  higher oil prices,  and higher inflation. The other consideration was that the problems all stemmed from wrongheaded speculation,  and anything that the Fed did to ameliorate the problems of those speculators would only encourage them to take excessive risks again in the future.

This notion of “moral hazard” was one that the Fed \(and Treasury\) would have to wrestle with many times throughout the crisis. **How the “moral hazard” question is dealt with during big debt crises is one of the biggest determinants of how these crises turn out.** Because undisciplined lending and borrowing was the cause of crisis,  it is natural to want to let those who were responsible experience the consequences of their actions,  and to impose lots of discipline by tightening lending and borrowing. But that’s like putting someone who just suffered a heart attack because they’re too fat straight on a diet and a treadmill. At such times,  **above all else,  the most important thing is to provide life-blood \(i.e.,  stimulants\) to keep the systemically important parts of the system alive.** It is dangerous to try to be overly precise in getting the right balance between \(a\) letting those who borrowed and lent badly experience the consequences of their actions and \(b\) providing judicious amounts of liquidity/lending to help rectify the severity of the contraction. It is far better to err on the side of providing too much than to provide too little. Unlike in the Great Depression,  when the Fed allowed banks to fail en masse,  the Fed took the view that although it would be good to minimize moral hazard when possible,  its top priority had to be saving the economy.

Tim Geithner,  who was the president of the New York Fed at the time,  shared my thinking. He believed the moral hazard framework was the wrong way to think about policy during a financial crisis because policy needs to be very aggressive in taking out catastrophic risk,  and one can’t move slowly or precisely. 13 That has proven true time and time again. Providing plenty of liquidity during a liquidity crisis leaves the government open to less risk and leaves the system healthier. In contrast,  the moral hazard framework leads people to believe that if you let things burn,  the government will assume less risk. In reality,  if you let everything burn,  the government will end up taking on all of the risk,  as it will have to nationalize the system in a much more costly and damaging way.

In the end,  policy makers responded to the crisis by guaranteeing almost everything,  explicitly or implicitly,  and carrying out a dramatic,  explicit injection of cash. Geithner told me that the interesting thing about this approach was that instead of losing 5 to 10 percent of GDP on the cost of the financial rescue,  we actually earned something like 2 percent of GDP,  depending on how you measure it. That’s a dramatic outlier in the history of financial crises,  and Geithner credits it to the Fed and Treasury’s very aggressive response and their willingness to put moral hazard concerns aside. I agree.

On September 18,  2007,  the Fed cut rates by 0.5 percent,  compared to the 0.25 percent expected by the market. As Bernanke put it,  “the hawks and doves flocked together.”14 The Fed’s bigger-than-expected move sparked a stock market rally that the *New York Times* described as “ecstatic,  ” which brought the S&P 500 back to within 2 percent of its all-time high.

More important than the stimulation that would come from the Fed’s interest rate cuts was the message this sent the markets—that the Fed was willing to take decisive action as needed to help contain the problems that had caused the market turmoil in August. At the same time,  it was clear to those who ran the numbers that **easing wouldn’t solve the more fundamental problems of financial intermediaries,  debtors,  and creditors holding more debt assets and liabilities than could be serviced**.

The banks’ \(and investment banks’\) balance sheet and liquidity problems were on both the asset side and the liability side. On the asset side,  the problems stemmed from the banks’ ownership of subprime mortgages through securitizations. On the liability side,  the banks had become dependent on risky sources of funding. Banks had always relied on short-term funding,  but historically this had consisted largely of deposits,  which could be controlled with guarantees. Savers can always pull their deposits,  and widespread fears about bank solvency had led them to do just that in the Great Depression. This led to the founding of the FDIC in 1933,  which dealt with this problem by insuring bank deposits \(up to a certain amount\). That mostly eliminated the incentives the depositors had to flee,  because even if a bank failed,  their deposits would be protected.

But by relying on what was known as “short-term wholesale funding,  ” modern banks had set themselves up for a similar situation to what banks had experienced between 1930 and 1933. Short-term wholesale funding took a variety of forms,  but at its core,  it was a lot like an uninsured deposit—meaning the depositor had a big incentive to pull it from the bank at the first sign of trouble.

Banks and investment banks had also gotten themselves into trouble by virtue of their central role in what we’ll call the “securitization machine.” **At its heart,  the securitization machine started with the issuance of risky mortgages and ended with the sale of very safe bonds to institutional investors.** Lots of players were involved,  but these financial intermediaries played a major role. Basically a mortgage lender would make the loans and sell them to a bank,  which would package them up into a bundle of say 1,  000 loans. The combined cash flows of these 1,  000 loans were thought to be much safer than any individual loan because they benefited from diversification—if one borrower couldn’t repay their mortgage,  that might create a loss on one loan,  but that wouldn’t affect the ability of the other 999 borrowers to repay their loans. On average,  most borrowers had historically been able to repay their mortgage loans,  so the result of the packaging was \(supposedly\) to reduce the overall risk profile of the loans.

The bank would then slice up the total cash flows from the 1,  000 loans and distribute them in chunks: 70 to 80 percent would become a super-safe AAA-rated bond,  another 10 to 15 percent might become a slightly riskier but still pretty safe AA-rated bond,  5 to 10 percent would become a BBB-rated bond,  and some small unrated residual \(the “first-loss” piece\) would take the losses of the first few borrowers that might default. **This was a classic case of data-mining history rather than using sound logic to assess risk. People were leveraging themselves up by betting that they were safe,  because the thing they were betting against had never happened before.** When the bet went wrong,  the self-reinforcing dynamic on the upside shifted to a self-reinforcing dynamic on the downside.

Banks would sell off whatever bonds they could to investors,  typically retaining the first-loss piece in order to make the deal work. They carried bonds as inventory \(sometimes with the intention of eventually selling them; other times to hold the exposure for return\). This worked,  which encouraged them to do it more until it didn’t work. To varying degrees,  the banks were holding large inventories of these bonds when demand dried up in the third quarter of 2007.

That happened when the write-downs due to mark-to-market accounting began. Bear Stearns saw its 3 Q 07 earnings drop by 61 percent due to losses related to the hedge funds that had blown up and other exposures it had to subprime mortgages. Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers took 7 percent and 3 percent hits to earnings,  respectively \(relatively small losses\). Citigroup,  UBS,  and Merrill Lynch followed suit,  reporting meaningful but manageable losses. Citigroup initially wrote down the largest loss,  at $5.9 billion \(keep that number in mind in comparison to the numbers later in our story\).

Around this time \(fall 2007\) we started running our own loss estimates and “stress tests” of the financial system—gathering balance sheet data on banks to see their assets and liabilities,  and applying liquid market prices as proxies to their illiquid holdings to estimate what they would have to report long before they would have to report it. This was invaluable in anticipating what was going to happen. On October 9,  2007,  the S&P 500 closed at its all-time high. That high in stocks wouldn’t be reached again until 2013.

It was clear to most people in the business that banks had a problem with subprime mortgages,  though it wasn’t yet clear to them that the whole economy had a major debt problem. To help alleviate the situation and build confidence,  a number of major banks proposed joining forces and creating a fund that would aim to raise $75-100 billion for buying distressed subprime mortgage securities. Like other observers,  we viewed it as a natural response to the credit crunch that would help to alleviate the risk of contagion. However,  by the end of the year,  efforts to establish this fund had been abandoned,  as the collaborating banks decided that it was “not needed at this time.”15

Meanwhile,  despite optimism at home,  the credit crunch spread from the US to Europe through two main mechanisms. The first was that some European banks \(most notably the British bank [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]\) had come to rely on money markets for short-term wholesale funding. When that source of funding began to dry up in the summer of 2007,  [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]] experienced a classic “run,  ” with depositors lining up to withdraw funds for three straight days in the middle of September. 16 The UK had a similar deposit insurance scheme as the US,  but with a lower cap on insured deposits \(£35,  000\). To stem the run,  the British government guaranteed all of [[Reflections On Modern Bank Runs a Case Study of Northern Rock|Northern Rock]]’s deposits.

The second mechanism resulted from the investments that many European banks had made in subprime securitizations. The largest ones,  like UBS and Deutsche Bank,  owned stakes in securitizations as a corollary to their role in producing the securitizations themselves. Many smaller banks had simply wanted a piece of the action. After all,  many slices of subprime securitizations had been rated AAA,  meaning that rating agencies had stamped them as having extremely low risk. During previous periods of stress,  such as the savings and loan crisis of the 1980 s and the dot-com bubble of the early 2000 s,  [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] rated AAA had a default rate of 0 percent,  according to Standard & Poor’s,  one of the big three rating agencies. 17 Plus,  the subprime securitizations rated AAA offered a premium \(though in hindsight,  one that was far too small,  given the level of risk\) relative to [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]] of the same rating.

As our risk measures of the banks,  investment banks,  and broker dealers that we dealt with changed,  we shifted our exposures from the riskier ones to safer ones,  and also moved into safer assets.

In late October,  2007,  sentiment began to turn for the worse as predictions of the overall losses on subprime securitizations started to increase. US stock prices suffered a steep 2.6 percent decline on October 19,  after JPMorgan posted a $2 billion write-down and Bank of America announced much weaker-than-expected earnings.

It was becoming clear that losses on subprime mortgages were going to be a bigger problem than previously thought for the banks,  but it wasn’t yet clear just how severely the stress in the housing market was going to hit US households,  whose consumption represents the bulk of US GDP \(around 70 percent\). Here’s what we wrote about it at the time:

**\(BDO\) October 30: Falling Home Prices and Wealth**

The weakening housing market affects the US economy in a number of ways ranging from falling construction,  to falling expenditures on housing-related items,  to less cash used from mortgage borrowing on non-housing-related consumption,  to falling wealth. As we have described previously,  the drop in financing alone \(money borrowed against houses to spend on other things\) made up over 3% at the peak and will likely be negative soon \(and will have to be made up some other way if consumption growth is to remain where it is\) while the decline in construction at a 20% annual pace is translating to about a 1% drag on real growth…Real estate assets as % GDP peaked at 167%,  so the drop in wealth will equal about 50% of GDP.

The impact on households was showing up in a variety of statistics: rising delinquencies on mortgages,  slowing purchases of new and existing homes,  slowing retail sales growth,  *etc.* Policy makers understood that the situation was about to get worse: the roughly two million of those borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages we discussed earlier were scheduled to have their teaser rates expire in 2008,  and thus were about to see their interest costs jump. Treasury Secretary Paulson announced various measures to help modify mortgages to extend teaser rates for stressed borrowers,  but stopped short of putting taxpayer money behind the plan,  limiting its potential impact.

Meanwhile,  at Bridgewater,  we completed our first look loss estimates and stress test by examining the balance sheet data of banks. For us,  the exercise was so eye-opening that on November 21 we released what we called a “Special Report,  ” excerpted here:

**Bridgewater Special Report:**

**What We Think Will Be Contained & What We Think Won’t Be Contained**

- Some credit problems have surfaced and some haven’t.
- We believe that the credit problems that have surfaced \(i.e.,  the subprime/SIV problems\) will spread \(i.e.,  there will be a contagion\) but they will be contained \(i.e.,  won’t spread beyond being manageable and won’t sink the economy,  though they will weaken it\). That is because their size is manageable,  their ownership is dispersed,  and the demand to acquire these positions from buyers of distressed securities is relatively large because of the current environment of plentiful global liquidity. Management of this crisis will of course require wise decision-making and coordination of central banks,  finance ministries,  legislators and financial institutions in much the same way as management of past financial crises required these. We expect this wise management and coordinated decision-making,  especially by central banks and finance ministries,  because we have relatively high regard for the people involved and because the actions that are appropriate are relatively clear.
- We also “believe” that the credit problems that lie beneath the surface are much larger and more threatening than the ones that have surfaced. These latent credit problems are the result of a\) there being an enormous amount of liquidity that is looking to be invested and b\) investors increasingly and imprudently reaching for higher returns via structured,  levered,  illiquid,  risky investments. Like subprime and other credit crunch problems before they surfaced,  we and others \(including government regulators\) do not adequately understand these exposures,  so it is difficult to say for sure where the problems lie or to know how they will behave individually and in interaction with each other in a stressful environment. What we do know is that these exposures have grown exponentially,  are very large,  and are based on many imprudent,  sometimes seemingly nonsensical strategies. We also believe that if these problems surface,  containing them will be challenging…
- Though we do not believe that the “below the surface problems” will come to the surface any time soon,  we also want to make sure that we have no or minimal exposures to,  and ample protections against,  widening credit and liquidity spreads,  declining equities,  undoing carry trades,  increasing volatility and deteriorating counterparties.
- When we include all of the credit crunch related exposures that exist for all entities,  we think that the mark-to-market losses as of today are in the $420 billion range globally,  which represents about 1% of global GDP… we estimate their unrealized losses to be much larger than their realized losses so we expect much larger write-downs to come.

So we ran the numbers and were extremely concerned by both what we knew and what we didn’t know. The biggest unknowns,  even after we ran the numbers on potential bank losses \(which were enormous\),  were how these losses might ripple through the market,  especially via the derivative markets. Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is determined by the value of some underlying asset,  rate,  index,  or even event. Unlike stocks or bonds,  they are not used to raise money for spending or investment. Instead,  they are primarily instruments for hedging risks and for speculating on changes in prices. They are made through private contracts rather than on exchanges and are unregulated. They were also enormous and opaque to everyone,  so no one could get their heads around the exposures that existed—and nobody could really know how the bank and nonbank lender losses would cascade.

More specifically,  in the three decades leading up to the crisis,  a huge market in over-the-counter derivative contracts \(i.e.,  those not traded on regulated exchanges\) developed. In December 2000,  Congress clarified that as long as these over-the-counter contracts \(OTC\) were between “sophisticated parties,  ” they did not have to be regulated as futures or securities—effectively shielding OTC derivatives from virtually all oversight. 18 Over the next seven years,  the OTC market grew quickly. By June 2008,  the notional value of these contracts was $672.6 trillion.

A key derivative that would play a major role in the financial crisis was the credit default swap \(CDS\). A CDS plays a role that is similar to insurance. When an issuer sells a CDS,  they promise to insure the buyer against potential defaults from a particular exposure \(such as defaults creating losses from mortgage-backed securities\) in exchange for a regular stream of payments. CDS’s allow purchasers of mortgage-backed securities \(and other assets\) to transfer default risk to the party selling the CDS. AIG,  for instance,  sold lots of this “insurance,  ” but only kept very small reserves against it—meaning they didn’t have the capacity to pay out if there were large losses.

As noted earlier,  I shared my concerns with the Treasury and White House,  but they thought that the picture I was painting was implausible because nothing like that had happened in their lifetimes. While I am hesitant to speak about policy makers in general because there are so many differences in what they are like individually and the different seats they sit in \(e.g.,  in the Treasury,  White House,  Congress,  SEC,  etc.\),  I must say that they are much more reactive than proactive,  which is understandable because,  unlike investors,  they are not in the business of having to bet against the consensus and be right,  and they operate within political systems that don’t act until there is a broad consensus that there is an intolerable problem. As a result,  policy makers generally don’t act decisively until a crisis is on top of them.

As 2007 came to an end,  the S&P 500 was down 6 percent from its October peak,  but in positive territory for the year as a whole. December’s biggest market sell-off came on a day that the Fed lowered interest rates by 0.25 percent—even though rate cuts ordinarily help stocks—since it was less than the 0.5 percent cut that the markets were expecting. Bond yields had declined more sharply,  from yields around 5 percent back in June before the credit crunch began to around 4 percent at the end of the year. The dollar index was down 8.6 percent over the year. Oil,  meanwhile,  was up a whopping 55 percent to $96,  just a hair beneath its all-time high.

### ****Depression: 2008

#### January–February 2008

At the beginning of the year,  cracks began to appear in the economy and the markets. US manufacturing,  retail sales,  and employment reports were relatively poor. Then came the inevitable announcements of big write downs \(i.e.,  losses\) at Citigroup \($22.2 billion\) and Merrill Lynch \($14.1 billion\),  as well as the downgrade of Ambac and MBIA,  two bond insurers which had collectively guaranteed about $1 trillion worth of debt and had big exposure to subprime mortgage securities. These repeated losses were due to a combination of previous market declines in their holdings and accounting rules requiring them to be marked to the market and passed through their income statements and balance sheets. By January 20,  the S&P 500 was down about 10 percent. Global equity markets were in even worse shape and fell even more,  as shown in the chart below,  left.

Witnessing all this,  the Fed realized that it needed to act. Bernanke told the Federal Open Market Committee that although it wasn’t the Fed’s job to prevent sharp stock market declines,  events seemed to “reflect a growing belief that the United States is in for a deep and protracted recession.”19 Emphasizing the need for immediate action,  he said “we are facing,  potentially,  a broad crisis. We can no longer temporize. We have to address this…we have to try to get it under control. If we can’t do that,  then we are just going to lose control of the whole situation.”20

Following an emergency meeting on January 22,  the Fed cut rates by 75 basis points \(i.e.,  0.75 percent\) to 3.5 percent,  citing a “weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth.” A week later,  the Fed cut rates again,  this time by 50 basis points,  citing “considerable stress” in the financial sector,  “a deepening of the contraction,  ” and tight credit for “businesses and households.” The combination of these cuts resulted in the largest calendar month decline in short rates since 1987. The Senate also passed a stimulus package \(about $160 billion\) to boost demand via tax rebates for low and middle income households.

Stocks bounced,  but despite the magnitude of the easing,  they failed to recoup their losses,  and by the end of February,  stocks were back to where they had been before the Fed intervened. Credit and economic conditions continued to deteriorate along the way. Massive write-downs were announced at AIG \($11 billion\),         UBS \($14 billion\),  and Credit Suisse \($2.8 billion\),         indicators of service sector growth and consumer confidence hit 7-and 16-year lows,         and a much publicized report from UBS estimated that losses from mortgage-backed securities could total $600 billion in the US financial system.

**Reflecting on events at the time,  we thought it was important to remind our clients that this was not going to be a typical recession but rather a deleveraging/depression-type dynamic,  which is quite different** in terms of both its potential magnitude and the linkages that drive the contraction. In our *Bridgewater Daily Observations* on January 31,  we wrote:

**\(BDO\) January 31: The Really Big Picture; Not Just a Normal Recession**

The “R” word has been used a lot to describe the possible contraction in economic activity because all contractions are now called recessions. However,  to use that term to describe what’s happening would be misleading in that it connotes an economic contraction like those that occurred in the US many times before,  as distinct from those that occurred in Japan in the 1990 s and in the US in the 1930 s,  which are better characterized by the “D” word \(e.g.,  deleveraging\).

Contrary to popular belief,  a “D” is not simply a more severe version of an “R”—it is an entirely different process…An “R” is a contraction in real GDP,  brought on by a tight central bank policy \(usually to fight inflation\) that ends when the central bank eases. It is relatively well managed via interest rate changes…A “D” is an economic contraction that results from a financial deleveraging that leads assets \(e.g.,  stocks and real estate\) to be sold,  causing asset prices to decline,  causing equity levels to decline,  causing more forced selling of assets,  causing a contraction in credit and a contraction in economic activity,  which worsens cash flows and increases asset sales in a self-reinforcing cycle. In other words,  the financial deleveraging causes a financial crisis that causes an economic crisis.

#### March 2008–Rescuing Bear Stearns

The first ten days of March saw equities sell off about 4.5 percent \(with much larger losses for financials\),  following high profile defaults at Carlyle Capital \($22 billion in assets under management or AUM\),         two funds operated by London-based Peloton Partners \($3 billion AUM\),  and news that Thornburg Mortgage \($36 billion in AUM\) was missing margin calls. They were all heavily exposed to mortgage-backed securities and lenders were increasingly hesitant to lend them money.

These concerns quickly spread to major brokerages,  especially those known to hold significant exposures to MBS,  such as Bear Stearns,  Lehman Brothers,  and Merrill Lynch,  all of which saw their borrowing costs spike. **The problems were passing to systemically important financial institutions,  threatening the entire system. Even so,  the danger was not widely appreciated.** Writing on March 10,  we noted in our *Bridgewater Daily Observations* that conditions were quickly “slipping away” and that “Broker/dealers in our experience cannot survive with financing costs close to Bear’s current levels.”

Bear Stearns was the most stressed of the major investment banks. Although Bear was the smallest of them,  it still held $400 billion worth of securities that would be dumped onto the market if it failed. Moreover,         Bear and its nearly 400 subsidiaries had activities that touched almost every other major financial firm. It had 5,        000 trading counterparties and 750,        000 open derivatives contracts. As Bernanke put it in his memoirs,         21 “size alone wasn’t the problem. Bear was big,         but not that big compared to the largest commercial banks.” It was not “too big to fail,        ” it was “too interconnected to fail.” Bernanke’s greatest fear was that a Bear [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] could trigger a collapse in the $2.8 *trillion* tri-party repo market \(a significant credit pipe for financial institutions\),  an event that would have “disastrous consequences for financial markets and,  as credit froze and asset prices plunged,  the entire economy.”

Classically,  **when a financial institution starts to show early signs of stress,  it can experience “runs” that can accelerate into a failure in a matter of days,  because runs can lead to losing liquidity**. That’s because these institutions rely on short-term borrowing,  often overnight borrowing,  to hold longer-term,  illiquid assets. At the first sight of trouble,  it is logical for those who are providing this short-term credit to stop lending in order to avoid losses. We certainly didn’t want to have exposure to a financial institution that was stressed. As more and more market participants change their behaviors in this way,  it creates the liquidity crisis that leads to failure. That was what was happening to the financial institutions shown in the chart above to the degrees conveyed by the spreads. The Treasury and the Fed just had a few days to figure out their responses.

Big financial institutions have failed many times in the past. As I described in the prior sections of the book,  ***if the debt is in one’s own currency,  and if policy makers have both the knowledge of what it takes to manage it and the authority to do so,  then they are capable of handling these situations*** *in a way that minimizes spillover effects and limits economic pain \(though some pain is inevitable\)*. This is a theme we will return to time and time again.

In 2008,  the US had a team of policy makers that understood what it would take to manage a debt crisis about as well as one could expect given that debt crises of this magnitude happen about once in a lifetime. I want to reemphasize how significant it was that the economic leadership team had the qualities they had. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had more than thirty years of financial market experience at Goldman Sachs,  including eight years as CEO,  so he brought a good understanding of how financial institutions and markets worked and a forceful leadership style with experience in making tough decisions under pressure. Chairman Bernanke was one of the most prominent economists of the time,  and one of the world’s foremost experts on the Great Depression,  which obviously provided critical perspective. Tim Geithner,  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \(which takes a leading role in overseeing the biggest banks and implementing [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]\),  had around two decades of experience in economic policy,  including prominent roles at the Treasury and at the IMF,  which gave him exposure to the handling of financial crises.

Geithner,  Paulson,  and Bernanke told me that they were extremely lucky to be on a team that trusted one another and had complementary skill sets,  and they all believed that they needed to do whatever they could to prevent the failure of systemically important institutions. In other words,  they agreed on the important things that had to be done and they were great at cooperating to do all in their power to get it done. I saw up close how lucky we all were,  because without such cooperation and cleverness,  we would have had such a terrible disaster that it would have taken decades to recover from it.

**The biggest problem Geithner,  Paulson,  and Bernanke faced is that they didn’t have all the legal authority they needed to make some of the moves that were necessary.** For example,  by law,  the Treasury could only use funds for purposes designated by Congress. While handling a failing traditional bank \(e.g.,  one that took retail deposits\) had a clear playbook,  primarily administered by the FDIC,  there was no authority for the Treasury,  the Fed,  or any other regulator to provide capital to a failing investment bank. At this point,  to save an investment bank,  there would have to be a willing private sector buyer to take on the exposure. This limitation proved incredibly consequential.

**The urgent need for flexible authority is a classic challenge for policy makers in the midst of crises. The system that is designed to ensure stability during normal times is often poorly suited to crisis scenarios in which immediate,  aggressive action is required.**

The Treasury and the Fed ran into this challenge with Bear Stearns,  so the Fed turned to the plans it sketched out in late 2007,  exercising its section 13\(3\) powers—which hadn’t been used since the Great Depression—to arrest what Bernanke would later call “self-feeding \[downward\] liquidity dynamics.”22 It announced a $200 billion new program,  the Term Securities Lending Facility \(TSLF\),  through which it would allow financial institutions,  including major brokerage firms,  to borrow cash or treasuries by using risky assets,  including nongovernment mortgage-backed securities,  as collateral. Markets applauded the injection of liquidity,  with stocks posting their largest daily gain \(about 4 percent\) in over five years.

Despite the announcement of the TSLF,  the run on Bear continued. In just four days \(March 10-March 14\) Bear Stearns saw an $18 billion cash buffer disappear as its customers quickly began withdrawing funds. Treasury Secretary Paulson feared the brokerage could collapse within 24 hours as soon he heard it was facing such a run on liquidity. 23 This was because Bear had been making loans of up to 60 days while remaining almost completely reliant on overnight funding. By Thursday,  March 14,  those fears were confirmed. Lenders in the repo market refused even to accept Treasury securities as collateral when making overnight loans to Bear Stearns.

Bernanke,  Geithner,  and other Fed officials agreed that another loan from the Fed wasn’t going to help Bear Stearns. It needed more equity—an investor to fill the hole created by all the losses. At this point,  the Treasury didn’t have the authority to be that investor. **A private sector solution—a healthier institution to acquire Bear—was the best option.** To buy time,  the Fed,  along with JP Morgan,  promised on March 13 to extend Bear Stearns “secured funding…as necessary,  for an initial period of 28 days.”

JPMorgan,  the third largest bank holding company in the country at the time,  was the most natural candidate to buy Bear,  because it was Bear’s clearing bank,  served as an intermediary between Bear and its repo lenders,  and was thus considerably more familiar with Bear’s holdings than any other potential suitor. Only JPMorgan could credibly review Bear’s assets and make a bid before Asian markets opened on Sunday,  a process which importantly included guaranteeing Bear’s trading book. However,  JPMorgan was not willing to proceed if it meant having to take over Bear’s $35 billion mortgage portfolio. To push a deal through,         the Fed promised to provide JPM with a $30 billion non-recourse loan to buy out the brokerage \(at $2 a share—its peak was $173\),  secured by Bear’s mortgage pool,  meaning that future losses on the mortgage portfolio would be borne by the Fed—and ultimately the taxpayer. They also created a new lending facility where twenty investment banks/brokerages could borrow unlimited sums while posting MBS for collateral.

On Tuesday,  the Fed additionally cut rates 75 basis points \(bringing the policy rate down to 2.25 percent\). The rescue and aggressive injection of liquidity had the desired effect. Stocks rallied and remarkably ended the month flat. Using taxpayer money to save Bear Stearns would prove a controversial decision,  but as we noted in our *Daily Observations* at the time,  failure to do so would have resulted in the “financial system…passing the point of no return \(i.e.,  the point at which the blowing out of risk and liquidity premiums would be self-reinforcing\).”

Although the markets rebounded,  Paulson,  Bernanke,  and Geithner worried because they saw that,  without a buyer,  they didn’t have the authority to prevent the [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] of an investment bank in the midst of a panic,  and they immediately began to worry about Lehman. 24

Paulson and Bernanke met with House Financial Services Committee chairman Barney Frank and told him that they were concerned about Lehman and needed emergency authority to wind down a failing investment bank in the midst of a panic. Frank told them that this would be impossible to get from Congress unless they made a compelling public case that Lehman was about to fail and that its failure would damage the US economy. Paulson and Geithner maintained frequent communication with Lehman’s CEO in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to sell the bank or raise equity from a strategic,  cornerstone investor. 25

Later in April,  Paulson used the Bear failure to convene a meeting with Senators Chris Dodd and Richard Shelby \(the current and former chairmen of the Senate Banking Committee\) and Daniel Mudd and Richard Syron \(the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\). 26 This led to the Senate taking up the GSE reform legislation,  which had passed the House in May of 2007 but had stalled in the Senate.

#### ****The Post-Rescue Rally: April–May 2008

In response to the rescue of Bear Stearns and the big easing,  stocks rallied and bond yields rose through most of April and May,  as markets became increasingly confident that the Fed would do whatever was necessary if things got bad enough. Prominent policy makers struck a tone of cautious optimism,  with Treasury Secretary Paulson noting that the economy was beginning to rebound and that he also “expected to see a faster pace of economic growth before the end of the year.”27 The charts below are some of the key markets at the time. You might give some thought to what bets you would’ve made then.

**The “expansions of balance sheets” \(i.e.,  the increased lending and buying of assets\) through borrowing was beginning to slow,  and,  as a result,  economic conditions continued to weaken as reflected in the economic stats,  which came in below expectations.** Unemployment continued to climb,  consumer confidence and borrowing continued to fall,  housing delinquencies and foreclosures continued to rise,  and manufacturing and services activity continued to contract. Simultaneously,  fresh rounds of write-downs were announced at UBS \($19 billion\),         Deutsche Bank \($4 billion\),  MBIA \($2.4 billion\),         and AIG \($7.8 billion\). Reflecting on the market action in the months following the Fed’s rescue,  we likened it to a “currency intervention that temporarily reverses the markets but doesn’t change the underlying conditions that necessitated the action.”

Simultaneously oil prices continued to climb \(hitting $130 in late May\) and the dollar continued to fall. These moves added to the Fed’s dilemma,  as it would have to balance keeping its policy accommodative to ward off an economic contraction and a further deterioration in financial conditions with concerns over price stability. The minutes of the Fed’s April meeting reflected this,  with the committee acknowledging “the difficulty of gauging the appropriate stance of policy in current circumstances.” Two members even expressed “substantial concerns about the prospects for inflation” and warned that “another reduction in the funds rate…could prove costly over the long run.”

It should be noted that **using interest rate and [[Class Note 10 Liquidity and Class Note 10 Liquidity and Liquidity Managementliquidity management|liquidity management]] policies that affect the whole economy to deal with the debt problems of certain sectors is very inefficient at best.** Macroprudential policies are more appropriate \(and in fact would’ve been appropriate much earlier,  such as in 2007 when they could’ve been used to control the then-emerging bubbles\). They were not to be put to use until much later,  when pressing circumstances required their use.

Collectively,  the combination of new-found optimism in the financial system and growing concerns over price stability meant that when the Fed cut rates in late April,  markets priced it as the end of the easing cycle.

#### Summer of 2008: Stagflation

In June the S&P fell by 9 percent because surging oil prices led to a spike in inflation at the same time that there were renewed credit problems in the financial sector and poor economic stats.

In terms of credit problems,  the month began with downgrades of Lehman Brothers,  Merrill Lynch,  and Morgan Stanley by Standard & Poor’s,  with the rating agency noting that it had lost some confidence in these banks’ ability to meet their financial obligations. This was followed by rumors that Lehman had approached the Fed for emergency funding and a release from Moody’s that MBIA and Ambac \(two of the country’s largest bond insurers\) were likely to lose their AAA ratings \(thereby severely impairing their ability to write new insurance\). By the end of the month,  Moody’s had cut the insurers’ ratings and placed Lehman on credit review,  while home foreclosures and mortgage delinquency rates,  the underlying drivers of the strains,  continued to accelerate.

**As we looked at these institutions’ balance sheets,  estimated the losses they would have to report,  and imagined what the reduced capital from those losses would mean for their lending and sales of assets,  it was clear to us that they were headed for serious trouble that would have serious knock-on effects.** Basically,  they were getting margin calls,  which meant that they would have to raise capital or sell assets and contract their lending,  which would be bad for the markets and the economy.

As a result of the contraction in credit,  unemployment surged to 5.6 percent \(the largest monthly increase in two decades\),  manufacturing activity declined for the fourth month in a row,  and consumer confidence hit a 16-year low. Simultaneously,  a CPI print showed that headline inflation rose to 4.4 percent in May,  its sharpest increase in six months,  and spiked fears of stagflation amidst poor growth and rising inflation expectations.

**To ease or not to ease—that was the question. The cross-currents made the answer less than obvious.** Throughout the month,  policy makers repeatedly alluded to concerns for both economic growth and price stability. Bernanke called rising oil prices unwelcome,  and Paulson emphasized that they would be “a real headwind” for the economy. With respect to the exchange rate,  Bernanke emphasized that the Fed would “carefully monitor” its implications for inflation and inflation expectations,  while Paulson even suggested that he “would never take intervention off the table.”28

The pickup in inflationary pressures prompted a shift of the Fed’s priorities from preventing debt and economic risks to growth and toward assuring price stability. As early as June 4,  Bernanke noted that further interest-rate cuts were unlikely due to concerns over inflation,  and suggested that the current policy rate was sufficient to promote moderate growth. 29 A few days later Bernanke gave a speech noting that the rising commodity prices and the dollar’s depressed value posed a challenge for anchoring long-term inflation. Finally,  on June 25,  the Fed left rates unchanged,  noting that “although downside risks to growth remain,  they appear to have diminished somewhat,  and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased.” Ugh. See the charts below.

Markets continued to decline,  oil prices rose,  and a series of ratings downgrades,  write-downs,  and poor housing stats surfaced during the first two weeks of July. Financial stocks went into a free fall as it became clear that the Fed was behind developments and that the credit problems would not be fixed up via a blanket easy Fed policy even if it aggressively eased. The mortgage crisis and who it would affect next also became clearer. Shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae came under extreme selling pressure,  following a report by Lehman Brothers,  published on July 7,  stating that the two mortgage giants would need a capital infusion of as much as $75 billion to remain solvent. According to Paulson,  the report “set off an investor stampede,  ” with shares of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae declining by about 45 percent each respectively in the week following the report’s release. 30

In mid-July,  markets bounced because oil prices declined sharply \(leaving more room for the Fed to ease\) and policy makers made a series of interventions to shore up confidence in the financial sector—most importantly with respect to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Also,  the SEC placed restrictions on shorting 19 financial stocks \(including the two mortgage lenders\),  the Fed extended its emergency lending program for investment banks and brokerages,  and the Treasury and the Fed announced a plan under which Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would be able to tap into public funding \(i.e.,  be bailed out\) if on the verge of collapse.

#### Taking Control of Fannie and Freddie

Of all the interventions,  the guarantee to use public funds to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the most unprecedented. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were two government-sponsored enterprises \(GSEs\),  created by Congress in 1938 and 1970 respectively,  with the former being part of Roosevelt’s New Deal following the Great Depression. They were created to stabilize the US mortgage market and promote affordable housing. They did this primarily by buying mortgages from approved private lenders,  packaging many together,  guaranteeing timely payment on them,  and then selling them back to investors.

**At first glance,  everyone looked to benefit from this arrangement.** Private lenders had a ready buyer for about as many mortgages as they could originate. Fannie and Freddie profited greatly from buying riskier mortgages and turning them into a safe asset \(i.e.,  buying something cheap and selling it for more\). Banks and other investors were happy to have a greater supply of safe assets to invest in,  earning slightly more than they would on equivalent treasury bonds. And households benefited from cheaper borrowing rates.

Of course,  all this was based on an implicit guarantee that the government would backstop Fannie and Freddie—it was only that guarantee that allowed the securities issued by GSEs to be seen as about as safe as treasuries,  giving them very low borrowing rates. At times,  the spread on their debt to treasuries essentially hit 0 percent.

While they weren’t officially guaranteed by law,  and government officials had denied for years that there was any guarantee,  the private market believed that the government would never let the GSEs fail,  as it would hurt too many,  including individual homeowners—though they couldn’t be 100 percent sure because the Treasury wouldn’t make that assurance. I remember a dinner meeting I had with the head of a Chinese organization that held a massive amount of bonds issued by the GSEs,  in which she expressed her concerns. I especially admired how the Chinese creditors approached this situation analytically and with a high level of consideration. Ironically the larger the GSEs grew,  the more “systemically important” they became,  which in turn all but guaranteed a government rescue if needed,  making them safer and further fueling their growth.

Although Fannie and Freddie were supposed to generate revenue primarily through insuring mortgage debt,  by 2007 about two-thirds of their profits came from holding risky mortgage-backed securities. The problems associated with having these exposures were made worse by lax regulation. Congress only required Freddie and Fannie to keep 0.45 percent of their off-balance-sheet obligations and 2.5 percent of their portfolio assets in reserves,  meaning that they were significantly undercapitalized,  even when compared with commercial banks of equivalent size,  which were also severely undercapitalized \(meaning that it only took a modest loss to make them go broke\). Paulson saw this and openly called them “disasters waiting to happen…extreme examples of a broader problem…too much leverage and lax regulation.”31

By 2007,  these two mortgage insurers were twenty times larger than Bear Stearns and either owned,  or had guaranteed,  $5 *trillion* dollars in residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities—about half of what had been issued in the US. Financing such operations also made them one of the largest issuers of debt in the world,         with $1.7 trillion outstanding,  about 20 percent of which was held by international investors. They were also huge players in the short-term lending market,  frequently borrowing up to $20 billion a week. It didn’t take a sharp pencil to see that they were a disaster waiting to happen. The only question was what the government would do.

Doing something to rein them in would be politically challenging. Larry Summers recently described to me the challenges he faced when dealing with them in the 1990 s:

>
> *“Fannie and Freddie had vast political power. When we said anything raising any concern about them,  they had arranged for the Treasury to receive 40,  000 pieces of mail saying it is important that Fannie and Freddie be fully enabled to do their vital work. When we testified on Fannie and Freddie,  a congressman would pull out an envelope from Fannie with their prepared statements and what their questions were going to be. They would have a set of mayors call if you tried to mess with them. The most disillusioning experience I had with respect to the financial community was at the quarterly dinner for the Treasury Advisory Borrowing Committee. I asked them: ‘What do you guys think about the GSEs?’ They said that the GSEs were like a massively over-leveraged hedge fund—dangerous. They were pretty emphatic. I said,  ‘Would you put that in your report?’ and they said they would. The report came back basically saying that Fannie and Freddie are vital contributors to our financial systems. I asked what happened. They said that they checked with their bosses and their bosses said we couldn’t say that because we all had such important client relationships.”*

Paulson described this situation as follows:

>
> *“We had seen what happened in March when Bear Stearns’s counterparties…abruptly turned away. We had survived that,  but the collapse of Fannie and Freddie would be catastrophic. Seemingly everyone in the world—little banks,  big banks,  foreign central banks,  [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]—\[either\] owned their paper or were \[their\] counterparty. Investors would lose tens of billions; foreigners would lose confidence in the US. It might cause a run on the dollar.”32*

This case exemplifies the very common problem of politics creating **government guarantees \(implicit or explicit\) that make risky assets appear to be safer than they are. This encourages investors to lever up in them,  which feeds bad debt growth.**

As losses from mortgage-backed securities mounted,  shares of Freddie and Fannie plummeted because everyone knew they had a lot of bad debt. Equity holders knew they would get hit even if the creditors were protected. By July 15,  Freddie and Fannie’s equity prices had declined by almost 75 percent in less than a year.

Now that the crisis was at hand and undeniably obvious,  it had to be dealt with. After frantic behind the scenes negotiations,  the Treasury was able to get a bill passed by Congress on July 23 allowing it to use a virtually unlimited \(Paulson chose the term “unspecified”\) amount of dollars to provide funds to the two GSEs \(limited only by the overall federal debt ceiling\),  and expanded regulatory oversight of them. The Treasury basically acquired a blank check,  backstopped by the taxpayer,  to do whatever it took to keep these institutions solvent.

**Nationalizing too-big-to-fail financial institutions on the brink of failure is a classic move in a deleveraging** that is usually well received,  as it signifies that the government is willing to provide a blanket of safety over the system. Remember that when debts are denominated in a country’s own currency,  the government has the power to eliminate the risks of default.

**Though there are undeniable advantages to a political environment in which there are checks and balances and laws,  **I **during times of crisis there exists the risk that what needs to be done might not be done swiftly enough. That’s because laws are never written so perfectly that they can anticipate and specify how to handle every possible circumstance.** Throughout the 2008 financial crisis,  there were numerous close calls in which the parties involved did the things that needed to be done,  even if that required them to get around the rules to do them.

On July 30,  as soon as Congress granted the Treasury the authority to oversee Fannie and Freddie,  regulators from the Treasury began working to assess just how dire the situation was. With the help of the Fed and outside accounting specialists,  Treasury officials pored over the GSEs’ books. They soon discovered that both Fannie and Freddie had been papering over massive capital losses. Once they had properly accounted for questionably valued [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] assets and improperly valued mortgage guarantees,  they saw that both companies were at least tens of billions of dollars underwater. As Paulson later put it,  “We’d been prepared for bad news,  but the extent of the problems was startling.”33

From mid-August until the bailout,  the situation was analyzed; terms were finalized on September 7. The Treasury then raced to build a plan that would serve its economic goals without bumping up against legal constraints. In the end,  it decided to put the GSEs into conservatorship while injecting capital through guaranteed purchases of preferred stock. Conservatorship would allow both Fannie and Freddie to keep running relatively normally following the takeover,  while the guaranteed stock purchases would allow the Treasury to effectively backstop their debt,  even after the 18-month limit on its authority expired. And,  importantly,  Paulson wouldn’t have to give Fannie and Freddie any heads up—all it would take was a go-ahead from their direct regulator,  the Federal Housing Finance Agency \(FHFA\).

Bailing out the GSEs was more of a political challenge than an economic one. The executives of both companies still believed they were on sound footing. After all,  just a couple of weeks before the FHFA had sent the GSEs drafts of reports concluding they were sufficiently capitalized. If news of the planned takeover leaked,  the executives of Fannie and Freddie would have time to mobilize their lobbyists and congressional allies in Washington to fight it. And if there were a fight,  there was no guarantee that the Treasury would win—in Paulson’s words,  the GSEs were famously the “toughest streetfighters in town.”34

Convincing the FHFA examiners required the coordination and combined influence of the Treasury,  the Fed,  the OCC,  and the FDIC. The FHFA,  which had repeatedly blessed Fannie and Freddie’s books on the basis of loose statutory accounting rules,  was embarrassed at the thought of reversing itself so suddenly. But after weeks of pressure from the Treasury and its allies,  the FHFA examiners gave in on September 4. The next day,  the news was given to the boards of the two companies. Fearing that any friction or delay in the takeover might send markets plunging,  Paulson set out,  in his own words,  “to ambush Freddie and Fannie” with no advance warning. 35

Paulson described the Fannie-Freddie situation to me as follows. In July 2008,  when Fannie and Freddie were beginning to fail,  the Treasury asked for very expansive emergency powers. As Freddie and Fannie combined were nine times larger than Lehman Brothers and the dominant sources of mortgage financing during the crisis,  they could not be allowed to fail. However,  Paulson’s political people had told him that if they put a big dollar number in front of Congress for approval,  Congress would likely get spooked. As Paulson couldn’t ask for unlimited authority to inject capital into the two GSEs,  he decided to ask for “unspecified” authority.

However,  when the Treasury finally got the “unspecified” authority,  it was temporary,  i.e.,  it expired in October 2009. This presented a challenge,  because Fannie and Freddie had long-term debt and insured long term mortgages. So it took some creative financial engineering to turn this expansive authority,  which Congress had intended to be only temporary,  into what was for all intents and purposes a long-term guarantee. To do this,  policy makers used their ability to immediately issue long-term preferred stock. Then they used these preferred shares to backstop Fannie and Freddie and absorb any potential losses.

This particular move—with its legal finagling—and the need to convince numerous lawmakers to set aside their ideological opposition to bailouts for financial institutions,  while at the same time getting Congress to raise the debt ceiling sufficiently to allow for a potentially meaningful capital injection,  were unprecedented and remarkable. But as Paulson described it later,  “if Congress failed to come through,  markets would implode. The stakes were enormous.”36

In early August,  falling oil prices and the Treasury’s unprecedented intervention helped usher in an interval of relief,  with equities rallying modestly through August \(about 2 percent\),  financials down only 1 percent,  and the free fall of Freddie and Fannie stock halted. However,  despite the growing perception that financial markets were stabilizing,  the underlying drivers of credit problems,  and their feedback mechanisms into the real economy,  had not changed.

On August 18,  I reminded the readers of our *Daily Observations* that the worst was yet to come.

**\(BDO\) August 18: Entering the Second Stage of the Deleveraging**

It seems to me that we have been through much of the first stage and are now entering the second stage \(i.e.,  the avalanche stage\) of the deleveraging. While the Fed did a great job of providing liquidity where it reasonably could,  the accounting adjustments \(e.g.,  allowing losses to be written down over several years\) weren’t made,  so **we are approaching a solvency crisis that we think is about to result in an avalanche of asset sales.** So now the question is whether they will create a safety net in time to catch these assets so that they don’t crash and bring down the financial system and the economy with it. Frankly,  we think that this will be a race to the wire.

### ****The Crash: September 2008

In September the crisis entered a new stage in which there was a genuine risk that the world economy would plunge into a depression. Since so much happened,  I will transition into a nearly day-by-day account of events. I will convey it via both my narrative and the newsfeed on the sides of the page.

Over the first week of September,  there was a mix of good and bad news in the form of oil prices falling precipitously \(which reduced concern over inflation and provided a tailwind to US consumer spending\). Airlines and retailers,  hopeful of a pickup in consumer spending,  were particular beneficiaries. At the same time,  falling oil prices reflected weakening global growth.

While financial players like Lehman Brothers,  Freddie,  Fannie,  and Ambac were struggling,  it also seemed as though solutions to their problems were in the works. For example,  Lehman’s stock rose on news that it had made progress in negotiations to sell part of itself to the Korea Development Bank,  while good news from Freddie \(a successful sale of $4 billion in debt\) and Ambac \(the announced launch of a new insurance subsidiary\) partially softened investor concerns surrounding these companies.

These positive developments were set against a continuous trickle of negative stat releases—in particular,  an unanticipated spike in jobless claims and a notable uptick in the unemployment rate \(from 5.7 percent to 6.1 percent\). Stocks declined by 2.5 percent. Weak economic reports also filtered in from outside the US. From Canada to Australia,  the story was the same—slowing demand,  slowing output,  and no end in sight. All in all,  stocks ended the first week of September just slightly down.

The big news came after markets closed at the end of the week,  when reports broke that the federal government would take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

#### ****Lehman Goes Bankrupt: September 8–15

Stocks rose about two percent on Monday,  September 8,  as the market responded positively to news of the nationalization of Fannie and Freddie,  a bold move that would have been unthinkable months before. The *New York Times* wrote that “financial stocks led the surge,  propelled by hope that the government’s decision had averted a calamity and *marked a possible turning point in the credit crisis that has troubled banks for nearly a year*” \(my emphasis\). Boy,  was that wrong.

Writers of accounts such as this one,  who have the benefit of hindsight,  typically paint pictures of what happened in ways that make what happened seem obvious. However,  as that rally and comment reflect,  it is an entirely different matter when one is in the moment. Just days before the crisis would become much worse,  the *New York Times* wrote on three separate occasions \(September 3,  5,  and 10\) about “bargain hunters” coming in with the stock market down around 20 percent from peak and many individual stocks down much more. Lehman Brothers,  for instance,  was trading down some 80 percent,  but it was a company with a good reputation,  a nearly 160-year history,  and it looked to be on the verge of finding a buyer or strategic investor. Below is its share price through early September. While the picture is clearly within the downtrend,  there were rallies,  and in just about all of them,  one could make the argument that the bottom was being made. In investing,  it’s at least as important to know when not to be confident and when not to make a bet as it is to have an opinion and make one.

The strategic investor who would come in and save Lehman never materialized and Lehman’s stock fell by almost 50 percent on Tuesday. Other major bank stocks,  including Citigroup,  Morgan Stanley,  and Merrill,  sold off 5–10 percent,  while the overall market was down about 3 percent,  and credit spreads widened substantially. Both investors and regulators began to wonder whether Lehman could survive until the weekend.

There were no clear,  legally acceptable paths for saving failing investment banks,  yet these investment banks were “systemically important” \(i.e.,  they could easily take the whole system down with them\). While the Fed was able to lend to Lehman to alleviate its liquidity problem,  there were limitations on how much they should under these conditions. And since Lehman faced a solvency problem in addition to a liquidity problem,  it wasn’t even clear that more liquidity could save it.

As we described earlier,  **a solvency problem can only be dealt with by providing more equity capital \(or changing the accounting/regulatory rules\)**. This meant that some entity needed to invest in it or acquire it. Neither the Fed nor the Treasury had the authority to provide that. Hence,  there was a need to find a private sector investor/buyer,  like Bear Stearns had with JPMorgan. But finding an investor for Lehman was harder than it was for Bear. Lehman was bigger,  with a bigger,  more complicated,  and murkier mess of losing positions.

Finding a buyer was made even harder by the fact that Lehman wasn’t the only investment bank needing a buyer to survive. Merrill Lynch,  another iconic Wall Street investment bank,  was in a similarly dire situation. As with Lehman,  many believed that without an investor Merrill was no more than a week away from bankruptcy. 37

On Thursday Lehman’s shares continued their free fall,  declining another 42 percent as rumors swirled that Barclays and Bank of America,  though interested,  were unwilling to buy without government assistance. At this point,  Lehman was continually rolling $200 billion in overnight loans just to stay running,  putting it at huge risk of a pullback in credit. 38

On Friday Lehman’s shares dropped 17 percent on news that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would backstop any deal. Lehman’s failure would pass through the system quickly,  causing a domino effect that took a toll on AIG \(its stock fell 31 percent\). But,  remarkably,  most of the market still believed that the financial sector’s problems would be contained. The overall market closed on Friday up 0.4 percent,  aided by falling oil prices.

On Friday evening,  reports surfaced that Fed officials had gathered the heads of Wall Street’s major banks—from Goldman Sachs to the Bank of New York Mellon—to urge them to bail out Lehman. Whether there would be any takers remained to be seen. Bank of America,  Barclays,  and HSBC had reportedly expressed interest,  but none wanted to do the deal without government support. And Treasury officials publicly insisted no support would come.

Paulson had hoped that by motivating a consortium of financial institutions to take on Lehman’s bad loans,  a potential acquisition of Lehman could be facilitated \(as a potential buyer could leave a substantial portion of Lehman’s bad assets behind when they acquired the firm\). But while some progress was made with the consortium,  no potential buyer emerged. Without a potential buyer,  the Fed did not have any authorities which would have been effective in preventing the failure of a nonbank in the midst of a panic-driven run,  according to Paulson,  Bernanke,  and Geithner. 39

Bernanke and Geithner had many conversations together and with Paulson about what they could do to help prevent Lehman’s failure,  but,  as in the case of Bear Stearns,  they did not believe that a Fed loan would be effective. They believed that the legal requirement that a loan had to be “secured to their satisfaction” limited the amount they could lend,  and that meant they could not lend Lehman enough to save it or guarantee its trading book. The weeks before that fateful weekend were consumed by the effort to figure out a way to prevent Lehman’s failure despite those constraints. They were willing to be very creative with their authority and to take a lot of risk,  but only within the bounds of what the law allowed. They erred on the side of doing more,  not less,  but Section 13\(3\) \(the section of the Federal Reserve Act that allowed for emergency lending to a wider set of borrowers\) did not make them alchemists. Loans were not equity,  and they had to be guided by what would work in practice.

Most everyone agrees that it would have been a lot better if these policy makers had the authority to liquidate Lehman in an orderly way; this was another classic example of how political constraints together with imperfectly thought-out legal constraints can get in the way of actions that are widely agreed to be beneficial.

On Sunday afternoon the news broke that Lehman was headed for bankruptcy,  and all hell broke loose. The shock was way bigger than any before because of Lehman’s size and interconnectedness to other vulnerable institutions,  which made it clear that the contagion would spread. Even worse,  the government’s failure to save it raised doubts about whether it could save the system. **Lehman’s failure was particularly scary because of its large and poorly understood interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system.**

There were a couple of major channels of potential contagion. The most important \(and least clear\) was Lehman’s substantial presence in derivatives markets. At the time of its bankruptcy,  Lehman was a party to between $4 and $6 trillion worth of exposure in CDS,  accounting for about 8 percent of the total market. Though many of these exposures were offsetting—Lehman did not actually owe huge sums on net—its failure sent clients scrambling to find new counterparties. At the time,  no one knew how large Lehman’s net exposure was,  or who was on the other side of it; we were crossing the line into a big,  disastrous unknown. On September 11,  we wrote in the *Daily Observations*:

The uncertainty of this situation is tremendous. What happens when you go to settle a currency forward transaction with a counterparty that suddenly doesn’t exist? Maybe everything goes fine,  but maybe some unexpected condition bites you in the ass. What if you haven’t been collecting mark-to-market gains from one of your dealers \(we collect constantly from everyone\),  they go down,  and now you are a general creditor? Who do you transfer the risk to? Maybe Merrill is right behind Lehman. What do you about that? And who might be behind it? If everyone is asking these questions the natural path is to cut back on trading and concentrate positions with a few firms. But these few firms have the incentive to ration their capacity to the highest quality financial institutions and managers. The inevitable result is substantially lower liquidity,  higher transactions cost,  and higher volatility. Higher volatility then feeds back into the real economy because people and businesses transact at these prices. And capital constraints in the financial sector mean that credit growth remains low,  which undermines economic growth. We are getting very close to crossing this line.

While Lehman’s [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] was the largest in US history \(and still is\),  with some $600 billion in reported assets,  it was only about two-thirds the size of Goldman Sachs,  and a quarter as large as JPMorgan. They were all connected and the losses and liquidity problems were spreading fast.

**We called this stage of the crisis the “avalanche”—the point at which a smaller problem in one corner of the financial system \(subprime mortgages\) was building in self-reinforcing ways into much bigger problems,  and fast**.

#### Aftermath of the Lehman Collapse: September 15–18

On Monday morning,  September 15,  Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy,  and the stock market fell by nearly 5 percent. No industry was spared,  though the financial sector took the brunt of the pain,  with shares of banks and insurers falling by about 10 percent. Credit spreads blew out and credit flow ground to a halt. Over the course of the following week,  markets,  policy makers,  and we at Bridgewater struggled to figure out the ripple effects from Lehman,  which of course we couldn’t because the interrelationships and exposures were too complex and too opaque. **It was clear to us that blanket protections would have to be put into place,  because the consequences of the uncertainties themselves would be devastating as everyone ran from any entity that could go under. But if policy makers couldn’t or wouldn’t save Lehman Brothers,  how could they save the system?**

One of the Fed’s immediate responses,  announced the night before,  was an unprecedented expansion in the “Primary Dealer Credit Facility”: They were willing to lend to investment banks against almost any collateral,  including extremely risky instruments—e.g.,  equities,  subprime mortgages,  and junk bonds. It should have been seen as an enormous step for a central bank to take,  and in a more normal environment,  it would have been. But the Lehman collapse overshadowed it.

Paulson would later write in his book that **he felt constrained from even being able to explain in a forthright way why Lehman had failed without creating more problems—a common issue policy makers face when communicating during a crisis.** As he put it:

>
> *“I was in a painful bind that I all too frequently found myself in as a public official. Although it’s my nature to be forthright,  it was important to convey a sense of resolution and confidence to calm the markets and to help Americans make sense of things…I did not want to suggest that we were powerless. I could not say,  for example,  that we did not have the statutory authority to save Lehman—even though it was true. Say that and it would be the end of Morgan Stanley,  which was in far superior financial shape to Lehman but was already under an assault that would dramatically intensify in the coming days. Lose Morgan Stanley,  and Goldman Sachs would be next in line—if they fell,  the financial system might vaporize and with it,  the economy.”*40

With big questions on the direction policy was heading,  I wrote the following note to our clients on September 15:

**\(BDO\) September 15: Where We Are Now**

We have known about the losses that had to be taken by financial institutions for some time. They were discussed and conveyed to you in the tables that we sent to you repeatedly,  over the last year. So,  these problems were known. We described them as ‘known and manageable’ because,  besides being known,  we felt that they were manageable via sensible government policies—of providing liquidity \(by the Fed\),  changing accounting rules and/or creating a safety net \(by the Treasury,  in cooperation with Congress\)—and then clearly articulating these policies to provide the necessary confidence that would allow the [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] process to progress in an orderly manner…

While we are still trying to figure out what the Treasury and Fed’s approaches are,  over the last few days they made some more things clear by innuendo. They made clear that they’re willing to take the chance of diving into the depths of the scary unknown without a clear safety net in place. **So,  now we sit and wait to see if they have some hidden trick up their sleeves or if they really are as reckless as they seem.** With interest rates heading toward 0 percent,  financial intermediaries broken and the deleveraging well under way,  **it appears that we are headed into a new domain in which the classic monetary tools won’t work and the Japan in the 1990 s and US in the 1930’s dynamic will drive things**.

Meanwhile,  reports came in showing how the financial meltdown was passing to the economy,  leading it to plummet. A Fed report showed industrial output down sharply in August; AIG saw its credit ratings downgraded,  potentially triggering additional collateral requirements; and Hewlett-Packard announced it was cutting 25,  000 jobs. With America’s financial system obviously in crisis,  the problems quickly spread globally,  prompting European and Asian central banks to announce new liquidity provision measures to shore up their own markets.

Credit markets were in turmoil. As financial players sorted through the tangle of counterparty risks and obligations created by Lehman’s failure,  interbank lending seized up and [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] \(the rate at which banks lend to each other\) settled at almost twice the prior week’s levels. The contagion was spreading to everyone,  even the strongest. Privately,  executives from blue-chip firms like GE admitted to regulators that even they were having trouble borrowing in the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] market,  which could put them in a cash-flow bind and force them to default. Prime [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] started to register increasing stress,  high redemptions,  and losses \(we’ll discuss this in more detail a little later\). By the end of the day,  credit spreads on Morgan Stanley widened to levels greater than those for Lehman on Friday.

Throughout the day,  regulators scrambled to keep up with AIG’s rapid decline. AIG was one of the largest insurers,  with around $1 trillion in assets at peak. Its problems centered around it having issued hundreds of billions of dollars of insurance contracts on bonds \(called CDS and CDOs\),         which required it to pay out if a bond faced losses. Many of these insured bonds were repackaged subprime mortgages,         so AIG was exposed to a staggering amount of losses. Since many other financial institutions were counting on these insurance contracts,         AIG was systemically important. And it looked to be heading toward failure fast. On Sunday,         it had said it would need $40 billion in funding. Now,  just a day later,  it was suggesting it would need $85 billion. 41

On Tuesday,  the Fed made two surprising policy moves—one far bolder than expected,  the other more timid. On the one hand,  the Fed,  in a regularly scheduled meeting to set interest rates,  decided *not* to change them,  when the market expected them to be lowered—a significant disappointment that hurt the markets. Remarkably,  even as the market looked to be on the verge of a depression,  the Fed remained concerned about inflation,  putting in their statement,  “The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee.” In his memoir,  Bernanke would later write that “in retrospect,  that decision was certainly a mistake,  ” caused in part by “substantial sentiment at the meeting in favor of holding our fire until we had a better sense of how the Lehman situation would play out.”42

However,  more importantly,  the Fed also made an announcement that redefined the limits of US central banking. It courageously announced that it would provide $85 billion in emergency funding to AIG. The deal,  drafted in a rush on the afternoon of Tuesday,  September 16,  came with tough terms attached. AIG would pay a floating interest rate starting at 11.5 percent,  while giving the government an 80 percent ownership stake in the company. Because AIG did not have enough safe financial assets to secure the loan,  it pledged nearly everything else it owned as collateral—including its insurance subsidiaries,  financial services companies,  and various real estate holdings \(including a ski resort\!\). The Fed loan worked because the market believed AIG was solvent \(because of the value of its insurance subsidiaries,  which had investment-grade credit ratings\). The fact that these served as collateral for the Fed’s loan was also critical to the Fed’s decision. 43

But even under these terms,  the loan was an unusually risky one for the Fed—after all,  the companies AIG put up as collateral were not nearly as easy to value or to sell as the AAA securities the Fed accepted in normal times. And there was still a risk that AIG would go under,  despite the Fed’s help. Geithner would later say,  “Deciding to support AIG was one of the most difficult choices I have ever been involved in in over 20 years of public service.”44

News of AIG’s bailout did not lift markets on Wednesday. Instead,  stocks slid by about 4.7 percent,  with shares of major financial institutions down by double digits. Rates on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] continued to rise,  while yields on three-month treasury bills fell to just above 0 percent \(down from around 1.6 percent a week before\) as investors fled to safety. Through this chaos,  regulators announced a series of stabilizing measures. The SEC moved to tighten controls over short sellers \(a common crisis response\),  and bank regulators proposed revisions to accounting rules to help dress up bank balance sheets.

Let’s spend a minute on the importance of accounting,  especially mark-to-market accounting. For banks,  some assets are “marked-to-market,  ” which means that every day banks take a look at what they could sell those assets for,  and value them at those prices. Other assets are allowed to be valued in different ways,  often by an in-house methodology that depends on the asset. When an asset that banks are required to mark-to-market is selling at fire-sale prices,  any bank holding it looks like they are taking significant losses,  which reduces their capital and thus requires them to raise money or sell assets,  which further strains liquidity and puts further downward pressure on assets. It also scares the hell out of people dealing with them. Accounting changes that allow banks to realize losses over a longer time period \(i.e.,  not marking assets to market\) prevents some of these problems. Of course,  changing accounting rules to hide losses during a financial crisis doesn’t engender confidence either,  so regulators have to be careful.

But accounting changes wouldn’t change the more fundamental issue—that overindebted US households and financial institutions were defaulting on their debts because they were overlevered. It was clear that financial institutions needed to be recapitalized \(e.g.,  via an equity investment\),  and they needed to find buyers for their more troubled assets. So Paulson turned to Congress for funding and authorization for the Treasury department to play that role.

#### The Government Comes Up with a Bailout Fund: September 18–31

Paulson,  Bernanke,  and congressional leaders \(most importantly,  Barney Frank\) thought the best way to restore confidence was to buy troubled assets through what would become the Troubled Asset Relief Program. They could have pursued nationalizing the banks,  but there was no precedent for it in the US,  and when banks were nationalized in other countries,  they were penalized with harsh terms. For that reason,  banks were reluctant to accept capital and nationalization until just before or immediately after they failed. Paulson did not believe this was the way to go,  because it would be more damaging than helpful to the task of reviving [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]].

Buying assets seemed sensible because a big source of the banks’ problems were the large amounts of complex,  highly illiquid mortgage securities on their balance sheets. The theory was that if the government provided some market for them,  prices would rise,  capital would be freed up,  and confidence would be restored,  allowing the banking system to begin to recapitalize.

When Wall Street learned about the possible TARP plan on Thursday,  the market rose. The rally continued on Friday,  with stocks up 4 percent,  as more of the details emerged. President Bush and Secretary Paulson announced that the federal government was prepared to spend $500 billion to buy up troubled mortgages,         while congressional leaders promised to act quickly to pass any proposal. Then the Fed unveiled $180 billion in new swap lines for global central banks,  somewhat easing fears of a dollar liquidity crunch in foreign markets. The SEC instituted a ban on the short-selling of nearly 800 financial stocks. And Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley came under the government’s legal authority to provide a blanket of protection by voluntarily becoming bank holding companies,  giving them greater access to the Fed’s lending channels.

The **Treasury also unveiled a creative new move to shore up troubled [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]],  which held $3.5 trillion**. Money market funds had become very popular as an alternative to bank deposits for both retail and institutional investors. Most investors were attracted by their high interest rates and undeterred by their lack of FDIC protection; they didn’t appreciate that they were delivering those higher interest rates by investing in higher-yielding and higher-risk loans. They also believed that they would not lose money in them as their principal was protected.

Prime money-market funds had been a crucial source of liquidity for all kinds of businesses,  since they buy [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  a type of short-term debt that businesses use to fund their operations. Because the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] they hold is generally diversified and highly rated,  these funds are usually considered almost riskless—like CDs or bank deposits. But a few prime funds took losses when Lehman failed,  specifically the Reserve Primary Fund,  which “broke the buck” on September 16. Fears that others might take losses caused many investors to pull their money. As the dollars flowed out of these funds,  they had to liquidate their holdings of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. The result was that hundreds of billions of dollars that had been funding the day-to-day operations of businesses dried up in a matter of days.

After the Reserve Fund broke the buck,  Ken Wilson,  who was at Treasury at the time,  had gotten a call at 7 a.m. from Northern Trust,  followed by others from Black Rock,  State Street,  and Bank of New York Mellon. All of them reported runs on their money-market funds. Meanwhile,  GE had been in the news,  explaining that they couldn’t sell their paper. Then Coca-Cola CFO Muhtar Kent called and said they were going to be unable to make their $800 million quarterly dividend payment at the end of the week because they couldn’t roll their paper. Even AAA-rated industrial-and consumer-products companies couldn’t roll their paper\! The situation was very quickly metastasizing from Wall Street to Main Street.

To stop the run on money-market funds,  Paulson decided to guarantee them outright. The only problem was that the funds would need a substantial backstop and the Treasury couldn’t immediately find the cash. To get around the problem,  Treasury officials turned to a creative source—tapping the $50 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund \(ESF\) to back up its guarantee. This plan was announced Friday,         September 19,         four days after the Lehman collapse. Treasury Secretaries can get into big trouble if they spend money that hasn’t been appropriated. So Paulson got his general counsel to give him an opinion that he could use that $45 billion,  since if the whole economy went down it wouldn’t be good for the dollar. 45 Some of Paulson’s colleagues questioned whether $45 billion would be enough,         given that there were $3.5 trillion worth of money-market funds. Paulson didn’t know if it would be,  but he didn’t have a better idea.

The Treasury team was moving so fast that Sheila Bair \(the head of the FDIC\) called and complained that not only was she not consulted,  but because of the guarantee all of the money would now go from bank deposits to money-market funds. That was a good point. So the Treasury clarified that the guarantee was only applicable to money-market funds that were in trouble as of September 19. The guarantee worked incredibly well and markets immediately turned. According to Paulson,  this was because when you say something is a guarantee and not just a backstop,  it is much more reassuring to investors.

The ESF was meant to be used to defend the dollar against runs,  but its mandate was flexible enough that the fund could be diverted to more pressing uses. And it could be done quickly,  with only presidential approval. **This was exactly the kind of quick thinking and creativity that was required to navigate the regulatory and political minefield and get what was needed done.**

The coordinated and comprehensive policy shifts were a relief to investors. Our *Daily Observations* from the day speaks for itself:

**\(BDO\) September 18: Great Moves\!**

The Treasury,  Fed,  and Congress finally agreed to agree to build the safety net\!\!\!\!

Overnight central banks added $180 billion in liquidity\!

Regulators moved against short sellers.

Morgan Stanley was frozen and is about to be dealt with,  and Goldman isn’t far behind,  but moves are in the works to deal with them.

The week’s optimism faded,  however,  as further details of TARP emerged \(or,  rather,  failed to emerge\) over the weekend. The formal proposal put forward by the Bush administration on Saturday,  September 20,  was three pages long,  and was intended to be an outline rather than a fait accompli to Congress. The proposal,  to be called TARP \(Troubled Asset Relief Program\),  called for $700 billion in purchases of mortgage-related assets,  but offered few details on how these purchases would be administered or what other actions might be taken—and that amount of money was a pittance in comparison to the need. As we explained to our clients when the bill was first unveiled,  troubled asset purchases couldn’t have much impact on their own:

**\(BDO\) September 25: The Proposed Plan Disappoints:**

Buying up $700 billion in mortgages \(along with some other assets\) will hardly help us at all. If these mortgages are bought at market prices it won’t change the financial conditions of nearly anyone materially,  the mortgages will be a small percentage of the amount that needs to be bought,  and the action won’t deal with most of the problems that exist. If they are bought at a premium,  this will be both an unethical direct subsidy that is on the wrong side of the line,  and it will mean that the amount of money spent will buy less and it still won’t contain the problems.

To make matters worse,  legislators were put off by the unchecked authority the bill would give the Treasury,  so getting it through Congress wasn’t assured. When markets opened on Monday,  stocks sold off,  closing down 3.8 percent and the dollar fell against most major currencies.

The evolving story of the TARP bill’s difficult journey through Washington DC—set against a backdrop of poor economic releases and icy credit markets—drove the ups and downs throughout the week of September 22. Most importantly,  political struggles between those who wanted to provide the support and those who didn’t drove the markets Monday through Wednesday. As Bernanke and Paulson urged immediate action in testimony before Congress on Tuesday,  President Bush addressed the nation in support of TARP on Wednesday. Yet little apparent progress came out of Congress. Legislative momentum was interrupted by debates over the need for a more comprehensive bill with more significant aid for homeowners and better-defined limits on the authority of the Treasury. Compensation for executives at banks became a hot-button issue. Many other issues that had some politicians anti-and others pro-led to lots of arguing and little progress.

**As is classic in deleveraging scenarios,  this political debate took on populist overtones.** Though congressional leaders mostly supported the bill,  rank-and-file members argued that it would be like a handout to the banks that caused so much trouble in the first place. Arguing over who ought to bear the costs is typical during deleveragings and highly counterproductive; it can be like doctors in the emergency ward arguing over who will pay the bill. All attention needs to be directed to saving the patient—how the costs should be handled can be decided later.

Even proposing the TARP bill was risky. If it didn’t pass,  there was likely to be an extremely negative market reaction. And they needed it passed in very difficult circumstances: as soon as possible,  weeks before a presidential election and amid a populist uproar from both the left and the right over its unprecedented size and scope. Given the vote counts in Congress,  the bill would need to pass on a bipartisan basis,  which by this point was extremely rare on any new important law \(and has become even rarer since\). If either of the presidential candidates opposed the bill,  it would have been nearly impossible to get passed—McCain and Palin initially taking an anti-bailout position put the bill at risk,  though they eventually supported it. \(Paulson was on the phone almost daily with both presidential candidates.\) The only factor working in the bill’s favor was that it usually takes a crisis to get Congress to act,  and the financial crisis was in its most acute stage. The difficulties in getting TARP passed are a good illustration of why regulators need broad emergency authorities versus needing to rely on Congress to act.

Financial markets pulsated in response to each undulation between “they will” and “they won’t” do what was necessary in time. Credit spreads on CDS for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley,  which had narrowed following their transformations into bank holding companies over the weekend,  widened through the week,  and huge outflows from prime money-market funds and into government funds continued to put pressure on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. On Thursday night,  the FDIC seized control of Washington Mutual,  marking the largest bank failure in American history,  before shifting its assets to JPMorgan in a $1.9 billion deal \(they would seize Wachovia a few days later\). As we wrote on Friday,  September 26,  “There is so much jam packed into each day that it is hard to pick what to comment on. The big picture through which we see all the daily news is that we are in the avalanche phase of the deleveraging.”

The political stalemate in Congress seemed to break early Sunday morning,  as Secretary Paulson,  flanked by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid,  announced that an agreement had been reached on a $700 billion bailout bill.

But when the bill came up for a vote on Monday afternoon,  it failed. Stocks fell 8.8 percent in the largest single-day drop since 1987. Around the world,  reverberations sent markets spiraling downward; oil prices fell by $10 because in a depression the demand for it would be much less. Central banks,  meanwhile,  scrambled to offer emergency loans to shell-shocked institutions. Interbank lending markets froze,  while rates on short-term treasuries fell to just above zero.

**Again,  among the most important aspects of successfully managing a crisis is having wise and knowledgeable decision-makers who have the authority to do whatever it takes.** The Congressional vote was a sign that the Treasury would have to struggle to get the authority it needed. At the time,  we wrote:

**\(BDO\) September 29: A Credibility Test**

The financing of US consumption and the global financial system operates on faith. Recent developments have obviously strained the faith in the financial system. Today’s failure in the House of the bill,  whose passage was assured by those supposedly in control,  has shined the global spotlight on US decision makers. The question of whether the US can do what needs to get done has been further complicated. In the end,  the world’s financiers \(China,  OPEC\) will decide whether US policy makers have passed the test.

Even had the bailout passed,  maintaining the necessary global faith in the system would have been difficult. Today the degree of difficulty has risen and the risk of a loss of faith has increased given the chaotic process and lack of leadership illustrated in Washington. *There is still a lot to lose*.

Officials at the Treasury and Congressional leaders were working around the clock to get the bailout bill passed. The process was painful: Convincing Republicans and Democrats to work together is hard enough during a normal year,  but TARP was being considered only a month before a hotly contested presidential election. Republicans hated to look as though they were abandoning their free-market principles and their commitment to fiscal responsibility just to support a bank bailout. Democrats worried about giving a major legislative win to an outgoing Republican administration just before an election. And both Obama and McCain worried that the other would try to bolster his populist credentials by taking a stand against a so-called “Wall Street bailout.” If that happened,  Paulson worried,  the bill would have little chance of passing. 46

But politics wasn’t the only headache associated with TARP. While the Treasury had been working with Congress to get TARP passed,  two of the biggest bank failures in US history occurred \(WaMu and Wachovia\),  and several European countries had to step up and bail out their own banks. Treasury officials could see that $700 billion in purchases of toxic assets wouldn’t be enough to rescue markets. But if the money was put directly into the banks as capital,         they could buy many times the $700 billion because they could lever up.

Even though they said they weren’t going to put capital in the banks through TARP,  they pushed to get authority to do it if necessary. The question would be how to do it fast and well. Rather than try to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy banks,  an analytical nightmare,  which would have prompted a lot of arguing and would have taken more time than they had while stigmatizing the banks they supported \(which could have worsened the runs\),  the Treasury instead offered to buy preferred stocks on very attractive terms. This allowed it to put capital into 700 banks very quickly.

What Paulson did was enormously unpopular because,  understandably,  the public wanted to punish the banks. In my opinion,  the move was necessary and appropriate. It also worked out very well for the taxpayer,  because the money that went into TARP’s capital programs prevented a catastrophic collapse,  which would have been as bad or worse than the Great Depression—not to mention that it all came back plus an almost $50 billion profit for the taxpayers. This willingness to do the unpopular but right things to benefit people is both heroic and underappreciated. Too many people who have never actually been on the field throw beer cans from the stands. This can lead to disastrous results,  unless the players are smart enough and courageous enough to do what is right despite the unpopularity of doing it.

With a lot of negotiating,  TARP eventually got through,  which was an extraordinary accomplishment because it was a very rare,  consequential bipartisan action from Congress. As you can imagine,  everyone was on pins and needles because of the enormity of the uncertainties. As with most such cases,  it took being at the edge of the precipice to bring about the coordinated action to do the right thing. While it would be great if policy makers could take the right steps early on to prevent such crises,  that’s unfortunately not consistent with how political systems work. From having been through a bunch of these sorts of dramas in many countries over many years,  I can attest that political systems typically make the right decisions only after heated fighting and literally just hours before disaster is about to strike.

But by the time the bill passed on October 3,  there was broad agreement among investors that the bill wouldn’t be enough. Stocks sold off 1.4 percent.

#### October 2008

For policy makers,  the first days of October were **a scramble to get as much done in as short a time as possible**. With the economy deteriorating daily,  nearly every regulatory department had a major policy change in the works,  each with its own roadblocks,  tradeoffs,  and benefits.

At the FDIC,  regulators worked on raising the ceiling on deposit coverage. The FDIC’s analysts knew they needed to provide more coverage—Depression-style bank runs on Wachovia had made that clear—but they also worried that raising the limit too high would draw depositors from foreign banks with lower limits,  choking off liquidity in Europe and Asia. So they settled on a compromise measure—raising the limit from $100,        000 to $250,  000 on October 3 as part of the same bill that authorized TARP—hoping it would be enough to ease pressure on struggling banks but not so much that it would start a deposit-insurance war with foreign regulators. The FDIC later followed up with the Transaction Account Guarantee Program that fully guaranteed noninterest bearing transaction accounts at participating banks.

Every day,  a new wave of bad news hammered stocks. The economy was sinking fast. In the first week of October alone,  PMI \(a survey of purchasing managers\) came in well below expectations,  data on factory orders showed a 4 percent decline in August,  and a payroll report showed a loss of 159,  000 jobs in September—marking the worst month in five years. The following week,  similarly grim economic stats came out in retail sales \(down 7.7 percent year over year\).

**During this period of constant bad news,  stocks sold off literally every day.** Between October 1 and October 10,  investors in the S&P 500 took total losses of 22 percent,  without a single day of gains. Crude oil continued to fall rapidly as well,  ending the first half of the month at $75 per barrel. Some days saw huge routs even when there wasn’t much news. On October 9,  for instance,  stocks sold off 7.6 percent on record volume,  with virtually nothing important enough to warrant it.

This acute pain wasn’t concentrated only in the financial sector. Reports surfaced that major nonfinancial corporations were relying on credit lines to finance continuing operations as they found themselves all but shut out of corporate paper markets. Some companies announced that they were slashing dividends to keep up cash reserves,  and outflows from prime money-market funds continued. In the household sector,  a report showed that consumer credit had fallen in August for the first time since 1998. Similar stories were unfolding globally,  as liquidity dried up in every major market,  even as central banks announced unprecedented interventions.

**In the face of so much pain,  policy makers rolled out ever-larger initiatives to thaw frozen credit markets and ease concerns throughout the financial system.** On October 7,  for instance,  the Fed announced an extraordinary new plan to purchase unsecured [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. Since bank lending had been almost completely choked off and money-market funds had pulled hundreds of billions of dollars out of [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] markets,  major nonfinancial companies were struggling just to continue funding normal operations. Fearing major layoffs and disruptions across the economy if these companies couldn’t access funding,  the Fed felt compelled to step in. To do so,  it created what it called the [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Funding Facility—technically an independent entity that would buy up [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] using loans provided by the Fed under its Section 13\(3\) powers. In practice,  the Fed was agreeing to finance [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] purchases directly,  with no backstop against losses by the Treasury. The move took the Fed to the edge of its statutory authority or perhaps a bit beyond \(depending on who you ask\),  as the central bank is generally not permitted to take on much exposure with such risky credit. The Fed bravely did what it needed to do and hoped that the fees the CPFF charged borrowers could be used to cover any losses,  though covering losses was appropriately not the primary objective.

Just days after the passage of TARP,  Paulson began hinting that the funds might be used to capitalize the banks instead of just purchasing troubled assets,  as he said he had been anticipating for weeks. 47 On October 9,  at Paulson’s urging,  White House officials started to signal that TARP money might go to capital injections into banks.

There was so much to do,  and policy-making needed to proceed at a furious pace. It was an utterly insane week.

The single largest push on the part of policy makers came over Columbus Day Weekend: October 11–13. On Saturday,  October 11,  President Bush met with members of the G 7 in Washington to publicly commit himself to a coordinated international effort to contain what had become a global financial crisis. It was agreed that the members of the G 7 would move together to inject capital into their banking institutions and increase deposit insurance guarantees. Over the next two days,  officials from the Treasury raced to finalize America’s part of the international commitment. The centerpieces of the new program were two bold new policy changes—a huge expansion of FDIC insurance coverage,  and a massive injection of capital into the banking system.

Typically,  the FDIC is only responsible for insuring the deposits of commercial banks. Under the new Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program,  however,  the FDIC’s authority had been stretched to guarantee the debt of any single systemically important bank and to backstop losses on all newly issued unsecured debt by banks and bank-holding companies as well as all noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. This amounted to a guarantee of nearly all bank debt. It was an extraordinary measure that many feared might have serious unintended consequences,  but,  as Paulson would later write,  “To be frank,  I hated these options,  but I didn’t want to preside over a meltdown.”48

Under the new Capital Purchase Program,  the Treasury planned to use its TARP money to take equity stakes in as many banking institutions as possible,  up to a limit of 3 percent of risk-weighted assets or $250 billion. As explained earlier,  the investments would come in the form of preferred stock with a 5 percent dividend.

Paulson needed even the healthiest banks to participate,  because if only the weak ones did,  participation would create a stigma that could encourage runs. And so,  though the Treasury had no power to force banks to take capital,  it did what it could. On Monday,  October 13,  Paulson invited the CEOs of nine major banks to his private conference room,  and explained that he expected everyone in attendance to participate,  and even prescribed the amount of capital he expected each bank to take. None left without taking government money. By the end of the meeting,  Paulson had pledged $125 billion of the $700 billion Congress had given him.

But even with the cash injection,  markets in the US,  Europe,  and Japan continued to worsen. So it became clear to Paulson,  Bernanke,  and Geithner that they had to act with even greater force. Bernanke and Paulson had very consequential meetings with central bankers and the finance ministers in the G 7 to coordinate an international response. Paulson and President Bush also met with G 20 finance ministers. Meanwhile,  there were teams moving very fast at the Treasury working to develop the US response. Several people took Paulson aside and warned him that they were perhaps moving too fast,  and that doing so could be dangerous. However,  Paulson believed that if policy makers did not move quickly,  they would have nothing that would work when all the markets opened on Tuesday after the three-day Columbus Day weekend. 49

Paulson says that the most powerful step they took was the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program,  in which the FDIC used its funds,  which were established to protect savers,  to guarantee the liabilities of financial institutions,  including the unsecured liabilities of bank holding companies. 50 At one point,  the FDIC’s general counsel said this was illegal. However,  Paulson and others spent a lot of time convincing its head,  Sheila Bair,  that this was the right thing to do,  and she ultimately made the very courageous decision to back it—which made a huge difference. 51

As news of the programs leaked on Monday,  October 13 \(and policy makers around the world announced similar projects\),  the markets that were open surged. Stocks rallied by 11.6 percent,  the largest single-day increase in the S&P 500 since 1939.

It’s worth pausing for a moment to consider how significant these announcements were in the larger story of the crisis. Up to this point,  most of the government responses had come in the form of ad hoc reactions to individual disasters. The Fed had borne a disproportionately large share of the burden,  and it was not at all clear that other agencies would adequately support it. But now it seemed increasingly clear that policy makers in the US and around the world were committed to taking extraordinary,  coordinated action. Still,  huge uncertainties lay ahead,  as the underlying economy continued to deteriorate. Here’s how we described this moment to our clients at the time:

**\(BDO\) October 13: The Governments Are Doing Everything Possible; Now We Will Have to See If It’s In Time**

These are great moves. They are doing everything that we had hoped that they would do. While these would have worked in stage one of the crisis—e.g.,  if they did them instead of allowing Lehman to go bankrupt—the crisis has spread to a stage 3 condition,  so we just have to wait and see. The big question is whether the massive liquidity injections and bank recapitalizations will get to those who are at the periphery of the system.

Many dominos are now falling that are beyond the reach of government. We know of lots of them that are big and scary and we are sure that we don’t know of many others. So,  it is hard to know for sure how these big problems will be affected by these policy changes and what the effects of these big credit/liquidity problems will be…

We are in very uncertain times. But,  for the first time we can now say with confidence that the major developed countries’ governments are doing all in their power to deal with this crisis.

Fears and uncertainties surrounding the economy kept volatility extremely high over the next week. On Wednesday,  for instance,  stocks fell 9 percent following grim retail sales numbers for September and a warning from Bernanke that any “broader economic recovery” would be slow to arrive. 52 The following day,  the market rebounded by 4.3 percent,  even in the face of a number of disappointing stat releases,  and rates on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] fell slightly.

But by Monday,  October 20,  markets had registered a meaningful easing of conditions in interbank lending and [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]. Rates on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] touched four-week lows,  while short-term treasury yields crept up. This thawing of credit conditions helped lift stocks,  and represented a significant easing of the pressure on banks.

Still,  most of the financial mismatches that were squeezing financial institutions and companies \(i.e.,  borrowing short term and lending longer term,  borrowing in one currency and lending in another\) had yet to be resolved. There was a squeeze for dollars because foreign financial institutions that had borrowed dollars and lent them out now had to pay them back,  and/or had to deal with their debtors,  who had to pay them back in dollars when dollars,  money,  and credit were hard to come by. Though the Fed continually expanded its dollar swap lines \(i.e.,  liquidity lending\) with developed-world central banks throughout October,  it was not able to provide enough dollar liquidity to alleviate this global dollar squeeze. Part of the problem lay in central banks’ reluctance to lend Fed-provided dollars against locally denominated collateral because of their fears of default and logistical issues. The largest squeeze occurred in emerging markets,  where major dollar debts had built up and debtors were scrambling for dollars. All in all,  the dollar rallied 8 percent in October.

Here’s how we explained the situation to our clients at the time:

**\(BDO\) October 22: The Dollar Squeeze**

A debt is a short cash position—i.e.,  a commitment to deliver cash that one doesn’t have. Because the dollar is the world’s reserve currency,  and because of the dollar surplus recycling that has taken place over the past few years…lots of dollar denominated debt has been built up around the world. So,  as dollar liquidity has become tight,  there has been a dollar squeeze. This squeeze…is hitting dollar-indebted emerging markets \(particularly those of commodity exporters\) and is supporting the dollar. When this short squeeze ends,  which will happen when either the debtors default or get the liquidity to prevent their default,  the US dollar will decline. Until then,  we expect to remain long the USD against the euro and emerging market currencies.

The actual price of anything is always equal to the amount of spending on the item being exchanged divided by the quantity of the item being sold \(i.e.,  P = $/Q\),  so a\) knowing who is spending and who is selling what quantity \(and ideally why\) is the ideal way to get at the price at any time,  and b\) prices don’t always react to changes in fundamentals as they happen in the ways characterized by those who seek to explain price movements in connection with unfolding news. During this period,  volatility remained extremely high for reasons that had nothing to do with fundamentals and everything to do with who was getting in and out of positions for various reasons—like being squeezed,  no longer being squeezed,  rebalancing portfolios,  *etc.* For example,  on Tuesday,  October 28,  the S&P gained more than 10 percent and the next day it fell by 1.1 percent when the Fed cut interest rates by another 50 basis points. Closing the month,  the S&P was down 17 percent—the largest single-month drop since October 1987.

#### November–December 2008

In the midst of this chaos,  on November 4,  Barack Obama was elected President amid record turnout,  and would come into office with big majorities in both houses of Congress. Heading into the election,  Obama had promised billions in government spending on infrastructure,  unemployment insurance,  and Medicaid,  and was supportive of TARP—and control of Congress would allow him to move quickly.

While the financial contagion may have been slowed by the Treasury and the Fed’s actions so far,  **it became clearer in the last couple months of 2008 that the economy was falling at a far faster pace than even the most pessimistic observers feared,  and that we were heading for the worst downturn since the Great Depression and into the great unknown**.

To us the economy was now in the classic early days of a deleveraging/depression,  when [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] could not work normally. Interest rates could no longer be lowered and innumerable avenues of credit had dried up.

Most of the important economic stats released in November were worse than the already very poor expectations. Consumer spending fell at an extraordinary rate; retail sales fell by over 8 percent and auto sales were down 30 percent year over year. Businesses across industries reacted to poor results with historic layoffs. The unemployment rate moved up past 6.8 percent,  the highest level since 1994,  and projections for layoffs and unemployment increased dramatically. December saw the worst manufacturing reading since 1982. The economy was imploding.

Businesses across industries looked to the federal government for aid to shore up their finances. The auto industry in particular remained in dire straits and actively sought backstops from the federal government. However,  the Treasury department was reluctant to broaden the $700 billion TARP package to include industrial companies and was thus unwilling to assist major automakers. In early November,         the Treasury turned down a request by General Motors for $10 billion to help finance a possible merger with Chrysler. Without funding from the federal government and with credit markets remaining nonfunctional,  automakers turned to selling assets to raise cash. Both Ford and General Motors sold their stakes in other automakers during the month.

On November 10,  AIG reported a $25 billion quarterly loss \(while securing an additional $150 billion from the government to curtail financial contagion\). Fannie Mae posted a $29 billion loss and said it might need more than the $100 billion the Treasury had already pledged to keep it afloat.

Paulson hadn’t said anything publicly about how his thinking was changing,  as he hadn’t wanted to influence the election. 53 The market was expecting a significant asset repurchase program. However,  in a mid-November postelection speech,  Paulson announced his plans for modifying Treasury’s use of TARP. He disclosed that Treasury no longer planned to buy illiquid assets because the market for these securities was frozen. Funds would instead be channeled to banks and nonbank financial companies \(though not auto companies\) as equity-like capital to better free them up to resume normal lending. Additionally,  a new lending program was announced that was targeted at consumer lending markets. This new program allowed the Treasury to put up part of the funding for auto loans,  credit cards,  and student loans. The markets,  however,  reacted negatively to the adjustment. Paulson noted after the fact: “As I feared,  the markets focused on the fact that there wouldn’t be a program to purchase mortgage-related assets.”54 This rattled the markets and the S&P dropped 5.2 percent.

Stocks reached a new low on November 20,  down over 20 percent for the month \(and 52 percent from their highs\). Oil collapsed \(now below $50 a barrel\),  and home prices continued to fall. However,  this new low was met with a relatively quick reversal on news that Obama would nominate Timothy Geithner to be Treasury secretary and Larry Summers \(former Treasury secretary\) to be director of the National Economic Council,  as both were justifiably considered highly capable. Summers came into this job having been concerned about the possibility of a major debt crisis for a while \(in a speech in early March before Bear’s collapse,  he had said,  “I believe that we are facing the most serious combination of macroeconomic and financial stresses that the United States has faced in a generation—and possibly much longer than that,  ”55 and he was an advocate of big policy moves in response to the crisis. He would end up as a key decision-maker in the administration’s policy toward auto companies. Bernanke would of course stay at the Fed,  so there was good continuity among the leaders of the economic team. These moves helped assure policy continuity between administrations.

On November 25,  the Federal Reserve and the Treasury announced $800 billion in lending and asset purchases aimed at pushing down mortgage rates \(to help the housing market\). The central bank committed to purchases of $600 billion in debt tied to home loans. This was their first Quantitative Easing \(QE\) program. This was a classic and critical step in managing a deleveraging. Central bankers in the midst of crises are forced to choose between 1\) “printing” more money \(beyond what’s needed for [[A Primer on Bank Liquidity|bank liquidity]]\) to replace the decline in private credit,  and 2\) allowing a big tightening as credit collapses. **They inevitably choose to print,  as they did in this case,  which is when things changed dramatically.**

**I hope you will read the next section,  about the US debt crisis in the 1928–37 period \(as well as look at the other cases\) to see how true this is. What was different in 2008 was the speed with which the policy makers made this crucial step. The 1930–33 depression went on so long because policy makers were so slow to react—not because their problems were worse,  because they weren’t. Still,  the 2008 crisis would have been a lot less painful if the policy makers had acted even earlier.**

See the chart below to get a sense of what happened in response to the news of “quantitative easing.” 30-year fixed mortgage rates fell nearly 1 percent on the news \(and 10-year Treasury yields declined 22 basis points\).

Still,  the stock market ended the month down 7.5 percent,  as it wasn’t clear if these moves were too little too late.

We wrote to clients on this announcement:

**\(BDO\) November 25: Why We Expect More Shock & Awe And What It Will Mean**

Though we can’t speak for them,  we believe that the Fed and the new Treasury folks understand the deleveraging/depression dynamic and the seriousness of the one that we’re in. In fact,  we believe that their understanding is now quite similar ours,  so they are doing what we would do,  and that they will probably do about what we would do. Along these lines,  we expect shock and awe type moves from both the Fed and the Administration \(i.e.,  the Treasury and other departments\).

Today’s Fed’s announced moves are just the latest steps down the path of continuing to broaden the securities bought and increase the amounts spent to bring down credit spreads and add liquidity to the system. We expect more because we expect that they will do “whatever it takes” that they can get away with.

Big policy announcements were also coming from other major countries as they saw their own economies slide. For instance,  the UK government announced a $30 billion stimulus package \(via a reduction in sales tax and measures to help homeowners,         pensioners,         and small businesses\); China cut interest rates; and the EU outlined a $258 billion fiscal plan. Other central banks also increased emergency lending measures \(e.g.,  the Bank of Japan implemented a new provision allowing commercial banks to borrow unlimited funds from the central bank,  collateralized\). And in December,  interest rates were lowered across the developed world as the global economy slowed.

As for the US Federal Reserve,  it cut its overnight rate to its lowest level ever \(between 0 percent and 0.25 percent\),  hitting the zero bound. Chairman Bernanke noted: “the decision was historic.”56 Stocks rallied and the dollar fell following the announcement,  largely because it was clear that “printing money,  ” buying debt,  and providing big guarantees to do whatever was needed to reverse this debt/liquidity crisis would occur.

The increased likelihood of a deal with the auto companies funded from TARP also helped markets,  not just because it helped those companies but because it was emblematic of a more forceful approach to saving the system. TARP was enacted to deal with financial institutions. Paulson repeatedly said that they didn’t intend to use TARP funds for the autos,  while the Bush Administration made it clear that it didn’t want an auto [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and worked diligently with Congress to prevent one by trying to get the legislative authority to use a portion of the $25 billion that Congress had already appropriated to help the autos meet fuel efficiency standards for emergency loans for restructuring. There was real progress in this regard,         with a bill passing in the House,         but the legislation stalled in the Senate in mid-December. On December 19,         just before leaving office,         President Bush officially announced plans to extend $13.4 billion in emergency loans to Chrysler and General Motors. By the end of the month,  the government expanded this bailout package unexpectedly,  delivering additional support to the auto industry \(which buoyed stocks\). Because TARP money could only be given to financial institutions,  the funds had to be directed through the auto companies’ financing arm. Additionally,  the financing affiliate of General Motors \(GMAC\) was approved to reorganize as a bank \(to receive federal aid\),  which allowed GMAC to start making new loans to less credit-worthy borrowers. After that,  they then helped the auto companies by recapitalizing and rescuing their finance companies just before leaving office. The market was also optimistic about the fiscal stimulus being pledged by president-elect Obama. The transition exemplified the very best of political behavior on the part of both transitioning presidents. Also,  the continuity of Bernanke and Geithner on the economic leadership team helped.

While all these moves were big,  there was of course good reason to question whether the damage already done was too great for a full recovery to occur. While stocks rallied on the hope of stimulus and progress with the automakers,  December ended with volatility \(uncertainty\) priced to remain high.

Bridgewater closed out 2008 with significant gains for our investors,  when most other investors had significant losses. What a year\! What a relief\!

Having the template explained in Part 1 and understanding the dynamics of the Great Depression in the 1930 s as well as we did \(and so many other deleveragings\) helped us a lot. The chart below shows interest rates and money supply \(M 0\) since 1925 to encompass both periods. In both cases they hit virtually 0 percent and in both cases “money printing” followed. Note that these were the only times since 1900 that these things happened,  and that,  in both cases,  immediately following this “money printing”/QE the markets and the economy bottomed.

Quantitative easing is like a giant shot of adrenalin to save a patient that is having a massive heart attack. The only question I had in late 2008 was if this overdue and great move would work or if it had come too late.

### ****Transition from an “Ugly” to a “Beautiful” Deleveraging: 2009

It’s worth briefly recapping where the US economy was at this point. Virtually every economic indicator looked to be falling extremely quickly. As an illustration,  in a single day in January,  reports of employment cuts across companies totaled 62,  000. In addition to weak economic growth,  there were still at least five major financial institutions at risk of failure: Fannie Mae,  Freddie Mac,  AIG,  Citigroup,  and Bank of America; each of these was bigger than Lehman. And a new,  untested administration was about to be handed the reins. This note conveys our picture of the economy at the time:

**\(BDO\) January 9: The US Economy Remains in Freefall…**

The US economy remains in free-fall with the impact of the credit contraction now hitting where it hurts most,  employment. Initially the financial sector suffered,  then demand and now employment. The transition from demand to employment was sealed when business revenues fell faster than costs in the fourth quarter,  compressing margins and driving earnings down \(not yet reported,  but almost certainly occurred\). Businesses were then motivated to cut their biggest expense item,  labor. The extreme pace of payroll reductions,  over 500 thousand per month in November and December,  reflects business’s attempt to sustain their operating earnings.

This is even more important than in most economic contractions given the lack of credit. The lack of credit means that businesses must generate cash flow internally; they cannot rely on a loan to get them through a cash bind. This magnifies the pressure to lay off workers.

When President Obama took office on January 20,  the markets began to focus on the administration’s economic policies. Secretary Geithner’s announcement of his financial stability plan on February 10 was seen as a major bellwether for administration financial policies. He outlined 57 broadly how he was going to “clean up and strengthen the nation’s banks.” He explained that the approach would stress test the nation’s major banks to determine which institutions needed additional capital and that the administration would shore up their capital with a combination of public and private funds. Investors were uncertain about the details of Geithner’s plan: Would there be nationalizations; would losses be imposed on shareholders or taxpayers? Investors were provided only with the broad strokes,  leaving them to expect the worst. The S&P fell 3 percent as Geithner spoke and ended the day down 4.9 percent.

Rumors that the Obama administration was considering nationalization continued to circulate,  so the Treasury,  FDIC,  OCC,  OTS,  and the Federal Reserve released a joint statement to assure 58 the public that nationalization was a last resort outcome,  stating: “Because our economy functions better when financial institutions are well managed in the private sector,  the strong presumption of the Capital Assistance Program is that banks should remain in private hands.” The “strong presumption” wasn’t enough—the S&P fell 3.5 percent on the day.

Later in the month,  Geithner released further details about the plan that the Treasury and Fed had collectively worked out for the “stress test”: the Federal Reserve would assess how well the country’s big banks would withstand a major contraction in the economy,  defined as a 3.3 percent contraction in GDP,  8.9 percent unemployment,  and a 22 percent fall in housing prices. If they lacked the capital to withstand the stress test,  banks would turn to private markets first and then public funds to fill the gap. Of course Geithner couldn’t yet provide the funds until the Fed finished their assessment on how exactly the shortfall would be filled. For about 18 months,  we had regularly run our own estimates of bank losses by analyzing their holdings,  marking them to market,  and then doing scenario analysis. We were pretty confident that our estimates were good. So we were eager to see what the Fed’s stress tests would look like,  mostly to see if they would forthrightly show the numbers and then deal with them.

In addition to Geithner’s Financial Stability Plan,  the Obama administration announced a series of other fiscal policies aimed at jumpstarting the economy and getting credit flowing again. We won’t go into depth on all of them here,  but will give some details about the two most meaningful announcements:

- On February 17,  President Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The stimulus totaled $787 billion,         with $288 billion specifically set aside for tax reductions,  $144 billion for state and local governments,         $105 billion for infrastructure,  and the rest for federal spending programs. Notably,  the tax reduction was funneled to taxpayers within days—a virtually instantaneous stimulus. The infrastructure spending,  on the other hand,  would take years to ramp up as projects needed to be scoped and planned for,  so it mattered less in the short term.
- On February 18,  the administration announced a plan worth up to $275 billion to address the housing crisis. With the goal of helping “as many as nine million American homeowners refinance their mortgages or avert foreclosure,        ” the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan offered $75 billion in direct spending to keep at-risk homeowners in their homes. It also provided incentives to lenders to alter the terms of their loans to troubled borrowers to make them more affordable. And it gave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac an additional $200 billion in financing.

Over the course of February,  US policy makers also announced or expanded other policies—including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility \(TALF\). TALF was a Fed policy which helped stimulate various types of consumer loans by lending up to $1 trillion on a non-recourse basis to holders of AAA asset-backed securities. It was set to begin on March 5 as an extension of a number of liquidity programs set to expire at the end of April. Despite all this stimulation,  markets continued to fall,  as shown in the chart below.

Reports of ongoing weakness in the financial sector and economy continued to pile up. On Sunday March 1,  news broke that AIG planned to report a $62 billion 4 th quarter loss \(the largest quarterly loss in US corporate history\),         and that the Treasury and Fed had agreed to provide AIG with an additional $30 billion in capital and loosen the terms of its earlier loan to the insurer. Markets plunged on Monday as fear of knock-on effects were triggered and the first economic stat releases from February showed the economy contracting at an accelerating rate. Monthly auto sales fell 5.8 percent to the weakest level since the early 1980 s and the economy shed 651,  000 jobs.

The next week opened with more of the same. On Monday,  March 9,  the World Bank came out with a very pessimistic report and Warren Buffett said that the economy had “fallen off a cliff.” The stock market fell by 1 percent. [[Lecture 4- Investor Sentiment|investor sentiment]] was extremely bearish and selling was exhausted. That was the day the bottom in the US stock market and the top in the dollar were made,  though it was impossible to know that at the time.

Stocks surged 6.4 percent on Tuesday,  led by a 38 percent jump in Citigroup shares,  following a memo to employees from Citigroup’s CEO stating that the bank was once again profitable,  a well-received speech by Chairman Bernanke on reforms to financial regulation,  and reports that lawmakers were close to re-instituting the uptick rule to slow short-selling of stocks.

#### Policy Makers Launch Coordinated Counterattack: March–April 2009

Behind the scenes,  **policy makers at the Fed and the Treasury department were planning a coordinated set of “shock and awe” policies designed to shore up the financial system and provide the money needed to make up for contracting credit**. These policies were much more aggressive than earlier easings,  and were released in a sequence of mega-announcements. How they were announced magnified the impact on markets.

The first of these announcements came on **March 18** when,  in a move that surprised markets,  the Fed announced that it was expanding its QE purchases of Agency MBS by $750 billion and agency debt by $100 billion,  and that it would expand its purchases to US government bonds,  making up to $300 billion in purchases over the next six months. In addition to increased QE,  the Fed expanded the collateral that was eligible for TALF to a wider set of financial assets and stated its continuing expectations of “keeping rates exceptionally low for an extended period.”

The market action around the $1 trillion plus announcement was huge. There was an enormous Treasury rally \(the 48 basis point fall in yields was the biggest change in a couple of decades\),  stocks rallied,  the dollar sold off,  and gold rallied. The intraday charts below show how big the moves following the announcement were.

**Then,  on March 23,  ** Secretary Geithner announced an expanded set of policies that aimed to buy $500 billion to $1 trillion worth of troubled assets from banks. At the heart of the program was the three-part Public-Private Investment Partnership \(PPIP\),  which incentivized private investment firms to buy banks’ bad assets using their own capital. In effect,  it allowed firms to leverage their investments in troubled assets using money borrowed from the Fed,  with a guarantee that they would not lose more than their initial investment if the assets fell below their initial value. In another move coordinated with the Fed,  Geithner also announced a possible expansion of TALF,  to finance residential and commercial MBS,  and said the agencies were considering making legacy securities eligible for the program.

On the day of the announcement,  the S&P rose 7.1 percent led by an 18 percent rally in financial shares.

**On March 24,  ** The Fed and the Treasury each announced plans to overhaul financial regulations and expand government power in seizing “too big to fail” banks,  as well as insurers,  investment banks,  and other investment funds. Two days later,  Secretary Geithner outlined a wider overhaul of financial regulations,  which greatly increased federal regulatory oversight of insurance companies,  hedge funds,  and private equity funds,  with expanded regulatory powers over any company deemed “too big to fail.” While not a key part of the stimulative counter-attack,  the move was well-received by markets.

At the end of March,  Summers and Geithner oversaw a team led by Steven Rattner,  a smart financier,  to create the plan that would push GM and Chrysler into what Larry Summers described as a “cushioned bankruptcy.” Bankruptcy would force the trade unions and creditors to negotiate ways to reduce debts,  and ample US government support \(including a large guarantee of GM’s car warrantees\) would ensure that GM could remain functioning while the company was restructured. While the automobile companies felt they couldn’t function in bankruptcy,  Summers thought that,  with sufficient support,  a bankrupt automobile company could function,  and that there was no reason that the debt needed to be paid in full.

**And then on April 2** came two major announcements. In the first,  the G 20 reported that it had reached an agreement on a greater than what we expected increase to IMF funding. Specifically,  G 20 countries agreed to immediately provide $250 billion in additional IMF financing,         with the aim of eventually adding up to $500 billion in new lending capacity to the IMF’s roughly $250 billion of existing liquid resources. The combination of dramatically expanded IMF lending capacity and more flexible lending terms was expected to dramatically reduce the immediate liquidity needs of a number of emerging-market countries. Emerging currencies soared following the announcement.

The second announcement came from the Financial Accounting Standards Board \(FASB\),  which had passed two proposals to ease mark-to-market accounting rules. The changes,  which had been expected to pass for a couple of weeks,  gave banks more discretion in reporting the value of mortgage securities. While markets embraced the move,  at the time we thought that these changes would have relatively little impact on banks’ abilities to write off losses over time,  while relieving some \(but not all\) of the accounting pressures on insurance companies.

The size of the coordinated government response to the credit crisis was unprecedented. At the time,  we characterized the moves as “an enormous wave.” The first table below,  which we shared with our clients at the time,  adds up all of the US government purchases and guarantees that had been announced by April 2009. **Remarkably,  the US government was backstopping two-thirds of all debt,  about $29 trillion dollars.**

While President Bush took a more hands off approach,  believing his team knew best what to do and supporting them to do it,  President Obama took a hands on approach,  digging into the facts and numbers and being actively engaged in discussions about issues. He instituted a presidential daily economic briefing,  analogous to the daily national security briefing. Every morning,  the president met with his economic team,  and for the first months,  every one of those meetings was about the ongoing crisis. According to Larry Summers,  the president read every word they sent him,  and he was very much into understanding what the approach was,  why they recommended it,  and what alternatives were being turned down. It was a time when market and economic developments were more important than anything else.

How investors fared in the bear market varied a lot. They generally fell into three broad categories: 1\) those who were clobbered and let their fears prompt them to reduce their risks \(sell “risky” assets\) the more they got clobbered,  2\) those who were clobbered and had blind faith that in the end things would work out,  so they held on or even bought more risky assets,  and 3\) those who had a pretty good understanding of what was happening and did a good job of selling high and buying low. There were very few in the third group.

As for us,  while we had done a good job up until that point,  we didn’t want to take on hardly any bets at this stage. Back in the 2007 bubble,  the gap between what was discounted in market pricing and what was likely appeared very large to us. Now market pricing was discounting a terrible set of conditions and the range of potential outcomes was enormous. While policy makers were making the right moves,  whether they would work and what else lay beneath the surface in exposures remained unknown.

A little later in April,  we wrote in reference to the degree of money printing and stimulus spending: “Like pandemics,  D-processes come along very infrequently,  so we don’t have many to look back on and,  in those that we have,  this antidote was never administered in this dosage.”

**In these crises there is no such thing as getting everything exactly right,  especially in the eyes of everyone.** There was a **public uproar** over the Treasury’s actions,  especially about how “generous” its deal was for banks that were recapitalized,  and how bankers weren’t being punished. Reports that AIG had paid large,  previously-committed bonuses after it received a bailout from the Treasury focused on how Secretary Geithner knew about the bonuses and allowed them to be paid out. The reports infuriated a public already upset with government bailouts of financial institutions and put the Treasury’s plans for further action at risk.

Such reactions are classic. **As economic pain increases,  populist calls to “punish the bankers that caused this mess” are the norm and they make it difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are necessary to save the financial system and the economy.** At such times bankers can want to stop “being bankers” by stopping investing or lending. Their doing so in the midst of the crisis would make the crisis much worse.

While the financial crisis and how it was handled contributed somewhat to the rise of populism in subsequent years,  in the end saving the system is much more important than striving for precision. Larry Summers makes the comparison to battlefield medicine—it’s never perfect,  you’re going to realize you made mistakes,  and you’re going to look bad,  even if you do the best possible job. I can’t say this enough: in my opinion,  judging the policy makers in this way is unfair. The fact that they do their job anyway,  and that they help as many people as they do,  is what makes them heroes in my eyes.

In mid-March,  at the peak of the controversy,  members of Congress and the media were publicly calling for Secretary Geithner’s resignation,  even though he had executed his job with great skill,  wisdom,  and care. Had they succeeded in forcing a resignation or otherwise derailed the Treasury’s bold and necessary plans to recapitalize the banking system,  the bad economic consequences would have been large.

Geithner wrote the following in his book,  conveying the challenge of handling public outrage:

>
> *“The public outrage was appropriate,  and I understood why the President wanted to embrace it,  but I didn’t see how we could ever satisfy it. We had no legal authority to confiscate the bonuses that had been paid during the boom. We had no power to set compensation for most private firms. We had more authority over firms receiving TARP funds,  but we couldn’t reduce bonuses to levels that the public might find acceptable without unleashing an exodus of talent from those banks,  reducing their prospects of navigating their way to safety. In any case,  I thought the public’s rage on these issues was insatiable. I feared the tougher we talked about the bonuses,  the more we would own them,  fueling unrealistic expectations about our ability to eradicate extravagance in the financial industry.”*59

The uproar ultimately faded after President Obama strongly stood behind Tim. But after what was seen as Geithner’s lack of action,  the House of Representatives passed a bill on March 19 that put a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that received government bailouts worth $5 billion or more. While the scope of the tax was limited mostly to the AIG bonuses,  the sense of distrust for government support among many executives in the financial sector \(who saw the tax as the government changing the rules after the fact\) would be a continuing source of tension.

Fortunately,  the bottoms in the markets and the economy were being made,  because had things gotten any worse or gone on any longer our capitalist and democratic system would’ve been at risk of breaking. All else being equal,  prices for goods,  services,  and investment assets go down when a rate of buying lessens and go up when the rate of selling lessens. For that reason,  **tops are typically made when the rate of buying is unsustainable \(which is also when people think prices will rise\) and bottoms are made when the rate of selling is at a pace that’s unsustainable \(typically when most people are bearish\)**. In the weeks before and after the big announcements,  pressures eased,  signs of an economic rebound emerged,  and markets rallied. A series of economic releases during the first week of April showed that while the economy continued to contract during March,  the pace of contraction was slower than expected. And as the charts below show,  while the major economic stats continued contracting through March at the fastest pace in decades,  the contractions looked to be leveling off and maybe reversing.

By mid-April,  stock and commodity markets around the world had rebounded sharply from their March lows. The S&P was up 25 percent,  oil was up over 20 percent,  and bank CDS spreads fell almost 30 percent,  but in level terms they remained near their extremes. This appeared to be due more to a slower rate of selling than a pickup in buying.

The obvious question at the time was whether a bottom was being made or if we were just seeing another bear market rally. After all,  there had been a number of classic bear market rallies along the way—e.g.,  the S&P had staged a 19 percent rally over a week at the end of October and a 24 percent rally over the last six weeks of 2008 before giving up the gains of each and hitting new lows.

#### ****The Bank Stress Test

One of the key questions for determining whether the US was headed for a sustained recovery was the health of the banks. Despite recent drips of good news,  there wasn’t broad transparency on whether the banks were still encumbered by toxic assets or a big need for capital. We had been running our numbers for months and saw huge numbers that weren’t being brought to light or being dealt with. But in February Tim Geithner said the Fed was going to do those stress tests. I didn’t know if they would fudge the numbers to make them look better than they were or if they’d tell it like it was so they could deal with the problems appropriately.

On May 7 the Fed released its results. In response I wrote:

**\(BDO\) May 7: We Agree\!**

The Stress Test numbers and ours are nearly the same\!\!\! The regulators did an excellent job of explaining exactly what they did for this stress test and showing the numbers that produced the results. They did virtually exactly what we did since we started putting out our loss estimates nearly two years ago,  and their numbers are essentially the same as ours. The differences between our numbers and theirs are more a matter of terminology than of substance. For example,  the biggest difference between their estimates and ours is due to the number of years they and we are counting—i.e.,  their loss estimate is for the losses that will occur over the next two years and ours is for the total amount of losses that will be taken on these assets over the lives of these assets. As there will be losses in years 3,  4,  etc.,  in addition to those in the first two years,  naturally the total losses \(i.e.,  ours\) will be greater than the losses incurred over the next two years \(i.e.,  theirs\). We won’t conjecture why they did it that way,  though we do know from our projections that the maximum capital needs \(i.e.,  when earnings fall short relative to losses\) is probably at the end of two years. Anyway,  that accounts for most of the difference in our total loss estimates,  and in addition we may also have a slightly worse economic scenario than they do. Once these adjustments are made,  we see essentially the same picture. What a relief\!\!\! For the first time in the last two years we are confident that the regulators really do understand the scale of the banking problem\!

Tim Geithner,  who read *Bridgewater Daily Observations* daily throughout the crisis,  took this one to President Obama. In his memoir,  he described the moment as follows:

>
> *“The next morning,  I walked into the Oval Office for the President’s daily economics briefing with a report from Bridgewater Associates,  the world’s largest hedge fund firm. Many experts,  including Larry,  regarded Bridgewater’s Daily Observations as among the smartest and most credible sources of private-sector economic analysis—and among the darkest about the banks. In front of the economic team and the President’s political advisers,  I handed that day’s Observations to the President…*

> *I wasn’t dancing in the end zone,  but that was a good day for the home team.”*60

We were in sync about what was and what needed to be done about it. What a relief\!

### ****The Beginning of the Beautiful Deleveraging: June–December 2009

In the second half of 2009,  the policies \(i.e.,  providing liquidity via QE,  capital via fiscal policies,  and other supports via macro-prudential policies\) reduced risks and increased the buying and prices of “riskier” assets,  and the economy began to recover. This shift was analogous to others that produced “beautiful deleveragings” for reasons explained earlier.

While we won’t discuss all the improving news of this period in depth,  we will highlight two points. First,  frequent concerns over inflation stemming from the fast pace of central bank printing didn’t materialize,  which fortunately laid to rest the incorrect belief that printing a lot of money would cause inflation to accelerate. The Fed’s “printing money” would not cause an acceleration of inflation if it was replacing contracting credit.

As we explained to our clients that summer:

- **Reflations don’t necessarily cause inflation because they can simply negate deflations,  depending on how far they are taken and what the money goes to.**
- It is overly simplistic to talk about “inflation” because “inflation” is an average of many things that behave differently from one another. For example,  when an economy is depressed,  during reflations \(which is normally the case,  because otherwise there’s no need for reflations\),  there is little or no inflation in labor costs and assets that are used for production \(e.g.,  real estate,  equipment,  etc.\),  while there is inflation in assets that benefit from decreases in the value of money/currency \(e.g.,  internationally traded commodities,  gold,  etc.\).

Second,  Congress and the Obama administration **shifted their attentions to significantly increasing financial industry regulation and oversight**. The following timeline gives a sense of how quickly these new laws and regulations were being written:

>
> *June 17:* Obama delivers a speech outlining a legislative proposal for comprehensive financial services reform,  which eventually led to the passing of [[Note on The Dodd-Frank Act and Its Impact|Dodd-Frank]]. The proposal included heightened regulation,  consolidation of existing regulatory bodies \(with greater regulatory authority given to the Fed\),  more consumer protections,  more regulation of credit rating agencies,  and updated rules around winding down banks,  among many other components. The bill itself wouldn’t be passed until 2010.

> *June 24:* The SEC suggested regulations for [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]] that would require them to hold some portion of their portfolios in highly liquid investments. Additionally,  the proposed regulations would restrict [[A Primer on Money Market Mutual Funds|money market funds]]’ holdings to high-quality securities.

> *June 30:* The Treasury Department released a bill to Congress to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The agency would take control of all consumer protection programs currently run by the Fed,  the Comptroller of the Currency,  the Office of Thrift Supervision,  FDIC,  FTC,  and the National Credit Union Administration.

> *July 23:* The Federal Reserve proposed changes to Regulation Z \(Truth in Lending\). The changes aimed to improve the consumer disclosure laws for closed-end mortgages and home-equity credit. It would require APR and monthly payments \(on adjustable-rate loans\) to be communicated to the buyer.

> *October 22:* The Fed proposed a review of 28 banking organizations’ incentive compensation policies,  to see whether or not they are “risk-appropriate,  ” and to go through a similar process at smaller banks. This proposal came on the same day that the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation released 61 the determinations for executive compensation for the “top 25 most highly paid at the seven firms receiving exceptional assistance.”

> *December 11:* The House passed the creation of the Financial Stability Council and Consumer Financial Protection Agency.

**Changing laws in ways that would have made the crisis less bad are typical at the end of big debt crises.** Then,  over long time frames \(e.g.,  25 years\),  as the hangover wears off and a new euphoria sets in,  these laws are increasingly flouted and new forms of leverage are produced by new forms of entities,  leading to a new debt crisis that evolves similarly.

### ****2010 through Mid-2011

As 2010 began,  the financial markets were strong \(up nearly 65 percent from their March 2009 lows\) because they were flush with liquidity thanks to the Fed’s QE,  and they were safer due to fiscal and regulatory changes. But the economy labored because many borrowers were weaker and more cautious,  and lending standards had tightened.

Now,  the markets started to discount a move to normalcy. The credit markets priced in that the Fed would tighten two or three times within the year—roughly the amount of tightening you’d expect in a standard business-cycle recovery from a recession. That was odd given conditions. Unemployment rates were still a hair away from post-war highs,  wage growth was stuck,  homes prices were flat at well-below the prior peak \(meaning many middle-class mortgage borrowers remained underwater\),  credit standards were tightened,  and borrowers who were still okay financially remained disinclined to lever up,  while those who were inclined to lever up were financially dead. It was hard to imagine there would be a normal pickup.

Around this time,  most of the world’s central banks and governments were slowing their aggressive rates of stimulus. The Fed ended the first round of quantitative easing in March after purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. The pace of fiscal stimulus from programs like the America Recovery and Reinvestment Act were set to peak later in the year. Abroad,  there were pockets of tightening as countries like China increased interest rates.

Importantly,  at this point it wasn’t clear to investors that **merely slowing or ending quantitative easing was equivalent to tightening—and not that different from raising interest rates**. Some thought it was enough to simply pump a lot of money into the economy to stimulate it—and the Fed had certainly done that,  printing over $2 trillion. But the flow of money was more important than the amount of money,  as it was this flow of asset purchases that helped sustain their increases in value and the growth of lending to buyers in the economy,  because credit growth remained slow. Yet the Fed’s amount of stimulation was then popularly believed to be too much and irresponsible. We had a different view,  doubting that developed economies would tighten as fast as what others thought and had priced in. We laid it out in the *Daily Observations* of February 17:

**\(BDO\) February 17: The Coming Tightening**

It is now the established view among the electorate,  central bankers,  and elected officials that central banks printing and buying of financial assets and central governments budget deficits must be reined in because these actions are financially irresponsible. We think that this universally accepted view is at best premature and at worst dangerous…When we take a sharp pencil to these plans and their implications,  we conclude that it is too much restraint—unless there is either major pickup in private debt growth or a major realignment of developed and emerging country currencies,  both of which appear unlikely to happen in the amounts required.

At the same time,  we did our pro forma financial projections in Europe and saw a debt crisis brewing there due to a mismatch between: a\) the amount of borrowing debtors needed to rollover maturing debt and sustain what they were doing,  and b\) the amount of lending that would be required to come from banks that had already stretched their balance sheets. In February,  several of Europe’s more indebted countries—Portugal,  Ireland,  Italy,  Spain,  and especially Greece—struggled to meet their debt obligations and were facing deteriorating economic conditions. While the news flow associated with this led to some day-to-day volatility in global markets,  most assessed the issue to be contained to Greece \(and potentially Portugal\) and that it would not pose larger problems for the European monetary system or the global economy. In a note to clients in early February,  we calculated that the problem would probably be much worse:

**\(BDO\) February 4: Tightening \+ Overindebtedness = High Risk**

“We judge the overindebtedness problems of the European debtor countries \(PIGS\) to be comparable in magnitude to some of the worst emerging-market debt problems of the past.

But the European debt crisis is a different story. While I won’t go into it now,  it is noteworthy that the same sequence of events followed,  in that policy makers didn’t believe they would face a debt crisis until they had it. When it came,  they made the same rookie mistakes of leaning too heavily on deflationary levers like austerity and of not printing money and of not providing protections against defaults for systemically important entities until the pain became intolerable.

From May until July,  the US equity market,  which had rallied nearly 10 percent from the start of the year through late April,  fell over 15 percent,  largely on contagion worries about Europe and softness in the US economic numbers. That weakness led to the realization that the Fed was likely to maintain its course on its 0-percent-interest-rate policy. US bond yields fell over 100 basis points over the next four months. The pace of improvement in the economy slowed in the summer of 2010. Timely reads on labor market health showed only modest improvement in unemployment claims,  while the unemployment rate was still near highs. There was still a lot of slack in the economy. Weakness at this level of economic activity would have been terrible.

Bernanke addressed further QE in a speech in Jackson Hole,  making it clear that it was a key policy option if needed,  saying,  “a first option for providing additional monetary accommodation,  if necessary,  is to expand the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities.”62 He also emphasized his belief that QE had been effective and had “made an important contribution to the economic stabilization and recovery.” As the chart below shows,  the 10-year break-even inflation rate had fallen by 50 basis points in the several months leading up to Bernanke’s August speech,  reflecting concerns of sustained very low inflation or deflation. However,  after he signaled that further QE was a strong possibility,  the markets rebounded strongly. The real economy response naturally lagged the essentially instantaneous market response,  but it wasn’t long before growth picked up as well.

In early October 2010,  New York Fed President Bill Dudley described economic conditions as “wholly unsatisfactory” and argued that “further action is likely to be warranted.”63 Dudley went on to give an assessment of the underlying drivers of US growth that was broadly similar to our own view at the time,  based largely on this observation \(from our October 1 BDO\): “Consumers are facing slow income growth,  lower asset prices relative to prior to the crisis,  and a much lower ability to borrow as a result of lower wealth,  higher debt levels,  and lower incomes. As a result,  households have not responded to lower rates by saving less or borrowing.” On October 6,  I wrote the following:

**\(BDO\) October 6: The Next Shoe to Drop: More QE and Devaluations**

What is happening is all very classic. Though they’re all different,  in most ways deleveragings are basically the same and transpire via a similar sequence of events. As we have described them in the *Daily Observations* and in our “Template for Understanding What’s Going On,  ” we won’t dwell on this sequence,  but will remind you of a few things that we think are especially relevant now.

All deleveragings are due to declines in private sector credit growth that require increases in both central bank money creation and central government deficits in order to offset the effects of the decline in private sector credit. Though many of us are financially conservative and feel that there is something unethical about printing money to bail out debtors and creditors,  it is important to recognize that austerity to deal with debt-deleveraging problems has never worked when these problems were big. When austerity has been tried,  even in persistent attempts to get out of debt,  it has eventually been abandoned by all governments because it didn’t work,  and it was too painful. That is because the decreased borrowing and spending \(and consequences of these on employment and many other pain points\) make this type of deleveraging as self-reinforcing on the downside as the increased debts and spending that cause bubbles is on the upside. As a result,  all of the deleveragings that we have studied \(which is most of those that occurred over the last couple of hundred years\) eventually led to big waves of money creation,  fiscal deficits and currency devaluations \(against gold,  commodities,  and stocks\).

**The QE broadly worked in providing additional needed stimulus.** Despite continued debt problems in Europe,  the US economy and markets finished 2010 on a high note. Growth picked up after a brief lull between QE 1 and QE 2,  the S&P 500 had 13 percent total returns for 2010,  and inflation expectations had been re-anchored by the Fed’s proven determination to continue stimulating as long as necessary. On March 15 of 2011,  this is how we saw domestic conditions as they developed:

**\(BDO\) March 15: Transitioning Beyond the “Sweet Spot”**

As previously mentioned,  it is pretty clear that the US economy is going through a post-contraction growth spurt that is being supported by [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]],  fiscal policy and an improvement in credit growth. As this recovery is occurring with both a\) considerable slack domestically \(and in Europe and Japan\) and b\) overheating demand in emerging countries,  we see limited inflation pressures,  with those pressures that exist largely coming via the prices of items that are being demanded by emerging countries. **Said differently,  2010/2011 in a [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] context appears quite like the “sweet spot” part of the cycle that typically occurs during the first two years of a recovery,  when there remains adequate slack and low inflation pressures.** However,  this recovery from a contraction is taking place during a deleveraging and therefore has been more dependent on the Fed’s printing of money and the central government’s fiscal stimulus.

By this point,  it was clear that the governments different programs to support the financial system broadly worked. Compared to other countries,  the US financial system experienced:

- A relatively fast speed at which the financial system was recapitalized \(and that TARP capital was repaid\)
- A relatively fast speed at which they unwound emergency credit programs
- Good overall financial returns on the rescue across the various programs.

We will end this case study here,  because in the second quarter of 2011 real GDP returned to its pre-crisis levels. This wasn’t the end of the recovery by any means. There was still plenty of slack in the economy and a self-reinforcing upward cycle. The charts below show the unemployment rate,  GDP growth,  the GDP gap \(showing the estimated amount of slack in the economy’s capacity to produce\),  and the S&P 500 stock market index from 2006 until the writing of this on the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Lehman debt crisis. The shaded bars show where they were in 2 Q 2011. The second set of charts show existing and projected debt-to-GDP ratios from 1920 until 10 years from now. These numbers do not include non-debt obligations such as those for pensions and health care,  which are considerably larger than debts. But that’s another issue to be explained at another time.

“The US housing market started to look frothy a few years back and now looks to us to be in a full-blown bubble. The housing market has been a major source of strength to the US economy,  and the popping of this bubble would have more dire consequences than an equity market fall. Selling one’s house at a loss can be very traumatic—it is the largest and most leveraged asset of the household sector. Losing equity in one’s house can devastate the household sector’s net worth,  and losing more than one’s equity can paralyze the economy \(e.g.,  most people couldn’t sell their homes,  which means that they couldn’t move\).”

“Home prices rose more quickly over the last year than at any point since 1980,  a national group of Realtors reported yesterday,  raising new questions about whether some local housing markets may be turning into bubbles destined to burst…Over all,  home prices have never fallen by a significant amount,  and Alan Greenspan,  the chairman of the Federal Reserve,  said on Friday that a national drop in price remained unlikely.”

The $725.8 billion gap,         which is almost exactly twice the deficit in 2001,         was driven by a 12 percent jump in imports and a more muted 10 percent increase in exports,         the Commerce Department reported in Washington.

“Market returns are driven by how events transpire relative to what is discounted. At this time the markets are discounting the lowest risks in decades,  yet we believe that the embedded risks in the system are quite large. We’ll explain.

Right now the financial markets are awash with liquidity…It seems to us that money is now being thrown at financial instruments like it is being thrown at the art,  jewelry and high-priced real-estate markets. Prices of risky assets,  particularly those with positive carry,  are being driven up,  and yields/carries are being driven down,  making expected future returns low. Simultaneously volatility has shrunk; as a result,  low volatility is being assumed to continue and reaching for yields has caused increased leverage to be employed in order to try to squeeze more return out of the puny spreads/carry trades.”

“In our opinion,  what is happening here is bigger than what the world now commonly refers to as the ‘credit crisis.’ Normally,  credit problems occur when borrowers get into a lot of debt and cash flows suffer,  either because interest rates rise or the economy falls. But imagine a dynamic in which the credit keeps flowing and debts keep increasing. That is the dynamic that’s happening. It is an extension of having too much credit/liquidity,  not too little.

…The American household sector as a whole is now in pretty bad shape \(i.e.,  has a bad balance sheet and poor cash flow outlook\),  so that pushing more money into its hands will lead to worse and worse financial problems pretty quickly,  so we expect that there will be spreading of credit problems even though interest rates will decline and credit will be readily available. And we believe that this will continue until foreign investors increasingly realize that the US is not a good place to invest.”

***Slipping Away***

“As you know we have a vague fear that the degree of levered counterparty positions that have built up over the years creates a kind of house of financial cards. With financial markets making new lows,  new problems are popping up.

More and more entities are failing on margin calls,  and this is flowing through to the dealers who have the exposures when entities fail on margin. Financials were crushed Monday as rumors of liquidity trouble at Bear Stearns flew. While we don’t have any view on rumors,  the quantity of major entities failing on margin calls \(TMA,  Carlyle Financial\) is likely creating trouble at many dealers. The counterparty exposures across dealers have grown so exponentially that it is difficult to imagine any one of them failing in isolation.

Bear Stearns has entered a non-equilibrium situation,  as its business,  in all likelihood,  cannot be sustained at current market prices. Either things are going to get a lot better,  or a lot worse for Bear. Broker/dealers in our experience cannot survive with financing costs close to Bear’s current levels.”

***We think that the Fed has done a fabulous job.…***

“We think the Fed is doing a great job. We wouldn’t do anything different because doing anything different would produce intolerable results. Of course we have moral hazard concerns; we believe the Fed does too. But the line has to be drawn somewhere and we think that it is at that point that the equity of the financial intermediary is essentially gone and before the point that the credit problems pass to others—and that is taking it right to the edge \(perhaps a bit too far\).

While we believe the Fed is acting appropriately,  that does not mean that we are confident that things will be all right. That’s because the Fed can’t do it alone \(i.e.,  as you know,  we think we need the accounting changes and they are for others to provide\). Also,  what probably will be required of the Fed boggles the mind.

The good thing is that the regulators now realize how serious the problems are. The question is whether they can move fast enough. As mentioned,  an avalanche can be prevented,  but it can’t be reversed.”

***Markets are tightening while the economy is deteriorating and financials are in free-fall***

“In the past three months since the Bear Stearns rescue a set of economic and market conditions have transpired that are inherently unsustainable and self-defeating. While the tax refunds and a few other unsustainable sources of money have stabilized spending and the economy,  market prices that directly impact the economy have responded in a way that is uniformly restrictive. At the same time,  the bounce in financial stocks that originally conveyed a more positive tone to the financial landscape has largely disappeared. Instead,  deteriorating credit conditions in the real economy are feeding back onto the financial system,  leaving behind a very big pile of financial institutions whose stock prices are in free-fall and whose market value of leverage is exploding. This high market value of leverage \(assets divided by market cap\) implies that on the margin,  ever smaller declines in the value of their assets will wipe out ever larger chunks of equity value,  the classic over-leveraged death spiral. Bigger losses lie ahead and the banking industry does not have enough healthy entities to absorb the dying ones. And,  the sovereign wealth funds have lost their appetite for large doses of bank equity. The inadequacy of bank capital combined with the coming need to liquidate ever-larger portfolios of bank assets will further constrain credit growth in the economy. In the meantime,  market prices are acting as a restrictive force against growth at the same time that the financial sector is collapsing.”

Market expectations are currently pricing roughly 4% of financial institutions going bankrupt in the next 6 months,  implying an asset liquidation of $600 bln…The banking sector as a whole has only about half of that amount of free equity capital available today,  much of which will need to be available to absorb credit losses on old loans.”

The freeze that continues in credit markets is evidenced by the breakdown of basic financing relationships in markets that were taken for granted as arbitrages when financing was available. The economy will be in free fall until new credit is available at rates that make sense given economic conditions,  and new credit is unlikely to be made available at such rates while there are so many dislocations to take advantage of first. Today,  there is just no willingness to use up balance sheet \(create credit\) for even arbitrages,  much less the financing of new economic activity.”

***How So Many Investors Lost Money in 2008 & Lessons for the Future***

“From our perspective,  most investors lost money because:

1. They had a lot more exposure to beta than alpha.
1. The beta exposure was much more heavily in assets that do badly during economic bad times \(e.g.,  stocks,  private equity,  real estate,  bonds with credit risk,  etc.\) than in assets that do well in bad times \(e.g. Treasury bonds\).
1. The risk and liquidity premiums rose a lot \(which happens in bad times\).
1. The alphas typically had lots of systematic biases in them to do well in good times and to do badly in bad times—e.g.,  the average “hedge” fund has been about 70% correlated with stocks,  so it’s not surprising that hedge funds are down a lot when stocks are down a lot.”

“As you know,  we believe that monetary and fiscal policies are beginning to tighten globally and the mature industrialized countries are over-indebted,  so we believe that we are about to enter a period of testing whether central banks and central governments can really ‘pull back’ as planned. Based on our calculations,  we doubt that they can stick to the plan as outlined without causing unacceptable consequences.”

“It seems that there is a great deal of confusion regarding ‘how things are going’ in developed countries that has arisen from observers sometimes looking at changes,  sometimes looking at levels,  sometimes looking at economic activity,  sometimes looking at the drivers of economic activity and sometimes looking at markets. Specifically,  a\) those who are looking at changes in financial markets’ prices are most optimistic,  b\) those who are looking at changes in economic activity and levels of market values are less optimistic,  c\) and those who are looking at the levels of economic activity and the drivers of economic activity are least optimistic.”

***The Template and the Slowdown***

“We suspect that the most important difference between our views and others concerns the long-term debt cycle. As long-term debt cycles transpire slowly—essentially over a lifetime—most people haven’t experienced many of them,  unlike the business cycle which most of us have seen many of. So,  while recessions are well understood,  deleveragings are not well understood.”

***More Will Likely Be Necessary From the Fed***

“While monetization policies are currently viewed as risky,  we think the implications of monetary inaction during a deleveraging and deflation are riskier. Monetization should not be viewed like a light switch that works in an all-or-none sort of way; it should be viewed like a spigot that regulates the flow in degrees. It works similar to interest rate cuts or putting your foot on the accelerator of a car. When doing either,  you judge the right amount primarily by watching the reactions. When things start to pick up,  you start to let off. When things start to slow down,  you start to press the pedal harder. The same is true for monetizations. In our view,  it is time for the Fed to put its foot back down on the monetization accelerator.”

“We suspect the Fed will end up having to push much harder than anyone currently expects,  as it is likely that the currently planned quantitative easing will not be nearly as effective per dollar as the last stage of QE was. This is because the economic impact of the Fed printing and spending money \(QE\) depends on who gets the money and what they do with it.”

***ECB Policy***

“We see overall growth rates decelerating,  debt problems on the periphery that at a minimum remain an intense weight on growth and a fiscal policy of austerity that is clearly a drag. It is against that backdrop that the ECB is ‘normalizing’ its balance sheet \(both by letting its longer-term lending facilities roll off and by decreasing the pace of its asset purchases\),  and as a result pushing up both short-term interest rates and the euro. This de facto tightening of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] seems like a mistake to us,  and we suspect will cause conditions to deteriorate \(likely further pressuring peripheral credits\) and eventually cause the ECB to reverse course \(pushing down rates and probably the euro\).”

We believe that debtors with linked monetary policies \(i.e.,  who can’t print money\) will experience many years of hardship and economic weakness,  and that creditors who can’t stop printing money because they have linked exchange rates will go through an extended period of overheating. We also believe that these pressures will intensify over the next 18 months,  leading to cracks and seismic shifts in these linkages. These views influence our market positioning in credit spreads,  yield curves,  currencies,  commodities and equities.”
