# War Economies

War economies are totally different from regular economies in terms of what happens with the production,  consumption,  and accounting for goods,  services,  and financial assets. For example,  the increasing GDP arising from the greater production of armaments which get destroyed in the war,  the reduced unemployment rate due to increases in military service,  shifts in production and profitability arising from the top-down allocation of resources,  and the nature of borrowing,  lending,  and other [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are not the same as in periods of peace so understanding these statistics requires a whole different orientation. Trying to adequately convey how war economies work would take a whole different book,  so I’m not going to delve deeply into the subject now,  but I will touch on them briefly because they certainly are important in understanding the big debt crises that were captured within our sampling period—and they are very important to understand if we enter another war period.

The economic/geopolitical cycle of economic conflicts leading to military conflicts both within and between emerging powerful countries and established powerful countries is obvious to anyone who studies history. It’s been well-described by historians,  though those historians typically have more of a geopolitical perspective and less of an economic/market perspective than I do. In either case,  it is well-recognized as classic by historians. The following sentence describes it as I see it in a nutshell:

**When 1\) within countries there are economic conflicts between the rich/capitalist/political right and the poor/proletariat/political left that lead to conflicts that result in populist,  autocratic,  nationalistic,  and militaristic leaders coming to power,  while at the same time,  2\) between countries there are conflicts arising among comparably strong economic and military powers,  the relationships between economics and politics become especially intertwined—and the probabilities of disruptive conflicts \(e.g.,  wars\) become much higher than normal.**

In other words economic rivalries within and between countries often lead to fighting in order to establish which entities are most powerful. In these periods,  we have war economies,  and after them,  markets,  economies,  and geopolitics all experience the hang-over effects. What happens during wars and as a result of wars have huge effects on which currencies,  which debts,  which equities,  and which economies are worth what,  and more profoundly,  on the whole social-political fabric. At the most big-picture level,  the periods of war are followed by periods of peace in which the dominant power/powers get to set the rules because no one can fight them. That continues until the cycle begins again \(because of a rival power emerging\).

Appreciating this big economic/geopolitical cycle that drives the ascendancies and declines of empires and their reserve currencies requires taking a much longer \(250-year\) time frame,  which I will touch on briefly here and in more detail in a future report.

Typically,  though not always,  at times of economic rivalry,  emotions run high,  firebrand populist leaders who prefer antagonistic paths are elected or come to power,  and wars occur. However,  that is not always the case. History has shown that through time,  there are two broad types of relationships,  and that what occurs depends on which type of relationship exists. The two types of relationships are:

1. a\) **Cooperative-competitive relationships** in which the parties take into consideration what’s really important to the other and try to give it to them in exchange for what they most want. In this type of win-win relationship,  there are often tough negotiations that are done with respect and consideration,  like two friendly merchants in a bazaar or two friendly teams on the field.
1. b\) **Mutually threatening relationships** in which the parties think about how they can harm the other and exchange painful acts in the hope of forcing the other into a position of fear so that they will give in. In this type of lose-lose relationship,  they interact through “war” rather than through “negotiation.”

Either side can force the second path \(threatening war,  lose-lose\) onto the other side,  but it takes both sides to go down the cooperative,  win-win path. Both sides will inevitably follow the same approach.

In the back of the minds of all parties,  regardless of which path they choose,  should be their relative powers. In the first case,  each party should realize what the other could force on them and appreciate the quality of the exchange without getting too pushy,  while in the second case,  the parties should realize that power will be defined by the relative abilities of the parties to endure pain as much as their relative abilities to inflict it. When it isn’t clear exactly how much power either side has to reward and punish the other side because there are many untested ways,  the first path is the safer way. On the other hand,  the second way will certainly make clear—through the hell of war—which party is dominant and which one will have to be submissive. That is why,  after wars,  there are typically extended periods of peace with the dominant country setting the rules and other countries following them for the time it takes for the cycle to happen all over again.

In terms of economic policy,  during a war period,  the most important priority is to maintain one’s access to financial and non-financial resources that are required to sustain a good war effort. Because no country has the capacity to both fund a war and sustain tolerable non-war-related spending out of current income,  one must have access to borrowing and/or have very large foreign exchange reserves. The access to borrowing very much depends on each county’s creditworthiness and the development of its capital markets,  especially the soundness of its own local currency debt market. Similarly,  maintaining access to the critical non-financial resources that are required to sustain both the war effort and acceptable domestic economic conditions is essential during the war period.

After the war period,  during the paying back period,  the market consequences of **the debts and the outcome of the war \(whether it is won or lost\) will be enormous. The worst thing a country,  hence a country’s leader,  could ever do is get into a lot of debt and lose a war because there is nothing more devastating. ABOVE ALL ELSE,  DON’T DO THAT. Look at what it meant for Germany after World War I in the 1920s \(which is explained in Part 2\) and for Germany and Japan after World War II in the late 1940s and the 1950s**.

The following charts show some of the typical shifts in the economy—how countries shift much of their economies to war production,  borrow a lot of money to finance big fiscal deficits,  and move much of their workforces to the armed services and war production. The first chart shows the rapid rise in government spending relative to private spending. The subsequent charts show the increase in military spending and the number of soldiers,  averaging a number of war cases—both military spending and number of soldiers as a percent of the population increase by around five times. For instance,  during World War II,  20 percent of the US workforce shifted to the military.

After a major war ends,  all countries—both the winners and losers—are saddled with debt and the need to transition from a war-economy to a more normal economy. The big contraction of military spending usually causes a postwar recession,  as factories are retooled once again and the large number of people formerly employed in the war effort need to find new jobs. Countries typically enter periods of deleveraging,  working through the big war debts with the same basic dynamics visible in other depressions/deleveragings coming into play here too. However,  losers of war experience significantly worse economic conditions. The following charts demonstrate this dynamic. Losers experience a much deeper depression,  resort to more money printing,  meaningfully spend down their savings/reserves,  and see much higher inflation rates \(sometimes experiencing hyperinflation\).

That’s all I have to convey about war economies at this stage. For more color on them,  I suggest you read the Weimar Germany and US Great Depression case studies in Part 2,  as the first paints a good picture of a postwar period for a war loser and the second shows how economic conflicts initiate a sequence of events that lead to shooting wars. I also suggest that you also look at the charts of the US and UK in the post-World War II periods \(two examples of winners of wars\). The reasons we don’t have charts for Germany,  Japan,  and other war losers for the post-World War II period is that the consequences for their currencies,  other markets,  and economies were so devastating that statistics were either ridiculously unreliable or unavailable.

## In Summary

**I want to reiterate my headline: managing debt crises is all about spreading out the pain of the bad debts,  and this can almost always be done well if one’s debts are in one’s own currency. The biggest risks are typically not from the debts themselves,  but from the failure of policy makers to do the right things due to a lack of knowledge and/or lack of authority. If a nation’s debts are in a foreign currency,  much more difficult choices have to be made to handle the situation well—and,  in any case,  the consequences will be more painful.**

As I know from personal experience,  the understandings and authorities of policy makers varies a lot across countries,  which can lead to dramatically different outcomes,  and they tend not to react forcefully enough until the crisis is extreme. Their authorities vary as a function of how powerful each country’s regulatory and checks-and-balance systems are. In countries where these systems are strong \(which brings lots of benefits\),  there is also the risk that some required policy moves can’t get done because they are inconsistent with the rigid rules and agreements that are in place.

It’s impossible to write the rules well enough to anticipate all the possibilities,  and even the most knowledgeable and empowered policy maker is unlikely to manage a crisis perfectly. Circumstances that weren’t foreseen must be responded to instantly,  often in hours,  within a legal/regulatory system that doesn’t have crystal-clear rules.

The checks and balances system—normally a critical protection from too much concentration of power—can exacerbate a crisis because it can slow decision making and allow those with narrower interests to block necessary policy moves. Policy makers who try to take the necessary bold actions are typically criticized from all sides. Politics is horrendous during debt crises,  and distortions and outright misinformation are pervasive.

While these big debt crises can be devastating to some people and countries over the short-to medium-term \(meaning three to ten years\),  in the long run they fade in importance relative to productivity,  which is more forceful \(though less apparent because it is less volatile\). The political consequences \(e.g.,  increases in populism\) that result from these crises can be much more consequential than the debt crises themselves. The charts below show real GDP per capita and help to put these big debt crises \(and the “little” ones that we call recessions\) in perspective. The contractions of more than 3 percent are shown in the shaded areas. Note how the growth rates over time were far more important than the bumps along the way. The biggest bumps came more as a result of wars than the worst depressions \(though a case can be made that those wars were caused by the political fallout from those depressions\).

## ********German Debt Crisis and Hyperinflation \(1918–1924\)

This section provides a detailed account of the most iconic inflationary depression cycle in history—the German debt crisis and hyperinflation that followed the end of World War I and carried into the mid-1920s,  which set the stage for the economic and political changes of the 1930s. Much like my accounts of the 2008 US Financial Crisis and the 1930s Great Depression,  this study goes through the particulars of the case in some detail with reference to the template laid out earlier in the “Archetypal Inflationary Depression.” Although the German hyperinflation took place almost a century ago,  and amid exceptional political circumstances \(Germany’s defeat in the First World War and the imposition of a huge reparation burden on it by the Allies\),  the basic dynamic of debt cycles,  economic activity,  and markets described in the template drove what happened. Noting the differences between this inflationary depression case \(and other inflationary depression cases\) and the deflationary depression cases highlights what makes some inflationary and others deflationary. To provide a vivid sense of what was happening in real time,  a newsfeed runs along the sides of my description of what happened.

### July 1914–November 1918: World War I

World War I \(July 1914–November 1918\) set the stage for this big,  dramatic cycle. During the war years Germany left the gold standard,  accumulated a large stock of domestic and foreign debts,  began the practice of money printing to finance its ever-growing fiscal deficits,  and experienced its first bout of currency depreciation and inflation. Based on their experience of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870,  the Germans had expected the war to be short,  and they assumed it would ultimately be paid for by large indemnities levied on the defeated Allied powers. Instead it turned out to be an extremely long and expensive affair that was financed primarily through domestic debt,  and Germany ended up having to pay a huge war reparation bill rather than collecting on one.

This was a classic case of war debts being built up by a country that then loses the war \(though more extreme than most\) and is also a classic case of a country with large foreign currency denominated debt that is held by foreign creditors. Knowing the dynamic described in the “Archetypal Inflationary Depression” section of Part 1,  you should have a pretty good idea of how this story will play out.

#### Background

Like most countries at the time,  Germany had been on the gold standard at the beginning of the war. All paper currency,  including all government debt,  was convertible to gold at a fixed rate. However,  by 1914,  the central bank did not have enough gold to back the stock of money in circulation at the fixed price as one might expect. As soon as the war broke out,  smart German citizens rushed to exchange their paper money for bullion,  which caused a run on the banking system. Within a matter of weeks,  the central bank \(the Reichsbank\) and the Treasury had paid out 195 million marks’ worth of gold to the public \(i.e.,  about 10 percent of total gold reserves\) In order to prevent further losses,  ensure liquidity in the banking system,  and avoid a major contraction in the money supply,  policy makers suspended the conversion of money to gold on July 31,  1914.3 The government also authorized the Reichsbank to buy short-term Treasury bills and use them,  along with commercial bills,  as collateral for the money it was printing The pace of printing that followed was rapid: By the end of August,  the quantity of Reichsbank notes in circulation \(i.e.,  paper marks\) had increased by approximately 30 percent.

This is classic. Currency is both a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. When investors hold a lot of promises to deliver currency \(i.e.,  a lot of debt denominated in a currency\) and the supply of that currency is tied to something that backs it,  the ability of the central bank to produce currency is limited. When investors want to convert their bonds to currency/money and spend it,  that puts the central bank in the difficult position of having to choose between having a lot of debt defaults or floating a lot of currency,  which can debase its value. **So,  whenever \(a\) the amount of money in circulation is much greater than the amount of gold held in reserves to back the money at the designated price of conversion,  and \(b\) investors are rushing to convert money into gold because they are worried about the value of their money,  the central bank is in the untenable position of either reducing the supply of money in circulation \(i.e.,  tighten credit\) or ending convertibility and printing more money.** Central banks almost always choose suspending convertibility and printing more money versus allowing a credit contraction to take place,  because it’s less painful.

Printing a lot of money and depreciating the value of a currency causes just about anything denominated in that depreciated money to go up in price,  and people like it when the things they own go up in value and they have more money to spend. This is also true in times of war. Policy makers attempting to marshal the economic resources of the country toward the war effort print money to give themselves more to spend. This printing helps prevent a liquidity crisis in the banking system or an economic contraction from taking place—either of which would be very disruptive to the war effort. It is for this reason that most of the countries fighting in WWI ended up suspending the gold standard at one point or another.

Fighting the war required the German government to significantly increase expenditures \(government spending as a share of GDP would increase 2.5x between 1914 and 1917\). Financing this spending would mean either raising new revenues \(i.e.,  taxation\) or increasing government borrowing. **As there was huge resistance to increasing taxation at home,  and as Germany was mostly locked out of international lending markets,  the war had to be financed by issuing domestic debt.**5 In 1914,  German government debt was insignificant. By 1918,  Germany had amassed a total local currency debt stock of 100 billion marks,  about 130 percent of German GDP.

**Source: Global Financial Data**

Although this stock of debt was huge,  prior to the German surrender and the imposition of war reparations,  most of it was denominated in local currency Policy makers recognized that this was a good thing. According to the Reichsbank,  “the greatest weakness in the war financing of the enemies is their growing indebtedness abroad \[particularly to the US\],  ”7 as it forces them to scramble for dollars when needing to make debt-service payments. In contrast,  most German debt taken on to finance the war \(prior to reparations\) was in local currency and financed by Germans

Up until the second half of 1916,  the German public was both willing and able to finance the entire fiscal deficit by purchasing government debt In fact,  war bond issuances were regularly oversubscribed. However,  as the war dragged on and inflation accelerated,  the Treasury found that the public was no longer prepared to hold all the debt it was issuing. This was partly due to the size of the deficit,  increasing substantially as the war progressed,  but also because wartime inflation had caused real interest rates to become very negative \(government war bonds paid out a fixed interest rate of 5 percent throughout the war,  whereas inflation had climbed above 30% by early 1915\),  which resulted in lenders not being adequately compensated for holding government debt The inflation was being driven by wartime disruptions and shortages,  capacity constraints in key war industries,  and currency weakness \(the mark would fall about 25 percent against the dollar by 1916\) While some naive lenders clung to the hope that the government would return to the gold standard at the old exchange rate once the war was over,  or compensate them for any losses due to inflation,  others feared they would most likely be paid in money that had lost most of its purchasing power,  so they ran out of debt denominated in that currency

The currency remained an effective medium of exchange while losing its effectiveness as a store hold of wealth. So,  the government borrowed money to pay for its war expenditures,  and the Reichsbank was forced to monetize the debt as investors came up short in supplying the money. This had the effect of increasing the money supply by an amount equal to the fiscal deficit not financed by the public. **As debt monetization is inflationary \(there is more money in the economy chasing the same quantity of goods and services\),  a self-reinforcing spiral ensued—i.e.,  debt monetization increased inflation,  which reduced real interest rates,  which discouraged lending to the government,  which encouraged additional debt monetization.** As the deficit was huge \(averaging about 40 percent of GDP between 1914 and 1918\),  this led to the money supply increasing by almost 300 percent over the course of the war

The pace of money creation accelerated after 1917 as German citizens became increasingly unwilling to purchase government debt,  and the central bank was forced to monetize a growing share of the deficit Although the number of marks in circulation almost doubled between mid-1917 and mid-1918,  it did not cause a material decline in the currency. In fact,  the mark rallied over this period as Russia’s withdrawal increased expectations of a German victory. The mark only began falling in the second half of 1918,  as a German defeat began looking increasingly likely

**Source: Global Financial Data**

In the last two years of the war,  the German government began borrowing in foreign currencies because lenders were unwilling to take promises to pay in marks When a country has to borrow in a foreign currency,  it’s a bad sign. By 1918,  the Reichsbank and private firms each owed about 2.5 billion gold marks in FX to external lenders A gold mark was an artificial unit used to measure the value of a paper mark to gold. In 1914,  one gold mark equaled one paper mark A debt of 5 billion gold marks was therefore a debt denominated in gold,  with the bill equal to the amount of gold that could be purchased by 5 billion marks in 1914.

**Unlike local currency debt,  hard currency \(foreign currency and gold denominated\) debt cannot be printed away.** Debtors would have to get their hands on either gold or foreign exchange to meet these liabilities. While the hard currency debt was less than 10 percent of the total debt stock,  it was still larger than the entire public gold reserves of the Reich The hope was that once Germany won the war,  the mark would appreciate,  making those debt burdens more manageable. And,  of course,  the losing countries would be forced to pay for most of Germany’s foreign and domestic debts

Policy makers recognized that if Germany lost the war,  or failed to extract large reparations,  it would be extremely difficult to pay back these debts with hard money. According to the president of the Reichsbank,  Rudolf Havenstein,  covering those debts “will be extraordinarily difficult if we do not get a large war indemnity.”21 According to the German economist Edgar Jaffé,  unless England paid between a third and a half of Germany’s war costs,  the result would be the “monstrous catastrophe” of “currency collapse” once German citizens learned that domestic debts would likely be paid in depreciated money,  and government agencies and private firms scrambled to get their hands on foreign exchange to pay off external liabilities

Breaking the peg to gold and monetizing an ever-growing fiscal deficit,  combined with wartime economic disruptions and shortages,  led to a declining exchange rate and a pickup in inflation. By the beginning of 1918,  the mark had lost about 25 percent of its value versus the dollar and prices had tripled.

However,  in the context of WWI,  this was pretty typical—i.e.,  it’s what most countries did to fund their wars. German inflation,  while high,  was not significantly higher than that of other war participants,  as you can see in the chart below But only a few of the war’s many participants ended up with hyperinflation,  for reasons I will soon explain.

I bring up this point to underline the fact that WWI \(and the accompanying monetization of debt\) did not directly cause Germany’s postwar inflationary depression. As mentioned in the archetype template,  **while inflationary depressions are possible in all countries/currencies,  they are most common in countries that:**

- **Don’t have a reserve currency:** So there is not a global bias to hold their currency/debt as a store hold of wealth
- **Have low foreign exchange reserves:** So there is not much of a cushion to protect against capital outflows
- **Have a large stock of foreign debt:** So there is a vulnerability to the cost of debt rising via increases in either interest rates or the value of the currency the debtor has to deliver,  or a shortage of available credit denominated in that currency
- **Have a large and increasing budget and/or [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficit:** So there is a need to borrow or print money to fund the deficits
- **Have negative real interest rates:** So lenders are not adequately compensated for holding the currency/debt
- **Have a history of high inflation and negative total returns in the currency:** So there is a lack of trust in the value of the currency/debt

**By the end of the war,  the German economy met all of these conditions.** Losing the war meant that the mark was not going to be the reserve currency of the postwar era. A large stock of external debts had been acquired,  and it was very likely that the Allies would force Germany to pay them an additional sum in war reparations. Foreign exchange reserves were not sufficient to meet the existing stock of external debts,  let alone any additional reparation payments. Real interest rates were very negative,  and offered little compensation to creditors holding German currency/debt. The budget and the trade balance were also in very large deficits,  meaning that Germany would remain dependent on borrowing/monetization to finance expenditures and consumption. Finally,  the experience of high inflation,  money printing,  and negative total returns in holding the mark had begun to reduce trust in the German currency/debt as a store hold of value.

### November 1918–March 1920: The Treaty of Versailles and the First Inflation

News of the German surrender in November 1918 was met with a wave of capital flight out of Germany. German citizens and firms rushed to convert their wealth into the currencies and assets of the victorious powers,  not knowing what the terms of the peace would be or exactly how the German government would pay for its massive stock of liabilities now that it had lost the war. Over the next few months,  the mark declined about 30 percent against the dollar,  the German stock market lost almost half its real value,  and government debt in local currency rose by about 30 percent,  almost all of which had to be monetized by the central bank. As a result,  the money supply grew by about 50 percent and the inflation rate climbed to 30 percent.

**Source: Global Financial Data**

This capital flight occurred despite initial optimism that the final terms of the peace would not be particularly harsh. Many members of the German negotiation team hoped that reparations would be limited to damage done in territories occupied by German forces,  and would be paid primarily in goods instead of currency US President Woodrow Wilson’s emphasis on self-determination also led many Germans to believe that there would be no annexations of German territory without at least a referendum. Many Germans therefore expected that their country would come out of the war with its territory and economic capacity intact,  and that the reparation burden would not be too vindictive

When the final terms of the Treaty of Versailles were revealed,  they came as a huge shock. Germany was to lose 12 percent of its territory through annexations,  10 percent of its population,  43 percent of its pig-iron capacity,  and 38 percent of its steel capacity Germany was also required to compensate Allied citizens for all wealth seized during the war \(within Germany and in occupied territories\),  but it would receive no compensation for its own assets \(both real and financial\) that had been confiscated abroad. The German government would also have to honor all prewar debts to Allied creditors,  even if they were the debts of private citizens. As for reparations,  a commission was to be established in 1921 that would determine the final bill after evaluating Germany’s capacity to pay and giving its government another chance to be heard on the subject. In the interim,  Germany would pay an equivalent of 20 billion marks in gold,  commodities,  ships,  securities,  and other real assets to compensate the Allies for the costs of occupation

Germany had no option but to agree to these terms or face total occupation. It signed the treaty on June 28,  1919. This triggered another sharp plunge in the exchange rate with the mark falling 90 percent against the dollar between July,  1919 and January,  1920. Inflation surged,  hitting 140 percent by the end of the year. Once again,  the mark’s drop was driven primarily by **German citizens rushing to get their capital out of the country because they justifiably feared that these promises to deliver currency \(i.e.,  these debt obligations\) would make it very difficult,  if not impossible,  for the German government to meet its liabilities with hard money. To do that,  the Reich would have to levy extortionately high taxes and confiscate private wealth. As the real wealth of private citizens was at risk,  getting out of the currency and the country made sense.**

**As the mark fell,  German debtors with external liabilities saw the real expenses of their debts soar. They rushed to pay off as many of their foreign debts as they could**,  flooding the foreign exchange market. This further weakened the mark,  triggering additional rounds of capital flight. This dynamic is also very common in countries with large foreign currency denominated debt during a debt/balance of payments crisis. As a prominent Hamburg industrialist noted at the time,  “We are driving ourselves to destruction if everyone now…secretly sells mark notes in order to be able to meet his obligations. If things keep on this way,  the mark notes will become unusable.”29

**To be clear: at this point money printing was not the source of the currency weakness so much as currency weakness was the cause of money printing. In other words,  capital flight from the currency and the country was driving the currency down,  which in turn helped drive higher inflation. That’s classically how inflationary depressions happen.**

Naturally,  as money leaves a currency/debt market,  that puts the central bank in the position of having to choose between a\) allowing the liquidity and debt markets to tighten up a lot and b\) printing money to fill in the void. Central banks typically print money to fill the void,  which causes currencies to decline. **While currency declines hurt importers and those with debts in foreign currencies,  devaluations are stimulative for the economy and its asset markets,  which is helpful during a period of economic weakness.** Currency declines provide a boost to exports and profit margins,  as they make a country’s goods cheaper on international markets. Simultaneously,  they make imports more expensive,  supporting domestic industries. Devaluations also cause assets to rise in value when measured in local currency,  and they attract capital from abroad as a country’s financial assets become cheaper in global currency terms.

From July 1919 through March 1920,  the decline in the mark and negative real rates provided a boost to the German economy and its equity and commodity markets.

The export industry also thrived,  unemployment declined,  and as real wages remained low,  business profitability improved. You can see the decline in unemployment and the pickup in exports in the charts below. \(Note that all unemployment statistics from the time only show unemployment among trade union members,  so they likely understate the true amount of unemployment and hardship in German society. However,  they do show that employment conditions were improving.\)

There was also the hope that by encouraging exports and discouraging imports,  the mark’s decline would be a one-off and would help bring the German balance of payments into equilibrium. According to one prominent German official:

*“I regard our gravely ailing currency as an admirable means of dispelling the hatred felt abroad towards Germany,  and of overcoming the reluctance to trade with us by our enemies. The American who no longer gets for his dollar 4.21 marks worth of goods from us,  but 6.20 marks worth,  will rediscover his fondness for Germany.”*30

German policy makers also began considering ways to deal with the domestic debt burden and the fiscal deficit. As one official described policy since the end of the war,  “All we have done is keep printing.”31 To reduce the deficit,  and raise revenues to meet debt liabilities,  a comprehensive tax-reform package was proposed by finance minister Matthias Erzberger. Known as the “Erzberger Financial Reform,  ” the package would transfer from the “haves” to the “have-nots” by levying highly progressive taxes on income and wealth \(with top rates for income approaching 60 percent,  and those for wealth at 65 percent\)

Passed in December 1919,  the Erzberger Reforms would go on to increase the share of the Reich’s income coming from direct taxes to 75 percent \(the 1914 figure had been about 15 percent\) and raise enough revenue to pay for all government expenditures except reparations by 1922.33 Prior to these reforms,  the majority of the government revenue came from public enterprises \(primarily railroads\),  as well as specific duties on exports,  imports,  and coal.

The beneficial results of currency weakness led many German policy makers to advocate relying on currency weakness and inflation \(from rising import prices and central bank printing\) as an effective alternative to “confiscatory taxation.”34 One such official was Dr. Friedrich Bendixen,  who argued that “every effort to collect the monstrous sum through taxes will weaken our productivity and thus reduce receipts and drive the Reich to economic collapse…only the transformation of the war loans into money can bring salvation.”35 Inflation would “cleanse” Germany of its local currency war debts and allow it to “begin a new life on the basis of new money.” Although this program was explicitly rejected by the central bank,  it recognized that things might “develop along these lines anyway.” They did: inflation climbed to almost 200 percent,  and by the end of 1919 it had reduced the domestic war-debt burden to about 25 percent of its original 1918 value. As you might imagine,  those with wealth scrambled to buy foreign currencies or real assets to prevent their wealth from being either inflated or taken away

**The central bank’s alternative to allowing inflation to “naturally” reduce the real debt burden was to tighten [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and engineer a deflationary recession.** This would allow the Reich to pay back its citizens something closer to the true value of their loaned wealth,  but it would also crush domestic credit creation and demand,  generating significant unemployment. **Germany faced the classic dilemma: whether to help those who are long the currency \(i.e.,  creditors who hold debt denominated in it\) or those who are short it \(i.e.,  debtors who owe it\). In economic crises,  policies to redistribute wealth from “haves” to “have-nots” are more likely to occur. This is because the conditions of the “have-nots” become intolerable and also because there are more “have-nots” than “haves.”**

At the time,  relieving debt burdens and redistributing wealth were higher priorities than preserving the wealth of creditors. Unemployment was still high,  food shortages were rampant,  and a large mass of returning soldiers from the front needed jobs so they could be reintegrated into the economy. Clashes between capitalists and workers,  as are typical in depressions,  were also happening all across Europe. There had been a Communist revolution in Russia in 1917,  and Communist ideas were spreading around the world. Commenting on the choice between inflation and deflation at the time,  the legendary British economist John Maynard Keynes wrote: “The inflation is unjust and deflation is inexpedient. Of the two perhaps deflation is the worse,  because it is worse in an impoverished world to provoke unemployment than to disappoint the rentier \[i.e.,  the capitalist lender\].”37

Although levels of activity remained very depressed,  by late 1919/early 1920 Germany had inflated away most of its domestic debt,  passed a comprehensive tax-reform package to generate new revenues,  and was beginning to see a pickup in economic activity. There was also some good news on the reparations front. To relieve growing tensions between Germany and the Allies,  the Allies invited Germany to submit its own proposal for how much the reparation bill should be. Critics of a harsh settlement,  such as John Maynard Keynes,  were finding increasing sympathy in official circles abroad. The exchange rate also began to stabilize

However,  conflicts between the Left and Right remained intense in Germany. In March 1921,  right-wing nationalist groups led by Wolfgang Kapp attempted to overthrow the Weimar government and institute an autocratic monarchist regime in its place. The coup collapsed within a matter of days after workers refused to cooperate with the new government and declared a general strike Although a complete failure,  the “Kapp Putsch” was a reminder of how fragile the political environment remained,  and was another example of how **the economic pain of deleveragings/depressions can give rise to populist and reactionary leaders on *both* the Left and the Right.** As one frustrated Berlin businessman put it:

*“Just at the moment when we begin again to work more than before…when in London the recognition is mounting that through the imposition of the Versailles Treaty one has committed a fearful political stupidity,  and that accordingly the exchange rate begins to improve,  the military party…under the leadership of a man who is a notorious reactionary,  again throws everything overboard and forces our workers into a general strike and demonstrations that are unnecessary because nothing will be achieved that way.”*40

### March 1920 to May 1921: Relative Stabilization

The fourteen months between March 1920 and May 1921 were a period of “relative stabilization.”41 The mark halted its slide,  prices remained stable,  and the German economy outperformed the rest of the developed world. Germany wasn’t collapsing from either economic or political chaos,  as many had predicted,  and those shorting the mark lost considerable sums \(a notable case is John Maynard Keynes,  who personally lost about £13,  000 on the trade\)

The global backdrop at the time was one of severe contraction,  driven by tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] in the US and UK. For example,  between 1920 and 1921,  industrial production fell by 20 percent in the US and 18.6 percent in the UK,  while unemployment climbed to 22 percent and 11.8 percent respectively

In contrast to other central banks,  the Reichsbank kept [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] very easy—the discount rate remained at 5 percent until 1922.44 The Reichsbank also regularly intervened to inject additional liquidity when credit conditions tightened. For instance,  in the spring of 1921,  when business liquidity tightened moderately,  the Reichsbank responded by accelerating its purchases of commercial bills \(from 3.1 percent to 9 percent of bills outstanding\) Fiscal policy also remained accommodative,  with real expenditures \(ex-reparations\) rising in 1920 and 1921.46 Although the budget deficit narrowed,  it remained huge—roughly 10 percent of GDP—and continued to be financed by the issuance of floating debt.

**Source: Global Financial Data**

**The stimulative policies allowed Germany to escape the global contraction and enjoy relatively strong economic conditions.** Between 1919 and 1921,  industrial production increased by 75 percent\! However,  as you can see in the charts below,  levels of economic activity remained extremely depressed \(e.g.,  industrial production and real GDP were still well below 1913 levels\),  and there was considerable poverty and suffering in German society. This period should be understood as one of growth within a larger period of economic contraction.

Rising economic activity and reflationary policies did not result in much inflation in Germany between March 1920 and May 1921,  as domestic inflationary pressures were being offset by global deflationary forces. Import prices from the US and UK fell by about 50 percent,  and rising [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] into the outperforming German economy helped to stabilize the currency,  which allowed for slower growth in the money supply. As you can see in the charts below,  this was a significant turnaround. The mark rallied,  inflation declined,  and by early 1921 prices stopped rising for the first time since 1914.

There was also considerable optimism about the German economy abroad—in fact,  it became the new hot economy to invest in,  as reflected by foreigners’ willingness to pour money into it,  which financed an ever-growing trade deficit. In fact,  some commentators at the time began referring to Germany’s surging capital inflows as a “tremendous” speculative bubble,  with Keynes even calling it “the greatest ever known.” **Many of those flooding the market with mark orders were new buyers,  with no prior experience in the market they were trading—one of the classic signs of a bubble.** According to Keynes:

*“\[From those\] in the streets of the capital…\[to\] barber’s assistants in the remotest townships of Spain and South America…the argument has been the same…Germany is a great and strong country; someday she will recover; when that happens the mark will recover also,  which will bring a very large profit.”*47

For some perspective on the size of these inflows,  by 1921 almost a third of all deposits in the seven largest German banks were foreign-owned These speculative inflows supported a relative stabilization in the mark. **It also made the central bank’s job much easier by reducing the inherent trade-offs between growth and inflation. As explained in my description of the archetypal template,  when capital is flowing into a country,  it tends to lower the country’s inflation rate and stimulate its growth rate \(all other things being equal\); when capital leaves,  it tends to do the opposite,  making the central bank’s job much more difficult.**

Strong capital inflows also meant that the German economy became increasingly dependent on “hot money” \(i.e.,  speculative investments that could be pulled out at a moment’s notice\) continuing to come in,  year after year,  to finance fiscal and external deficits As is classic in the bubble phase of any balance of payments crisis,  **increasing dependence on capital inflows to maintain levels of spending and economic activity made the economic recovery fragile,  and sensitive to any minor event that could trigger a shift in sentiment** vis-à-vis the future prospects of the German economy.

The mark’s sharp appreciation in early 1920 was an unwelcome development for policy makers because a falling mark was considered essential to maintaining German export competitiveness,  supporting employment growth,  and building a savings pool of hard currency earnings. It was considered the “one good fortune in the midst of misfortune,  ” without which Germany would lose the possibility of exports The initial appreciation hit exports hard,  with the chamber of commerce going as far as to say that industry had practically “ground to a halt.”51 Unemployment surged,  with the number of trade union members reported as unemployed tripling. For these reasons,  the economic ministry intervened between March and June 1920—aiming to deliberately depress the mark and stimulate employment. It worked. The mark fell,  competitiveness returned,  and unemployment once again began to decline

During this period,  German policy makers were more concerned about deflationary forces spreading to Germany than the inflation that their stimulative policies could cause. Rising unemployment,  and the potential social unrest it could cause,  were considered much more menacing than the return of rising prices. As the reconstruction minister told a prominent industrialist:

*“\[I\] am not afraid of the inflation…if the crisis which has already broken out to its full extent in England were not to come over to us,  we should allow the printing press to do a bit more work and begin rebuilding the country. This activity would enable us to build a dam against the crisis.”*53

Of course,  the stabilization of the mark,  inflation,  and economic conditions remained contingent on large speculative inflows into Germany and a stable balance of payments.

### ****May 1921: The London Ultimatum

The arguments between Germany and the Allies over reparations came to a head with “The London Ultimatum” in May 1921,  in which the Allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin within six days if Germany did not accept the new reparation bill. Total reparations were set at 132 billion gold marks \(about 330 percent of German GDP\). Payments for the first 50 billion were scheduled to begin immediately,  in quarterly installments of 750 million \(or 3 billion a year\). This was a debt-service burden of around 10 percent of German GDP,  or 80 percent of export earnings Payments for the remaining 70 billion would begin whenever the Allied powers,  not Germany,  determined its economy capable of doing so. Not only did Germany have to service a huge hard currency debt burden,  it also had to live with the threat of its debt service payments tripling at a moment’s notice.

The reparations demanded were enormous and dashed expectations that a far more conciliatory agreement would be reached. The structure of the payments was also deeply unnerving to potential investors and the German public,  as it meant that debt service burdens would likely get bigger if economic conditions improved For context,  the chart below shows the size of the hard currency debts imposed on Germany relative to other economies prior to entering major inflationary depressions. As you can see,  Weimar Germany dwarfs every other case. The second chart shows Germany’s debt as a percent of GDP between 1914 and 1922.

As soon as the reparation burden was announced,  the mark began selling off; it declined by 75 percent by the end of the year. Inflation also returned,  with prices almost doubling over the same period. For one prominent German participant at Versailles,  the ultimatum fulfilled his worst fears:

*“The world must be made to understand that it is impossible to burden a country with debts and at the same time to deprive it of the means of paying them…the most complete collapse of the currency…cannot…be avoided if the peace treaty is maintained in its current form.”*56

**The reparation schedule created a balance of payments crisis. In many ways,  a balance of payments crisis is just like any other serious problem faced by individuals,  households,  and corporations in making a payment. To come up with the money,  a country must either 1\) spend less,  2\) earn more,  3\) finance the payments through borrowing and/or tapping into savings,  or 4\) default on the debt \(or convince creditors to give it relief\).** Unlike its domestic war loans,  Germany could not print away the debt burden,  as the debts were not denominated in paper marks. Policy makers would need to rely on some combination of the four levers outlined above.

***Cutting Spending Would Be Extremely Painful and Politically Dangerous***

Since about 50 percent of the German government’s total revenues would have to be spent on reparations,  cuts in nonreparation expenses would need to be drastic to make a difference Because most nonreparation spending was going towards essential social services—unemployment relief,  subsidies for food and housing,  and funding for leading public employers,  such as the railways and shipyards—large spending cuts were considered “politically impossible.” With the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and its ongoing bloody civil war,  as well as the growing Communist movement in Germany,  policy makers feared a potential revolution from the left. Simultaneously,  the increasingly humiliating demands of the Allied powers,  and the economic pain that came from meeting them,  were fueling far-right nationalism. Fears of political chaos intensified as strikes,  riots,  and acts of political violence became increasingly common. During the summer of 1920,  a state of emergency had to be declared following widespread looting;58 in March 1921,  Communist groups seized control of several shipyards and factories and were only dispersed following firefights with police;59 and in October 1921,  finance minister Matthias Erzberger was assassinated by ultranationalists for his role in the 1918 surrender Given this context,  it should not be surprising that the government refused to cut back on social spending and the Reichsbank refused to stop monetizing the deficit.

***Tax Burdens Were Already Extremely High***

While cutting spending was untenable,  so was raising income by levying additional taxes. The problem was that the Erzberger Reforms of 1919 \(discussed above\) had already raised tax burdens considerably. Increasing this burden posed the same political/social risks as cutting back on spending—i.e.,  any additional tax increases would not only prove immensely difficult to pass \(the Erzberger Reforms themselves had been watered-down significantly by opposition in the Reichstag\),  but would also be likely to accelerate capital flight. Commenting on the impossibility of meeting the reparation burden through taxation,  Keynes wrote “the whips and scorpions of any government recorded in history \[would not have been\] potent enough to extract nearly half…\[the required\] income from a people so situated.”61

***Existing Savings Were Extremely Limited and Securing Lending in Sufficient Size Was Impossible***

There were virtually no savings to draw on to service those debts. The Treaty of Versailles had essentially seized or frozen all of Germany’s prewar foreign holdings and canceled all debts owed to Germans. Moreover,  those with foreign currency savings \(primarily exporters\) were incentivized to keep their earnings in foreign bank accounts,  precisely because they had reason to fear the reparations burden would encourage a government seizure of their wealth. As for the central bank’s gold reserves,  they were not enough to cover even the first interest payment.

Further,  there was little appetite internationally to extend Germany credit on a scale that would allow it to spread out its reparation burden. This was for two reasons. First,  most developed world economies were burdened by war debts of their own \(primarily owed to the United States\) and were also in the midst of severe recessions. Second,  the German government \(and most Germans\) weren’t creditworthy. For instance,  when the head of the Reichsbank approached the Bank of England for a 500 million gold mark short-term loan to meet the second reparation installment,  he was “politely refused.”62 According to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time,  “the difficulty was that there was a vicious circle. Germany said she could not stop the emission of paper money and repay her obligations unless she was able to raise a foreign loan,  and she could not raise a foreign loan unless she could pay her obligations.”63

Of course,  defaulting on the debt unilaterally was impossible,  because Germany had been threatened with an invasion. Though its leaders furiously and continuously tried to renegotiate the payments,  bitter feelings from the war \(which had ended just a couple of years earlier\) made the victors,  especially France,  disinclined to make concessions.

**Unlike a household facing a payment problem,  a country can change the amount of existing currency,  and by doing so affect its value. This gives it an additional lever to manage a balance of payments crisis.** While the Reichsbank could try to defend the currency by raising rates and tightening credit,  which would increase the returns on holding mark denominated assets/deposits for creditors,  and thereby attract more capital from abroad while discouraging capital flight at home,  it would also crush domestic demand,  reduce imports,  and help close the trade deficit. That would require an unimaginably severe contraction in consumption,  which would have been intolerable for this already impoverished and conflict-ridden society to bear.

The only remaining alternative was to allow the currency to depreciate and print money to alleviate any potential tightening in liquidity that resulted from the flight of marks abroad.

As we noted in the template,  **the most important characteristic of cases that spiral into hyperinflation is that policy makers don’t close the imbalance between income and spending/debt service; instead,  they fund and keep funding spending over sustained periods of time by printing lots of money.** Of course,  some targeted money printing is typical in any balance of payments crisis—and,  if not overused,  is helpful,  because it prevents the economic contraction from getting too severe. **But when there is too much reflationary printing of money/monetization,  and too severe a currency devaluation \(which is reflationary\) relative to the other levers for managing a deleveraging—especially the deflationary levers of austerity and debt restricting/default—the most severe inflationary depressions can and do occur.**

**The reparation schedule—and the extreme difficulty of using austerity,  dissaving,  external borrowing,  and debt defaults as levers—pushed German policy makers to rely exclusively on money printing to manage the crisis.** While policy makers knew this would contribute to inflation,  they wagered that it would be the least terrible of their terrible choices. In my opinion,  they made a mistake in not trying to achieve a better balance between deflationary forces and inflationary ones.

### ****June 1921–December 1921: The Emerging Inflationary Spiral

The second half of 1921 saw the **classic dynamics of an inflationary spiral emerge. Germany’s impossible set of foreign debt obligations was contributing to currency declines,  which caused inflation and a liquidity crisis. The central bank provided liquidity by printing money and buying debt,  rather than allowing commerce to deeply contract. This,  in turn,  triggered further rounds of capital flight,  inflation,  tightening liquidity,  and money printing,  so the spiral accelerated.** In the midst of this,  the central bank depleted a substantial portion of its gold reserves to cover the first reparation payments.

The spiral was still relatively contained compared to what was to come a year later,  mainly as foreigners continued to support the German balance of payments by purchasing German assets. But reparation payments and local capital flight caused the mark to decline 75 percent over the period and inflation accelerated,  approaching 100 percent per annum. The sharpest declines came in October 1921,  following the League of Nation’s decision to cede Upper Silesia \(an important coal mining and industrial region\) to Poland,  despite a majority vote by its residents to remain in Germany

**Rising inflation led to a surge in retail purchases. This pickup in demand was not a sign of increasing economic activity but rather a flight of income and savings into real goods before inflation could eat away at the purchasing power of money.** The American Council of Hamburg spoke of a “vast amount of retail buying,  ” while the *Hamburgische Correspondent* referred to a “monstrous lust for goods.”65 The situation soon came to be described as one of “general liquidation,  ” because between foreigners buying a lot since the mark was cheap and Germans buying goods to escape inflation,  the shelves in the shops were bare. A Berlin official reported shock at the “plundering of the retailers by foreigners with highly valued currencies,  ” while a British observer lamented that “many shops declare themselves to be sold out; others close from 1 to 4 in the afternoon,  and most of them refuse to sell more than one article of the same kind to each customer…Germans \[are\] laying in stores for fear of a further rise in prices or a total depletion of stocks.”66

The same pressures led to a massive increase in consumer-durable and real-asset purchases. Auto sales climbed to all-time highs,  the textile trade had bookings several months in advance,  cotton firms refused to take new orders,  and most industries found themselves operating at full capacity and having to introduce overtime to meet the growing demand for goods Once again,  this burst of economic activity was not a sign of economic prosperity,  but a classic flight into inflation-hedge assets. According to one Bavarian official:

*“The fall of the mark…has brought a real anxiety among the propertied classes. Everyone seeks to do something with their money. Everything is bought that can be bought,  not only for present need,  not only for future use,  but in order to get rid of the paper and have objects to exchange when the time comes that it is worth absolutely nothing.”*68

As the central bank kept market interest rates anchored at 5 percent \(by increasing purchases when liquidity tightened\),  and as inflation was generally 10x higher,  **the real return on lending became very unattractive and the real cost of borrowing \(i.e.,  real interest rates\) plummeted.**69 **This led to a surge in borrowing,  which became extremely attractive.**70 As a result,  real investment reached prewar highs71 and monthly [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] rates declined by 75 percent However,  there was very little in this investment that was productive. Firms would push borrowed money into capital less for its “use value” than for its “intrinsic value.” Firms that did not do this,  and kept most of their wealth in debt assets \(such as bonds\),  suffered devastating losses. This time was called the “flight from the mark to the machine”; it resulted in many excessive investments that performed poorly once the inflation had passed Of course,  all of this accelerated inflation and reinforced the spiral.

**Growing demand for real goods led to increasing employment in the industries that produced those goods.**74 **So unemployment fell and workers’ bargaining power increased as they pushed for wage increases and better working hours.** In the summer of 1921,  numerous standoffs between employers and laborers led to large nominal wage gains. However,  these gains were not enough to keep up with inflation and workers still saw their real incomes fall by about 30 percent This made tensions between the “haves” and the “have-nots” even worse.

**The only sector of the economy that saw some clear benefit from the collapse of the mark was the export sector. Foreign sales increased as German goods became cheaper on the international market.** However,  the pickup in exports was less than it ordinarily would have been,  given such a large decline in the currency,  for two reasons: First,  there was considerable hostility to German exports abroad,  even as they became cheaper,  which limited the potential gains from a depreciating currency. Second,  labor costs were also declining in the rest of the developed world,  as a result of deflation from the severe global recession,  limiting the potential competitiveness gains from the depreciating mark.

The second half of 1921 also saw what one commentator called “an orgy of speculation” in the stock market Stocks nearly tripled in value over the period \(in inflation-adjusted terms\) and in August the Berlin stock exchange was so overloaded with orders that it was forced to shut down three times a week. By November,  operating days were reduced to just one day a week and banks refused to take orders for shares after 10 a.m. According to one newspaper,  “Today there is no one—from lift-boy,  typist,  and small landlord to the wealthy lady in high society—who does not speculate in industrial securities and who does not study the list of official quotations as if it were a most precious letter.”77

Once again,  **this bull market was not driven by improving economic fundamentals,  or a more optimistic discounting of future economic conditions. It reflected a rush to get out of money or to get short money \(i.e.,  borrow it\) against a long “stuff” position.** According to one observer:

*“Stock market speculation today is the organized flight from the mark…at a time when the return on an investment diminishes in the same ratio as the value of the paper mark and when therefore even the solid capitalist,  if he does not want to impoverish himself from day to day,  must acquire real values. This alone has led to an extraordinary increase in the stock market business.”*78

By the end of 1921,  deteriorating economic conditions,  the absence of faith in the mark,  and rapidly rising prices began to threaten an economic and/or political collapse. At the time,  the inflation rate was nearing 100 percent. The only thing preventing a total collapse was the foreigners’ willingness to continue to buy marks and fund Germany’s massive external deficit \(about 10 percent of GDP\). As the chart below illustrates,  despite the loss of confidence in the mark at home,  many foreigners kept purchasing German assets at cheap prices.

### ****January 1922–May 1922: Negotiating a Reparation Moratorium

Alarmed by the chaos in Germany,  the Allied powers concluded that the German economy needed some relief from reparation payments This was encouraging because at this stage it was the reparation debt burden that was most crushing and most inescapable. Continuing with the status quo ran the risk of a total economic collapse,  which would worsen the political chaos at the heart of Europe,  while making it impossible to collect any reparation payments in the future. However,  there remained considerable disagreement among the Allied powers as to the extent of such relief and what,  if anything,  Germany should be required to give in return.

Central to the matter was a tension between the desire for vengeance and the limitation of German power,  and the recognition that economic realities dictated that some compromises be made. **This flavor of debtor/creditor standoff is classic during deleveragings. Naturally,  the debtors \(i.e.,  Germans\) demanded as much relief as they could get and the creditors \(i.e.,  the Allied powers\) tried to get as much money back as they could without plunging the debtor economy into insolvency. The game of power brinksmanship was played by all.** Commenting on the dynamics at the time,  J.P. Morgan,  Jr. reportedly told a confidant:

*“The Allies must make up their minds as to whether they wanted a weak Germany who could not pay,  or a strong Germany who could pay. If they wanted a weak Germany they must keep her economically weak; but if they wanted her to be able to pay they must allow Germany to exist in a condition of cheerfulness,  which would lead to successful business. This meant,  however,  that you would get a strong Germany,  and a Germany that was strong economically would,  in a sense,  be strong from a military point of view also.”*80

The question of restructuring Germany’s reparation payments was discussed at a conference in Cannes,  France,  in January 1922. A temporary compromise was reached under which the Reparations Commission reduced the debt service bill by 75 percent for the remainder of the year,  provided Germany agreed to raise new taxes \(including a forced loan of a billion gold marks on its wealthy citizens\),  reduced spending and money printing,  and granted the Reichsbank formal independence from the government These concessions were mostly symbolic. The taxes agreed to were far too small to meaningfully close the budget deficit and the president of the Reichsbank,  Rudolf Havenstein,  said he welcomed more independence,  as it would allow him to print as much money as was needed to ensure liquidity without constraints from fiscal policy makers

Renewed optimism about meaningful relief from reparations halted the mark’s slide. By the end of January,  it had risen 30 percent from its 1921 lows,  and inflation,  while remaining high \(about 140 percent per annum\),  had stopped accelerating. The inflationary spiral was halted for now,  providing much-needed relief to the German economy. As negotiations progressed,  German policy makers pressed the Allies for additional concessions,  arguing forcefully that it was the balance of payments,  and not the central bank’s money printing,  that was ultimately responsible for the inflationary crisis. In a speech to the Reichstag on March 29,  Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau told German lawmakers:

*“Over and over again we encounter the notion that if the value of our money has been ruined this can only be because we have printed money. The recipe which we are given against this is: stop your printing press,  bring your budget in order,  and the misfortune is ended. A grave economic error\!…\[How is it possible\] to make continuous gold payments without the help of foreign loans and at the same time keep the exchange rate intact? The attempt has never been made to give such a prescription and it cannot be given. For a country that does not produce gold cannot pay in gold unless it buys this gold with export surpluses \[which Germany did not have\] or unless it is borrowed \[which Germany could not do\].”*83

As you can see,  the mechanics of economics and markets were simple and basically the same then as they are now. While the central bank could easily extinguish its domestic currency denominated debt \(in the ways previously described\) it could not easily extinguish its external debts \(for previously explained reasons\).

From February until May,  expectations surrounding the currency continued to be driven primarily by news of the reparation negotiations When news suggested there would be a comprehensive agreement,  the mark rallied,  and inflation expectations fell When new information suggested that an agreement was less likely,  the mark fell and inflation expectations rose The mark experienced numerous 10 to 20 percent swings on such changes of sentiment,  and by the end of May was down about 40 percent versus the dollar,  as the prospects of a reparation agreement deteriorated.

The chart below gives a taste of how new pieces of information on the reparation negotiations led to major swings in the mark. As you can see from the below table,  the markets chopped up and down in big moves every time there was essentially any update on reparation negotiations. Imagine having to trade through such volatility\!

### ****June 1922–December 1922: Hyperinflation Begins

In June 1922,  expectations of a reparation settlement collapsed,  as did the mark. This was due to three interconnected events: First the French,  who had always been the most reluctant among the Allied powers to reduce reparation burdens,  declared they would no longer accept the conclusions of the Reparation Commission regarding Germany’s capacity to pay Rather,  France would make its own determinations on what German reparations should be,  and would seize German assets,  particularly some of its most productive assets \(i.e.,  the coal mines in the Ruhr\),  if Germany defaulted Instead of a possible moratorium,  Germany would now have to pay France whatever the French thought was appropriate,  or risk a sustained occupation of some of its most valuable territory.

The French declaration also undermined an additional plan to support the German economy. An international committee had been established,  headed by the American financier JP Morgan,  Jr.,  to investigate the possibility of extending Germany a gold loan to rebuild its economy and ease the burden of external debt. However,  this loan was contingent on progress on a reparation moratorium,  for without it such a loan could almost certainly not be paid back. Following the French declaration,  the loan committee was forced to conclude that extending credit to Germany was impossible

Finally,  on June 24,  Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau was assassinated by a right wing group. Rathenau,  despite some of his belligerent speeches,  was one of the few German politicians who was trusted by the Allied powers and enjoyed significant support at home If there was anyone who could mediate a settlement with the Reparations Commission and get it through the Reichstag,  it was Rathenau. Of course,  this also illustrates the threat of nationalism and extremist populism that was hanging over Germany.

**Unlike earlier,  foreigners now rushed to pull their capital from Germany.** As noted previously,  about a third of all deposits in German banks were foreign-owned,  and foreign speculation had been a huge source of support for the German economy and balance of payments. Over the next few months,  about two thirds of these deposits disappeared and capital inflows collapsed Simultaneously,  capital flight of Germans wanting to get out accelerated; well-to-do citizens rushed to get their wealth out before the confiscatory taxes agreed to in the January compromise came into effect. The mark collapsed and hyperinflation began.

**The result was an acute liquidity crisis in the German banking system that led to runs on the banks.** The rate of central bank printing was no longer fast enough to keep up with the flight of marks abroad and rising prices. By July,  banks were forced to go on three-day work weeks,  and had to inform their depositors that they did not have enough cash on hand to either honor their deposits or make weekly wage payments for their large business clients Some even began printing their own marks,  which was illegal. **The liquidity crisis was self-reinforcing. Depositors,  seeing that the banks were struggling to honor their liabilities,  began withdrawing their deposits in ever-growing numbers,  which only made the liquidity crisis worse.**

By August 1922,  the economy was on the brink of financial collapse. The central bank was forced to respond by rapidly accelerating the pace at which it was printing marks and monetizing a growing share of government debt.

The central bank also began purchasing commercial bills en masse. As the liquidity crisis deepened in the fall,  it additionally accelerated its provision of direct credits to the banking system. By the end of the year,  the Reichsbank would end up holding about one third of all commercial bills in circulation and would have increased its credits to the banking system by 1,  900 percent Such interventions helped prevent the financial system from collapsing,  and led to a ten-fold increase in the money supply.

Unlike past bouts of currency depreciation and money printing,  in which inflation would pick up substantially but never enter hyperinflation territory,  this round of currency depreciation and money printing sent inflation skyrocketing. Part of this was due to the scale of the liquidity injection that was needed to offset the pullback in foreign capital,  but part of it was also due to changing inflationary psychology. While most people had believed that inflation was being semi-managed,  now most believed it was out of control.

**In inflationary depressions,  it is classic that with each round of printing,  more money leaves the currency instead of going into economic activity.** As domestic currency holders see that investors that short cash \(i.e.,  borrow in the weakening currency\) and buy real/foreign assets are repeatedly better off than those who save and invest at home,  they increasingly catch on and shift from investing printed money in productive assets to purchasing real assets \(like gold\) and foreign currency. Foreign investors no longer return because they have been repeatedly burned.

As early as August,  with prices rising by over 50 percent a month and accelerating,  policy makers recognized that they were approaching a hyperinflationary spiral,  but they felt they had no alternative but to continue printing Why didn’t they stop?

**Once an inflationary depression reaches the hyperinflationary stage,  it is extremely difficult to stop printing. This is because when extreme capital flight and extreme inflation feed off one another,  money becomes harder to come by,  even as it loses its worth.** When Keynes visited Hamburg in the summer of 1922,  still in the early phase of the hyperinflation,  he vividly described the phenomenon:

*“The prices in the shops change every hour. No one knows what this week’s wages will buy at the end of the week. The mark is at the same time valueless and scarce. On the one hand,  the shops do not want to receive marks,  and some of them are unwilling to sell at any price at all. On the other hand…the banks were so short of ready cash that the Reichsbank advised them to cash no checks for more than 10,  000 marks…and some of the biggest institutions were unable to cash their customers’ checks for payment of weekly wages.”*95

**To stop printing would result in an extreme shortage of cash and bring about a total collapse of the financial system and all commerce.** As one economist noted at the time:

*“\[To stop the printing press\] would mean that in a very short time the entire public,  and above all the Reich,  could no longer pay merchants,  employees,  or workers. In a few weeks,  besides the printing of notes,  factories,  mines,  railways and post office,  national and local government,  in short,  all national and economic life would be stopped.”*96

**People tend to think that hyperinflations are caused by central banks recklessly printing too much money,  and all they need to do to stop it is to turn off the printing press.** If it were that easy,  hyperinflations would almost never occur\! Instead,  inflation spirals push policy makers into circumstances where printing is the least bad of several terrible options.

In the case of Weimar Germany,  the cost of not printing was not only potential economic collapse,  but political fragmentation. France’s repeated threats to occupy German territory if reparations were not paid made halting the printing press an invitation to a foreign invasion. It also lowered hopes for productive reparations negotiations. As one prominent industrialist put it at the time:

*“The Reichsbank can no more stop inflation than the Burgermeister of Hamburg can tell the patients in the hospital to stop being ill…as long as it is possible for the French to invade Germany,  there can be no talk of a stabilization of our currency.”*97

**By September,  Germany was trapped in a classic hyperinflationary spiral. Extreme capital withdrawals and rapidly rising prices were forcing the central bank to choose between extreme illiquidity and printing money at an accelerating rate. As doing the former would result in a total collapse in business activity,  there was really no choice. However,  as the money supply grew,  no one wanted to hold it in such a depreciating environment. The velocity of money accelerated,  triggering even more capital flight,  money printing,  and inflation,  and so on and so forth.**

You can see this relationship most vividly in the chart below—which must be shown in logarithmic terms due to the exponential growth rates in inflation and the money supply. As you can see,  currency weakness was leading inflation,  which was leading money supply growth—not the other way around. **Reckless money printing was less the cause of the hyperinflation than what was required to prevent massive deflationary defaults by banks \(and just about everyone else\) and a deflationary economic collapse.**

**Remember that money and credit serve two purposes: As a medium of exchange and a store hold of wealth. As the spiral accelerated,  the mark completely lost its status as a store hold of value.** People rushed to exchange it for any available alternative—real goods,  foreign exchange,  and capital equipment. **Very soon,  exponential rates of inflation made it impractical to trade in marks,  so the currency also began to lose its status as a means of exchange.** Foreign currencies \(especially the dollar\) and even makeshift currencies became increasingly common in day-to-day transactions and price quotations. For instance,  local branches of the Reichsbank found that they did not have enough actual paper notes for businesses to meet their payroll obligations So,  the central bank and the finance ministry allowed some large depositors to print their own currencies. These were called Notgeld—which literally means “emergency money.”99 Soon,  everyone began considering whether the mark would go extinct. According to the *Frankfurter Zeitung*,  by October 1922:

*“German economic life is…dominated by a struggle over the survival of the mark: is it to remain the German currency,  or is it doomed to extinction? During the past few months foreign currencies have replaced it as units of account in domestic transactions to a wholly unforeseen extent. The habit of reckoning in dollars,  especially,  has established itself,  not only in firms’ internal accounting practice,  but above all as the method of price quotation in trade,  industry and agriculture.”*100

In a desperate attempt to calm the inflationary spiral,  on October 12 1922,  the government stepped in to stop the ever-growing flight into foreign currency. Restrictions were put on German citizens purchasing foreign FX **Such capital controls are a classic lever to control inflationary depressions; they are rarely successful. The reasons for this are that a\) capital controls have limited effectiveness at best because they are usually pretty easy to get around and b\) trying to trap people typically leads them to want to escape even more.** Not being able to get one’s money out of the country triggers a psychology that is analogous to the inability to get one’s money out of a bank: it produces fear that produces a run.

**The stock market was one of the few remaining domestic escapes from the inflation.** After declining 50 percent \(in real terms\) since June,  stocks actually rallied in the second half of October—but like the fall of 1921,  this rally had nothing to do with underlying economic conditions or the future prospects of the economy. In fact,  in the fall of 1922,  real profit margins were collapsing as the chaos of the hyperinflation hit productivity The rally was also extremely small in the context of the overall real stock market decline during the debt crisis.

See the charts below and imagine living through these conditions.

### ****January 1923–August 1923: The Occupation of the Ruhr and the Final Days of Inflation

In January 1923,  with the economy already in chaos and prompted by Germany missing a promised delivery of timber as a reparation payment,  a French-Belgian force invaded Germany and occupied the Ruhr \(Germany’s primary industrial region\). The French hoped that this action would pressure Germany to pay reparations more cooperatively and in the meantime allow France to extract payments in coal. The Germans responded by declaring “passive resistance.”103 Miners in the Ruhr would strike in an attempt to make the occupation as costly as possible for the French government. However,  this resistance would need to be subsidized by the Reich,  as both the miners and their employers would have to be paid. It also meant that about half of the country’s coal supply would need to be imported,  adding additional strain on the balance of payments As a result,  government spending increased,  the balance of payments deteriorated,  liquidity shortages pushed the Reichsbank to print even more,  and inflation,  which was already at astronomical levels,  accelerated even more.

France’s aggression left an opening for Germany in the reparation negotiations,  as the occupation of a country approaching economic ruin was widely denounced. To buy time,  the Reichsbank began issuing dollar denominated debt \(at a considerable discount to international prices due to its credit risk\) in order to buy marks—with the central bank targeting a peg against the dollar. Between January and June of 1923,  the Reichsbank sold about 400 million gold marks of borrowed foreign exchange and central bank reserves to defend the mark’s peg against the dollar. The central bank also raised rates to 18 percent \(but given that inflation was running at close to 10,  000 percent this was mostly a symbolic move\) According to the president of the Reichsbank:

*“The intervention did not…have as its purpose the permanent and final stabilization of the mark. Such an undertaking will only become possible when the reparations problem is seriously brought to a solution. What it had as its purpose was…to recover for the German economy…as long as possible…a time of somewhat calm…to free the market from wild and unscrupulous speculation and to protect the German people from a further rapid price increase which would have exhausted it.”*106

The FX intervention halted the mark’s slide \(it actually appreciated by 50 percent for the first three months of the intervention\) and introduced a brief period of deflation that certainly hurt the shorts However,  by May **it became clear that the Reichsbank did not have the reserves to pay out dollar denominated principal and interest payments and maintain the peg,  so the fixed exchange rate policy was abandoned six months after it was put in place** and hyperinflation returned stronger than before \(reaching 36,  000,  000,  000 percent by November 1923\)

Now the German economy found itself burdened by an additional stock of hard currency debt,  and the French reaffirmed their commitment to stay in the Ruhr as long as was necessary to get what they were owed. Throughout the summer,  some sporadic interventions in the FX market were attempted,  but none were able to curb inflation or prevent the downward spiral in the exchange rate Around this time,  the president of the Reich asked his finance minister to find new measures “to avert the complete collapse of our mark.” The finance minister replied “the complete collapse of the mark is already underway.”110

From July 1922 until November 1923 the mark depreciated by 99.99999997 percent versus the dollar \(i.e.,  the cost of dollars increased 1,  570 billion percent\) and prices rose by 387 billion percent\! For some perspective on what these numbers mean,  in 1913 a total of six billion marks circulated as currency and coin in the whole German economy. By late October 1923,  the entire stock of money in 1913 would just about get you a one kilo-loaf of rye bread Living through such chaos was immensely painful and traumatizing for German citizens—and experiences of the inflation would later serve to validate many of the criticisms made by Nazi politicians of the “disastrous” Weimar era.

### ****Late 1923 to 1924: Ending the Hyperinflation

By late 1923,  the hyperinflation had created intolerably painful conditions within Germany. Unemployment was rising rapidly,  inflation was well above 1,  000,  000 percent,  real tax revenues were diminishing at an alarming rate food was growing scarce,  and transacting with marks had become almost impossible Without an effective means of exchange,  the economic machine of the nation had ground to a halt. The resulting suffering stunned people of all walks of life. As one local mayor put it,  “I have never encountered such hordes of people starving and wandering about.”114 And all recognized that the crisis would soon boil over into mass riots or revolution Rudolf Wissell,  who would later serve as Germany’s minister of labor,  captured the prevailing sentiment of the period: “The inflation in which we find ourselves at this time is murdering the Republic. It will be the gravedigger of our Republic.”116

The Allied powers concluded that without substantial reparation relief,  German policy makers would remain helpless to avert a total collapse of the economy. So,  in November 1923 they suspended reparations payments and reopened negotiations with the Germans on restructuring the debt This gave German policy makers the breathing room they needed.

German policy makers took five crucial steps to curb inflation,  each following logically from the last:

1. 1\) To offload the reparations burden that started the crisis in the first place,  policy makers renegotiated payments with the Allies,  eventually reducing the debt service burdens to just 1 percent of GDP. With the crippling reparation burden made more manageable…
1. 2\) …A new currency was introduced,  the rentenmark,  which was backed by gold-denominated assets and land and pegged to the dollar. However,  as the new currency could fail if investors believed that it would be used to monetize debt payments…
1. 3\) …Strict limits were placed on the amount of rentenmarks that could be printed and the amount of debt that could be monetized. However,  a central bank can only credibly avoid monetizing debt if the government can pay its bills,  so…
1. 4\) …The German government took action to raise its revenues and cut its expenditures,  making deep,  extremely painful cuts. Similarly,  the central bank capped the amount they would loan to businesses and raised borrowing rates. To further build faith in the new currency…
1. 5\) …The central bank built up large reserves of foreign currency assets. They were able to do this by borrowing foreign exchange from the Allies and encouraging German citizens who had fled the currency during the hyperinflation to repatriate their savings.

Earlier one-off measures \(e.g.,  the short-lived currency peg,  capital controls\) hadn’t been enough—Germany needed a comprehensive and aggressive policy shift that abolished the currency,  accepted hard backing,  and placed extreme limits on monetization,  credit creation,  and government spending. It helped that years of economic crisis had made the public eager to find a currency that they could actually use. However,  none of this would have been possible if the reparation burden was not substantially reduced. After all,  why would any investor or saver want to hold German currency if they knew the government had huge external liabilities it could not pay?

Below,  we walk through each of these measures in detail,  moving roughly chronologically.

#### 1\) Restructuring the Reparations Debt

Although the process of negotiating with the Allies was slow,  drawn out,  and painful,  some critical concessions were secured very early that provided the breathing room that was necessary to implement the policy changes that ended the hyperinflation Without reparation relief,  the structural drivers of the inflation would have remained intact,  and it would have been highly unlikely that any new currency could have commanded faith as a store hold of wealth.

Significant progress came as early as September 1923,  when German industrialists in the Ruhr began to cooperate with the Weimar government in its negotiations with the French These industrial magnates had long resisted any concessions to France when it came to reparations payments,  but as conditions continued to deteriorate and workers began to riot,  they recognized the need for diplomacy,  and eventually agreed to resume coal transfers By mid-October,  the Weimar government was able to completely end its financial support of “passive resistance” to the Ruhr occupation,  both opening the way for progress in talks with the French and eliminating one of its largest expenses

The Weimar government quickly built on the progress it had made in the Ruhr. By the end of November,  British and French negotiators had created a new committee—the Dawes committee—to review and potentially reduce Germany’s reparations obligations Critically,  the committee agreed to suspend reparations payments until it came to its final conclusions—making it far easier for Germany to balance its budget during the stabilization period For the next 10 months,  Germany did not have to make a single hard currency payment to the reparations commission. Moreover,  when the Dawes Plan came into full force in August 1924,  it significantly and permanently eased Germany’s reparations burden Payments were rescheduled,  and debt service costs reduced,  to the point that reparations payments amounted to only one percent of German GNP in 1924 and 1925—a reduction of over 90 percent versus 1923.125

Although Germany would still have to pay the full 130 billion gold marks of reparations,  payments were now so spread out that it was possible to meet them. The chart below gives some perspective on how significant this shift was by comparing what Germany could have been asked to pay at any moment between 1921 and 1923 \(if the Allies had demanded Germany begin paying down the full reparation bill\),  what they actually had to pay between 1921 and 1923 \(i.e.,  the London Schedule,  under which some payments were suspended until the Allies thought Germany was capable of paying them\),  what debt service payments look like leading into the typical inflationary deleveraging,  and what Germany had to pay after reparation payments were restricted in 1924 \(i.e.,  the Dawes Plan\). As you can see,  the Dawes Plan dramatically reduced the FX debt service burden.

With the reparations debt service substantially reduced and the domestic debt mostly inflated away,  Germany’s debt burden was largely relieved.

#### 2\) Creating a New Currency

**Creating a new currency with very hard backing** is the most classic path that countries suffering from inflationary deleveragings follow in order to end them. In the Weimar case,  this currency replacement process came in roughly three stages,  beginning in August 1923 and ending in October 1924.126

The first steps toward replacing the mark were disorganized and reactive,  driven by necessity rather than by any definite plan. By the summer of 1923,  transacting in the mark had become so difficult that major institutions within Germany turned to alternatives,  even though these had their own flaws Many resorted to using foreign exchange in place of domestic currency. From late 1922 onward,  most major industries in Germany began to set prices in foreign currencies,  and by 1923 much of the wholesale trade within Germany was conducted directly in dollars,  francs,  or florins Those who could not access foreign currency turned to “emergency money” as a last resort. These emergency bills were issued by local governments,  trade associations,  or companies,  and were usually at least theoretically backed by real assets This emergency money,  though often illegal,  was easier to use than the paper mark,  and by the fall of 1923,  nearly 2,  000 types of it were actively circulating in Germany

Recognizing the need for a currency with a stable value,  the government attempted to give a stamp of authority to this informal system. Specifically,  in August 1923 it began issuing very small-denomination debt,  indexed to dollars,  which it hoped would be used as a temporary currency until a better solution could be found These “Gold Loan” bills could either be circulated directly or used as a more secure backing for other emergency currencies And,  though they were ultimately backed by nothing more than a stamp claiming they were “wertbestandig” \(stable value\) and a promise that the government could “raise supplements to the tax on capital” in order to honor them,  they did retain their value In fact,  the public was so desperate for a reliable store of wealth that the gold loan bills tended to be hoarded rather than used,  and they disappeared almost entirely from circulation shortly after being issued

The second phase of the transition to a new currency began on October 15,  1923,  when the government announced the creation of a new national bank—the Rentenbank—and a new stable-value currency,  the rentenmark,  which would enter circulation on November 15.135 Unlike previous efforts to create a currency with “stable value,  ” the more ambitious rentenmark scheme was an immediate,  “miraculous” success Crucially,  since rentenmarks could be exchanged for either a fixed quantity of paper marks or a fixed quantity of hard assets \(and vice versa\),  the hard backing behind the rentenmark applied not only to newly issued bills \(as had been the case with the gold loan bills\),  but to all of the paper marks already in circulation. Specifically,  the rentenmark was pegged to the paper mark at a ratio of one to one trillion,  and to the dollar at a ratio of 4.2 to one—a symbolically significant exchange rate,  as it set the gold value of the rentenmark equal to that of the pre-war,  peacetime mark

In the months that followed,  both of these pegged rates held,  and by December both the rentenmark and the newly-pegged paper mark were trading at par in foreign markets,  while inflation had fallen to sustainable levels

#### ****3\) Imposing Limits on Money Printing

The key to the new currency’s lasting success was that the Rentenbank issued relatively little of it and convincingly backed its issues with real assets. At the same time,  there weren’t large debts denominated in it—the total amount of credit the Rentenbank could extend was capped at 2.4 billion marks And,  unlike the old gold loan bills,  rentenmarks were directly secured by mortgages on 5 percent of all German agricultural and industrial property \(“renten” refers to the annuities paid on these mortgages\) Even more important than this direct backing was the implicit security provided by the Reichsbank’s gold reserves. By 1923 the real value of the money supply had been so reduced by the popular flight from paper marks that it could be backed entirely by the government’s reserves This reduction in the value of circulating currency was reinforced as the Reichsbank began cracking down on illegal emergency money following the introduction of the rentenmark and withdrew its gold loan bills from circulation

As shown on the chart below,  the monetary base in dollars had fallen to equal Germany’s gold reserves by 1923.

After a year of relative stability,  German policy makers implemented the third phase of the currency transition. On October 11,  1924,  they introduced another new hard currency \(the reichsmark\),  which could be purchased with rentenmarks at a one to one ratio. Unlike the rentenmark,  which had only been formally backed by mortgage bonds,  the new reichsmark could be exchanged directly for bullion at the Reichsbank. Specifically,  it could be converted into precisely the same quantity of gold as the pre-war mark All remaining paper marks were withdrawn from circulation by June 5,  1925,  while the old currency \(the rentenmark\) was gradually phased out over the next decade

But as we will see,  it took much more than a new currency to create a lasting stabilization. The rentenmark and reichsmark were crucial pieces of the reform process,  but they weren’t the only pieces. Currency depends on the credibility of the institutions issuing it. The fact that there were not a lot of promises to deliver currency \(i.e.,  not a lot of debt denominated in the new currencies\) meant that the central bank was not in the position of having to choose between inflationary monetization of debt and deflationary defaults on it. And the fact that the amount of the currency was limited to the amount of backing behind it meant it could be kept stable. The Rentenbank faced a difficult challenge as it attempted to gain credibility in the fall of 1923,  but it succeeded because its fundamentals were solid.

#### ****4\) Ending Monetization

**In order to build confidence in a new currency,  countries in inflationary deleveragings need to stop monetizing debt.** As long as the government can force the central bank to print to cover its liabilities,  there is a risk that the new currency will be debased and its supposedly hard backing abandoned. That is one of the reasons it is important that central banks be independent of the political system.

Reassurance that monetization would stop came in the form of two major announcements—one initially private and one quite public. First,  on August 18,  1923,  the Reichsbank informed the Weimar government that,  beginning in 1924,  it would not discount any additional government debt Though this memo was private,  it quickly circulated among the industrial elite,  and it spurred policy makers to seriously reconsider the need for fiscal reforms The second piece of reassuring news came on October 15,  1923,  when central bank officials publicly stated that the new Rentenbank would cap total government credits \(in this case at 1.2 billion rentenmarks\). Additionally,  its new policy would forbid the Reichsbank from monetizing any government debt after November 15.147

For a time,  both the public and the government itself doubted that the central bank and the Rentenbank would honor these promises. After all,  the Rentenbank lent the government the entirety of its 1.2 billion rentenmark allocation almost immediately And,  by December 1923,  the government had already requested an additional 400 million rentenmarks When officials at the Rentenbank stood firm,  however,  they successfully signaled the beginning of a new era of central bank independence—and the end of a long period of unchecked monetization.

#### 5\) Closing the Deficit

**When the central bank stops monetizing debts during an inflationary deleveraging,  the government can either find new creditors to finance its deficits,  close those deficits,  or take control over the central bank and continue monetizing debt. Since finding new creditors is usually impossible in an inflationary deleveraging,  and monetizing debt only postpones the problem,  the budget ultimately needs to be balanced.**

By late 1923,  the Weimar regime had come to the conclusion that it needed to close the deficits. There was no choice,  and with the debts largely relieved,  this was now possible. In the words of the German minister of finance,  “If we do not succeed in cutting loose from the inflationary economy through ruthless choking off of Reich expenditures,  then the only prospect we have is general chaos.”150

The government had run budget deficits since the outbreak of the war in 1914.151 However,  in August 1923,  the government took steps to address the problem by indexing certain taxes to inflation and passing additional emergency taxes By October,  it had indexed all taxes to inflation

Additionally,  the government took aggressive measures to reduce expenses,  dismissing 25 percent of its employees and cutting the salaries of the remainder by 30 percent The Weimar regime ended its expensive subsidies to workers engaged in “passive resistance” in the Ruhr Such austerity was extremely painful,  and would have been almost impossible to stomach a year or two before. But the hyperinflation had caused so much suffering and chaos by the end of 1923 that the German public was willing to do almost anything to bring prices back under control.

Most important,  though,  was the effect of more gradual inflation and a more stable exchange rate on the yield of existing taxes Temporary stabilization created a virtuous cycle of sorts: by reducing the rate of inflation,  the stabilization increased real tax receipts,  helping reduce budget strains and increasing the public’s confidence in the government’s ability to avoid future monetization. Following the introduction of the rentenmark in November,  real tax receipts increased rapidly,  rising from about 15 million gold marks in October 1923 to more than 300 million in December 1923.157

By January 1924,  the government was running a surplus

#### 6\) Tightening Credit

Officials decided to significantly tighten access to credit,  so private credit wouldn’t add to inflationary pressures. This tightening was implemented through two channels. First,  the government announced in February 1924 that it would “revalue” some privately held debts \(i.e.,  require debtors to give creditors more than face value\) These included mortgages,  bank deposits,  and industrial debentures whose values had fallen to almost nothing during the hyperinflation Although the policy was implemented to appease angry creditors,  it also worked as a tightening Just as debt reductions have the effect of easing credit,  weakening the currency,  and increasing inflation,  debt revaluations tighten credit,  support currencies,  and lower inflation.

Second—and more significantly—on April 7 1924,  the Reichsbank decided to cap the total amount of credit it would extend to the private sector. It wouldn’t call back any existing debt,  but it would extend new credit only as prior debts were paid off This strict cap on new credit creation was painful for businesses in the short term,  but it also meaningfully stabilized German inflation,  which turned slightly negative in May 1924.163

#### ****7\) Accumulating Foreign Exchange Reserves

Though all the programs,  policies,  and agreements described above put the German economy on progressively firmer footing,  not everyone was convinced they would ensure a permanent stabilization. In fact,  as Germany implemented its stabilization regime between November 1923 and October 1924,  speculators continually bet against the mark As long as Germany lacked a meaningful foreign exchange reserve,  these speculative attacks remained a threat to its continued stability.

Two major shifts helped restore Germany’s depleted foreign exchange reserves. The first was the transfer of privately held foreign currencies to the Reichsbank. As institutions and individuals within Germany gained increasing confidence in the new rentenmark as a means of exchange,  they began to convert the foreign currency they had hoarded during the hyperinflation into new bills Between November 1923 and January 1924 alone,  foreign exchange holdings at the Reichsbank grew from about 20 million gold marks to nearly 300 million Though these foreign exchange flows paused as inflation rose in early 1924 \(and individuals began accumulating foreign currencies again\),  they resumed once credit standards within Germany were tightened and inflation stabilized \(as described above\)

The second major shift came through the Dawes Plan. In addition to reducing reparations burdens,  the Dawes Committee also extended Germany a significant foreign exchange loan The loan,  issued in October 1924,  amounted to 800 million gold marks worth of foreign currency,  divided mainly between dollars,  pounds,  and francs Though the amount was not extraordinarily large,  it meaningfully improved the Reichsbank’s credibility when it came to defending against speculative attacks It also sent a reassuring signal to foreign investors. In the four years following the implementation of the Dawes Plan,  American investors poured money into German debt,  attracted by its relatively high yields

By 1924,  the crisis was largely over. Germany would enter a brief period of recovery before the Great Depression hit it hard a decade later. This second crisis was not only economically devastating but fueled the rise of right wing and left wing populists,  Hitler’s rise to power,  and all that followed. But that’s another story.
