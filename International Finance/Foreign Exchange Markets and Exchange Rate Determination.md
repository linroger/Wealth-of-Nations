# Foreign Exchange Markets and Exchange Rate Determination

## CHAPTER 1: THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

### INTRODUCTION

The main centre for [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) trading is London,  with some$3,     576 billion worth of [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) traded on a daily basis,      quite a lot when one considers that the annual gross domestic product of the United Kingdom in 2019 was approximately 80.5% of that at$2,  879 billion.

Other important [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) centres are:

- New York with$1,  370 billion
- Tokyo with$376 billion
- Singapore$640 billion
- Paris$167 billion
- Frankfurt$124 billion

The net volume of [Foreign Exchange](Foreign%20Exchange%20Quoting%20Conventions.md) dealing globally was in April 2019 estimated to be in excess of$8.3 trillion per day.

### THE EXCHANGE RATE

The exchange rate is simply the price of one currency in terms of another,  and there are two methods of  expressing it:

1. Foreign currency units per unit of the domestic currency: taking the pound sterling as the domestic  currency,  on 16 December 2020 approximately$1.35 was required to obtain one pound,      that is,      $1.35/£1;
1. Domestic currency units per unit of foreign currency: again,  taking the pound sterling as the  domestic currency,  on 16 December 2020 there was approximately £0.7407 required to purchase one  US dollar,  that is,  £0.7407/$1
	- If the first definition is employed,  a rise in the exchange rate from$1.35/£1 to,      say,     $1.50/£1 would mean  that more dollars are required to purchase one pound,  so that the pound has appreciated or,  equivalently,  the  dollar has depreciated.
	- Conversely,  if the second definition is used,  a rise in the pounds per dollar exchange  rate from,  say,  £0.6667/$1 to £0.7407/$1 means that more pounds have to be given to obtain a dollar,  which  means that the pound has depreciated in value or,  equivalently,  the dollar has appreciated in value.
- Thinly traded currencies tend to have the largest spread,  which  usually increases if the risks of trading in a particular currency are perceived to have risen.
- The bid rate is the rate at which a bank will buy sterling,  while the offer rate is the rate  at which the bank will sell sterling in exchange for dollars. The difference is known as the bid–offer spread  and represents the gross profit margin of the bank.
### CHARACTERISTICS AND PARTICIPANTS OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

Easily the most heavily traded currency is the US dollar which is known as a **vehicle currency** – because the currency is widely used to denominate international transactions. Oil and many other important primary products such as tin,  coffee and gold all tend to be priced in dollars.

The main participants in the foreign exchange market can be categorized as follows:

- **Retail clients**: These are made up of businesses,  international investors,  multinational corporations and the like who need foreign exchange for the purposes of operating their businesses. Normally,  they do not directly purchase or sell foreign currencies themselves; rather they operate by placing buy/sell orders with the commercial banks.
- **Commercial banks**: The commercial banks carry out buy/sell orders from their retail clients and buy/sell currencies on their own account (known as proprietary trading) so as to alter the structure of their assets and liabilities in different currencies. The banks deal either directly with other banks or through foreign exchange brokers. In addition to the commercial banks,  other financial institutions such as merchant banks are engaged in buying and selling currencies both for proprietary purposes and on behalf of their customers in finance-related transactions.
- **Foreign exchange brokers**: Often banks do not trade directly with one another,  rather they offer to buy and sell currencies via foreign exchange brokers. Operating through such brokers is advantageous because,  since they collect buy and sell quotations for most currencies from many banks,  the most favourable quotation is obtained quickly and at very low cost. One disadvantage of dealing through a broker is that a small brokerage fee is payable which is not incurred in a straight bank to bank deal. Each financial centre normally has just a handful of authorized brokers through which commercial banks conduct their exchanges.

#### BULLS AND BEARS IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

Speculators are usually classified as **bulls** or **bears** according to their view on a particular currency.

- If a speculator expects a currency,  for example the pound (spot and forward),  to appreciate in the future they are said to be 'bullish' about the currency. It pays the speculator to take a long position on the pound,  that is,  to buy the pound spot or forward at a cheap price today in the hope that they can sell it at a higher price in the future.
- If a speculator expects the pound (spot and forward) to depreciate in the future he or she is said to be 'bearish' about the currency. It will pay the speculator to take a short position on the currency,  that is,  to sell the pound at what they consider to be a relatively high price today in the hope of buying it back at a cheaper rate sometime in the future.
- **Central banks**: Normally the monetary authorities of a country are not indifferent to changes in the external value of their currency. Even though exchange rates of the major industrialized nations have been left to fluctuate freely since 1973,  central banks frequently intervene to buy and sell their currencies in a bid to influence the rate at which their currency is traded. Under a fixed exchange rate system the authorities are obliged to purchase their currencies when there is excess supply,  and sell the currency when there is excess demand.

### ARBITRAGE IN THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET

**Financial centre arbitrage** ensures that the dollar–pound exchange rate quoted in New York will be the same as that quoted in London and other financial centres. This is because if the exchange rate is$1.36/£1 in New York but only$1.34/£1 in London,  it would be profitable for banks to buy pounds in London and simultaneously sell them in New York and make a guaranteed 2 cents for every pound bought and sold. The act of buying pounds in London will lead to a depreciation of the dollar in London,  while selling pounds in New York will lead to an appreciation of the dollar in New York. Such a process continues until the rate quoted in the two centres coincides at,  say,  $1.35/£1.

**Cross currency arbitrage**. To illustrate what is meant by currency arbitrage let us suppose that the exchange rate of the dollar against the pound is$1.35/£1 and the exchange rate of the dollar against the euro is$1.2175/€1. Currency arbitrage implies that the exchange rate of the euro against the pound will be €1.1088/£1 ($1.35/$1.2175 = 1.1088). If this were not the case,  say there was 1.25 euros per pound,  then a UK dealer wanting dollars would do better to first obtain 1.25 euros which would then buy$1.5219 making nonsense of a$1.35/£1 quotation. The increased demand for euros would quickly appreciate its rate against the pound to the €1.1088/£1 level.

Some banks are keen to buy a currency because they are short of it and others are keen to sell a currency because they have too much of it. This means that banks will quote slightly different bid–offer quotes on a currency in the interbank market.

Box 7.2 The [[Carry Trade 1]] does not make sense according to UIP

- In a carry trade investors borrow money in a low interest rate currency and place it into a higher interest
rate currency in the hope that the latter will either appreciate or not depreciate more than the interest
rate differential,  enabling an excess return to be made.
- The carry trade has been increasingly used in recent years by hedge funds,  speculators and banks despite the fact that UIP theory suggests that it will not produce excess returns in the long run. Remember,  the UIP condition predicts that over the long run the low interest rate currency will on average appreciate by the interest rate differential so as to make the carry trade a break-even strategy.
- Nonetheless,  if UIP does not hold then the carry trade might work in the short run or even for several years (just as it can also fail at both time horizons).
- The carry trade will prove unprofitable if the currency with the high interest rate depreciates by an amount greater than the interest rate differential over the relevant time horizon.

#### EXAMPLE
- Imagine the yen/euro rate is 100 yen per euro and the Japanese interest rate is 1% and the euro interest rate is 5%.
- A hedge fund might decide to borrow 10 million yen for one year knowing it will have to pay back 10,  100,  000 yen in a year’s time.
- The hedge fund then sells the yen in the spot market to gain €100,  000 which will earn 5% in euros and so become €105,  000.
	- So long as the euro has not depreciated to below 96.19 yen/€1 then the carry trade will be profitable.
		- For example,  if the euro actually appreciates to 110 yen/€1 then the hedge fund will make 1,  450,  000 yen profit (or €13,  181.82).
		- Even if the exchange rate remains at 100 yen/€1 the hedge fund will be able to convert the €105,  000 and obtain 10,  500,  000 yen and so make a 400,  000 yen profit (or €4,  000).
	- The carry trade strategy will break even if the euro depreciates approximately 4% to 96.19 yen/€1 when €105,  000 converts to 10,  100,  000 yen,  which is just sufficient to repay the borrowed 10,  000,  000 yen plus 100,  000 yen interest. However,  there are risks with the carry trade.
		- The real danger is if the yen appreciates by substantially more than 4%.
			- Say the yen were to appreciate sharply to 80 yen per euro by the end of the year.
			- In this case the €105,  000 will be worth 8,  400,  000 yen leaving the hedge fund with a shortfall (loss) of 1,  700,  000 yen of the required 10,  100,  000 yen that it needs to repay,  which is the euro equivalent loss of €21,  250.
	- According to UIP on average we can expect the Japanese yen to appreciate to 96.19 so that the expected profit from the carry trade is zero.
	- The carry trade therefore implies that markets on average lead to a depreciation of the high interest rate currency less than would be predicted by the interest differential.
	- During the early part of this century the carry trade proved to be very profitable as the yen–euro rate started at 100 yen/€1 and moved all the way to 170 yen/€1,  even though the European interest rate was above that of Japan through the period,  as depicted in Figure 7.3.
	- However,  in July 2008 there was a very abrupt depreciation of the euro from 170 yen/€1 to 115 yen/€1 in the space of just three months,  so that anyone doing the carry trade at that point would have lost very substantially in a very short space of time.

### THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES

**The spot exchange rate**. This is the quotation between two currencies for immediate delivery. In other words,  the current exchange rate of two currencies vis-à-vis each other. In practice,  there is normally a two-day lag between a spot purchase or sale and the actual exchange of currencies to allow for verification,  paperwork and clearing of payments.

**The forward exchange rate**. In addition to the spot exchange rate it is possible for economic agents to agree today to exchange currencies at some specified time in the future,  most commonly for one month (30 days),  three months (90 days),  six months (180 days),  nine months (270 days) and one year (360 days). The rate of exchange at which such a purchase or sale can be made is known as the forward exchange rate.

**Nominal exchange rate**

The exchange rate that prevails at a given date is known as the nominal exchange rate; it is the amount of US dollars that will be obtained for one pound in the foreign exchange market,  for example,  $1.35/£1. Similarly,  if the euro quotation is €1.1088/£1,  this is again a nominal exchange rate quotation. The nominal exchange rate is merely the price of one currency in terms of another with no reference made to what this means in terms of purchasing power of goods/services.

**Real exchange rate**

The real exchange rate is the nominal exchange rate adjusted for relative prices between the countries under consideration. It is normally expressed in index form as:

$$Sr = \frac{S}{P} \times \frac{P^*}{P^*}$$

where $S_r$ is the index of the real exchange rate,  S is the nominal exchange rate (foreign currency units per unit of domestic currency) in index form,  P is the index of the domestic price level and $P^*$ is the index of the foreign price level.

The real exchange rate monitors changes in a country's price competitiveness. Real exchange rate indices unlike nominal exchange rate indices are not publishable on a daily basis because the consumer price indices used are normally only published monthly.

**Effective exchange rate**

Since most countries of the world do not conduct all their trade with a single foreign country,  policy-makers are not so much concerned with what is happening to their exchange rate against a single foreign currency but rather what is happening to it against a basket of foreign currencies with which the country trades. The effective exchange rate is a measure of whether or not the currency is appreciating or depreciating against a weighted basket of foreign currencies.

### THE DEMAND FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE

The demand for pounds in the foreign exchange market is a derived demand; that is,  the pounds are not demanded because they have an intrinsic value in themselves,  but rather because of what they can buy.

As the pound appreciates against the dollar,  that is,  moves from$1.20/£1 towards$1.50/£1,  the price of the UK export to US importers increases,  which leads to a lower quantity of exports and with it a reduced demand for pounds. Hence,  the demand curve (D) for pounds which is depicted in Figure 1 slopes down from left to right.

In this simple model,  the demand for pounds depends upon the demand for UK exports. Any factor which results in an increase in the demand for UK exports will result in an increased demand for pounds and a shift to the right of the demand curve for pounds.

Among factors that result in a rightward shift of the demand schedule for pounds are:

- A rise in US income
- A change in US tastes in favour of UK goods
- A rise in the price of US goods

All these factors would result in an increased demand for UK exports and hence pounds. The effect of an increase in the demand for pounds is to shift the demand schedule to the right.

### THE SUPPLY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

The supply of pounds arises because UK residents wish to purchase US exports and therefore dollars. UK residents supply pounds in return for the dollars they wish to acquire,  which are purchased by increasing the amount of pounds supplied in the foreign exchange market,  and this yields an upward-sloping supply of pounds curve.

### ALTERNATIVE EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

At the Bretton Woods conference of 1948 the major nations of the Western world agreed to a pegged exchange rate system,  each country fixing its exchange rate against the US dollar with a small margin of fluctuation around the par value. In 1973 the Bretton Woods system broke down and the major currencies were left to be determined by market forces in a floating exchange rate world.

**Floating exchange rate regime**

Under a floating exchange rate regime the authorities do not intervene to buy or sell their currency in the foreign exchange market. Rather,  they allow the value of their currency to change due to fluctuations in the supply and demand of the currency.

**Fixed exchange rate regime**

For various reasons,  governments can intervene to try and fix the exchange rate around certain levels.

With **non-sterilized intervention** the buying/selling of sterling in the foreign exchange market affects the UK money supply and interest rates.

Frequently,  however,  authorities will attempt to restore domestic money supply and interest rates back to their levels before the foreign exchange market intervention took place,  and this is known as **sterilized foreign exchange market intervention**.

While nonsterilized intervention is likely to be effective in moving the exchange rate in the desired direction,  there is good reason to doubt that sterilized intervention can have much of an impact.

If the authorities decide to sterilize the impact of their interventions on the money supply,  through offsetting open-market operations that move the money supply and interest rates back to the levels prior to the intervention,  then they will most likely have only a limited exchange rate impact since none of the fundamentals change.

### THE DETERMINATION OF THE FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE

The forward exchange market is where buyers and sellers agree to exchange currencies at some specified date in the future.

**Hedgers** are agents (usually firms) that enter the forward exchange market to protect themselves against exchange rate fluctuations which entail exchange rate risk.

**Arbitrageurs** are agents (usually banks) that aim to make a riskless profit out of discrepancies between interest rate differentials and what is known as the forward discount or forward premium.

The presence of arbitrageurs ensures that what is known as the **covered interest rate parity (CIP)** condition holds continually:

$$F=\frac{S}{(1+r^*)} \times (1+r)$$

Where:

- F is the one-year forward exchange rate quotation in foreign currency per unit of domestic currency
- S is the spot exchange rate quotation in foreign currency per unit of domestic currency
- r is the one-year domestic interest rate
- r\* is the one-year foreign interest rate

**Speculators** are agents that hope to make a profit by accepting exchange rate risk. Speculators engage in the forward exchange market because they believe that the future spot rate corresponding to the date of the quoted forward exchange rate will be different to the quoted forward rate.

Speculators are at work in both the spot and forward exchange markets. If they decide that the current spot rate is overvalued they may sell spot so that the currency depreciates; if interest rates do not change then both the spot and forward exchange rates depreciate.

Similarly,  if speculators feel that the currency is overvalued forward then they will sell forward and both the forward and spot exchange quotations will depreciate.

Hence,  arbitrage ties the spot and forward exchange market quotations together via the CIP condition. Speculation and hedging may be thought of as determining the level of the spot and forward exchange quotations.

### CONCLUSIONS

The need for a foreign exchange market arises because international trade in goods/services and financial assets almost always involves the exchange of differing national currencies.

Let's break down the example into smaller parts,  detailing each step of the trades made by the trader and the payoffs for each step. We will use the principles of Covered Interest Parity (CIP) to understand the relationship between spot rates,  forward rates,  and interest rates.

### STEP 1: INITIAL CONDITIONS
- One-year dollar interest rate (USD): 2%
- One-year sterling interest rate (GBP): 6%
- Spot exchange rate:$1.35/£1

### STEP 2: CALCULATION OF FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE USING CIP

CIP states that the forward exchange rate should be set so that an investor is indifferent between investing in domestic currency and investing in foreign currency after covering exchange rate risk through a forward contract. The formula for the forward exchange rate (F) is:

$$F = S \times \left(\frac{1 + i_{\text{domestic}}}{1 + i_{\text{foreign}}} \right)$$

where:

- $S$is the spot exchange rate
- $i_{\text{domestic}}$is the domestic interest rate
- $i_{\text{foreign}}$is the foreign interest rate

Plugging in the values:

$$F = 1.35 \times \left(\frac{1 + 0.02}{1 + 0.06} \right)$$

$$F = 1.35 \times \left(\frac{1.02}{1.06} \right)$$

$$F = 1.35 \times 0.9623$$

$$F  = 1.2991$$

Answer 1: The one-year forward exchange rate of the pound is$1.2991/£1.

### STEP 3: CALCULATION OF FORWARD DISCOUNT/PREMIUM

The forward rate is less than the spot rate,  which means the sterling is at a forward discount. The annual forward discount/premium can be calculated as:

$$\text{Forward Discount/Premium} = \frac{F - S}{S} \times 100\%$$

$$\text{Forward Discount/Premium} = \frac{1.2991 - 1.35}{1.35} \times 100\%$$

$$\text{Forward Discount/Premium} = -3.77\%$$

Answer 2: The one-year forward rate of sterling is at an annual forward discount of 3.77%.

### STEP 4: ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY IF FORWARD RATE IS MISPRICED

Let's assume the forward rate is incorrectly priced at$1.25/£1. A UK investor could exploit this by:

1. Borrowing £100 at 6% interest.
1. Converting £100 to USD at the spot rate of$1.35/£1,      receiving$135.
1. Investing$135 at the US interest rate of 2%,      resulting in$137.70 after one year.
1. Entering into a forward contract to convert$137.70 back into GBP at the incorrect forward rate of$1.25/£1,  resulting in £110.16.

The investor would then repay the £100 borrowed plus 6% interest (£106),  leaving a risk-free profit of £4.16 (£110.16 - £106).

### STEP 5: MARKET CORRECTION

Arbitrageurs would exploit this mispricing until the forward rate adjusts to the correct level where no risk-free profit is possible. The correct forward rate,  as calculated earlier,  is$1.2991/£1. At this rate,      the$137.70 converted back into GBP would exactly equal the £106 owed,  eliminating the arbitrage opportunity.

| Step | Trade | When | Payoff |
|------|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Borrow £100 | Now | -£100 |
| 2 | Convert to USD at spot rate | Now |$135 |
| 3 | Invest USD at 2% interest | Now to 1 year |$137.70 |
| 4 | Enter forward contract at$1.2991/£1 | Now | - |
| 5 | Convert USD to GBP at forward rate | 1 year | £106 |
| 6 | Repay borrowed GBP with interest | 1 year | -£106 |
| 7 | Net Payoff | 1 year | £0 (No arbitrage profit) |

————————

When the forward rate deviates from the rate implied by Covered Interest Parity (CIP),  there are two possible scenarios: the forward rate is either below (Scenario A) or above (Scenario B) the CIP-implied rate. We'll provide the generalized forms of the trades for each scenario.

### SCENARIO A: FORWARD RATE BELOW CIP RATE

In this scenario,  the forward rate (F) is less than the CIP-implied forward rate (F_CIP). This suggests that the foreign currency (GBP in our example) is at a forward discount,  and there is an opportunity for arbitrage by borrowing in the foreign currency,  converting to the domestic currency,  investing at the domestic rate,  and selling the domestic currency forward.

Generalized Trades:

1. Borrow £X at the foreign interest rate (i_foreign).
1. Convert £X to USD at the spot rate (S),  receiving$X \times S$.
1. Invest$X \times S$at the domestic interest rate (i_domestic) for one year,  resulting in$X \times S \times (1 + i_domestic)$.
1. Enter into a forward contract to convert the investment back into GBP at the forward rate (F),  resulting in$\frac{X \times S \times (1 + i_domestic)}{F}$.

If$\frac{X \times S \times (1 + i_domestic)}{F} > X \times (1 + i_foreign)$,  then there is an arbitrage profit.

Scenario A:

| Step | Trade                                                        | When          | Payoff                                            |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Borrow £X at i_foreign                                       | Now           | -£X                                               |
| 2    | Convert to USD at spot rate S                                | Now           |$X \times S$|
| 3    | Invest USD at i_domestic                                     | Now to 1 year |$X \times S \times (1 + i_domestic)$|
| 4    | Enter forward contract at F                                  | Now           | -                                                 |
| 5    | Convert USD to GBP at forward rate F                         | 1 year        |$\frac{X \times S \times (1 + i_domestic)}{F}$|
| 6    | Repay borrowed GBP with interest                             | 1 year        | -$X \times (1 + i_{foreign})$|
| 7    | Net Payoff                                                   | 1 year        |$\frac{X \times S \times (1 + i_{domestic)}}{F} - X \times (1 + i_{foreign})$|

### SCENARIO B: FORWARD RATE ABOVE CIP RATE

In this scenario,  the forward rate (F) is greater than the CIP-implied forward rate (F_CIP). This suggests that the foreign currency (GBP in our example) is at a forward premium,  and there is an opportunity for arbitrage by borrowing in the domestic currency,  converting to the foreign currency,  investing at the foreign rate,  and buying the domestic currency forward.

Generalized Trades:

1. Borrow$X at the domestic interest rate (i_domestic).
1. Convert$X to GBP at the spot rate (S),      receiving$\frac{X}{S}$.
1. Invest$\frac{X}{S}$at the foreign interest rate (i_foreign) for one year,  resulting in$\frac{X}{S} \times (1 + i_{foreign})$.
1. Enter into a forward contract to convert the investment back into USD at the forward rate (F),  resulting in$\frac{X}{S} \times (1 + i_{foreign}) \times F$.

If$\frac{X}{S} \times (1 + i_{foreign}) \times F > X \times (1 + i_{domestic})$,  then there is an arbitrage profit.
