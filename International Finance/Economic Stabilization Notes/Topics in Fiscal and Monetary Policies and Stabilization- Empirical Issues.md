## Topics in Fiscal and Monetary Policies and Stabilization: Empirical Issues

Introduction

In this module we will study various empirical aspects of fiscal and monetary policies. The first two sections include an empirical examination of discretionary monetary and fiscal policies. The following section discusses limits to stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, a topic of increasing importance in the United States and around the world over the past decade or longer. The final section of the module deals with aufomatic fiscal stabilizers.

### A. Discretionary Monetary Policy Actions

We start by discussing the Taylor Rule, the empirical link between [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] actions and the business cycle. This rule should be viewed as an approximation to actual [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] decision making in the United States over the past 40 years or so; it is worth emphasizing that actual policy does not always follow the Taylor rule.

Taylor Rule:
$$\mathrm{FFR}_{i}\:=\mathrm{r}^{*}\:+\:\pi_{i}\:+\:(\pi\:-\:\pi^{*})_{i}\:+\:[(\mathrm{y}\:-\:\mathrm{y}^{*})/\mathrm{y}^{*}]_{i}$$
In this specification, FFR denotes the nominal or market federal funds rate; $y^{*}$ denotes the target level of real GDP (think of this as the natural or potential level of GDP), $\pi^{k}$ denotes the target rate of price inflation (currently $2\%$ per annum in the United States), and $r^{*}$ the long-run or equilibrium (or “natural" or "neutral") level of the real interest rate (estimated currently to be less than $1\%$ per annum). The real interest rate is defined as the nominal or market interest rate minus the expected rate of price inflation, which for this discussion is assumed equal to the actual rate of inflation.

Under the Taylor rule, the Fed manipulates the federal funds rate (FFR), the nomina/ interest rate under its direct control, in response to deviation between actual and target values of inflation and output.

For example, the FFR is increased if the percentage output gap gets larger (i.e., as output rises further above trend or target); this is the sense in which [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] attempts to be countercyclical with respect to fluctuations in real output and thus to “lean against the wind" (interest rates rise which reduces the interest-rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand) Also the FFR is changed if inflation deviates from target. For example, the FFR is increased if inflation rises above its target value; again this illustrates that the Fed attempts to lean against the wind. Note the very close similarity to the theoretical monetary rule in module 2. [To make the connection appear even closer, we can subtract the inflation rate from both sides of the above Taylor rule converting the left hand side from the nominal funds rate to the real funds rate (r= FFR-).]

Leaning against the wind policy has implications for the relationship between the real federal funds rate and $r^{*}$. In the case where both inflation and output are less than their respective target values (as might result from a negative aggregate demand shock), the Fed would set < r* according to the Taylor Rule. This is called expansionary or stimulative policy. Conversely, where both inflation and output exceed their respective target values (perhaps due to a positive demand shock), the Fed would set r $>r^{*}$ and this would be called restrictive policy.

The appropriate stance of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is more difficult if output is less than its target and inflation greater than its target (as might result from a negative aggregate supply shock). The Fed often has struggled with what to do in such a situation. The Taylor rule gives explicit instructions in this case for policymakers to plug in the exact values for the inflation and output gaps and set the FFR accordingly; one possibility is for the Fed to raise the real rate such that r > $r^{2\pi}$ which would lead to a reduction in inflation but a reduction in output as well, an unpleasant tradeoff to policymakers.

Implementation of the Taylor Rule is difficult in practice because there are several measures of price inflation from which the Fed can choose (such as the total vs. core measures of inflation); and because it has to utilize a statistical estimate of potential GDP (since potential GDP is never actually observed); and because empirical coefficient values for the inflation and output gap terms must be chosen.

The Taylor rule usually is expressed in terms of contemporaneous values on inflation and output. but given the existence of lags in the macroeconomic impact of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]], one could use forecast values for inflation and output, so that the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] rule could be made forwardlooking; the professional literature suggests that such a change makes for better policy, but surprisingly (at least to me) not by much. Note that under the Taylor rule, the Fed does not react directly to asset price movements, i.e., it does not react to perceived asset price bubbles, such as housing or stock-market price bubbles; the Fed reacts only indirectly to the extent that asset price bubbles affect GDP and overall price inflation.

Also, the formal math structure of the Taylor rule, as well as our theoretical policy rule above, does not allow for a period of recognition and deliberation and hence suggests that policy moves are automatically taken in response to gaps. In reality, [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is not “automatic" but rather has a “discretionary” element in the sense that decisions are the result of careful deliberation, followed by a vote, before the Federal funds rate is changed

For a numerical example using the Taylor Rule, suppose initially that the output and inflation gaps are zero, in which case the Fed would set the nominal funds rate at its desired long run value, $r^{*}+\pi^{*}$.Substituting in reasonable values of $0.5\%$ for $r^*$ and $2\%$ for $\pi^{*}$ implies that the Fed would set the nominal funds rate at $2.5\%$ per annum $(FFR=0.5\%+2\%+0+0)$.If there was an inflationary shock, the authorities would raise the funds rate by 1.5 times the change in the inflation rate (to confirm this, take the derivative, dFFR/dz, for a given output gap, and show that it equals 1.5). Again starting from equilibrium, a 1 percentage point rise in AL would lead to an increase in the nominal funds rate from $2.5\%$ to $4.0\%$ per annum. This implies that the rea funds rate would increase from $0.5\%$ to $1.0\%$ as inflation rises.

The coefficient levels of 0.5 were inferred by Taylor from properties of large models of the time, though later research has shown that larger response coefficients (especially on the inflation term) would make the rule even more stabilizing. By plugging historical values of the right-hand-side variables into the Taylor equation, it can be seen that the equation generates a path for the funds rate that tracks the actual path relatively well; that is, the Taylor rule seems to explain actual [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] behavior fairly well, at least from the late 1980s. Taylor uses his rule to show that in the 1965-1979 period, the time of accelerating inflation in the U.S., policy was too easy (in the sense that the FFR demanded by his equation for that period exceeded the FFR actually chosen by the Fed) and in the 1981-1985 period policy was too tight. Orphanides shows that Taylor's results become muddled when the actual (real time) data that were available to policymakers at the time are inserted into the rule (as opposed to inserting heavily-revised current estimates of the data of that period) Specifically, Orphanides' results suggest that [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] makers in these earlier periods followed a sensible lean-against-the-wind strategy but had bad estimates of the right-hand-side variables (in particular, their estimate of real potential GDP in the 1965-1979 period was to0 large) and hence made bad policy decisions

### B. Discretionary Fiseal Poliey

This section explores empirical aspects of "discretionary" changes to government spending and taxation, including the use of fiscal policy as a countercyclical/stabilization tool.

Before beginning with the analysis, I want to provide some background information on federal government spending and taxes in the United States. The variable, G, denotes spending on goods and services mostly including defense spending on goods (such as tanks, rifles, ships, jets, computers, etc.) and spending on government employee compensation (including defense and civilian workers). Taxes, T, mostly include revenue from personal and corporate income taxes and from payroll taxes, and to a far lesser extent, from excise (sales) taxes and tariffs. Transfer payments mostly include social security retiree benefits, Medicare and Medicaid medical outlays, unemployment insurance benefits, the earned income tax credit, veterans benefits, and food stamps. Interest payments on the government debt, $\mathrm{iD}_{i-1}$, are transfers from an economic perspective but are officially counted as a different category. Now to the analysis.

The most common summary measure of fiscal policy is the actua/ budget surplus, S, defined as tax receipts minus total government spending. Taxes in most countries depend positively on income; as income declines, for example, income taxes fall "automatically." Also certain transfer payments depend negatively on income (e.g., unemployment insurance benefits rise automatically as the unemployment rate rises or as income falls). The components of taxes and spending that depend on income are called the automatic fiscal stabilizers; for example, as income declines by a dollar taxes fall about 20 cents in the U.S. thus providing an automaticbut partialoffset to the decline in income. Taxes net of transfer payments (or net taxes, for short), T”, depend positively on income. In math terms, $dT^{\mathrm{d}}(Y)/dY>0$ for all values of Y

This allows us to write the actual budget surplus as: S(Y) = $T^{0}\left (Y\right)$i$D_{t1}$ -G

If $S=0$, we have a “balanced budget." I will define the actual budget deficit as: $\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{G}+$i$\mathbf{D}_{\imath+1}$ iD $\mathrm{iD}_{[1,1]}$ $T^{2}(Y)$.The primary budget deficit (deficit excluding interest payments) is defined as: $\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{G}$ - T”(Y). [Technical note: in discussions of the budget deficit and related fiscal measures, all the budget variablesi.e., S, T, D, G, and P are commonly given in nominal terms even though variables such as T and G are expressed in real terms in our macro model.]

A common measure of the stance of diseretionary fiscal policy is called the “HighEmployment Budget Surplus" (or HEB, for short). It also is called the “Cyclically-Adjusted Budget Surplus" or the “Structural Budget Surplus." This measure starts with the actual budget surplus defined above $f=$ tax receipts spending) and removes the components of taxes and spending that result from the deviation of GDP from its potential level. Thus, the measure adjusts the actual surplus for cyclically-induced swings in economic activity, that is, for the effects on the budget of the automatic fiscal stabilizers.

More precisely, let the high-employment budget surplus be denoted by HEB= S($Y_{p}$).This dollar surplus is taxes net of transfer payments $(T^{2})$ minus interest payments on government debt minus government expenditures on goods and services, i.e, S($Y_{p}$) = $T^{n}$($Y_{p}$) - i$D_{[\cdot] }$ - G where net faxes are evaluated at potential GDP, and G, i, and D are assumed independent of GDP. In particular high employment net taxes are positively related to potential GDP: in math terms, $dT^{a}(Y_{p})/dY_{p}>$ 0.

By adding and subtracting $T^n(Y)$ to the high-employment surplus, we get:
$$=\:\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y}_{p})-\mathrm{iD}_{n+1}\:\mathrm{-G}\:=\:\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y}_{p})-\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y})+\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y})-\mathrm{iD}_{n+1}\:\mathrm{-G}\:=\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{Y})\:+\:\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y}_{p})-\mathrm{T}^{n}(\mathrm{Y})$$
Thus the high-employment budget surplus equals the actual budget surplus plus a cyclicaladjustment term that captures the effect on net taxes of Y differing from Y, the cyelical adjustment term is: T’(Y,) T’(Y).

For example, if $Y<Y_{\mathfrak{p}}$ (think of the economy as being in a recession), then actual net taxes are less than net taxes evaluated at potential GDP and thus the actual budget surplus is less than the high-employment surplus. Indeed the high-employment surplus originally was developed to teach policymakers intent on balancing the actual budget that there was no need to cut spending or raise taxes during a recession if policymakers would simply keep the high-employment surplus in balance (make certain you understand this point). Failure to appreciate this point would lead policymakers to raise taxes and cut government spending during recessions to balance the actual budget; of course, these actions would produce an even deeper recession (by shifting the IS and AD curves to the left)

Period-to-period changes in the dollar value of the cyclically-adjusted budget surplus obviously do not reflect business-cycle swings in economic activity (hence the name cyclically-adjusted deficit) but do reflect several other factors, such as the impact of legislative policy actions (i.e. discretionary policy actions), the impact of demographic influences (like retirement of the baby boomers) on social security and Medicare outlays, and the impact of changes in interest rates on interest payments on Treasury debt. Although the HEB thus is capturing several “non-fiscal. policy” factors, it is viewed as a reasonable measure of the stance of discretionary fiscal policy Loosely speaking, any of the non-interest-rate factors that increase (reduce) the cyclically adjusted budget surplus shift the IS curve to the left (right), rather than capturing movements along the curve. (Arguably, a change in interest rates is a better reflection of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] than fiscal policy and so interest payments on Treasury debt sometimes are excluded from the

Let's consider some practical applications of these principles. For example, if policymakers tried to offset the increase in the budget deficit resulting from the contracting economy during the financial crisis recession of 2008-2009, they would have raised taxes (or cut spending) about $2\%$ of GDP according to CBO estimates; this is a very large amount and would have deepened the recession. Evidently having learned the main lesson of the HEBnot to cut spending or increases taxes during a recessionfiscal policymakers were willing to let the size of the deficit take a backseat to the plunge in real economic activity in the U.S. in 2008 and, more recently, in 2020; indeed huge deficit-increasing stimulus was enacted in response to the deep recessions associated with the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 corona virus pandemic

### C. Limits to Stimulative Discretionary Fiscal Policies

In module 3, Friedman’s model demonstrated that getting the right timing and magnitude for either stimulative or restrictive policy were difficult and hence posed limits to policy. In this section we examine practical quantitative limits related to the magnitude of stimulative fiscal policy, a topic of growing importance in the United States and abroad. We have briefly discussed the limits to discretionary [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] imposed by the zero lower bound on the federal funds rate; my course on monetary economics (Econ 111) discusses this in more detail.

Limits to Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Of course, deficit-increasing short-run fiscal stimulus leads to an increase in government debt over time. By definition, the change in the stock of government debt outstanding equals the budget deficit; thus, if the deficit is $S100$ this year, the stock of debt rises by S100 between the beginning and end of the year

Let $D_t$ denote the government debt outstanding at time $t$ and let $S_t$ denote the budget surplus during period $t$ as defined above:

$$
S_t = T^n(Y) - iD_{t+1}
$$

where $iD_{t-1} - G_t$. Thus,

$$
\Delta \mathbf{D}_t = \mathbf{D}_{t+1} - \mathbf{D}_t = -S_t = G_t + iD_{t+1} - T^2(Y)
$$

The right-hand side is called the total budget deficit, and $G_t \cdot T^n(Y) = P$ is called the "primary" budget deficit. This implies:

$$
\Delta \frac{\mathbf{D}_t}{\mathbf{D}_{t-1}} = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{\mathbf{D}_{t-1}} + \mathbf{i}
$$

Please recall the technical point that the budget variables $S_t$, $T_t$, $D_t$, $G_t$, and $P$ are usually expressed in nominal terms when discussing the budget deficit.

At some point, it appears that bond market investors will punish countries that run up their debt by demanding prohibitively high interest rates to hold the debt, reflecting the increased likelihood of a default. This is exemplified by developments in Greece and Ireland in 2010; for example, at the height of its crisis in early 2010, interest rates on Greek government debt rose an incredible 10 percentage points (above the rate for comparable German bonds), presumably reflecting expectations of a default. These countries were forced to engage in draconian fiscal retrenchment (sizable cuts in government spending and increases in taxes). Could this same scenario play out in the United States if it continues to run historically large budget deficits? Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office projects a sizable run-up in government debt after accounting for the several coronavirus fiscal packages which together add $5$ trillion to the level of debt fairly quickly.

To answer such a question, it is standard to focus on the level of government debt relative to the size of the economy (i.e., to GDP). From above, we know that:

$$
\Delta \frac{\mathbf{D}_t}{\mathbf{D}_{t-1}} = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{\mathbf{D}_{t-1}} + \mathbf{i}
$$

Let $g$ be the growth rate of nominal GDP $(SY)$. Subtracting $g$ from both sides, we get:

$$
\Delta \frac{D_{t-1}}{D_{t-1}} - g = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{\mathbf{D}_{t-1}} + \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{g}
$$

The left-hand side is the growth rate of the debt/GDP ratio. For example, it is positive if and only if:

$$
\mathbf{P} > \left(\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{i}\right)\mathbf{D}_{t-1}
$$

i.e., if and only if $P$ is larger than the right-hand side. Here are some standard debt dynamic properties:

1. If GDP is growing faster than government debt, then the ratio of debt to GDP $(D/SY = d)$ is declining since the numerator of $D/SY$ is growing slower than the denominator.
2. For the case of $P = 0$:
$$
\Delta \frac{D_t}{D_{t-1}} = \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{g}
$$

Thus, the debt-GDP ratio declines if $g > i$ (and of course, it increases if $g < i$). If the primary deficit is zero $(\mathbf{P} = 0)$, the increase in the level of debt from one period to the next $(\Delta D)$ is interest payments on previously accumulated debt because all other government outlays exactly equal tax receipts. If $\mathbf{P} = 0$, think of interest outlays as being financed by issuing new government debt. Equivalently, in this case, the growth rate of debt equals the interest rate:

$$
\Delta \frac{\mathbf{D}}{\mathbf{D}_{t+1}} = \mathbf{i}
$$

3. It is reasonable to conclude that debt declines as a share of GDP if interest rates on government debt are low enough and the primary deficit is not too large. To keep the debt ratio from declining when $g > i$, there must be a large enough primary deficit. We know that:
$$
\Delta \frac{D_t}{D_{t+1}} - \mathbf{g} = \frac{\mathbf{P}}{\mathbf{D}_{t+1}} + \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{g}
$$

Thus, the debt/GDP ratio increases if and only if:

$$
\mathbf{P} > (\mathbf{g} - \mathbf{i})\mathbf{D}_{t+1}
$$

i.e., if and only if $P$ is larger than the right-hand side.

4. *(Technical point)*: If the primary deficit, $P$, is larger than that minimal amount $= (g - i) D_{t+1}$ but fixed as a share of GDP, debt will rise as a share of GDP until it plateaus at a new higher equilibrium level, $d^*$: the formula is $d^* = D/SY = p/(g - i)$ where $\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{P}/SY$. For a proof, see Chapter 22 of the Blanchard textbook.

Point 2 above suggests that if $\mathbf{P} = (\mathbf{g} - i) D_{t-1}$, then the debt-GDP ratio does not change over time. Such was roughly the situation in the United States just prior to the $5T$ coronavirus fiscal relief packages. Interest rates on Treasury securities were extremely low at all maturities; the average rate $\bar{i}$ was less than $1\%$ per annum. GDP grew around $4\%$ per annum (prior to the outbreak), so $g - i > 3\%$ per annum, which implies a declining ratio of debt to GDP as long as the primary deficit is not too big. Just prior to the enactment of the coronavirus fiscal packages, the primary deficit was between $2.5\%$ and $3\%$ of GDP, just the right size to prevent the debt/GDP ratio from declining or increasing from its beginning-of-period 2019 value of about $0.8$.

Of course the huge corona-virus fiscal packages will increase the primary deficit and the debt ratio substantially. CBO projects that U.S. Treasury debt held by the public will rise within a year of implementation of the packages from its pre-package level of $80\%$ of GDP to more than $1\dot{0}0\%$. Such a high level has been reached historically only during WWII

To date in early 2022, investors have not reacted adversely to such a rise and demand much higher Treasury interest rates with a consequent large negative impact on the economy. But, is there an upper limit on the size of discretionary U.S. fiscal policy with its implications for government debt before it has a significantly adverse effect on the economy?

The usual answer is that high and rising budget deficits and debt will eventually lead to an increase in interest rates or to an increase in taxes (or reduction in government spending) for the sake of fiscal "responsibility;" in either case, economic growth would be adversely affected. However, in the current environment there may not be such an adverse effect in the near term meaning the next five to ten years because:

- i) investors know that the U.S. Treasury has never defaulted, which will help to keep Treasury interest rates low
- ii) investors know that with low Treasury interest rates the debt ratio will stabilize, albeit at a historically high level (so long as g continues to exceed i: see point (iv) above
- iii) current long-term Treasury interest rates are at historically low levels suggesting that market participants expect rates to remain low well into the future (based on the expectations theory of the term structure of rates, discussed in depth in Econ 111); indeed long-term rates remained very low even after enactment of the corona-virus fiscal packages.
- iv) the rate of return on non-Treasury assets faced by investors is estimated by some economists to not be very high at this time, so that there is not much incentive for worldwide investors to switch from Treasuries to other assets (thereby raising Treasury interest rates). (Low rates of return in general could be a result of a substantial amount of “excess" saving worldwide: several economists have argued this is true empirically. Under more normal circumstances using saving to finance increases in government debt leaves less saving to finance physical capital accumulation, i.e., government debt "crowds out” physical capital, leading to less future output (because output depends on both labor and physical capital inputs). But with excess worldwide saving, this crowding out, to the extent it takes place, is not very costly in terms of future output. Put another way, excess saving implies a low rate of return on physical capital. i.e., a low opportunity cost of using the saving to finance government debt accumulation.
- v). Going further into the future, the CBO estimates that debt will rise to more than 200 percent of GDP by mid-century reflecting the rapid projected growth of social security and Medicare spending. Between now and then, it is possible that adverse macroeconomic effects will be felt especially if there is less "excess" saving in the future.

### D. Automatic or Built-in Fiscal Stabilizers

Certain taxes and expenditures respond very quickly to swings in real economic activity. For example, increases in wages will boost the taxes withheld from paychecks as well as social insurance contributions (i.e., payroll taxes) within a matter of a few weeks. In addition, an increase in profits will boost taxes paid by corporations with only a short lag. These responses are “built-in to the existing structure of individual, payroll, and corporate taxes in the United States. On the spending side, unemployment insurance benefits respond to changes in the employment status of workers in a matter of a few weeks. Under the current structure, workers are entitled to 26 weeks of benefits after becoming unemployed. Moreover, when the nationa unemployment rate has risen above a critical value, benefits are automatically extended another 13 weeks. Together the components of government taxes and spending that respond quickly to economic activity,within the structure of existing law,are known as the “automatic fiscal stabilizers.'

The term “automatic stabilizer” seems to presume that such tax and spending changes do indeed stabilize the economy. This raises the questions of whether they in fact stabilize or even destabilize under certain circumstances or destabilize certain variables. The starting point of the basic textbook Keynesian model is that current consumption demand depends on currentrather than permanent or lifetime—after-tax income. After-tax income is Y $-\mathrm{T}^n$ where $\mathbf{T}^{0}=\mathbf{T}_{0}+\tau\mathbf{Y}$ (and $T^{dn}$ is defined as above). Introducing net taxes that depend on incomei.e., the automatic fiscal stabilizerschanges several properties of our basic macro model developed in the second module.

- i. The IS curve is steeper in the presence of automatic stabilizers. Recall the economic argument for a downward sloping IS curve with no stabilizers: a decline in r boosts the interest-ratesensitive components of C, I, and NX and hence Y must increase to maintain goods market equilibrium in which $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{C}+\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{NX}$ (a decline in r boosts the right hand side and hence Y must increase to rebalance the equation). However, with automatic stabilizers, the increase in Y raises T which tends to reduce C; thus Y does not have to rise as much in the presence of automatic stabilizers to maintain equilibrium.
- ii. The shift in the IS curve resulting from an exogenous increase in private aggregate demand (such as an increase in the intercept terms of the consumption, investment, or net export equations) is smaller in the presence of automatic fiscal stabilizers. For example, with no automatic stabilizers an exogenous increase in business optimism (i.e., an increase in $\mathbf{I}_0)$ boosts investment demand and hence Y must rise to regain equilibrium in the goods market. But with automatic stabilizers, the rise in Y in turn boosts $T^n$ which tends to lower C, so Y does not have to rise as much in the presence of automatic stabilizers to maintain equilibrium. Put simply, the automatic stabilizers damp any effect of the demand shock on current personal disposable income (relative to the case with no stabilizers)
- iii. Shifts in the MP curve have a smaller impact on the short-run equilibrium level of output, but the same impact on the real interest rate, in the presence of the automatic stabilizers (there is a larger absolute effect on the interest rate if $r_{Y}>0$ because the MP curve is upward sloping in this case rather than flat). Graphically, this is easy to see. Shift the MP curve by a given amount along a steep IS curve and then along a flat IS curve. Comparing the two cases, output changes by less when moving along a steep IS curve than along a flat one. Thus the automatic stabilizers “stabilize” output (and “de-stabilize” the real interest rate if $\mathbf{r}_{y}>0$) relative to the case of no automatic stabilizers.
- iv. The prior point basically proves that the AD curve is steeper in the presence of automatic fiscal stabilizers (for example, consider the case where the MP curve shifts because of a change in the inflation rate).
- v.An exogenous shock on the supply side (such as an increase in the price of oil) has a smaller absolute impact on output but a larger impact on the inflation rate in the presence of automatic fiscal stabilizers. Note that the automatic stabilizers stabilize output but destabilize inflation relative to the case of no automatic stabilizers. The stabilization of output in the face of an adverse supply shock that reduces the natural rate of output is not necessarily a good thing since actual output eventually must decline all the way to the new natural level.

We now are in a position to see how the automatic fiscal stabilizers relate to the discussion of policy effectiveness in the Friedman model of module 3. In the case of fiscal policy, P captures both discretionary policy actions and the automatic stabilizers impact on GDP

However the automatic stabilizers are more likely to work better than discretionary fiscal actions because the timing must be bette. The correlation between X and P, $P_{\mathrm{xp}}$ is algebraically smaller (i.e., closer to -1 in value) for automatic stabilizers than for discretionary fiscal policy actions. This is because (i) with automatic stabilizers there is no recognition lag by Congress and (ii) there is no implementation lag. Moreover, both automatic and discretionary fiscal policies involve the same outside lags. For example, taxes fall at the same instant as GDP in the case of automatic stabilizers but require recognition and implementation time for discretionary actions Think about whether the automatic stabilizers or discretionary policy actions have better magnitude.

### FRBUS estimates of impact of the automatic fiscal stabilizers

FRBUS is a large macro-econometric model developed at the Federal Reserve Board The model specifies taxes as a function of income, but in simulations of the impact of the automatic stabilizers, a counterfactual tax structure is incorporated in which taxes are independent of income (i.e., taxes, in effect, become “lump-sum").

The model is subjected to two large shocks; a negative aggregate demand shock equal to I percent of GDP; an increase in crude oil prices of S5 per barrel (i.e. an adverse supply shock). Each shock is taken to be permanent and the real federal funds rate is maintained at its baseline value.

In the case of the demand shock, real GDP falls 1.3 percent after 8 quarters, while in the counterfactual case the drop is 1.6 percent; that is the automatic tax stabilizers attenuate the decline in real GDP by roughly 20 percent.

In the case of the oil price shock, nominal GDP is largely unaffected because the opposing movements in real activity and prices tend to minimize the impact on nominal tax bases (i.e. on nominal income) and hence minimize the impact on nominal taxes. Taxes in real terms decline because the price level rises; further the decline in real taxes is about the same whether the tax system uses lump sum taxes or the current tax rate structure so that the “automatic tax stabilizers" do not much alter the impact of an oil price shock on real GDP. This is interesting because in certain instances of a supply shock, as discussed above, the optimal response is for the automatic stabilizers to have no impact (or indeed a negative impact) on aggregate demand

These results help shed light on the issue of whether the presence of automatic fiscal stabilizers reduces the variance of U.S. real GDP. To the extent that variation in real GDP is driven primarily by supply-side shocks, such as shocks to oil prices whose principal initial impact is to the supply side of the economy, the results suggest an extremely limited stabilizing role of the income tax system (and indeed, as discussed, this limited role may be optimal). By contrast, if demand-side shocks are the primary driving force, income taxes provide a modest degree of stabilization
