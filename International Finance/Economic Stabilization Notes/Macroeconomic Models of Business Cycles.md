### Macroeconomic Models of Business Cycles

Aggregate Demand

## Market in New Goods and Services: The IS Curve

1. **Current Real Consumption of Domestically-Produced or Foreign-Produced Goods and Services** depends on current real after-tax income and on expected future real after-tax income. (It also depends on the real interest rate and other factors as discussed in points 2, 3, and 4 below.) There are two main pieces to understanding the basics of modern models of consumption (known as the "life-cycle" and "permanent income" models of consumption).

	- First, **consumption "smoothing" over one’s lifetime is approximately optimal**. That is, if a person expects to live $T$ periods, then $C_1 = C_2 = … = C_T$ is approximately optimal. This follows from the key assumption of diminishing marginal utility of consumption. For example, over two periods with a total of 20 units of consumption, reallocating one’s consumption from a smooth $(10, 10)$ to a choppy $(5, 15)$ lowers utility on balance because reducing consumption by 5 units (in period one) lowers utility more than raising consumption 5 units (in period two) boosts utility; thus smooth or equal consumption is optimal.

	$$
    \text{Utility of Consumption: } U(C_1, C_2) = U(C_1) + U(C_2)
$$

    This expression assumes no discounting of future utility. In this case, we need to prove that $U(10) + U(10) > U(5) + U(15)$ to show the optimality of consumption smoothing.

    - Re-write the inequality as:
    
    $$
    U(10) - U(5) > U(15) - U(10)
$$

    But this is true because of diminishing marginal utility.

2. **Consumer Durables** (e.g., autos, computers) provide services over time and thus have an investment (as well as a consumption) component; thus as the real interest rate—viewed as the real cost of borrowing—rises, demand for durables falls.

    2a. The **real interest rate** is given by:
    
    $$
    r = i - \pi^e
$$
    
    where $i$ is the market or nominal interest rate and $\pi^e$ is the expected rate of price inflation. Notice that we are not using the actually realized rate of inflation but rather the rate that borrowers and lenders expect will occur as of today when decisions are made. This is called the **ex ante real interest rate**. The above relation can be re-written as:
    
    $$
    i = r + \pi^e
$$

    That is, the market interest rate is the real interest rate augmented to include compensation for expected inflation. Finally, when the realized rate of inflation, $\pi$, is used, $r$ is called the **ex post real interest rate**.

3. **Households are believed to display a "positive rate of time preference,"** meaning that, all else equal, they would prefer to consume now rather than in the future. The household choice between present and future consumption (and hence the decision about saving) depends on the strength of time preference versus the relative price of future consumption $\left[\frac{1}{(1+r)}\right]$; there is a substitution (or incentive) and an income (also called a target-wealth effect) effect that work in opposite directions. Under the former, a higher rate of return on saving, $r$, provides an incentive to save more today or, put another way, to substitute future for current consumption (for a given rate of time preference). By contrast, saving will fall (current consumption rise) to the extent that the higher rate of return does not require as much saving to achieve a target level of wealth in the future (say at retirement). Based on empirical evidence on aggregate consumption behavior, we assume that the substitution effect dominates so that higher $r$ means lower current consumption and hence higher household saving. This effect can alter the above result on consumption smoothing.
4. **There are a few other important determinants of consumption.** As suggested above, consumption depends on a household’s net wealth—the value of its stocks and bonds and houses, etc. minus the value of its debts. The idea is that (net) assets generate a stream of current and future non-wage income which provides resources (in addition to wages) that support consumption over one’s lifetime. The value of wealth varies inversely with interest rates. Also, the state of consumer confidence matters for consumption.

	- Let's briefly give an example of how wealth varies inversely with interest rates. Consider stock prices, which can be thought of as the sum of a "fundamental" component and a bubble component. Ignoring the bubble possibility, a stock's fundamental price is the present discounted value of the future dividend stream, that is:

	$$
    P_s = \frac{\text{div}_{t+1}}{(1+i)} + \frac{\text{div}_{t+2}}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{\text{div}_{t+3}}{(1+i)^3} + \ldots 
$$

    where $\text{div}_{t+j}$ is the dollar amount of dividends paid to shareholders at the end of period $t+j$ and $i$ is the market interest rate (this is discussed more fully in Econ 111). Thus, for a given value of the dividend stream, the stock price varies inversely with interest rates.

### Market in New Goods and Services:The IS Curve

1. Current real consumption of domestically-produced or foreign-produced goods and services depends on current real after-tax income and on expected future real after-tax income. (It also depends on the real interest rate and other factors as discussed in points 2, 3, and 4 below.) There are two main pieces to understanding the basics of modern models of consumption (known as the "life-cycle” and "permanent income" models of consumption)

First, consumption “smoothing” over one'’s lifetime is approximately optimal. That is, if a person expects to live T periods, then $\mathbf{C}_{1}=\mathbf{C}_{2}=\ldots=\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{T}}$ is approximately optimal. This follows from the key assumption of diminishing marginal utility of consumption. For example, over two periods with a total of 20 units of consumption, reallocating one's consumption from a smooth (10, 10) to a choppy (5, 15) lowers utility on balance because reducing consumption by 5 units (in period one) lowers utility more than raising consumption 5 units (in period two) boosts utility; thus smooth or equal consumption is optimal. For students interested in a simple math proof, suppose that utility of consumption over the two periods is additively separable, i.e., $U(C_{1},C_{2})=U(C_{1})+U(C_{2})$ This expression assumes no discounting of future utility. In this case, we need to prove that $U(10)+U(10)>U(5)+U(15)$ to show the optimality of consumption smoothing Re-write the inequality as: $U(10) - U(5)>U(15) - U(10)$. But this is true because of diminishing marginal utility.]] There are some exceptions we will explore briefly. These include the difference between market interest rates and the rate of time preference capital market imperfections in which an individual cannot borrow against future income enough to maintain consumption in periods of low income; legal limits to consumption in certain periods such as occurred in the U.S. during the corona-virus period of 2020 and during the rationing period of World War II.

Second, under modern models, consumption in every period of life depends on an individual's expected lifetime resources, not just today 's resources. This has implications for temporary vs. permanent changes in income. For example, if a person unexpectedly receives S1 on a temporary or transitory basis either because of a one-time wealth transfer or a temporary tax cut lasting just one period and if the person allocates the income evenly to consumption in each period of their lifetime, then consumption rises by (1/T) dollars each period. That is, the marginal propensity to consume out of wealth or out of temporary income is (1/T). If T is 33 years, then the one-time S1 boost to income raises consumption 3 cents per year (relative to baseline) starting immediately. As an application, an exogenous decline in house prices resulting in a S1 fall in household wealth would reduce total consumer spending by 3 cents (and, in fact, empirical evidence supports a decline of 3 cents on the dollar in the aggregate).

By contrast, if the person unexpectedly receives an additional dollar every period so that the income rise is permanent, lifetime resources rise by S33 and consumption rises by S1 per year (relative to baseline) starting immediately. Thus the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income is 1. Notice I have described the increase in either temporary or permanent income as "unexpected." What would happen to the path of consumption at the moment of an increase in income if the increase were fully expected such as an increase in income when you move from college to a job or from your working years to retirement? Short answer: nothing happens, it already did.

Implicitly, the prior analysis assumes perfect capital (borrowing and lending) markets so that an individual can borrow against their expected future income. If the government unexpectedly announces a permanent tax cut of $S1000$ per person to take effect in two years then individuals must be able to borrow against that expected future boost to aftertax income (or draw down existing savings). Otherwise, consumption smoothing starting today at the new higher level of consumption would not be possible

To summarize at this point, households will choose the optimal level of current consumption given today's current, and expectations of future, after-tax income, etc. (i.e., given today's view about lifetime resources). They will (approximately) maintain this level of consumption for the rest of their lifetime unless something unexpected happens that alters today's expectations of current and future income, etc. For example, ar unexpected boost to lifetime resources would lead to an immediate increase in consumption to a new level that would remain constant ("smoothed") until the next unexpected change in lifetime resources occurs

Notice that these considerations help explain the observed business cycle positively correlated co-movement of aggregate consumption and income. Presumably some of any observed change in aggregate income is unexpected and leads to a change in consumption in the same direction based on our model of consumption. Further, to the extent that enough individuals cannot borrow against future income and thus must consume out of current income only, there again would be a positive correlation between aggregate income and consumption; for example, an unexpected temporary decline in income (e.g. due to a recession) would force borrowing (or liquidity) constrained individuals to cut consumption. Borrowing constraints require a modification of our basic consumption model.

Before moving on, it is worth noting that the optimality of consumption smoothing implies that individuals would be willing to pay a positive amount to avoid swings in consumption over time. The amount they would pay is very much like an insurance premiumin this case it would be to insure against swings in total consumption However, it is not possible to buy private insurance to protect against consumption swings due to macroeconomic events, such as recessions and booms (we will talk about this more later in the course). In such circumstances, perhaps government stabilizatior policy could in effect provide the insurance

2. consumer durables (e.g., autos, computers) provide services over time and thus have an investment (as well as a consumption) component; thus as the real interest rate—viewed as the real cost of borrowingrises, demand for durables falls.

$\pi^{\circ}$ is the expected rate of price inflation. Notice that we are not using the actually realized rate of inflation but rather the rate that borrowers and lenders expect will occur as of today when decisions are made. This is called the ex ante real interest rate. The above relation can be re-written as: $\mathbf{i}=\mathbf{r}+\pi^{\circ}$ , that is the market interest rate is the real interest rate augmented to include compensation for expected inflation. Finally, when the realized rate of inflation, 70 , is used, r is called the ex post real interest rate.

3. Households are believed to display a “positive rate of time preference,” meaning that, all else equal, they would prefer to consume now rather than in the future. The household choice between present and future consumption (and hence the decision about saving) depends on the strength of time preference versus the relative price of future consumption [1/(1+r)]; there is a substitution (or incentive) and an income (also called a target-wealth effect) effect that work in opposite directions. Under the former, a higher rate of return on saving, r, provides an incentive to save more today or, put another way, to substitute future for current consumption (for a given rate of time preference). By contrast, saving will fall (current consumption rise) to the extent that the higher rate of return does not require as much saving to achieve a target level of wealth in the future (say at retirement) Based on empirical evidence on aggregate consumption behavior, we assume that the substitution effect dominates so that higher r means lower current consumption and hence higher household saving. This effect can alter the above result on consumption smoothing.

4. There are a few other important determinants of consumption. As suggested above, consumption depends on a household’s net wealththe value of its stocks and bonds and houses, etc. minus the value of its debts. The idea is that (net) assets generate a stream of current and future non-wage income which provides resources (in addition to wages) that support consumption over one’s lifetime. The value of wealth varies inversely with interest rates. Also, the state of consumer confidence matters for consumption

Let's briefly give an example of how wealth varies inversely with interest rates. Consider stock prices, which can be thought of as the sum of a "fundamental" component and a bubble component. Ignoring the bubble possibility, a stock's fundamental price is the present discounted value of the future dividend stream, that is:
    $$
    P_s = \frac{\text{div}_{t+1}}{(1+i)} + \frac{\text{div}_{t+2}}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{\text{div}_{t+3}}{(1+i)^3} + \ldots 
$$
    where $\text{div}_{t+j}$ is the dollar amount of dividends paid to shareholders at the end of period $t+j$ and $i$ is the market interest rate (this is discussed more fully in Econ 111). Thus, for a given value of the dividend stream, the stock price varies inversely with interest rates. Thus, for a given value for the dividend stream, the stock price varies inversely with interest rates.

Taken together, the previous points imply that current period real consumption depends on current (after-tax) wage income and expected future (after-tax) wage income.

In addition, current consumption depends on non-human wealth, real interest rates, and consumer confidence. Further, wealth is inversely related to interest rates as well as having an exogenous component such as the price of housing (assumed exogenous in this course). These separate factors can replace non-human wealth in the expression for current consumption (see equation 2 below).

5. Real investment in plant and equipment and software by businesses and in new homes (i.e., residential construction) by households varies inversely with real borrowing costs i.e., with the real interest rate. Also, real business investment depends on business optimism/pessimism as well as on expectations of future demand for their products (i.e., expected future sales). Although taken as exogenous in our model, some economists have speculated that business confidence itself can be directly affected by fiscal policy for example, some argue that the budget deficit reducing policies of the early 1990s actually stimulated business confidence and, hence, investment
6. Real U.S. imports depend on our current and expected future income and, hence, real U.S. net exports (i.e., exports minus imports) vary inversely with domestic income. Also, real U.S. exports minus imports tend to rise as the dollar falls relative to other currencies. i.e., as the dollar depreciates. I use the convention that the exchange value of the dollar is denominated as foreign currency per dollar so that an increase (decrease) in the exchange rate is an appreciation (depreciation) of the dollar.

The value of the dollar tends to rise as domestic interest rates rise relative to those abroad: higher U.S. rates provide incentive for world-wide investors to increase demand for dollars to buy dollar-denominated interest bearing securities, which in turn pushes up the value of the dollar. The basis for this relationship is known as open-interest parity (the name means that interest rates in different "open-economy" countries are equal (on par) in equilibrium after accounting for exchange rate movements in their respective currencies). Thus higher domestic U.S. interest rates increase the exchange value of the dollar, reducing U.S. net exports (and equivalently boosting foreign saving in the U.S.)

Open interest parity is an equilibrium relationship govermning interest returns when investments are made in the securities of different countries, recognizing that purchase of foreign securities first requires purchase of foreign currency. To a U.S. investor, the gross return, in dollars, after 1 year if a $S100$ investment is made in the United States at an annual interest rate of r is given by: $S100(1+r)$.By contrast, the gross return, in dollars, after 1 year if a S100 investment is made abroad at a foreign annual interest rate of r, and a current exchange rate of e and expected exchange rate at the end of the year of E(e) is given by: ${\mathrm{S100e(1+r_{f})/E(e)}}$; the numerator gives the gross return in foreign currency after 1 year and the denominator converts the foreign currency amount back into dollars. Assuming that financial investors care only about the expected rate of return (and thus ignore default risk), these two dollar returns must be equal in equilibrium; if not, then worldwide investors would change their investment directions until the two returns were equal. Setting the two dollar return expressions equal to each other and using the (emathematical approximation that $(1+\mathbf{r})/(1+\mathbf{r}_{\beta})=1+\mathbf{r-r}_{\beta}$ it follows that: $r-r_f=$ E(e)/E(e). This implies that if the domestic interest rate equals the foreign rate, the current and expected future exchange value of the dollar are equal. If the domestic interest rate were to rise relative to the foreign rate (so that $r>r_{p})$, the current value of the exchange rate would have to rise relative to the expected future value (in which case the market would expect the exchange value of the dollar to depreciate, i.e., it would expect $\mathbb{E}($e)<e). The equilibrium relationship can be re-written: $\mathbf{e} =$E(e) + E(e) [r- $r_{f}$] which is the form of our exchange rate equation below assuming that E(e) is a constant, for simplicity (the constant is labeled $e_0$ as the intercept and e, when multiplying r r,) interest rates are zero. The so-called traditional channels of influence of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] are: i. lower interest rates boost consumption by lowering the cost of borrowing, by increasing the value of household wealth, and reducing the incentive to save (that is assumed to exceed the target wealth effect) i. lower rates (e.g., lower corporate bond rates and lower mortgage rates) boost investment by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses and for residential construction i. lower domestic interest rates (relative to those abroad) reduce the exchange value of the dollar and hence boost net exports

8. $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{C}+\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{X}-\mathbf{M}$ or, equivalently, $S_{\mathrm{th}}+S_{\mathrm{tus}}+S_{\mathrm{gov}}+S_{\mathrm{for}}=$I. These two equations define equilibrium in the market for new goods and services.

The full set of equations defining the goods market is presented next; all variables are taken as of time t (today) although for simplicity I have not included time subscripts. Even expected future real output $(Y^{\mathrm{o}})$ is dated at time t in the sense that the expectation is formed today based on all relevant information available today
Here is the content from the image converted into markdown with LaTeX for the equations:

## Model Equations and Variable List
1.$Y = C + I + G + X - M$
2.$C = C_0 + c_y (Y - T) + c_{ye} (Y - T)^e - c_r r$
3.$I = I_0 + i_y Y + i_{ye} Y^e - i_r r$
4.$NX = N_0 - n_y Y - n_{ye} Y^e - n_e e$
5.$e = e_0 + e_r (r - r_f)$

Notice that the equations are linear in the variables. A list of variables contained in the model follows:

-$Y, Y^e$denote current and expected future real output (i.e., real GDP), respectively
-$C$denotes real private consumption expenditures
-$I$denotes real private investment expenditures (business plus residential)
-$G$denotes real government expenditures (not including transfer payments)
-$NX = X - M$denotes real exports minus imports (i.e., real net exports)
-$T, T^e$denote current and expected future taxes minus transfer payments, real
-$Y - T, Y^e - T^e$denote real current and expected future disposable income, respectively
-$r$denotes the real interest rate
-$r_f$denotes the real foreign interest rate
-$e$denotes the exchange value of the dollar (expressed in units of foreign currency per dollar, so a higher value of$e$denotes an appreciation of the dollar)
-$S_{hh}, S_{bus}, S_{gov}, S_{for}$denote household, business, government, and foreign saving, respectively

All coefficients are taken as a positive constant. Examples:
-$c_y = \frac{dC}{d(Y-T)}$= marginal propensity to consume out of current real disposable income;
-$i_y = \frac{dI}{dY}$= marginal propensity to invest out of current output.

The sum of these two marginal propensities is assumed to be less than one.

### The Intercept Terms also Have Interpretations

For example,$C_0$is assumed to capture exogenous consumption-related variables such as the price of housing and consumer confidence and people being ordered to stay home (during the corona-virus outbreak).

$I_0$is assumed to capture exogenous investment-related variables such as business optimism/pessimism, sometimes referred to as "animal spirits."

By substituting equations 2 – 5 into equation 1 and solving the result for$r$as a function of$Y$, we get the following linear equation that mathematically defines the IS curve:

$$
r = (\text{messy negative slope coefficient}) Y + (\text{messy intercept term})
$$

The sum of these two marginal propensities is assumed to be less than one.

Conclusion: higher domestic real interest rates reduce aggregate demand; the downward sloping curve in (Y, r) space that captures all combinations of real rates and GDP consistent with equilibrium in the market for new goods and services is called the IS curve.

Here is the reason that the curve is downward sloping: because $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{C}+\mathbf{I}+\mathbf{G}+\mathbf{N}\mathbf{X}$ an increase in Y must be accompanied by an increase in C+ I+ G+ NX which requires a lower real interest rate.

The curve shijfs to the right (or upward) with several exogenous factors captured in the “messy” intercept term, including increases in G, improved consumer or business confidence (i.e., an increase in $C_{0}$ or $\Gamma_{0}$, an increase in the exogenous price of housing and hence household wealth (captured as an increase in $C_0)$, increased foreign demand for U.S. goods (captured as an exogenous increase in exports), and an increase in the real foreign interest rate, $r_{F}$ which causes the dollar to depreciate and net exports to rise. The effect of tax cuts on current consumption and, hence, aggregate demand is ambiguous they boost current disposable income but reduce future disposable income if the currenf cuts are expected to be financed by future tax hikes.

An aside on curve shifting: Recall the equation for a straight line, $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{mX}+\mathbf{b}$.Here,Y is the variable on the vertical axis, X is the variable on the horizontal axis, “m" is the slope of the line, and *b” is the Y-intercept. Generally in this course, important curves (such as the IS curve) will be straight lines, so the above formula applies. The curve shifts if and only if “b” changes (of course, “b” may be a complicated linear combination of several exogenous variables, so “b" will change if any of its components change) Finally, if Y changes but “b" does not then we are talking about movement along the

### Monetary Policy

$$.\:\mathrm{r}=\mathrm{M}\left(\pi-\pi^{*},\:\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{Y}_{p}\right)=\mathrm{r}^{*}+\mathrm{r}_{\pi}(\pi-\pi^{*})+\mathrm{r}_{\gamma}(\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{Y}_{p})$$
The Fed is assumed to raise real interest rates when price inflation on goods and services, 21, rises relative to its target, π *, and when the output gap (difference between actual and potential GDP) rises. I have linearized the Fed's policy response function, M, after the second equals sign; in this expression, $r^{*}$ is exogenous, although it depends on a host of factors in more complicated formulations. Also r, and r, are positive constants. For example, $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{y}}=$dr/d(Y$-\mathbf{Y}_\mathrm{p})$ and is interpreted as the impact of a change in the output gap on the real interest rate. Also, all variables are taken as of time t (today) but for simplicity I have not included time subscripts.

This [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] “rule” can be described as “leaning against the wind." The idea intuitively is that if π rises or if Y rises, an increase in the real interest rate by the Fed reduces aggregate demand (through the channels discussed above) and puts downward pressure on inflation and output; conversely, if $\pi$ falls or if Y falls, a reduction in the real interest rate by the Fed boosts aggregate demand and puts upward pressure on inflation and output. This Fed “rule” has very roughly been in effect for a long time, arguably since the 1970s. Further, the rule is deceptively simple, masking a host of important issues, including the following (discussed in depth in Econ 111): a. for stability, Fed must target the rea/ interest rate if π rises and i goes up, but less than point-for-point, the real interest rate falls and aggregate demand rises and hence m rises even more, leading to unstable dynamics. For stable dynamics, di/d $\pi>1$.This is sometimes called the Taylor Principle (after economist, John Taylor).

b. implementation is difficult because we don't observe potential GDP and because there are several empirical measures of inflation (including the CPl). With regards to inflation, the Fed has to choose between total or headline inflation and core inflation (core inflation removes food and energy inflation from the total).

c. Asset price inflation (such as the price of homes or stocks) is not included directly, only indirectly to the extent that it affects consumer price inflation $(\pi)$ or real GDP d. For a long time, policymakers took zero as the lower bound on nominal interest rates, implying a limit to stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]. [Negative nominal interest rates, mainly short-term, have been observed in a few countries around the world during the past few years; this interesting topic will not be discussed in this course.] Indeed, the Fed acted as if zero was the lower bound for short-term nominal interest rates, especially the federal funds rate; for example, the funds rate was zero between late 2008 and late 2015 and again between early 2020 and early 2022. During the earlier period, it was thought that the Fed was out of traditional ammunition to fight recessions and in response the Fed took several innovative measures to get around the issue of the zero lower bound for the funds rate; the Fed. This included three rounds of quantitative easing, the massive purchase of both short-term and long-term Treasury and private securities. The intent was to lower long-term interest rates, which remained positive, because long-term rates generally are more closely related to the components of aggregate demand than short rates. The Fed also introduced "credit easing" which made liquidity available to certain select markets (such as the market for [[Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]]) to prevent such markets from shutting down necessary credit flows. (These actions are discussed in much more detail in Econ 111). In 2020 and 2021, the Fed again used these modern tools to limit the decline in the economy resulting from the corona-virus/COVID 19.

c. The Fed could focus on expected inflation, $\pi^{\circ}$, and on expected output, $Y^{\kappa}$, instead of current values. This would account for the empirical fact that Fed actions take time in the real world before they are felt by the economy. Perhaps surprisingly such a modification does not affect the qualitative results below very much.

f. In (Y,r) space, the curve relating all values of r and y consistent with the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] rule is called the MP line. It is horizontal if r depends only on t; it is upward sloping if r depends on y. The idea is that if y falls (rises) the Fed leans against the wind by reducing (increasing) the real interest rate. Also, the MP curve shifts up with higher inflation: the idea is that, for a given y, higher inflation causes the Fed to boost the real interest rate to fight the higher inflation. The curve shifts up (down) if the target rate of inflation falls (rises). $率率\vec{To}$ simplify the analytics for the remainder of this module, we will ignore the impact of the output gap on interest-rate setting by the Fed and thus consider only the case where the $MP$ line is flat, shifting up or down with inflation; we set r, equal to zero.**

### Aggregate Demand: IS-MP in (Y$,\pi)$ space

As rises, r rises because of the Fed response; this leads to a reduction in the interest-rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand (AD). The curve relating all values of Y and $\pi$ consistent with goods market equilibrium subject to the Fed’'s policy response function is called the AD curve; it is downward sloping. The curve shifts right or upward with higher values of current G, improved consumer/business confidence, and lower taxes, and higher values of the Fed’s target rate of inflation $(\pi^*)$ A mathematical derivation is given in Appendix 2

### Aggregate Supply

Modeling the supply side of the macro economy is more controversial than the demand side. This is because of the debate over the degree of inertia or stickiness of wages and prices and price expectations in the short run. In the classical approach wages and prices are flexible even in the short run so that the economy (in particular, the labor market) is always in equilibrium with fully employed resources; this implies that output always equals its natural value. In Keynesian-style approaches, stickiness of wages/prices/price expectations allows for unemployment and output to not always equal their “*natural* levels. We will consider both approaches. We start with a Keynesian approach to the supply side as presented in Blanchard’s textbook (basics in chapters 7 and 8 in newes) edition, and 6 and 7 in prior editions; extensions in chapter 13 in all editions)

### Wage Setting

$$ W = A P^e f(u, z) $$

where $df/du < 0$. Simplify by linearizing the $f(.)$ function as follows:
$$ f(.) = 1 - \alpha u + z $$

and thus we get:
$$ W = A P^e (1 - \alpha u + z) $$

Here, $W$ denotes the nominal wage rate; $P^e$ denotes the expected price level; $u$ denotes the unemployment rate; $A^e$ is the expected level of a measure of labor productivity (discussed in more detail below); $z$ denotes other labor-market factors, like the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits, the level of the minimum wage, and the degree of employment protection. We define the unemployment rate as $u = 1 - N/L$, where $N$ is employment and $L$ is the size of the labor force (assumed exogenous). We define $z$ in such a way that $df/dz > 0$; $\alpha$ is a positive constant.

Wages are determined as the result of bargaining between workers and firms. Participants have bargaining power that depends on conditions in the overall labor market (including competition from foreign labor), such as the level of the unemployment rate, and on how costly it would be for firms to replace workers (as well as on $A^e$ and $P^e$). For example, a higher unemployment rate likely would weaken the bargaining power of workers and hence reduce the nominal wage rate, assuming that the wage rate is flexible in the downward direction. Similarly, an increase in unemployment insurance benefits (i.e., an increase in $z$) likely would improve the bargaining power of workers and boost wages. Also, expected prices and productivity gains matter because workers care about how much inflation will erode their nominal wages and how productivity gains will be divided between firms and workers.

### Price Setting by Firms

The price, $P$, set by a firm depends on the costs it faces in producing output and on the degree of competition it faces. In particular, higher costs get passed through into higher prices and less competition results in higher prices.

Costs depend on the nature of the production function and on the prices of factor inputs. The production function is given by:
$$ Y = A F(N, K) $$

where $dY/dN = A dF/dN > 0$ and $d^2 Y/dN^2 < 0$. The latter inequality is the assumption of diminishing marginal productivity of labor. "$K$" denotes the services of the stock of physical capital, which is assumed fixed at $K_0$ in short-run analysis. To simplify, labor and physical capital are the only two factors of production, with energy inputs being ignored at this point. "$A$" is a measure of the level of technology and changes in it are termed "productivity shocks" in part because the marginal product of labor is $dY/dN = AF'(N, K_0)$ which obviously depends on "$A$".

If there was perfect competition in the goods market, the price of output would be equal to the marginal cost of production. The marginal cost of producing another unit of output depends on how many additional labor hours are needed and on the wage rate of labor ($=W$). Total production cost is $WN = \text{Cost}$ (we ignore capital and other costs which are assumed constant in our short run analysis) and thus the marginal cost of production is $d\text{Cost}/dY = W(dN/dY) = W/(dY/dN) = W/AF'(N, K_0)$ for a given nominal wage rate.

Blanchard simplifies by assuming constant returns to labor in production, i.e., $F(N) = NK_0$. Thus, $Y = ANK_0$. Note: **unit labor costs** are defined as $WN/Y$, which equals $W/AK_0$ in Blanchard's model.This implies that the marginal product of labor is a constant, "$AK_0$", and that the unemployment rate, $u = 1 - N/L = 1 - Y/AK_0 L$. Without further loss of generality Blanchard assumes $A = 1$ (and we will also assume initially that $K_0 = 1$), so that $Y = N$. This implies that $AF'(N) = 1$ since both $A$ and $F'(N)$ equal 1; and thus the marginal cost of production is simply $W$, the wage rate that the firm is facing.

Thus the competitive firm would set $P = W$; if $A$ and $K_0$ do not equal 1 the firm would set:
$$ P = W/AK_0 $$
However, many goods markets are not [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]], and firms charge a price in excess of marginal cost.That is, $P=(I+m)W/AK_{0}$, where m denotes the percentage “markup” of prices over (unit labor) cost. For example, if $\mathbf{m}=0.1$ then prices are marked up 10 percent over (unit labor) cost. This equation implies that $\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{AK}_{v}/(1+\mathbf{m})$ Thus, the real wage, W/P, is constant unless the markup, technology or fixed capital stock changes.

A final important concept is labor's share of total income $:=\frac{1}{2}$ WN/PY. (Try plugging in values for W/P and for N/Y using our model.)

Combining Wage Setting and Price Setting: Aggregate Supply

Combining the above key equations, with A and $K_{0}$ not equal to 1, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}&\mathrm{P=(1+m)~W/AK_{0}=(1+m)~(A^{c}/AK_{0})P^{c}~(1-~au~+z)~where~u=1-Y/AK_{0}~L.}\\&\mathrm{Thus,~P=(1+m)~(A^{c}/AK_{0})P^{c}[1+z-\alpha+aY/AK_{0}~L].}\end{aligned}$$

1. This expression implies that an increase in output leads to an increase in the price level and is called an aggregate supply relationship (between output and the price levelbelow we develop another aggregate supply relationship that connects output to the rate of price inflation). The underlying rationale is that higher output requires more labor input (for given levels of A and $K_{\mathrm{n}}$; more employment implies a lower unemployment rate; a lower level of the unemployment rate puts upward pressure on wages, W; and higher wages lead firms to increase prices. 2. An increase in the expected price level or expected level of labor productivity leads to a proportionate increase in the price level. If wage setters expect a higher price level (or their productivity to be higher), they bargain for a higher nominal wage; the higher wage is an increase in production costs that leads firms to boosts output prices. 3. To simplify the analysis until later in the module, assume $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} ^{\mathrm{~} }= \mathbf{K} _{0}= 1$ rather than the price level. Indeed, the AD curve is a relationship between output and price inflation, not the price level. So far, our discussion of the supply side has been in terms of the price level. Now let's recast the discussion in terms of the inflation rate (i.e. the percentage change in the price level, $\Delta\mathbf{P}/\mathbf{P}_{t-1})$.We will need to add time subscripts to all the price terms and to the unemployment rate and output. For example, the price level at time t (today) is P. The price level in period t-1 (last period) is $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}.$ Dating of the other variables is handled the same way. The variable m and z will not have time subscripts because they will be assumed exogenous

How much does the price level rise from last period to this period, expressed as a percent of last period’s price level? The answer is: $(\mathbf{P}_{t}-\mathbf{P}_{t-1})/\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$ This is the percentage change in the price level, otherwise known as the actual rate of price inflation,,

We can ask a similar question about the expected price level: Given all the informatior available to you last period, by how much did you expect last period's price level, $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$ to increase this period (again, expressed as a percent of last period’s price level)? The answer is: ($\mathbf{P} _{i}^{0}$ - $\mathbf{P} _{i1}) / \mathbf{P} _{i1}$ In this expression, $P_{1}^{\mathrm{c}}$ is the price level that you expected last period to occur this period and ($\mathbf{P}_{t}^{\mathrm{c}}-\mathbf{P}_{t-1})/\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$ is known as the expected rate of price inflation for period t, $\pi_{t}^{e}.$ To drive home the point, the price level that you expect this period to hold next period (in period, t+1) is given by, $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}^{t}.$

Here are some handy results about inflation and expected inflation: (i) ($\mathbf{P} _{t}$ - $\mathbf{P} _{t+ 1}) / \mathbf{P} _{t+ 1}$ = $\mathbf{P} / \mathbf{P} _{t+ 1}$ - $1=\pi_{1}.$ This implies: $\mathbf{P}_{t}/\mathbf{P}_{t+1}=1+\pi_{t}$

(i) Similarly, we can show that: $\mathbf{P}^{e}/\mathbf{P}_{t+1}=1+\pi^{e}$,

Now recall the AS relationship above: $\mathbf{P}_{1}=\left(1+\mathbf{m}\right)\mathbf{P}_{t}^{\mathrm{c}}\left(1-\alpha\mathbf{u}_{t}+\mathbf{z}\right)$ where I have added time subscripts. Notice that an increase in the expected price level leads to an increase in the actual price level at time t. But an increase in the expected price level for today $(\mathbf{P}_{i}^{e})$ also leads to an increase in the expected rate of inflation for today $(\pi_{t}^{\mathrm{e}})$; this follows from the above definition of the expected rate of inflation. Moreover, an increase in the actual price level today leads to an increase in the today's actual rate of inflation. Thus, the AS relationship implies an increase in the expected rate of inflation for today $(\pi_{i}^{e})$ leads to an increase in today's actual rate of inflation $(\pi_{t})$

Now divide both sides of the above AS relationship by $\mathbf{P}_{t-1}$ and use our two handy results above. We get: $1+\pi_{i}=(1+\pi_{i}^{t})(1+$m)(1-au$_\mathrm{t}+$z). Next, divide both sides by $(1+\pi_{\uparrow}^{*})(1+m)$.We thus get: $(1+\pi_{i})/(1+\pi_{i}^{i})(1+m)=(1-\alpha u_{i}+z)$ Focusing on the left hand side, we repeatedly apply the approximation: In $(1+\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{x}$ for small values of X, and get the following approximation:

*** π, = - αu + π + m + z. Letting u = 1 - Y/L, we get *** = Y/L +, + m + z -

These are our inflation determination equations and are versions of the famous expectations-augmented Phillips curve. They hold in the short run and in the long run (albeit in a simplified form as shown below). Notice that the second equation is a linear relationship between inflation and output and gives an upward sloping straight line in (Y$,\pi)$ space called the short run aggregate supply curve. The intercept term is: $\pi_{1}^{e}+$ $m+z$ -0. An increase (decrease) in any of these terms shifts the short-run aggregate supply curve upward (downward); I have ignored α in this discussion of curve shifts because it will remain constant

Long run equilibrium (Blanchard calls this the medium run equilibrium) is defined by P = $P^{\mathrm{e}}$. This implies that $\pi_{1}=\pi_{t}^{\mathrm{c}}$ in long-run equilibrium. (In a more general model, we would characterize long run equilibrium with the additional condition: $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{A}^{t}$)

It follows from the first inflation determination equation that: $\mathbf{u}^{*}=(\mathbf{m}+\mathbf{z})^{\prime}\mathbf{\alpha}$ in long run equilibrium. For students interested in mathematical details, this value for u* follows from all of the approximations used in deriving the first inflation determination equation above. The precise value is $\mathbf{u}^{*}=(\mathbf{m}+\mathbf{z}+\mathbf{m}\mathbf{z})/\alpha(1+\mathbf{m})$; it is derived from the exact AS relationship: $1+\pi_{i}=(1+\pi_{i}^{e})(1+$m$)(1-\alpha$u$_\mathrm{t}+$z) and the conditions that $\pi_{\mathrm{t}}=\pi_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{c}}$ Notice that the precise value is very similar to the approximate value if m is small, a reasonable assumption.] Thus, we can re-write the first inflation determination equation (using the approximations) as:

 $\pi _{i}= \pi _{i}^{e}- a\left (\mathrm{u} _{i}- \mathrm{u} ^{* }\right)$.From the definition of u, we have: $\mathbf{u}^{*}=1$ - $(\mathbf{Y}^{*}/\mathbf{L})$

Thus:  $\pi _{i}= \pi _{i}^{\varepsilon }+ (a/ \mathcal{L}) (\mathcal{Y} _{i}- \mathcal{Y} ^{* })$ In this alternative form, Y* = [1- (m+z)/a]L

Thus in long run equilibrium $\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}^{*}$ and $Y=Y^{*}$. In long-run equilibrium, output equals the natural level $(Y^{*}=Y_{n})$ no matter what the level of the inflation rate [note: think of Y, as equivalent to Y in the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] rule, that is, $Y^{*}=Y_{\mathrm{~a}}=Y_{\mathrm{~p}}$

Thus the long-run supply curve is vertical and shifts with any change in the variables that determine $Y^{*}.$ Changes in m and z (as well as $A$ and $K_{0}$ in a more general model) are considered *supply-side shocks” that shift both the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves.

Actual output and potential output equal each other in long-run equilibrium.But outside of long-run equilibrium actual output can exceed potential output, creating upward pressure on price inflation. This possibility will be very important when we discuss whether the model is applicable to analyzing the impact of the corona-virus later in this module

Also, in the long run $(\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{P}^{t})$, the wage setting relationship becomes: $\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{P}(1-\alpha\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{z})$ This defines a downward sloping line in (u, W/P) space.

In long run equilibrium the price setting relationship is unchanged: $\mathbf{P}=(1+m)W$ which implies $\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{P}=1/(1+\mathbf{m})$ This gives a horizontal line in (u, W/P) space.

The intersection of these two curves defines the natural rate of unemployment, $u_{_{N}}=u^{*}$ also called the structural rate of unemployment. Algebraically, it is given by: $\mathbf{u}_{n}=(\mathbf{m}+\mathbf{z}+\mathbf{m}\mathbf{z})/\mathbf{\alpha}(1+\mathbf{m})$ which is $(\mathfrak{m}+\mathfrak{z})/\mathfrak{u}$, approximately (assuming that m is small). This is derived by solving the wage and price setting relationships for W/P and then equating them. An alternative method is to solve the long run equilibrium Phillips curve for u (using $\pi_{\mathrm{t}}=\pi_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{c}}$), as noted above. In either case, an increase in m or z increases the natural rate of unemployment

The natural rate of unemployment leads to a corresponding natural rate of output, $Y_n=$ $Y^{*}$ because of the above definition of the unemployment rate which holds for all values of the unemployment rate and output: u =1-N/L=1-Y/L in Blanchard’s model.

Bonus section on the long run impact of technology, A, on employment.

With only a slight modification, we can analyze the long-run impact of shocks to technology or labor productivity on jobs. There are many examples of concern about technology (machines) causing job loss dating back to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Such concerns continue to the present day.

Luddites were workers in the textile industry in the early 1800s in England who destroyed machines they thought threatened their jobs. The word, luddite, now refers to a person opposed to new technology. In France in the 1800s it is alleged (the historical fact is somewhat controversial) that workers destroyed machines with their wooden shoes, called sabots; hence the modern terms of saboteur and sabotage. In the 1990s, France passed a law reducing the normal workweek from 39 to 35 hours because of concern that technological progress meant not enough work for all workers to have full-time jobs.

To analyze the issue in the long run $(\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{P} ^{\mathrm{c} }$ and $\mathrm{A=A}^{\mathrm{c}}$), we use the wage setting relationship: $\mathbf{W}=\mathbf{AP}(1-\alpha\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{z})$ where A is not equal to 1. This defines a downward sloping line in (u, W/P) space given by: $\mathbf{W/P}=\mathbf{A}(1-\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{z})$

In long run equilibrium the price setting relationship becomes: $\mathbf{P}=(1+\mathbf{m})$W/A (assuming $\mathbf{K}_{0}=1$), which implies $\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{A}/(1+\mathbf{m})$ This gives a horizontal line in (u, W/P) space. Notice that A enters multiplicatively in both the equilibrium wage and price setting relationships.

Thus an increase in A shifts up both the equilibrium wage setting and price setting curves by the same percentage amount (evaluated at the initial equilibrium unemployment rate). Thus a change in technology leaves the equilibrium unemployment rate unaffected; also the equilibrium level of employment is unaffected (since $u=1$ - N/L)!!!

**This is a useful result because empirically decade-average unemployment rates (an approximation to u) donot appear tovary muchat all with changes in labor productivity between 1900 and 2020in the UnitedStates (if anything there is a slight negative correlation).***

In the aggregate, it is estimated that A (labor productivity) rose by a factor of 9 over the 20th century in the U.S., but employment rose by a factor of 7 and the unemployment rate did not increase systematically. Of course the roughly zero correlation between labor productivity growth and unemployment in the aggregate was not true in every sector. For example, productivity in farming grew a lot over the last century but the number of farmers declined from about 11 million to 1 million. By contrast, with enormous growth in computer technology, the number of programmers rose a lot (from 0 in 1960)

### Now back to our basic model

Adjustment of prices and price expectations over time The final issue on the supply side of the model is the adjustment of price level and inflation expectations. We will make the major assumption that expectations of the price level and price inflation are sticky or fixed in the short run; indeed the short run is defined as the period during which price expectations are fixed. As we will see, this assumption allows exogenous shifts in aggregate demand to affect output, relative to its natural (or potential level) in the short run. All other “prices" in the model, such as wages, the price of output, and interest rates are fully flexible even in the short run. In addition, we will assume that inflation (and price level) expectations adjust adaptively over time; this means that individuals will adjust up (down) their expectations of inflation only if actual inflation exceeds (is less than) what had been expected to occur. Mathematically, we can model adaptive inflation expectations as follows:.
$$\Delta\:\pi_{i}^{c}\:=\:\pi_{i}^{c}\:-\:\pi_{i-1}^{c}\:=\:\beta\:(\pi_{i-1}\:-\:\pi_{i-1}^{c})\quad0\leq\beta\:\leq\:1$$
For example, if people expected a $3\%$ inflation rate $(=\pi^{i}_{i-1})$ and if actual inflation $(=\pi_{t-1})$ turned out to be $4\%$ in period t-1, then they would “adapt" to the $1\%$ forecast error by increasing their expectation of inflation for the next period by $1/2\%$ (if $\beta=1/2$).Thus, the revised expectation of inflation would be $3-1/2\%\left[=\pi_{t}^{\mathrm{c}}=\pi_{t-1}^{\mathrm{c}}+\:1/2\left(\pi_{t-1}-\pi_{t-1}^{\mathrm{c}}\right)\right]$

We can re-write the expression for adaptive expectations as follows:

$\pi _{1}^{e}$ = $\beta$ $(\pi _{0. 1})$ + (1 $- \beta$ $) \pi _{1. 1}^{e}$

When written this way, it is seen that expected inflation this period is based on past information. For example, Blanchard implicitly assumes $\beta=1$ (which appears to hold empirically for much of the post-war period in the U.S. until the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007), in which case the expected rate of inflation this period equals last period's actual inflation rate. Thus, if there is an aggregate demand shock this period, inflation expectations will not adjust until next period (even though actual inflation will change this period, as we will see in the next section). For example, if the Fed announces a new target rate of inflation, $\pi^{*}$, this period there will be no immediate impact on inflation expectations; in this sense, Fed announcements are not fully credible in this model (unlike in rational expectations models in which full credibilityi.e, $\pi^{c}=\pi^{*}$ - allows the Fed announcement of a new target inflation to have an immediate impact on inflation expectations and hence on aggregate supply). The lack of an immediate response in our model is the implication of the “stickiness" assumption.

Technical note: For students interested in understanding more about the inner workings of our model, it is helpful to pull the prior analysis together in order to really understand how it is possible for output to exceed its potential or natural level in the short run. This is useful background for our subsequent analysis of the effects of the pandemic To simplify suppose output equals its potential level initially and that there is a positive demand shock (rightward shift in AD curve) putting upward pressure on prices. Since the production function, $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{ANK}_{0}$ always holds, it must be that employment, N, rises above its natural level (given A and $K_{0}$ or that the unemployment rate falls below its natural level in order that output rises above potential. From price setting we know that the real wage, W/P, is constant (given the supply-side exogenous variables: m, A, and $K_{\mathrm{n}}$.This does not mean that wages and prices separately are constant; in fact each rises by the same percentage amount as a result of the demand shock. From wage setting we know: $\mathbf{W} / \mathbf{P} = \left (\mathbf{P} ^{\mathrm{c} }/ \mathbf{P} \right) \left (1- \:\mathbf{a} \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{z} \right)$.Since W/P is constant when there is a demand shock and $P^{\circ}$ is given in the short run, the right hand side must be constant and thus a decline in u must accompany an increase in P. Put another way, firms respond to higher prices by increasing employment of workers and boosting output above potential in the short run with fixed price level and inflation expectations.]]

## Major Uses of Macroeconomie Model

1. The model helps to identify the root causes of observations on output, inflation, etc. Economists on Wall Street and at the Fed do this type of exercise constantly. As an example, suppose we observe decreases in output and inflation over a short period of time. The model allows for such an observation only in the presence of a negative demand-side shock (a supply-side shock, like higher oil prices, would lead to lower observed output but higher inflation). The task then involves figuring out the exact nature of the demand shock. 2. The model offers predictions as to the effect on macroeconomic variables such as aggregate output, inflation, and real interest rates of a change in an exogenous policy or non-policy variable. This model use is developed next under "Combining Aggregate Demand and Supply." This is the standard model application found in textbooks 3. The model helps to explain business cycle facts regarding co-movements (explored in detail below).

Combining Aggregate Demand and Supply (see appendix 3 for mathematical details

$\pi_{i}=\pi_{i}^{c}$ Now we will consider the short-run and long-run macroeconomic impact of changes in exogenous demand-side and supply-side variables. [Hint to analyzing such exogenous changes: it's usually easier to start with what happens on the supply side.]

1. We can model the aggregate effects of the turmoil in housing and financial markets beginning in late 2006 as a negative shock to aggregate demand. To do so requires that we have to interpret our model with flexibility because there is no explicit housing sector and there is only a very simple financial sector (i) One approach is to argue that there has been an exogenous decline in the price of housing. “Exogenous” is meant to be from the perspective of our model of relatively short-run economic activity; it could be justified by a weakening of lending standards over long periods of time that led to overbuilding and an eventual decline in house prices. The exogenous decline in home prices implies an exogenous drop in household net wealth. You can think of this in the model sense as a decline in $\mathbf{C}_{0}$ (the consumption intercept) or in the exogenous component of household wealth. In either case, there has been an exogenous reduction in aggregate demand that shifts both the IS and AD curves to the left. Additionally, these events coincided with a sharp decline in consumer confidence (based on national surveys); such an effect, modeled as an additional decline in $C_{0}$, would reinforce the direct impact of the decline in housing prices on the IS and AD curves. (i) An alternative approach is to argue that the financial turmoilhowever it began made it more difficult for households and firms to obtain credit (e.g., as banks tightened lending standards in the face of a large decline in bank capital) and, for those who could obtain it, more costly. Indeed, the financial turmoil can be viewed as an amplification mechanism boosting the immediate impact of a decline in housing prices, leading to an even larger leftward shift in the IS and AD curves. This can be modeled as an exogenous reduction in housing and business investment demand (a decline in $I_{0}$ in our model). Or we can combine all the proposed factors into one large combined negative shock to aggregate demand

Assume the economy is in long run equilibrium when the shock hits. There is no change in any supply-side exogenous variables so the AS curves are unaffected in the short run. The left shift in the AD curve reduces output. Lower output leads to a higher unemployment rate and hence to lower nominal wages. In turn, this cost reduction leads price setters to reduce output prices. As a result price inflation falls as the AD curve shifts left along the short-run AS curve. The Fed leans against the inflation wind by lowering the real interest rate; this puts upward pressure on aggregate demand and outpu but not by enough to offset the decline resulting from the declines in $C_{0}$ and $I_{0}.$

Notice at this point that $\pi_{i}<\pi_{i}^{c};$ this is because inflation expectations are sticky in the short run. Over time, inflation expectations (and the expected price level) are revised downward. As a result, nominal wages are reset at a lower level, and, for a given level of output, prices fall some more, i.e., the AS curve shifts rightward. The Fed lowers the real interest rate to lean against the inflation wind and this boosts aggregate demand and output over time. This process continues until output rises back to its natural level.

At this point, inflation is less than its initial value and the Fed's target rate of inflation. This is a loose end because a more general condition of long-run equilibrium proceed. The Fed could implicitly allow its target, $\pi^{\prime}$, to decline (think about how this would shift the MP and hence AD curve). Alternatively, the Fed could decide to maintain its original target, in which case it would have to engineer a monetary loosening (a downward shift in the intercept term of the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] function) that would shift the aggregate demand curve back up until the original rate of inflation was achieved. Also, demand shocks often can be temporary (e.g. the decline in consumer sentiment or tightened bank lending standards can reverse in time). In this case, the shifts in the AD and AS curves would reverse themselves as the temporary shock ended. For now, we simply accept that there is a loose end.

Ignoring the loose end, we can ask how the short run and long run dynamic path of the economy in response to an AD shock compares to actual business cycle swings. For sake of this discussion, think of a full business cycle as looking similar to a sine wave. In the case of a negative AD shock, for example (such as an exogenous decline in $C_{0})$, in our model output declines in the short run and then returns to its initial level over time. In a sense, output traces out only half of a complete business cycle; a full cycle would see output fall, then rise back to its original level, then rise to a new peak, and then decline back to its original level (recall the definition of a complete business cycle from module 1).

2. From an initial position of full equilibrium, suppose that there is a supply-side shock such as an inerease in the price of oil. Although oil prices are not formally a part of the model, the model can be extended to allow for them. Assume that the increase is permanent. For example, suppose that the price of crude oil has been S40 per barrel for a long time and then rises to S60 per barrel in period t, and then remains at S60 thereafter. An easy way is to capture an increase in the price of oil by an increase in the markup, m. The reason is that, given wages, an increase in oil prices constitutes an increase in the cost of production (think of energy as a factor of production, along with labor), forcing firms to raise prices. In the model of wage and price setting above, an increase in the markup shifts the horizontal price setting curve downward. The associated reduction in the equilibrium real wage implies an increase in the natural rate of unemployment and hence a reduction in the natural level of output (Y,). Recall: $\mathbf{Y} ^{* }= \mathbf{Y} _{\mathrm{a} }= [1- (\mathbf{m} + \mathbf{z}) / \mathbf{a}]$L In the short run, given $\pi_{i}^{e}$, an increase in the markup owing to higher oil prices leads firms to boost prices, and hence inflation, at any level of actual output; in math terms, this follows from the equation defining the short-run AS curve: $\pi _{1}$ = $a$Y/L+ $\pi _1^2+ m+ z$ $- a$ As a result, the short run AS curve shifts upward. Thus, in the short-run at the intersection of the AD curve and the new AS curve, output declines and inflation rises. In the background, the Fed is fighting the higher inflation by raising the real interest rate (the MP curve shifts up along the IS curve). The resulting case of lower output and higher inflation is sometimes called stagflation, and it happened following the oil price shocks of the 1970s and during 2007-2008.

of the assertion about the shift in the AS curves using the equation for the short run AS curve: $\pi _{t}$ = $\pi _{t}\:^{s}$ + $(\alpha$L) (Y$_1-$Y$^*)$ Suppose we start in a position of long-run equilibrium where the short-run AS, long-run vertical AS, and the AD curves intersect. At this point the level of inflation equals the expected rate of inflation. We can re-arrange the equation for the AS curve as: $(\pi _{t}-$ $\pi _{t}^{\mathrm{e} }) ($L$/\alpha)=($Y$_t-$Y$^*)$.But the left hand side equals zero at the initial point and thus an exogenous reduction in $Y^{*}$ must be matched by an equivalent reduction in Y; that is, the short run AS curve shifts by exactly the same amount as the long run AS curve at the initial level of π.]]

At the new short-run equilibrium, actual inflation exceeds the expected rate of inflation, which is assumed fixed in the short run. Over time, people adaptively adjust up their expectations of inflation. This shifts the AS curve up further over time (recall that $\pi^{\circ}$ is part of the intercept term for the short run AS curve). As a result, actual inflation continues to rise and the Fed continues to raise the real interest rate, thereby reducing aggregate demand and output. The process continues until output has declined to its new natural level.

Again there is a loose end because the inflation rate exceeds the Fed's target rate of inflation. As discussed in point 1 above on the effects of a positive shock to aggregate demand, the loose end can be resolved in several ways.

Ignoring the loose end, we can ask how the short run and long run dynamic path of the economy in response to an AS shock compares to actual business cycle swings. For sake of this discussion, think of a full business cycle as looking similar to a sine wave. In the case of a negative AS shock, for example (such as an exogenous rise in oil prices), in our model output declines in the short run and then continues to decline until it reaches the new equilibrium level (i.e., the new natural level of output)

[A final thought about changes in oil prices: We have implicitly assumed no change on the demand side (i.e. no shifts in the IS and AD curves). This was for convenience, but one could argue for demand-side effects that are the balance of qualitatively offsetting impacts. On the one hand, higher oil prices are like a tax increase to the extent that they raise gasoline prices, thereby reducing consumption expenditures on transportation. Also, higher oil prices may lead certain firms to cancel some investment plans shifting to more energy-saving equipment. On the other hand, some economists now believe that an increase in oil prices is a boost to aggregate investmen demand. This is because of the dramatic increase in size of the domestic U.S. (shale) oil industry. Higher oil prices stimulate domestic investment in extraction equipment. These considerations imply that changes in oil prices be modeled as both a demand shock and a negative supply shock. Of course, this would complicate the analysis. The special section on the corona-virus below engages in an analysis of simultaneous supply and demand-side shocks.]

3. From an initial position of full equilibrium, suppose that there is a positive shock to labor produetivity (an increase in “A"), holding $A^{t}$ fixed in the short run. We must use our version of the Blanchard model in which A does not equal one. On the supply side, an exogenous increase in productivity of labor reduces unit labor costs (given A°) and hence has the same qualitative impact on output prices as does a reduction in wages. Graphically, the short-run AS curve shifts right. An increase in productivity also has demand-side effects; however, Blanchard notes (chapter 13) that the direction of impact is ambiguous and we will ignore the issue.

Earlier we saw that productivity changes had no effect on employment in the long run What happens to the short-run level of employment (and the associated unemployment rate) when productivity rises? Can employment decline (and unemployment rate rise) as a result of technological progress in the short run? Recall Blanchard’s model, $Y=AN$ which implies $\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{Y}/\mathbf{A}$ It follows that an exogenous increase in A will reduce N if Y does not rise enough but will increase N if Y rises by a lot; thus the impact of a change of A on N in the short run is ambiguous in theory (and empirically as well).

### Special Section on the Corona-Virus/COVID 19 Pandemic

In this section I discuss the macroeconomic impact of the corona-virus pandemic using the Blanchard macro-model. Use of the model for this purpose is open to question for reasons detailed below where I also offer a lengthy rationale for using it nevertheless. In the context of the model, I argue that the corona-virus involves both a negative supplyside and demand-side shock, resulting in a reduction in output and employment in the short run. The negative demand-side shock resulting directly from COVID is only partially offset in the short run by the corona-virus relief fiscal packages and Fed special actions (a more complete discussion of fiscal and [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] actions will be given later in the course). Thus, on balance, the demand shock is negative in the short run. An important part of the analysis is linking the very painful short-run impact of the pandemic to the unwinding of the direct demand and supply side shocks on the recovery path back to some semblance of normalcy. We will see that the dynamic adjustment from the short run to the long run differs in substantial ways from the cases examined above.

Empirical background: Data from late March and early April 2020 revealed a massive reduction in employment as initial claims for unemployment insurance cumulated over only 6 weeks to 30 million (out of a total of about 160 million workers employed before the pandemic began); this implies that the unemployment rate rose from $3.5\%$ to at least $17\%$ as of late-April. Also, the industrial production reports for March and April showed respectively a $5\%$ and an $11\%$ decline in output. To put this in perspective, the largest monthly decline in industrial production during the entire decade of the Great Depressior was $10\%$, although many months during the decade showed a decline, typically around $1\%$ or less. Real GDP declined $5\%$ (at an annual rate) in the first quarter and declined $31.5\%$ (at an annual rate) in the second quarter. [As noted in module 1, the NBER officially identified February 2020 as the business cycle peak month and April 2020 as the trough month.]

Modeling the effects of the pandemic: The aggregate impact of corona-virus is complicated. We will model the pandemic as involving both a negative (direct) demand side and supply-side shock simultaneously along with partially-offsetting fiscal and [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] responses. An open question is the degree to which the various shocks are permanent. And remember, we want our model to explain why employment and output plunged through mid-2020.

Applying the standard Blanchard model masks several important issues, understood by highlighting what the model does not explicitly include. First, there is no “state-of-health variable" although we can work around this in a straightforward way. Second, the model has only one sector rather than two; two sectors could better capture the partial lockdown distinction between "essential businesses" and "non-essential businesses" in the United States. The latter sector was largely shut down for several months in 2020 and then partially re-opened off and on through mid-2021 when it was completely re-opened Early during the pandemic when largely shut down, it would appear that any boost to demand for the products of this sector would not lead to an increase in output. You cannot get a haircut with every barbershop closed; you cannot take a vacation if hotels are closed and airplanes grounded; you cannot go to sporting events if stadiums are shut down; you cannot go to the mall to buy clothes, shoes, electronics, and books if the mall is shut down. In other words, output of this sector cannot exceed its (now much lower) level of potentialwhich contrasts sharply with the aggregate supply relation developed above in which aggregate output could indeed exceed potential with inflation resulting. [Recall the technical note on page 14 above which delves into this idea.] Put another more technical way, the supply elasticity in the shut-down sector is zero. (Thanks to Olivier Blanchard who got me thinking about the problem in this way.)

When combined with the “essential business" sector, however, the combined supply elasticityeven for nominally shut-down productsis positive. For example, restaurants. are non-essential but one could still do take-out. Clothing, shoe, and electronics store sales at the closed mall were zero but one could buy these items at essential businesses such as Costco, Walmart, or Amazon because these stores sell both essential and nonessential items. So the supply of these non-essential goods aggregated over the two sectors likely was a lot less as a result of the shut-downs but the aggregate supply elasticity was not zero. Indeed, actual output could exceed the new, lower level of potential output as a result of the re-distribution of supply from businesses in the shutdown sector to the open sector. [Some of the increased supply of non-essential goods at Costco, etc. likely came out of existing inventories (i.e. out of past production) but some certainly resulted from new production.] Moreover, the supply of essential goods including food and other staples was responsive to the surge in demand (customers baskets were over-flowing with goods like never before at Costco). Also, demand boomed early during the pandemic for medical equipment, protective masks, and handsanitizer which called forth supply responses as certain businesses quickly re-purposed to produce such items, by re-tooling, running factories closer to capacity, adding additional shifts, etc.

An important question is the quantitative importance of the respective sectors. Is the shut-down sector the dominant story or is the open sector? If the former is a better approximation to the aggregate economy, then increased or excess demand will result in no extra output (greater than the potential level), and rationing (like toilet paper) or inflation will resultand we should not use the Blanchard model. If the latter (i.e., open sector) is a better approximation, then our standard model can be used. Put another way, we want to know empirically whether the supply response at essential businesses outweighs the zero elasticity response of the non-essential sector in an empirically meaningful way, or vice versa.

To shed light on this issue, consider that the unemployment rate rose into doubledigit territory (about $15\%$) in the second quarter of 2020. In addition, U.S. real GDP declined $31.5\%$ at an annual rate in the second quarter (following a $5\%$ decline in the first quarter). Such frightening outcomes have not been seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. There was much suffering. However, for our modeling purposes, it is important to recognize that the $31.5\%$ decline in GDP growth at an arnual rate translates into roughly a $9\%$ decline in GDP, not at an anmual rate (it's as if GDP declines from S100 to S91 from one quarter to the next). So roughly $90\%$ of the economy effectively remained open. Yes, there was a huge decline but it was not even close to a $100\%$ shutdown; in fact, most of the economy remained open for business. A lot of work appears to have switched online; one indicator is that Zoom saw an increase in meeting participants from 10 million in December 2019 to 200+ million in late March 2020 to

Given actual developments in the first half of 2020, it thus seems reasonable to use the macro model developed in previous sections with the appropriate qualifications. So let's turn to using the model.

The corona-virus pandemic led to government orders for certain businesses to shut down, orders for workers to stay home (some who work remotely and others who were in unemployed/lockdown status at home), and supply-chain disruptions to firms. The latter includes limits to shipping containers and truck drivers (necessary components to the transport of raw materials, parts, etc. to domestic firms), shortages of lumber (used in home improvements), shortages of semiconductor chips (used by the domestic auto industry), etc. Given these pandemic facts, there are a couple of ways to proceed on the supply side using our macroeconomic model. The way I am going to pursue is to argue that some of the capital stock becomes temporarily unusable; this is because many factories, airplanes, stores, restaurants, etc were at least partially shut down voluntarily by fear of contagion and directly by legal order and indirectly by the COVID driven disruption to the supply chain. It would be even better if we could model the situation as an exogenous reduction in part of the capital stock and in part of labor input (accounting for those workers who have been sent home unemployed) but it doesnt appear possible in the Blanchard textbook model. Now on to our analysis:

Recall our original production function on page 9: $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{N},\mathbf{K})$, with $\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{1}$.Let $\mathrm{F(N,K)=NK}_{0}$ where $\mathbf{K}_{0}$ is the level of the capital stock normally assumed constant and suppressed in our prior analysis. That is, $Y=\mathbf{N}\mathbf{K}_{0}$ and thus the marginal product of labor, ${\mathrm{dY/dN}}={\mathbf{K}}_{0}$ Now assume that corona-virus leads to an essentially exogenous reduction in $\mathbf{K}_{0}$ as a result of partial or complete closures of factories, restaurants, etc. In addition, there is an essentially exogenous reduction in labor productivity as $K_{0}$ declines. The short-run AS curve shifts up (with rising unit labor costs) and becomes steeper, putting upward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on output. (The equation for AS curve becomes: $\mathbf{\pi}_{1}=\alpha\mathbf{Y}/\mathbf{K}_{0}\mathbf{L}+\mathbf{\pi}_{1}^{\varepsilon}+\mathbf{m}+[\mathbf{z}\mathbf{K}_{0}+(1-\alpha)/\mathbf{K}_{0}$ - 1] where $\alpha<1$ in the U.S.)

In reality, employment declines a lot with the corona-virus. In our model the theoretical impact on employment is ambiguous since $\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{NK}_{0}.$ The unambiguous deline in Y implies a decline in $NK_{0}$ For employment, $\mathbf{N}=\mathbf{Y}/\mathbf{K}_{0}$ to decline the percentage decline in Y must exceed the percentage decline in $K_{0}.$ I will assume this to be the case in order to match the empirical reduction in N. As a result, the unemployment rate rises as N declines ($u=1$ - N/L). And the long run AS curve (potential GDP) also shifts left as $K_{0}$ declines. ($Y^{*}$ now is equal to 1- (m+ z) / $\alpha[K_0$L)

At the same time there is a negative demand shock. First, consumer confidence declines indeed, the University of Michigan consumer confidence index declined about $30\%$ in total in March and April of 2020, the largest decline in the history of the index. I assume that much of this decline resulted from increased fear and uncertainty among consumers factors that must be considered exogenous from the perspective of our model and hence are captured here as a reduction in $\mathbf{C}_{0}$. Other components of the negative demand shock are an assumed reduction in business optimism (a decline in $I_0)$ and people being ordered or volunteering to stay at home except to buy "necessities" (reduction in $\mathbf{C}_{0}.$

The negative demand-side shock offsets the inflation pressure, but reinforces the downward output pressure, stemming from the negative supply shock. Graphically, the AD (and IS) curve shifts leff; the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus (including sizable checks to most people) enacted during the crisis tends to shift the AD and IS curves right, but assume on balance the AD and IS curves shift left even after including the effects of policy. Unambiguously our model predicts a decline in output.

The qualitative impact of the demand and supply side shocks on prices is ambiguous unless we know the relative sizes of the shocks. Actual data for both the total and core CPI revealed that there was a significant drop in consumer price inflation (to negative levels) in March, April, and May 2020. This suggests that the demand shock was a bit larger than the supply shock, at least during the early stages of the pandemic From our model of inflation (see page 12), the decline in prices implies that output declines more than potential, i.e., the output gap, Y - Y* declines

Moreover, our model also would predict a decline in wage growth; this follows from our price setting equation (see page 10): $\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{AK}_{\eta}/(1+\mathbf{m})$.The initial decline in the capital stock should lead to a smaller real wage and hence smaller wage growth given the slowdown in price inflation. In fact, labor compensation growth slowed during the recession months of 2020 (and has increased since). Full disclosure: although nominal wage growth declined, the real wage actually rose in the second quarter of 2020; if our model is correct then the price markup factor, m, must have fallen temporarily.

From the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] rule (with both r, and r not equal to zero) the decline in both inflation and the output gap implies a reduction in the real interest rate. Indeed, the Fed lowered the federal funds rate from about $1.5\%$ to zero in mid-March, 2020-largely in response to the declines in output and employment-and has kept it near zero through early 2022. Recall however that it is primarily long-term interest ratessuch as corporate bond rates, auto loan rates, and mortgage interest ratesthat have an impact on the interest-rate-sensitive components of aggregate demand. Each of those rates can be thought of as the sum of a corresponding Treasury security rate and a premium that serves as compensation for default risk (discussed in depth in Econ 111). The Fed action was accompanied by a marked reduction of at least 1 percentage point in Treasury interest rates across the maturity spectrum. In addition there was a sizable reduction (nearly 1 percentage point) in corporate bond and mortgage interest rates; these reductions lasted through the end of 2020. Any financial market elevation of default risk premiums owing to the pronounced slowdown in economic activity was outweighed by the general decline in Treasury rates.

Quick summary of short run analysis: I take the short run to be the few months starting in March 2020 during which there was a huge negative demand-side shock, only partially offset in the short run by a huge fiscal and [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] response, as well as a huge negative supply-side shock. Output and employment declined a lot. Consumer prices also fell (the rate of price inflation was negative). The growth of labor compensation also declined. I think our modified Blanchard model, with a left shift in the AD curve larger than the left shift in the AS curve, provides a reasonable theoretical explanation

Given the decline in price inflation early during the pandemic, our model would predict a decline in inflation expectations; indeed, based on several surveys as well as on financial market measures, inflation expectations declined during the recession months of 2020. The decline in inflation expectations until now in our model would lead to a rightward shift in the short run AS curve over time, implying an ongoing reduction in price inflation until long-run equilibrium is reached; however, price inflation actually has increased on balance since the recession ended in April 2020. So something is wrong with our usual way of modeling the effects of various shocks when applied to the pandemic.

Our usual model dynamic adjustment implicitly assumes no change or unwinding in the precipitating demand-side or supply-side shocks (although we did mention that certain shocks could be viewed as temporary when addressing the "loose end" above but there were other ways to address it as well). In modeling the pandemic, this implicit assumption is not appropriate. Indeed, there has been an unwinding of both shocks. Moreover, the demand-side shock evidently has dissipated much more rapidly than the supply-side shock (i.e., the AD curve has shifted rightward more and faster than the AS curve). We can infer this by observing increases in output, price inflation (actual and expected), and wage inflation on balance since the end of the brief 2020 recession. The real wage, W/P, which equals $\mathrm{AK}_{0}/ (1+$m) in our model, has declined a bit since its peak in 2020:Q2. This can be explained by some dissipation of the supply-side shock (i.e. by an increase in $K_0)$ more than offset by an increase in price markups (i.e. by an increase in m).] What underlying factors help explain these observations? First, the COVID vaccine became available in early 2021; as more people have become vaccinated reluctance to go out and spend has declined. Second, households saved an unprecedented fraction of their income (including government transfer aid) for roughly a year starting in March 2020, providing the support for spending; the stimulative fiscal policy packages were an important underlying factor. Third, most businesses have re-opened as a result of safer conditions. Of course, as well documented, supply-chain disruptions continue through early 2022 which suggest the initial supply-side shock (lower capital stock) is taking a long time to unwind; once it does, there will be substantial downward pressure on price inflation (as the AS curve shifts right).

How long will it take for the economy to return to long run equilibrium, i.e., how long will it take for the pandemic to be over and for the AS and AD curves evennually to return to their initial positions (ignoring policy)?

As of December 2021, almost 2 years since the beginning of the pandemic shutdowns, employment remains roughly 3.5 million less than pre-pandemic. During the large recession in the early 1980s, it took 2 years for employment to fully recover. But it could take a lot longer, for example it took around 6 years for employment to fully recover in the aftermath of the Great Recession a decade ago.

Overall, in the current situation, the time it takes for a return to long run equilibrium depends on a host of supply-side and demand-side factors. These include whether there will be future serious waves of the disease and the degree to which they are controllable by vaccine/treatment; the time required to repair damaged supply-chains; the time for primarily women to adequately deal with child-care and return to the workforce worker decisions to change career paths; etc. Moreover, the separate AS and AD returnto-normalcy likely will continue to take different amounts of time.

And in fact "normalcy" itself may look a lot different if a sizable fraction of the workforce switches careers and if certain industries are adversely impacted for a long time; maybe some of the decline in $K_{n}$ will be permanent. Further, there are many related questions about what the “new normal" may entail; for example, will it involve more online education/training, more work-from-home, less traffic congestion, less pollution?

Finally, monetary stimulus would have to reverse once the pandemic winds down and the economy has transitioned substantially back to “normal" or else aggregate demand will remain excessive with significant upward pressure on price inflation in 2021 and beyond. The Fed has argued that the elevated inflation readings during the much of 2021 were temporary and would largely go away once supply-chain disruptions ceased However, widespread concern that some of the elevated inflation is not temporary has led the Fed to begin "tapering" its quantitative easing purchases of securities in late 2021 and even consider “quantitative tightening" in which it would reduce the size of its balance sheet. The Fed also has announced that it is likely to raise the federal funds rate three times in 2022, although it would remain low by historical standards after these rate hikes unless the Fed re-evaluates and increases rates by larger amounts. A related factor putting upward pressure on inflation is the fact that many households significantly increased saving in 2020 and 2021 (given that disposable income was boosted through fiscal policy and that many consumption opportunities were shut down), with the cumulative "excess" saving (of about \$2.5 trillion or $10\%$ of GDP by some estimates) being converted to consumption in 2021 and 2022

### Does thisKeynesian style model explain business cycle facts?

First, we note that Keynesians attribute recessions to “not enough demand” for goods, in contrast to classical economists who attribute recessions to “not enough supply. Keynesians view recessions as being caused by negative shocks to consumption and investment demand as well as by negative policy shocks such as lower governmenf expenditures or a Fed policy tightening. The Keynesian model can account for several business cycle facts, but not all.

5. The model does not explain the mildly procyclical nature of the real wage in a world whose short-run fluctuations are dominated by demand-side shocks Indeed, the real wage is constant in the face of demand shocks in the model [recall that $\mathbf{W}/\mathbf{P}=1/(1+\mathbf{m})]$; it depends on the markup, which itself is unresponsive to [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] fluctuations in Blanchard’s model of price setting 6. Similarly the model does not explain the procyclical behavior of labor productivity

Recall in Blanchard's simplified model, $Y=\mathbb{N}$, and hence labor productivity, or Y/N, is constant. In a slightly more complicated model that allows for diminishing marginal productivity of labor, an increase in employment during demand-lead [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] expansions, e.g., should reduce average labor productivity because of diminishing marginal productivity. Thus, an expanded Keynesian model predicts that average labor productivity is countercyclical, contrary to the business cycle “fact." To address this issue, Keynesians have modified their models to include labor hoarding. During recessions, firms are seen as utilizing their workforce less intensively (rather than engaging in layoffs, which are costly); hence measured labor productivity declines (hours worked remain the same,but marketable output declines). Of course, as mentioned in class, the experience of the recessions of 2007-2009 and 2020 raises serious questions about whether labor productivity is, in fact, procyclical.

Here is a simple framework that allows for labor hoarding. Consider the modified Cobb-Douglas production function: $\mathbf{Y} = \left (\mathbf{\mu } _{k}\:\mathbf{K} \right) ^{a}\left (\mathbf{\mu } _{n}\:\mathbf{N} \right) ^{\mathrm{l- \alpha }}$ where the $\mu$ 's denote the utilization rates of capital and labor, respectively, and $0\leq a\leq1$.The utilization rates measure how intensively the capital and labor inputs are used; for example, a waitress at a restaurant is used very intensively during the normal lunch and dinner hours but far less intensively at other times. In the case of labor for example, the product of the utilization rate and the amount of labor (think of the latter as the number of hours worked) defines “labor services." Thus output depends on capital services and labor services. Also note that we can write the average product of labor, Y/N, as $\left(\mathbf{\mu}_{\mathrm{k}}\:\mathbf{K}\right)^{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{\mu}_{0}\right)^{1-\alpha}/\mathbf{N}^{\alpha}$

Thus as employment $(\mathbb{N})$ declines during recessions, the average product of labor should rise according to the production function with diminishing average (and marginal) productivity of labor. However, there is ample evidence that the utilization rate of labor $(\mu_{\mathrm{n}})$ declines during recessions as those workers retained by firms are given some tasks-such as maintenancethat do not boost output as normally measured. Thus measured output per hour worked declines during recessions (if the utilization rate declines enough). This phenomenon is called labor hoarding and occurs because it is cheaper for firms to retain workers than to incur firing and re-hiring costs. Thus the procyclicality of the utilization rate of labor can lead to the procyclicality of measured labor productivity

## What if, contrary to the Keynesian perspective, economic fluctuations are primarily a result of supply-side shocks?

Real Business Cyele (RBC) Modelwould not adhere to Blanchard’s characterization of wage and price determination but his model, nonetheless, delivers the same basic message about the impact of supply-side shocks. RBC proponents generally assert that economic fluctuations are mostly caused by productivity shocks (i.e., exogenous changes in output per hour worked). Productivity shocks include the development of new products or production methods, new management techniques, changes in the availability of raw materials or energy, unusually good or bad weather (the latter constituting a negative productivity shock), new government regulations that affect production (possibly another negative shock), a health pandemic (another negative shock) and so on. In the RBC model, wages and prices are determined on spot markets and are fully flexible (differing in flavor from Blanchard’s characterization of wage and price formation). This implies that the economy is viewed as always being in full equilibrium with output equal to its natural level. Recessions are not seen as temporary departures of output below its natural level but rather as equal declines in the levels of actual output and of natural output.

1. In response to occasional aggregate supply shocks, the Blanchard model (and of course the RBC model) predicts recurrent fluctuations in output. 2. The model explains the procyclical behavior of labor productivity. Simply, this is because, in the RBC view, fluctuations in aggregate activity are caused by productivity shocks. (Of course, recent [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] experiences, such as the recessions of 2007-2009 and 2020 are changing views about whether productivity is, in fact, procyclical.) 3. Theory implies that employment may or may not fluctuate in the same direction as output in the face of productivity shocks. Recall Blanchard’s model, $Y=AN$ orN $=\mathbf{Y}/\mathbf{A}$, where A does not equal one (and we let $\mathbf{K}_{0}=\mathbf{I}$). An exogenous increase in A will reduce N if Y does not rise enough but will increase N if Y rises by a lot; thus the impact of a change of A on N is ambiguous in theory (and empirically as well) although a positive relationship certainly is possible. 4. Because shocks to spending on consumption and investment durable goods are themselves not a source of cycles in the RBC view, the [[Week 3 Cyclical Industries (and Advanced Forecasting)|cyclical]] behavior of durable goods spending—namely that it is strongly procyclical and volatile cannot be readily explained by the model. 5. Because a negative shock to productivity, for example, leads to stagflation, the RBC view is not consistent with the business cycle fact that inflation tends to slow during or just after recessions. 6. The model does explain the procyclical nature of the real wage. Even in Blanchard’s model the real wage declines in the face of a negative productivity shock.

Conclusions: Both the Keynesian and RBC models can explain several business cycle facts and not explain others. It would help if both sides accepted that fluctuations are caused both by demand-side and supply-side shocks and this is the direction of recenf professional research. More encompassing models have been developed that allow for demand and supply shocks as well as wage, price, and financial frictions; these are called DSGE or dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium models.

Recessions and expansions raise two basic questions. (1) What are the underlying causes of business cycles? We have offered possible answers above. (2) What, if anything, should policymakers do about business cycles? We begin to answer the second question now.

In short, the RBC view is that wages and prices adjust rapidly to restore quickly full equilibrium after a shock. As a result, the market economy largely is “self-correcting” and not in need of policy intervention; indeed, policy action may do more harm than good. In the Keynesian view, temporary deviations of output from its natural level are a common outcome following shocks, and these deviations are not eliminated by market forces very quickly. Moreover, except for occasional large oil price shocks, most output fluctuations are caused by demand-side shocks that, in principle, can and should be offset by appropriate monetary or fiscal policies.

For example, consider a negative shock to aggregate demand, perhaps owing to a decline in consumer confidence or increased business pessimism. The IS curve, and hence the AD curve, shifts to the left and output falls below its natural level. If there is no policy response, the economy remains in recession in the short run but eventually will adjust as inflation expectations adjust downward gradually following a decline in actual inflation the decline in $\pi^c$ shifts the AS curve down (because wages are reset at a lower level which leads firms to reduce prices). The resulting decline in inflation leads the Fed to lower real interest rates and hence boost aggregate demand and output evenrually back to their full employment levels.

Alternatively, an increase in government purchases (G) equal in magnitude to the negative demand shock would shift the IS curve upward; if the increase in G were perfectly timedwhich is possible in our modelthere would be no net effect on aggregate demand and the economy would be perfectly insulated from what would otherwise be a negative fluctuation in output. This analysis raises the issue of whether both perfect timing and size of a policy intervention are possible in practice. We return to this issue in the next module.

In the case of an adverse supply shock (which does not happen often in the Keynesian view), the appropriate response of fiscal or [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is complicated. This is because the supply shock leads to stagflation while fiscal and monetary policies generally can have an impact only on aggregate demand. There is a tradeoff; policies can offset the decline in output or the increase in prices but not both. In the long run, however, output must decline to its new lower natural level; so any attempt to offset the short-run decline in actual output would lead to higher prices and would, in any case, eventually give way to a decline in output to its natural level.

## Appendix 1: Derivation of the IS Curve (optional)

Here are the equations representing goods market equilibrium (from page 5):
**Derivation of the IS Curve:**

Starting with the key equations:

1. $Y = C + I + G + X - M$
2. $C = C_0 + c_y(Y - T) + c_{y_e}(Y - T)^c - c_r r$
3. $I = I_0 + i_y Y + i_{y_e} Y^e - i_r r$
4. $NX = N_0 - n_y Y - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_x$
5. $e_x = e_0 + e_r(r - r_f)$

First, substitute equation 5 into equation 4 (eliminating "ex") and then substitute the resulting modified equation 4 along with equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

$$
Y = \left[C_0 + c_y(Y - T) + c_{y_e}(Y - T)^c - c_r r\right] + \left[I_0 + i_y Y + i_{y_e} Y^e - i_r r\right] + G + \left[N_0 - n_y Y - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e(e_0 + e_r(r - r_f))\right]
$$

Now combine all terms in $r$ on the right-hand side and place everything else on the left:

$$
Y(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) - \left[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c - I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e - G - N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e + n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r\right] = -c_r r - i_r r - n_e e_r r
$$

Now multiply both sides by $D = \left[1/(-c_r - i_r - n_e e_r)\right]$, which is a negative number:

$$
r = DY(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) + D\left\{-[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c] - [I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e] - G - [N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r]\right\}
$$

**This equation defines the IS curve.** The messy slope coefficient, i.e., the coefficient of $Y$, is given by:

$$
D(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) = \frac{(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y)}{(-c_r - i_r - n_e e_r)} < 0 \quad (\text{Technically, this requires that } 1 - c_y - i_y + n_y > 0, \text{ which we assume}.)
$$

In other words, the IS curve is a downward-sloping straight line in the $(Y, r)$ plane.

**The messy intercept term of the IS curve is given by:**

$$
D\left\{-[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c] - [I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e] - G - [N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r]\right\}
$$

### Appendix 2: Derivation of the AD Curve (Optional)

**From Appendix 1, the equation for the IS curve is given by:**

$$
r = DY(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) + D\left\{-[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c] - [I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e] - G - [N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r]\right\}
$$

where $D = \left[1 / (-c_r - i_r - n_e e_r)\right]$.

**The equation for the MP line with $r_y = 0$ is given by:**

$$
r = r^* + r_n(\pi - \pi^*)
$$

Substitute the right-hand side of this expression for $r$ in the IS equation, then solve the resulting expression for $\pi$ and we get:

$$
\pi = -\frac{1}{r_n}r^* + \pi^* + \frac{1}{r_n}DY(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) + \frac{1}{r_n}D\left\{-[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c] - [I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e] - G - [N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r]\right\}
$$

This equation mathematically defines the **AD curve**, i.e., the relationship between $\pi$ and $Y$ when simultaneously the goods market is in equilibrium and when the Fed is following the [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] rule, given the exogenous variables $G$, $C_0$, $r^*$, $\pi^*$, etc.

**The AD curve is a negatively sloped straight line in the $(Y, \pi)$ plane.** The slope of the AD curve is given by:

$$
\text{slope} = \frac{1}{r_n}D(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) < 0 \quad (\text{recall that } D \text{ is negative})
$$

**The AD curve shifts whenever any of the exogenous variables (that make up the intercept term) change.** For example, the curve shifts up if $G$ rises (for any given value of $Y$):

$$
\frac{d\pi}{dG} = -\frac{1}{r_n}D > 0
$$

### Appendix 3: Putting together AD and AS (Optional)

**In long-run equilibrium,** $\pi_t = \pi_t^e$. Thus, from the inflation determination (i.e., AS) relationship, $Y = Y^*$. Only exogenous changes in $Y^*$, such as a change in oil prices, affect output in long-run equilibrium. Shocks on the demand side have no impact.

**By contrast, in the short run** with inflation expectations fixed, output is affected by both demand-side and supply-side exogenous factors. To see this, summarize the AD and AS curves as follows:

**AD:**

$$
\pi = I_D + m_D Y
$$

where $I_D$ denotes the intercept and $m_D$ the slope of the AD curve. Recall that $Y = mX + b$ is the equation of a straight line in the $(X,Y)$ plane.

**From Appendix 2:**

$$
I_D = -\frac{1}{r_n}r^* + \pi^* + \frac{1}{r_n}D\left\{-[C_0 - c_y(T) - c_{y_e}(T)^c] - [I_0 + i_{y_e} Y^e] - G - [N_0 - n_{y_e} Y^e - n_e e_0 + n_e e_r r]\right\}
$$

And,

$$
m_D = \frac{1}{r_n}D(1 - c_y - i_y + n_y) < 0
$$

**AS:**

$$
\pi = I_s + m_s Y
$$

where $I_s$ denotes the intercept and $m_s$ the slope of the AS curve.

$$
I_s = \pi_t^e + a' - \frac{\alpha}{AL}Y^* \quad \text{where } Y^* = \frac{[1 - (m+z)/\alpha]}{AL}; \quad m_s = \frac{\alpha}{AL} > 0
$$

Substitute the expression for $\pi$ from the AS curve into the equation for the AD curve:

$$
I_s + m_s Y = I_D + m_D Y
$$

Now solve for $Y$:

$$
*** \quad Y = \frac{(I_D - I_s)}{(m_s - m_D)} \quad ***
$$

This is the short-run equilibrium value for output.

(Notice that the denominator—the difference in slopes of the two curves—is positive.)

**(2) Derivative of Output with respect to Natural Output:**

$$
\frac{dY}{dY^*} = \frac{1}{[1 / (m_s - m_D)]} \times \left( -\frac{dI_s}{dY^*} \right) = \frac{1}{(m_s - m_D)} \times \left(\frac{\alpha}{AL}\right) > 0
$$

Thus, an increase in the natural level of output boosts the actual level of output in the short run.

We can also show that natural output rises more than actual output in the short run. Substituting the expression for $m_s = \left(\frac{\alpha}{AL}\right)$ into the derivative and dividing numerator and denominator by this term, we get:

$$
\frac{dY}{dY^*} = \frac{1}{1 - \left(\frac{m_D}{\alpha / AL}\right)}
$$

The denominator of this expression exceeds 1 since $m_D$ is negative. Thus, the entire derivative is less than 1, i.e., actual output rises less than natural output.

**In geometric terms:**

What happens to the value of the derivative as $m_D$ goes to 0? It approaches minus infinity.
