The PBoC is one of the largest central banks in the world,  with over $3 trillion in [foreign exchange reserves](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange-reserves.asp). The Huabei Bank,  the Beihai Bank,  and the Xibei Farmer Bank were consolidated to form the PBoC after the Chinese Communist Party's victory and the creation of the People's Republic of China0.\1

In September 1983,  the State Council decided that the PBoC should become the central bank. The bank's first headquarters were in Shijiazhuang,     Hebei,     and were later moved to Beijing in 1949. Between 1950 and 1978,  the PBoC was the only bank in the nation and oversaw both central banking and commercial banking operations. All other banks within mainland China,  such as the Bank of China,     were either divisions of the PBoC or did not accept deposits0.\1

One of the major points from his presentation was the PBOC lowered the required reserve ratio twice in 2022,  injecting over one trillion RMB into the real economy. The central bank also provided liquidity through various channels,  creating a favorable environment for macroeconomic stability. Key indicators like the broad money supply (M2) and RMB loans demonstrated stable and accelerated growth0.\1

It prioritized lending to the manufacturing industry,  technology-based SMEs,  innovative companies,  and micro and small businesses. This support helped stabilize the national economy,  with notable growth in these areas0.\1

Last,  despite interest rate hikes in major European and American economies,  the PBOC continued its reform of the loan prime rate,  lowering it in 2022. This contributed to a decrease in the overall financing cost for the real economy. The weighted average interest rate on newly issued corporate loans dropped,  and a market-oriented mechanism for deposit rates was established to stabilize bank liability costs0.\1
