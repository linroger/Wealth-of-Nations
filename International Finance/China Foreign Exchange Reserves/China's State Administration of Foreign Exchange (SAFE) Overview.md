## Understanding China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange

China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange was created in 1979 in the nation's capital,  Beijing,  where it is headquartered0.\1﻿ The agency operated independently until 1998,  when the Chinese government brought it under the control of the [[[People's Bank of China (PBoC)|People's Bank of China]]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/peoples-bank-china-pboc.asp) (PBOC). The government's move was to boost the image and influence of the PBOC as a central bank0.\1﻿

SAFE has a series of administrative offices or [branches](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/branch-office.asp),  central sub-branches,  and sub-branches set up in different provinces and cities across China,  which report directly to the federal government. There are a total of 36 branches,  309 central sub-branches,  and 517 sub-branches in the agency's network0.\1﻿

The agency is administered at the state level and is made up of seven departments,  which oversee its primary functions0.\1﻿ These main responsibilities include:

- Drafting policies and [regulations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulation-i.asp) related to foreign reserves and foreign exchanges
- Supervising and inspecting [forex](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forex.asp) transactions
- Managing China's forex,    gold reserves,  and foreign currency [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp)6﻿﻿7

SAFE is also involved in the study and implementation of policy measures for the advancement of the convertibility of the country's official national currency,  the [renminbi](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/c/cny-china-yuan-renminbi.asp) (CNY/RMB)0.\1﻿ The significance of an adjustment in the currency's value to the global economy,  along with China's huge forex reserves,  makes the agency an increasingly important player in international forex and [financial markets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-market.asp).

The terms renminbi and yuan are often used interchangeably to describe China's currency—where renminbi refers to the actual name of the currency and yuan is the unit of account for the country's financial system.

## Special Considerations

SAFE has a number of major functions. In addition to managing and administering the forex market,  and drafting laws and regulations,  it also oversees [statistics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/statistics.asp),  monitors the balance of payments and the external [credit and debt](https://www.investopedia.com/credit-and-debt-4689724),  and releases relevant information according to regulations.

The agency is also responsible for:

- Developing the country's forex market
- Conducting studies about and making suggestions on policy for forex reform
- Enforcing laws to ensure market participants don't violate regulations
- Developing and planning standards and requirements for automated forex administration
- Partaking in global financial activities
