# War Economies: An Overview

## 1. Introduction to War Economies
- War economies differ significantly from regular economies.
  - Production,  consumption,  and accounting for goods,  services,  and financial assets undergo fundamental changes.
  - Economic indicators such as GDP,  unemployment rates,  and [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] are affected differently compared to peacetime.

## 2. Characteristics of War Economies
- **Increased GDP from Armament Production**
  - Armament production boosts GDP,  but these goods are often destroyed in war.
  - This increase does not reflect typical economic growth as seen in peacetime.
- **Reduced Unemployment Rates**
  - Military service increases employment,  reducing unemployment rates.
  - This shift is due to the top-down allocation of resources towards war efforts.
- **Shifts in Production and Profitability**
  - Resource allocation is directed by government priorities rather than market forces.
  - Industries related to war efforts see increased profitability,  while others may suffer.
- **Nature of Borrowing,  Lending,  and Capital Flows**
  - Financial activities are heavily influenced by government policies and war needs.
  - Traditional market dynamics are altered,  requiring a different analytical approach.

## 3. Importance of Understanding War Economies
- War economies are crucial for understanding historical debt crises.
- They play a significant role in geopolitical and economic cycles.
- Understanding these dynamics is essential if another war period arises.

## 4. Economic and Geopolitical Cycles
- Economic conflicts often lead to military conflicts,  both within and between nations.
  - Emerging powers challenge established powers,  leading to geopolitical tensions.
- Historians have documented these cycles,  though often from a geopolitical perspective.
  - Economic and market perspectives provide additional insights into these cycles.

## 5. Dynamics of Economic Conflicts
- **Within Countries**
  - Economic conflicts arise between rich/capitalist/political right and poor/proletariat/political left.
  - These conflicts can lead to populist,  autocratic,  nationalistic,  and militaristic leaders gaining power.
- **Between Countries**
  - Conflicts arise among comparably strong economic and military powers.
  - Economics and politics become intertwined,  increasing the likelihood of disruptive conflicts like wars.

## 6. Consequences of War Economies
- War economies have profound effects on currencies,  debts,  equities,  and economies.
- They also impact the social-political fabric of societies.
- Post-war periods often see dominant powers setting global rules until new rival powers emerge.

## 7. Long-Term Economic/Geopolitical Cycles
- Understanding these cycles requires a long-term perspective,  often spanning 250 years.
- These cycles drive the rise and fall of empires and their reserve currencies.

## 8. Types of Relationships in Economic Rivalries
- **Cooperative-Competitive Relationships**
  - Parties consider each other's needs and negotiate for mutual benefit.
  - Resembles friendly negotiations or competitions.
- **Mutually Threatening Relationships**
  - Parties focus on harming each other to gain advantage.
  - Involves exchanges of painful acts to force concessions.

## 9. Conclusion
- War economies and their dynamics are complex and require a nuanced understanding.
- Recognizing the interplay between economics,  politics,  and military conflicts is crucial for comprehending historical and potential future economic crises.

# Economic Dynamics of War and Post-War Periods

## 1. Interaction Dynamics in Conflict Situations
- **Lose-Lose Relationships**
  - Interaction through "war" rather than "negotiation."
	- Either side can force the threatening war path onto the other.
	- Both sides must agree to pursue the cooperative,  win-win path.
  - Both sides tend to follow the same approach.
	- Relative powers of the parties are crucial in decision-making.
- **Considerations in Conflict Paths**
  - **First Path: Negotiation**
	- Parties should recognize potential threats and appreciate the exchange quality.
	- Avoid being overly aggressive to maintain cooperation.
  - **Second Path: War**
	- Power is defined by the ability to endure and inflict pain.
	- Clarity on power dynamics emerges through conflict.
	- Post-war periods often see dominant countries setting global rules.

## 2. Economic Policy During War
- **Priorities in War Periods**
  - Maintain access to financial and non-financial resources.
	- Essential for sustaining a strong war effort.
  - Funding a war requires borrowing or large foreign exchange reserves.
	- No country can fund a war and maintain non-war spending from current income.
- **Access to Borrowing**
  - Depends on creditworthiness and capital market development.
  - Sound local currency debt markets are crucial.
- **Access to Non-Financial Resources**
  - Critical for sustaining war efforts and domestic economic conditions.

## 3. Post-War Economic Consequences
- **Debt and War Outcomes**
  - Enormous market consequences based on debts and war outcomes.
  - Losing a war with high debt is devastating.
	- Example: Germany post-World War I and World War II.
- **Economic Shifts During War**
  - Economies shift to war production.
	- Increase in government spending relative to private spending.
	- Rise in military spending and workforce allocation to armed services.
  - Example: During World War II,  20% of the US workforce shifted to the military.

## 4. Transition from War to Peace
- **Post-War Economic Transition**
  - Countries face debt and need to transition to normal economies.
  - Military spending contraction leads to postwar recession.
	- Factories retool and workforce reallocation is necessary.
- **Deleveraging Periods**
  - Countries work through war debts.
  - Similar dynamics to other depressions and deleveragings.

## 5. Visual Representation of Economic Shifts
- **Charts and Data**
  - Illustrate shifts in government and military spending.

- Recognizing the interplay between conflict paths,  economic policies,  and post-war transitions provides insights into historical and potential future economic crises.

# Economic Consequences of War: Winners vs. Losers

## 1. Economic Conditions for War Losers
- **Post-War Economic Depression**
  - Losers of wars experience significantly worse economic conditions compared to winners.
  - The economic depression is deeper and more prolonged.
- **Monetary Policy and Inflation**
  - War losers often resort to excessive money printing.
	- This leads to a depletion of savings and reserves.
	- Inflation rates rise significantly,  sometimes reaching hyperinflation levels.
- **Data and Statistics**
  - Reliable statistics for war losers post-World War II are often unavailable.
	- The economic devastation rendered data collection unreliable or impossible.

## 2. Case Studies and Historical Context
- **Weimar Germany and US Great Depression**
  - Weimar Germany provides a case study of a post-war loser.
	- Illustrates the severe economic consequences and hyperinflation.
  - The US Great Depression shows how economic conflicts can escalate into wars.
- **Post-World War II Winners: US and UK**
  - Charts for the US and UK post-World War II illustrate the economic conditions of war winners.
  - These countries experienced more stable economic recoveries.

## 3. Summary of Debt Crisis Management
- **Managing Debt Crises**
  - Effective management involves spreading out the pain of bad debts.
  - Success is more likely if debts are denominated in the nation’s own currency.
- **Risks and Policy Maker Challenges**
  - The biggest risks arise from policy makers' failure to act due to lack of knowledge or authority.
  - Nations with foreign currency debts face more difficult choices and painful consequences.
- **Policy Maker Authority and Decision-Making**
  - Authority varies across countries,  affecting crisis outcomes.
  - Strong regulatory systems can hinder necessary policy moves due to rigid rules.
  - Crisis management requires quick responses to unforeseen circumstances.

## 4. Political and Economic Implications
- **Checks and Balances**
  - While protective,  these systems can slow decision-making during crises.
  - They can allow narrow interests to block necessary actions.
- **Political Climate During Crises**
  - Policy makers face criticism from all sides.
  - Politics becomes contentious,  with misinformation prevalent.
- **Long-Term Economic Perspective**
  - Despite short-to-medium-term devastation,  productivity growth is more impactful in the long run.
  - Political consequences,  such as increased populism,  can be more significant than the crises themselves.

## 5. Visual Representation of Economic Trends
- **Real GDP Per Capita Charts**
  - Illustrate the impact of debt crises and recessions.
  - Highlight that long-term growth rates are more important than short-term fluctuations.
  - Major economic disruptions often result from wars rather than depressions alone.

# German Hyperinflation: A Detailed Case Study

## 1. Introduction to the German Hyperinflation
- The German hyperinflation of the early 20th century serves as a quintessential example of an inflationary depression.
  - Occurred in the aftermath of World War I,  amid unique political and economic circumstances.
  - Driven by the dynamics of debt cycles,  economic activity,  and market behaviors as outlined in the "Archetypal Inflationary Depression" template.
  - Highlights the differences between inflationary and deflationary depressions.

## 2. Contextual Background: July 1914–November 1918
- **World War I as a Catalyst**
  - The war set the stage for a dramatic economic cycle in Germany.
  - Germany left the gold standard,  accumulated significant domestic and foreign debts,  and began printing money to finance fiscal deficits.
  - Experienced initial currency depreciation and inflation during the war years.
- **Expectations vs. Reality**
  - Based on the Franco-Prussian War of 1870,  Germany expected a short war,  financed by indemnities from defeated Allies.
  - The war was prolonged and expensive,  financed primarily through domestic debt.
  - Post-war,  Germany faced a massive reparation bill instead of collecting indemnities.
- **Classic Case of War Debts**
  - Germany's situation exemplifies a country losing a war with substantial foreign currency-denominated debt held by foreign creditors.
  - This scenario aligns with the dynamics described in the "Archetypal Inflationary Depression."

## 3. Economic Background and Initial Responses
- **Gold Standard and Currency Dynamics**
  - Germany,  like most countries,  was on the gold standard at the war's onset.
	- All paper currency and government debt were convertible to gold at a fixed rate.
	- By 1914,  the central bank lacked sufficient gold reserves to back the money supply at the fixed price.
- **Public Reaction and Policy Response**
  - As war broke out,  citizens exchanged paper money for gold,  causing a banking system run.
  - The Reichsbank and Treasury paid out significant gold reserves to the public.
  - To prevent further losses and ensure liquidity,  policymakers suspended gold conversion on July 31,  1914.
	- Authorized the Reichsbank to buy short-term Treasury bills and use them as collateral for money printing.
	- By August's end,  Reichsbank notes in circulation increased by approximately 30%.

## 4. Currency as a Medium of Exchange and Store of Wealth
- **Currency Dynamics**
  - Currency serves as both a medium of exchange and a store of wealth.
  - When investors hold substantial debt denominated in a currency,  and the currency supply is tied to a backing (e.g.,  gold),  central bank currency production is limited.

## 5. Infographic: Dynamics of German Hyperinflation

```markdown
- **World War I (1914-1918)**
  - Germany leaves gold standard
  - Accumulates domestic and foreign debts
  - Begins money printing
  - Initial currency depreciation and inflation

- **Post-War Expectations**
  - Short war expectation based on Franco-Prussian War
  - Reality: Long,     expensive war financed by domestic debt
  - Result: Huge reparation bill instead of indemnities

- **Economic Responses**
  - Gold standard suspension
  - Reichsbank authorized to buy Treasury bills
  - Rapid increase in money supply

- **Currency Dynamics**
  - Currency as medium of exchange and store of wealth
  - Limited central bank currency production due to gold backing
```

## 6. Conclusion
- The German hyperinflation case illustrates the complex interplay of war,  debt,  and [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the causes and consequences of inflationary depressions.
- The case highlights the importance of managing currency supply and debt in maintaining economic stability.

# Economic Dynamics of War and Inflation: A Detailed Analysis

## 1. Central Bank Dilemmas in Times of Economic Stress
- **Investor Behavior and Central Bank Challenges**
  - When investors convert bonds to currency,  central banks face a dilemma.
	- They must choose between allowing debt defaults or increasing the money supply.
	- Increasing the money supply can lead to currency debasement.
- **Conditions Leading to Central Bank Decisions**
  - Two critical conditions exacerbate central bank challenges:
	- **Condition A**: The money supply exceeds gold reserves needed for currency conversion.
	- **Condition B**: Investors rush to convert currency to gold,  fearing devaluation.
  - **Central Bank Responses**
	- Central banks typically suspend convertibility and print more money.
	- This choice is often less painful than allowing a credit contraction.
	- Printing money leads to currency depreciation,  raising prices of goods and assets.

## 2. War-Time Economic Policies
- **Monetary Policy in War**
  - During war,  policymakers print money to support the war effort.
	- This prevents liquidity crises and economic contractions.
	- Most countries in WWI suspended the gold standard to finance war efforts.
- **German Government Spending During WWI**
  - Government spending as a share of GDP increased 2.5 times from 1914 to 1917.
  - Financing options included raising taxes or borrowing.
	- Resistance to taxation and limited international lending led to domestic debt issuance.

## 3. Financing the War: Germany's Approach
- **Domestic Debt Issuance**
  - In 1914,  German government debt was minimal.
  - By 1918,  local currency debt reached 100 billion marks,  130% of GDP.
- **Advantages of Local Currency Debt**
  - Most debt was in local currency,  reducing foreign currency exposure.
  - The Reichsbank noted the weakness of enemy nations' foreign debt reliance.
- **Public Willingness to Finance Debt**
  - Initially,  the German public was willing to finance deficits through bond purchases.
  - War bonds were oversubscribed until mid-1916.

## 4. Inflation and Public Sentiment
- **Impact of Inflation on Debt**
  - As the war continued,  inflation accelerated,  reducing public willingness to hold debt.
  - Real interest rates became negative due to fixed bond rates and rising inflation.
- **Factors Driving Inflation**
  - Wartime disruptions,  shortages,  and capacity constraints in key industries.
  - Currency weakness,  with the mark depreciating 25% against the dollar by 1916.
- **Public Perception and Currency Effectiveness**
  - Some lenders hoped for a return to the gold standard or compensation for inflation.
  - Others feared repayment in devalued currency,  leading to reduced debt holdings.
  - The currency remained a medium of exchange but lost its value as a wealth store.

## 5. Infographic: Economic Dynamics During War

```

## 6. Conclusion
- The economic dynamics during war highlight the complex interplay between [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]],  public sentiment,  and inflation.
- Understanding these factors provides insights into the challenges faced by central banks and governments in maintaining economic stability during times of conflict.

# Economic Dynamics of Debt Monetization and Inflation During War

## 1. Introduction to Debt Monetization
- **Government Borrowing for War Expenditures**
  - The government borrowed extensively to finance its war efforts.
  - The Reichsbank was compelled to monetize the debt due to insufficient public investment.
  - This process increased the money supply by the amount of the fiscal deficit not covered by public financing.

## 2. Inflationary Effects of Debt Monetization
- **Self-Reinforcing Inflationary Spiral**
  - Debt monetization is inherently inflationary,  as it introduces more money into the economy without a corresponding increase in goods and services.
  - This inflationary pressure led to a cycle:
	- Increased inflation reduced real interest rates.
	- Lower real interest rates discouraged lending to the government.
	- Reduced lending necessitated further debt monetization.
  - The fiscal deficit was substantial,  averaging about 40% of GDP from 1914 to 1918.
  - Consequently,  the money supply surged by nearly 300% during the war.
- **Acceleration of Money Creation Post-1917**
  - As public willingness to purchase government debt waned,  the central bank had to monetize a larger portion of the deficit.
  - The number of marks in circulation nearly doubled between mid-1917 and mid-1918.
  - Despite this,  the currency did not immediately depreciate significantly.

## 3. Currency Dynamics and Market Expectations
- **Initial Stability and Subsequent Decline of the Mark**
  - The mark initially rallied due to expectations of a German victory following Russia's withdrawal from the war.
  - The currency only began to depreciate in the latter half of 1918 as a German defeat seemed more probable.

## 4. Foreign Currency Borrowing and Its Implications
- **Shift to Foreign Currency Borrowing**
  - In the war's final years,  Germany began borrowing in foreign currencies as lenders lost confidence in the mark.
  - Borrowing in foreign currency is a negative indicator,  reflecting diminished trust in the domestic currency.
- **Hard Currency Debt Challenges**
  - By 1918,  both the Reichsbank and private firms owed approximately 2.5 billion gold marks in foreign exchange.
  - A gold mark was a unit measuring the value of a paper mark against gold,  with one gold mark equaling one paper mark in 1914.
  - Hard currency debt,  unlike local currency debt,  cannot be inflated away.
  - Debtors needed to acquire gold or foreign exchange to settle these obligations.
  - Although hard currency debt was less than 10% of the total debt,  it exceeded the Reich's entire public gold reserves.

## 5. Strategic Considerations and Policy Maker Concerns
- **Expectations of Post-War Debt Management**
  - The hope was that a German victory would appreciate the mark,  easing debt burdens.
  - Defeated countries would be expected to cover much of Germany's debts.
- **Risks of Defeat and Economic Collapse**
  - Policymakers acknowledged the difficulty of repaying debts without significant reparations.
  - Reichsbank President Rudolf Havenstein emphasized the need for a large war indemnity to manage debts.
  - Economist Edgar Jaffé warned of a "monstrous catastrophe" of currency collapse if debts were paid in depreciated money.

## 6. Economic Disruptions and Inflationary Pressures
- **Breaking the Gold Peg and Economic Disruptions**
  - The decision to break the gold peg and monetize deficits,  coupled with wartime disruptions,  led to currency depreciation and inflation.
  - By early 1918,  the mark had depreciated by about 25% against the dollar,  and prices had tripled.
- **Typical Wartime Economic Strategy**
  - Such economic strategies were common among countries during WWI to fund their war efforts.

## 7. Infographic: Dynamics of Debt Monetization and Inflation

```markdown
- **Debt Monetization**
  - Government borrowing for war
  - Reichsbank monetizes debt
  - Money supply increases with fiscal deficit

- **Inflationary Spiral**
  - Debt monetization → Inflation → Lower real interest rates
  - Discouraged lending → More debt monetization
  - 40% GDP deficit → 300% money supply increase

- **Currency Dynamics**
  - Initial mark stability → Expectations of victory
  - Mark depreciation → German defeat likelihood

- **Foreign Currency Borrowing**
  - Shift due to mark distrust
  - Hard currency debt challenges
  - Debt exceeds gold reserves

- **Policy Maker Concerns**
  - Post-war debt management hopes
  - Risks of defeat and economic collapse

- **Economic Disruptions**
  - Breaking gold peg → Currency depreciation
  - Inflationary pressures typical in WWI
```

## 8. Conclusion
- The German experience during WWI illustrates the complex interplay between debt monetization,  inflation,  and currency dynamics.
- Understanding these factors provides insights into the challenges faced by economies during wartime and the potential consequences of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] decisions.

# German Post-WWI Inflationary Depression: A Detailed Analysis

## 1. Introduction to German Inflation Post-WWI
- **Contextual Overview**
  - German inflation during WWI was high but not significantly higher than other war participants.
  - Only a few countries experienced hyperinflation post-WWI,  which was not directly caused by the war or debt monetization.
- **Key Factors Leading to Inflationary Depression**
  - Inflationary depressions are more common in countries with specific economic vulnerabilities:
	- Lack of a reserve currency status.
	- Low foreign exchange reserves.
	- Large foreign debt stock.
	- Large budget and/or [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deficits.
	- Negative real interest rates.
	- History of high inflation and negative returns in the currency.

## 2. Germany's Economic Conditions Post-WWI
- **Absence of Reserve Currency Status**
  - The German mark was not a reserve currency,  lacking global trust as a store of wealth.
- **Foreign Exchange Reserves and Debt**
  - Insufficient reserves to cover external debts and potential reparations.
  - Large stock of foreign debt increased vulnerability to interest rate hikes and currency value changes.
- **Budget and Trade Deficits**
  - Significant deficits necessitated borrowing or money printing to finance expenditures.
- **Negative Real Interest Rates**
  - Real interest rates were negative,  offering little incentive for creditors to hold German currency/debt.
- **Historical Inflation and Currency Trust**
  - High inflation and negative returns eroded trust in the mark as a store of value.

## 3. Impact of the Treaty of Versailles and Initial Inflation (November 1918–March 1920)
- **Capital Flight Post-Surrender**
  - News of Germany's surrender led to capital flight as citizens and firms converted wealth into currencies of victorious powers.
  - Uncertainty about peace terms and liability payments fueled this exodus.
- **Economic Consequences**
  - The mark depreciated by about 30% against the dollar.
  - The German stock market lost nearly half its real value.
  - Government debt in local currency rose by about 30%,  necessitating central bank monetization.
  - Money supply increased by 50%,  driving inflation to 30%.
- **Initial Optimism and Subsequent Realities**
  - Initial optimism existed that peace terms would be lenient,  with reparations limited to occupied territories and paid in goods.
  - US President Woodrow Wilson's self-determination principle led to hopes of no territorial annexations without referendums.

## 4. Infographic: Economic Dynamics Post-WWI

- **Post-Surrender Capital Flight**
  - Wealth conversion to victorious powers' currencies
  - Mark depreciation (30% against dollar)
  - Stock market real value loss (50%)
  - Government debt rise (30%)

- **Monetary and Inflationary Effects**
  - Central bank debt monetization
  - Money supply increase (50%)
  - Inflation rate climb (30%)

- **Initial Optimism**
  - Hopes for lenient peace terms
  - Reparations in goods,     limited to occupied territories
  - Self-determination principle expectations
```

## 5. Conclusion
- The German post-WWI inflationary depression was driven by a combination of economic vulnerabilities and the aftermath of the Treaty of Versailles.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the causes and consequences of inflationary depressions,  highlighting the importance of economic stability and trust in currency value.

# German Post-WWI Economic Crisis: A Detailed Analysis

## 1. Initial Expectations and the Treaty of Versailles
- **Pre-Treaty Expectations**
  - Many Germans anticipated that post-war conditions would preserve their territory and economic capacity.
  - There was a belief that reparations would not be excessively punitive.
- **Revelation of the Treaty Terms**
  - The Treaty of Versailles terms were unexpectedly harsh,  causing a significant shock.
	- Germany was to lose 12% of its territory and 10% of its population.
	- Industrial capacity was severely impacted,  with a loss of 43% of pig-iron and 38% of steel capacity.
	- Germany was required to compensate Allied citizens for wealth seized during the war.
	- No compensation was provided for German assets confiscated abroad.
	- The German government had to honor all prewar debts to Allied creditors,  including private debts.
- **Reparations Commission**
  - A commission was to be established in 1921 to determine the final reparations bill.
  - Germany was to pay an interim amount equivalent to 20 billion marks in gold,  commodities,  ships,  securities,  and other real assets.
- **Acceptance of Terms**
  - Germany had no choice but to accept these terms or face total occupation.
  - The treaty was signed on June 28,  1919.

## 2. Economic Consequences of the Treaty
- **Exchange Rate Impact**
  - The treaty's signing triggered a sharp decline in the exchange rate.
	- The mark fell 90% against the dollar between July 1919 and January 1920.
- **Inflation Surge**
  - Inflation soared to 140% by the end of the year.
  - The primary driver was capital flight,  as German citizens sought to protect their wealth.
- **Capital Flight Dynamics**
  - Fears of high taxes and wealth confiscation led citizens to move capital out of the country.
  - The rush to convert marks into foreign currencies further weakened the mark.
  - This dynamic is typical in countries with large foreign currency-denominated debt during a debt/balance of payments crisis.

## 3. Debt and Currency Dynamics
- **Impact on Debtors**
  - German debtors with external liabilities faced soaring real expenses.
  - They rushed to pay off foreign debts,  flooding the foreign exchange market and further weakening the mark.
- **Industrialist Perspective**
  - A Hamburg industrialist noted the self-destructive nature of selling mark notes to meet obligations.
  - The mark risked becoming unusable if the trend continued.

## 4. Inflationary Depression Dynamics
- **Cause and Effect**
  - At this stage,  currency weakness was driving money printing,  not the other way around.
  - Capital flight was the primary cause of currency depreciation and subsequent inflation.
  - This is a classic pattern in inflationary depressions.
- **Central Bank Dilemma**
  - Central banks faced a choice between allowing liquidity and debt markets to tighten or printing money to fill the void.
  - Typically,  central banks opt to print money,  causing further currency declines.

## 5. Economic Implications of Currency Decline
- **Impact on Importers and Debtors**
  - Currency declines hurt importers and those with foreign currency debts.
- **Stimulative Effects**
  - Devaluations can stimulate the economy and asset markets during economic weakness.
  - They boost exports and profit margins by making goods cheaper on international markets.

```

## 7. Conclusion
- The harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles and subsequent economic policies led to a severe inflationary depression in Germany.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the challenges faced by economies during periods of significant external debt and currency instability.

# Economic Dynamics of Currency Devaluation and Inflation in Post-WWI Germany

## 1. Introduction to Currency Devaluation Effects
- **Impact on Imports and Domestic Industries**
  - Devaluation makes imports more expensive.
	- This supports domestic industries by encouraging consumers to buy locally produced goods.
- **Asset Valuation and Capital Inflows**
  - Devaluation increases the value of assets when measured in local currency.
  - It attracts foreign capital as financial assets become cheaper in global currency terms.

## 2. Economic Boost from Currency Decline (July 1919 - March 1920)
- **Economic Indicators**
  - The decline in the mark and negative real interest rates boosted the German economy.
  - Equity and commodity markets experienced growth.
- **Export Industry and Employment**
  - The export industry thrived,  leading to a decline in unemployment.
  - Real wages remained low,  improving business profitability.
  - Unemployment statistics,  though limited to trade union members,  indicated improving employment conditions.
- **Balance of Payments Hopes**
  - There was hope that encouraging exports and discouraging imports would stabilize the balance of payments.
  - A prominent German official expressed optimism that the devalued currency would improve trade relations and economic conditions.

## 3. Policy Responses to Economic Challenges
- **Domestic Debt and Fiscal Deficit Management**
  - Policymakers considered strategies to address domestic debt and fiscal deficits.
  - The "Erzberger Financial Reform" was proposed to raise revenues through progressive taxation.
	- Aimed to transfer wealth from the "haves" to the "have-nots."
	- Top income tax rates approached 60%,  and wealth taxes reached 65%.
- **Erzberger Reforms Implementation**
  - Passed in December 1919,  these reforms increased the share of Reich's income from direct taxes to 75% by 1922.
  - Prior to reforms,  government revenue primarily came from public enterprises and specific duties.

## 4. Inflation as an Economic Strategy
- **Currency Weakness and Inflation Advocacy**
  - Some policymakers advocated for currency weakness and inflation as alternatives to heavy taxation.
  - Dr. Friedrich Bendixen argued that inflation could cleanse Germany of local currency war debts.
	- Suggested that transforming war loans into money would prevent economic collapse.
- **Central Bank's Stance on Inflation**
  - The central bank rejected the explicit inflation strategy but acknowledged its potential inevitability.
  - Inflation climbed to nearly 200%,  reducing the domestic war-debt burden significantly.

## 5. Wealth Preservation and Monetary Policy Alternatives
- **Wealth Preservation Efforts**
  - Wealthy individuals scrambled to buy foreign currencies or real assets to protect their wealth from inflation.
- **Central Bank's Alternative Strategy**
  - Proposed tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] to engineer a deflationary recession.
	- This would allow repayment closer to the true value of loaned wealth.
	- However,  it risked crushing domestic credit creation and demand,  leading to significant unemployment.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: A Detailed Analysis

## 1. Introduction to Economic Dilemmas and Redistribution Policies
- **Germany's Economic Dilemma**
  - Germany faced a classic economic dilemma: whether to support creditors (long the currency) or debtors (short the currency).
	- Creditors held debt denominated in the currency,  while debtors owed it.
- **Redistribution Policies in Economic Crises**
  - Economic crises often lead to policies that redistribute wealth from "haves" to "have-nots."
	- The intolerable conditions of the "have-nots" and their numerical superiority drive these policies.
	- Relieving debt burdens and redistributing wealth were prioritized over preserving creditor wealth.

## 2. Socioeconomic Conditions and Political Climate
- **Post-War Economic Challenges**
  - High unemployment,  rampant food shortages,  and the reintegration of returning soldiers posed significant challenges.
  - Clashes between capitalists and workers were widespread across Europe.
- **Spread of Communist Ideas**
  - The 1917 Communist revolution in Russia influenced global political ideologies.
  - Communist ideas were gaining traction,  adding to the political tensions.
- **Keynesian Perspective on Inflation vs. Deflation**
  - John Maynard Keynes commented on the choice between inflation and deflation.
	- He argued that inflation is unjust,  but deflation is worse due to its impact on unemployment.
	- In an impoverished world,  provoking unemployment is more detrimental than disappointing capitalists.

## 3. Economic Reforms and Stabilization Efforts
- **Inflation and Economic Activity**
  - By late 1919/early 1920,  Germany had inflated away most of its domestic debt.
  - A comprehensive tax-reform package was passed to generate new revenues.
  - Economic activity began to pick up,  signaling a potential recovery.
- **Reparations and International Relations**
  - The Allies invited Germany to propose its own reparation bill,  easing tensions.
  - Critics of harsh settlements,  like Keynes,  gained sympathy in official circles abroad.
  - The exchange rate began to stabilize,  reflecting improved economic conditions.

## 4. Political Instability and the Kapp Putsch
- **Intense Left-Right Conflicts**
  - Despite economic stabilization,  political conflicts between the Left and Right remained intense.
- **The Kapp Putsch**
  - In March 1921,  right-wing nationalist groups attempted to overthrow the Weimar government.
	- Led by Wolfgang Kapp,  they aimed to establish an autocratic monarchist regime.
	- The coup failed within days due to a general strike by workers.
- **Political Fragility and Populism**
  - The Kapp Putsch highlighted the fragile political environment.
  - Economic pain from depressions can lead to populist and reactionary leaders on both sides.
  - A Berlin businessman expressed frustration over the political instability disrupting economic progress.

## 5. March 1920 to May 1921: Period of Relative Stabilization
- **Economic and Political Stabilization**
  - The period between March 1920 and May 1921 was marked by relative stabilization.
	- The mark's decline halted,  prices stabilized,  and the economy outperformed other developed nations.
- **Global Economic Context**
  - The global backdrop was one of severe contraction due to tightening monetary policies in the US and UK.
  - Those shorting the mark,  including Keynes,  incurred significant losses.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: 1920-1921

## 1. Global Economic Context and Germany's Divergence
- **Industrial Production and Unemployment in the US and UK**
  - Between 1920 and 1921,  industrial production fell by:
	- 20% in the US.
	- 18.6% in the UK.
  - Unemployment rates rose to:
	- 22% in the US.
	- 11.8% in the UK.
  - **Source**: Global Financial Data
- **Reichsbank's Monetary Policy**
  - Unlike other central banks,  the Reichsbank maintained an easy [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].
	- The discount rate remained at 5% until 1922.
	- Regular interventions were made to inject liquidity when credit conditions tightened.
  - **Example**: In spring 1921,  the Reichsbank accelerated its purchases of commercial bills from 3.1% to 9% of bills outstanding.
- **Fiscal Policy**
  - Fiscal policy remained accommodative.
	- Real expenditures (excluding reparations) rose in 1920 and 1921.
	- The budget deficit,  although narrowed,  remained substantial at roughly 10% of GDP.
	- Continued financing through the issuance of floating debt.
- **Economic Outcomes**
  - Stimulative policies allowed Germany to escape the global contraction.
  - Industrial production increased by 75% between 1919 and 1921.
  - Despite growth,  economic activity levels remained below 1913 levels,  with considerable poverty and suffering.

## 2. Inflationary and Deflationary Dynamics
- **Offsetting Inflationary Pressures**
  - Rising economic activity and reflationary policies did not result in significant inflation between March 1920 and May 1921.
  - Domestic inflationary pressures were offset by global deflationary forces.
	- Import prices from the US and UK fell by about 50%.
	- Rising [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] into Germany helped stabilize the currency,  allowing for slower money supply growth.
- **Currency and Inflation Trends**
  - The mark rallied,  and inflation declined.
  - By early 1921,  prices stopped rising for the first time since 1914.
  - Optimism about the German economy increased abroad,  attracting foreign investments.

## 3. Capital Inflows and Economic Implications
- **Speculative Capital Inflows**
  - Germany became a hot economy for investment,  with significant foreign capital inflows.
  - Speculative inflows were seen as a "tremendous" bubble,  with Keynes calling it "the greatest ever known."
  - Many new buyers had no prior market experience,  a classic sign of a bubble.
- **Foreign Ownership in German Banks**
  - By 1921,  almost a third of all deposits in the seven largest German banks were foreign-owned.
  - These inflows supported the stabilization of the mark.
- **Central Bank's Role and Economic Dependence**
  - Capital inflows reduced the trade-offs between growth and inflation for the central bank.
  - Inflows tend to lower inflation and stimulate growth,  while outflows do the opposite.
  - The German economy became increasingly dependent on "hot money" to finance fiscal and external deficits.

## 4. Risks and Fragility of Economic Recovery
- **Dependence on Speculative Investments**
  - The economy's recovery was fragile and sensitive to shifts in sentiment.
  - Dependence on capital inflows made the economy vulnerable to any minor event that could trigger a shift in sentiment.
- **Policy Challenges with Mark Appreciation**
  - The mark's sharp appreciation in early 1920 was unwelcome for policymakers.
  - A falling mark was considered essential for:
	- Maintaining export competitiveness.
	- Supporting employment growth.
	- Building a savings pool of hard currency earnings.

## 6. Conclusion
- The period between 1920 and 1921 in Germany was marked by a divergence from global economic trends,  driven by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.
- While Germany experienced growth and capital inflows,  the economy remained fragile and dependent on speculative investments,  highlighting the risks associated with such economic dynamics.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: The Impact of the London Ultimatum

## 1. Economic Challenges and Policy Responses (March - June 1920)
- **Initial Appreciation of the Mark**
  - The mark's appreciation was initially seen as a "one good fortune in the midst of misfortune."
	- It was crucial for maintaining Germany's export potential.
  - However,  the appreciation severely impacted exports.
	- The chamber of commerce reported that industry had "practically ground to a halt."
	- Unemployment surged,  with the number of unemployed trade union members tripling.
- **Government Intervention**
  - The economic ministry intervened to deliberately depress the mark and stimulate employment.
	- This intervention occurred between March and June 1920.
  - **Outcome of Intervention**
	- The mark fell,  restoring competitiveness.
	- Unemployment began to decline once again.
- **Concerns Over Deflationary Forces**
  - German policymakers were more concerned about deflationary forces than inflation.
	- Rising unemployment and potential social unrest were seen as more threatening than inflation.
  - **Reconstruction Minister's Perspective**
	- The minister expressed a willingness to allow more money printing to prevent a crisis similar to that in England.
	- The goal was to build a "dam against the crisis" through economic activity.
- **Dependence on Speculative Inflows**
  - The stabilization of the mark and economic conditions relied heavily on speculative inflows and a stable balance of payments.

## 2. The London Ultimatum (May 1921)
- **Reparations and Threats**
  - The London Ultimatum marked a critical point in reparations negotiations between Germany and the Allies.
	- The Allies threatened to occupy the Ruhr Basin if Germany did not accept the new reparation bill within six days.
  - **Reparation Details**
	- Total reparations were set at 132 billion gold marks,  about 330% of German GDP.
	- Payments for the first 50 billion were to begin immediately,  with quarterly installments of 750 million marks.
	- This represented a debt-service burden of around 10% of German GDP or 80% of export earnings.
	- Payments for the remaining 70 billion would commence when the Allies deemed Germany capable.
- **Economic and Investor Reactions**
  - The reparations were enormous,  dashing hopes for a conciliatory agreement.
  - The payment structure was unsettling for investors and the German public.
	- Debt service burdens were expected to increase if economic conditions improved.
  - **Comparative Context**
	- Germany's hard currency debts dwarfed those of other economies entering major inflationary depressions.
	- Charts showed Germany's debt as a percentage of GDP from 1914 to 1922.

## 3. Economic Consequences of the Ultimatum
- **Currency and Inflation Impact**
  - The announcement of the reparation burden led to a sell-off of the mark.
	- The mark declined by 75% by the end of the year.
	- Inflation returned,  with prices nearly doubling over the same period.
- **Balance of Payments Crisis**
  - The reparation schedule created a balance of payments crisis.
	- This crisis was akin to serious financial problems faced by individuals,  households,  and corporations in making payments.
  - **Prominent German Perspective**
	- A participant at Versailles expressed that burdening a country with debts while depriving it of payment means would lead to currency collapse.
	- The peace treaty's maintenance in its current form was seen as unsustainable.

## 5. Conclusion
- The period surrounding the London Ultimatum was marked by significant economic challenges and policy responses in Germany.
- The ultimatum's reparation demands and subsequent economic consequences underscored the fragility of Germany's post-WWI recovery and highlighted the complex interplay between international obligations and domestic economic stability.

# Economic Challenges and Policy Responses in Post-WWI Germany

## 1. Introduction to Economic Levers for Debt Management
- To manage its reparation payments,  Germany had four primary options:
  1. **Spend Less**
	 - Reduce government expenditures.
  1. **Earn More**
	 - Increase national income through economic growth or taxation.
  1. **Finance Payments**
	 - Borrow funds or use existing savings.
  1. **Default or Seek Relief**
	 - Negotiate with creditors for debt relief or default on obligations.
- Unlike domestic war loans,  Germany's reparation debts were not denominated in paper marks,  preventing debt monetization through currency devaluation.

## 2. Challenges of Cutting Government Spending
- **Political and Social Implications**
  - Approximately 50% of government revenues were allocated to reparations.
  - Significant cuts in non-reparation spending were necessary but politically dangerous.
	- Most non-reparation spending supported essential social services,  such as unemployment relief,  food and housing subsidies,  and public employment sectors like railways and shipyards.
	- Large spending cuts were deemed "politically impossible" due to potential social unrest.
  - The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and the growing Communist movement in Germany heightened fears of a leftist revolution.
  - Simultaneously,  the demands of the Allied powers fueled far-right nationalism.
  - Political chaos was evident through strikes,  riots,  and political violence.
	- A state of emergency was declared in the summer of 1920 due to widespread looting.
	- In March 1921,  Communist groups seized control of shipyards and factories,  leading to violent confrontations with police.
	- Finance Minister Matthias Erzberger was assassinated by ultranationalists in October 1921 for his role in the 1918 surrender.
  - Given these circumstances,  the government refused to cut social spending,  and the Reichsbank continued monetizing the deficit.

## 3. Limitations of Increasing Tax Revenue
- **High Existing Tax Burdens**
  - The Erzberger Reforms of 1919 had already significantly increased tax burdens.
  - Further tax increases posed similar political and social risks as spending cuts.
	- Additional taxes would be difficult to pass due to opposition in the Reichstag.
	- Higher taxes risked accelerating capital flight.
  - John Maynard Keynes commented on the impracticality of meeting reparation burdens through taxation,  noting that no government could extract such a large portion of income from the population.

## 4. Constraints on Using Savings and Securing Loans
- **Limited Savings and Lending Options**
  - Germany had virtually no savings to draw upon for debt servicing.
  - The Treaty of Versailles had seized or frozen Germany's prewar foreign holdings and canceled debts owed to Germans.
  - Exporters with foreign currency savings were incentivized to keep earnings abroad to avoid potential government seizure.
  - The central bank's gold reserves were insufficient to cover even the first interest payment.
  - International appetite for extending credit to Germany was minimal due to:
	- Developed economies burdened by their own war debts,  primarily owed to the United States.
	- Ongoing severe recessions in these economies.

```

## 6. Conclusion
- Germany faced significant economic challenges in managing its reparation payments post-WWI.
- The combination of political instability,  high tax burdens,  limited savings,  and constrained borrowing options underscored the complexity of the situation.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the economic and political pressures that shaped Germany's post-war recovery efforts.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: Creditworthiness and Inflationary Spiral

## 1. Introduction to Germany's Creditworthiness Challenges
- **Lack of Creditworthiness**
  - The German government and most Germans were not considered creditworthy by international standards.
  - **Example**: The head of the Reichsbank was refused a 500 million gold mark short-term loan by the Bank of England.
	- The British Chancellor of the Exchequer highlighted a "vicious circle":
	  - Germany needed a foreign loan to stop printing money and repay obligations.
	  - However,  it couldn't secure a loan without first demonstrating the ability to meet its obligations.
- **Constraints on Defaulting**
  - Unilateral default on debt was not an option due to the threat of invasion.
  - German leaders attempted to renegotiate payments,  but post-war bitterness,  especially from France,  hindered concessions.

## 2. Currency Management as a Lever in Balance of Payments Crisis
- **Currency Manipulation**
  - Unlike households,  countries can alter the amount of existing currency,  affecting its value.
  - This provides an additional tool for managing balance of payments crises.
- **Policy Options for Currency Defense**
  - The Reichsbank could raise rates and tighten credit to defend the currency.
	- This would increase returns on mark-denominated assets,  attracting foreign capital and discouraging domestic capital flight.
	- However,  it would also severely contract domestic demand,  reduce imports,  and help close the trade deficit.
	- Such a contraction was deemed intolerable for the impoverished and conflict-ridden German society.
- **Alternative Strategy: Currency Depreciation**
  - The remaining option was to allow currency depreciation and print money to alleviate liquidity tightening from capital flight.

## 3. Dynamics of Hyperinflationary Spirals
- **Characteristics of Hyperinflation**
  - Hyperinflation occurs when policymakers fail to close the gap between income and spending/debt service.
  - Instead,  they sustain spending by printing excessive amounts of money over time.
  - **Balance of Payments Crisis**
	- Targeted money printing can be beneficial if not overused,  as it prevents severe economic contraction.
	- Excessive money printing and severe currency devaluation,  without balancing deflationary measures like austerity and [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]],  lead to severe inflationary depressions.
- **German Policy Response**
  - The reparation schedule and difficulty in using other economic levers pushed Germany to rely on money printing.
  - Policymakers recognized the inflationary impact but considered it the least detrimental option.
  - A better balance between deflationary and inflationary forces might have mitigated the crisis.

## 4. June 1921–December 1921: The Emerging Inflationary Spiral
- **Emergence of Inflationary Spiral**
  - The latter half of 1921 saw classic inflationary spiral dynamics.
  - Germany's foreign debt obligations contributed to currency declines,  causing inflation and liquidity crises.
  - The central bank responded by printing money and buying debt to prevent commerce contraction.
  - This triggered further capital flight,  inflation,  liquidity tightening,  and more money printing,  accelerating the spiral.
- **Central Bank's Role and Gold Reserves**
  - The central bank depleted significant gold reserves to cover initial reparation payments.
  - The spiral was relatively contained compared to future developments,  partly due to continued foreign support for German assets.

## 6. Conclusion
- Germany's post-WWI economic challenges were exacerbated by its lack of creditworthiness and reliance on money printing to manage reparation payments.
- The emerging inflationary spiral highlighted the complex interplay between foreign debt obligations,  currency management,  and domestic economic stability.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the causes and consequences of hyperinflationary depressions.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: Inflationary Pressures and Economic Responses

## 1. Introduction to Inflationary Pressures and Currency Decline
- **Reparation Payments and Capital Flight**
  - Reparation payments and local capital flight caused the German mark to decline by 75% over a specific period.
  - Inflation accelerated,  approaching 100% per annum.
- **Impact of Upper Silesia Decision**
  - The sharpest declines in the mark occurred in October 1921.
  - This followed the League of Nations' decision to cede Upper Silesia,  an important coal mining and industrial region,  to Poland.
  - The decision was made despite a majority vote by residents to remain in Germany.

## 2. Consumer Behavior and Retail Dynamics
- **Surge in Retail Purchases**
  - Rising inflation led to a surge in retail purchases.
  - This increase in demand was not indicative of economic growth but rather a flight of income and savings into real goods to preserve purchasing power.
- **Descriptions of Retail Activity**
  - The American Council of Hamburg noted a "vast amount of retail buying."
  - The *Hamburgische Correspondent* described a "monstrous lust for goods."
  - The situation was characterized as "general liquidation,  " with foreigners buying due to the cheap mark and Germans buying to escape inflation.
- **Retailer Reactions**
  - A Berlin official reported shock at the "plundering of retailers by foreigners with highly valued currencies."
  - A British observer noted that many shops declared themselves sold out,  closed during the afternoon,  and limited sales to one article per customer.
  - Germans were stockpiling goods in anticipation of further price increases or stock depletion.

## 3. Shift to Consumer Durables and Real Assets
- **Increase in Durable Goods Purchases**
  - The same inflationary pressures led to a massive increase in consumer-durable and real-asset purchases.
  - Auto sales reached all-time highs,  textile trade bookings were months in advance,  and cotton firms refused new orders.
  - Most industries operated at full capacity,  introducing overtime to meet demand.
- **Flight into Inflation-Hedge Assets**
  - This burst of economic activity was not a sign of prosperity but a classic flight into inflation-hedge assets.
  - A Bavarian official noted that the fall of the mark caused anxiety among the propertied classes,  leading to widespread purchasing to convert paper money into tangible goods.

## 4. Monetary Policy and Borrowing Dynamics
- **Central Bank Interest Rate Policy**
  - The central bank kept market interest rates anchored at 5% by increasing purchases when liquidity tightened.
  - With inflation generally 10 times higher,  the real return on lending became unattractive,  and the real cost of borrowing plummeted.
- **Surge in Borrowing and Investment**
  - The unattractive real lending rates led to a surge in borrowing,  making it extremely attractive.
  - Real investment reached prewar highs,  and monthly [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] rates declined by 75%.
  - However,  much of this investment was not productive,  as firms invested in capital for its intrinsic value rather than use value.
- **Consequences of Investment Behavior**
  - Firms that retained wealth in debt assets,  such as bonds,  suffered devastating losses.
  - This period was termed the "flight from the mark to the machine,  " resulting in excessive investments that performed poorly post-inflation.
  - The investment surge accelerated inflation and reinforced the inflationary spiral.

## 5. Labor Market Dynamics and Wage Pressures
- **Employment and Bargaining Power**
  - Growing demand for real goods led to increased employment in industries producing those goods.
  - Unemployment fell,  and workers' bargaining power increased,  leading to demands for wage increases and better working conditions.
- **Labor Standoffs and Wage Gains**
  - In the summer of 1921,  numerous standoffs between employers and laborers resulted in large nominal wage gains.

```

## 7. Conclusion
- The post-WWI period in Germany was marked by significant inflationary pressures,  driven by reparation payments,  capital flight,  and currency depreciation.
- Consumer behavior shifted towards purchasing real goods and assets as a hedge against inflation,  while [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and borrowing dynamics further fueled the inflationary spiral.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the complex interplay between economic policies,  consumer behavior,  and labor market conditions during periods of hyperinflation.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: Inflation,  Exports,  and Speculation

## 1. Introduction to Economic Gains and Challenges
- **Real Income Decline Despite Wage Gains**
  - Workers experienced nominal wage increases,  but these were insufficient to match inflation.
	- Real incomes fell by approximately 30%.
	- This exacerbated tensions between the "haves" and the "have-nots."
- **Export Sector Benefits from Currency Collapse**
  - The export sector was the only clear beneficiary of the mark's collapse.
	- Foreign sales increased as German goods became cheaper internationally.
  - **Limitations on Export Gains**
	- Hostility towards German exports abroad limited potential gains.
	- Declining labor costs in other developed countries,  due to global recession-induced deflation,  reduced competitiveness advantages from the depreciating mark.

## 2. Stock Market Speculation and Economic Instability
- **Speculative Boom in the Stock Market**
  - The second half of 1921 saw a speculative frenzy in the stock market.
	- Stock values nearly tripled in inflation-adjusted terms.
	- The Berlin stock exchange faced such high order volumes that it shut down three times a week.
	- By November,  trading days were reduced to one per week,  and banks limited share orders.
- **Widespread Participation in Speculation**
  - Speculation was pervasive across all social strata.
	- Individuals from various backgrounds engaged in stock market activities.
	- The stock market was viewed as a means to escape the depreciating mark.
- **Drivers of the Bull Market**
  - The bull market was not driven by improving economic fundamentals.
	- It was a reaction to escape holding money,  with investors seeking to acquire real assets.
	- Stock market speculation was seen as an organized flight from the mark.

## 3. Economic and Political Threats
- **Deteriorating Economic Conditions**
  - By the end of 1921,  economic conditions worsened,  with inflation nearing 100%.
  - The lack of confidence in the mark and rising prices threatened economic and political stability.
- **Foreign Investment as a Stabilizing Factor**
  - Foreigners continued to purchase marks and fund Germany's external deficit,  preventing total collapse.
	- Despite domestic loss of confidence,  foreign investments in German assets persisted.

## 5. January 1922–May 1922: Negotiating a Reparation Moratorium
- **Allied Powers' Response to German Chaos**
  - Alarmed by Germany's economic chaos,  the Allies considered granting relief from reparation payments.
	- The reparation debt burden was seen as the most pressing issue.
	- Continuing the status quo risked total economic collapse and increased political chaos in Europe.
- **Disagreements Among Allied Powers**
  - There was considerable disagreement on the extent of relief and potential concessions from Germany.
	- Tensions existed between desires for vengeance and limiting German power versus recognizing economic realities.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: Debtor-Creditor Standoff and Reparation Negotiations

## 1. Introduction to Debtor-Creditor Dynamics
- **Classic Debtor-Creditor Standoff**
  - The post-WWI period in Germany exemplified a classic debtor-creditor standoff.
	- Debtors (Germans) sought maximum relief from reparation payments.
	- Creditors (Allied powers) aimed to recover as much as possible without causing German insolvency.
  - This dynamic involved a strategic game of power brinksmanship.
- **J.P. Morgan,  Jr.'s Perspective**
  - J.P. Morgan,  Jr. highlighted the dilemma faced by the Allies:
	- A weak Germany would be unable to pay reparations.
	- A strong Germany could pay but might also regain military strength.
  - The Allies needed to decide between economic weakness and potential military resurgence.

## 2. The Cannes Conference and Temporary Compromise
- **Conference in Cannes,  France (January 1922)**
  - Discussions focused on restructuring Germany's reparation payments.
  - A temporary compromise was reached:
	- The Reparations Commission reduced the debt service bill by 75% for the year.
	- Conditions included new taxes,  reduced spending,  and granting the Reichsbank independence.
  - **Symbolic Concessions**
	- The agreed taxes were insufficient to close the budget deficit.
	- Reichsbank President Rudolf Havenstein welcomed independence,  allowing unrestricted money printing.
- **Impact on the German Economy**
  - Optimism about reparation relief halted the mark's decline.
  - By January's end,  the mark rose 30% from 1921 lows.
  - Inflation,  though high (140% per annum),  stopped accelerating,  providing economic relief.

## 3. Ongoing Negotiations and Economic Arguments
- **German Policy Makers' Stance**
  - German officials argued that the balance of payments,  not money printing,  caused the inflationary crisis.
  - Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau emphasized the impossibility of making gold payments without foreign loans or export surpluses.
  - He criticized the simplistic view that stopping money printing would resolve the crisis.
- **Mechanics of Economics and Markets**
  - The economic mechanics were fundamentally the same then as now.
  - While domestic currency debt could be extinguished,  external debts posed significant challenges.

## 4. Currency Fluctuations and Market Sentiment
- **Influence of Reparation Negotiations**
  - From February to May,  currency expectations were driven by reparation negotiation news.
  - Positive news led to mark rallies and reduced inflation expectations.
  - Negative news caused the mark to fall and inflation expectations to rise.
  - The mark experienced 10-20% swings based on sentiment changes.
- **Market Volatility**
  - By the end of May,  the mark was down about 40% versus the dollar due to deteriorating reparation agreement prospects.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: The Onset of Hyperinflation

## 1. Introduction to Hyperinflation and Market Volatility
- **Market Volatility and Reparation Negotiations**
  - The markets experienced significant volatility,  with large fluctuations in response to updates on reparation negotiations.
  - Traders faced challenges navigating through such unpredictable conditions.

## 2. June 1922–December 1922: The Beginning of Hyperinflation
- **Collapse of Reparation Settlement Expectations**
  - In June 1922,  hopes for a reparation settlement collapsed,  leading to a sharp decline in the mark.
  - Three interconnected events contributed to this collapse:
	1. **French Rejection of Reparation Commission Conclusions**
	   - France,  historically the most reluctant among the Allies to reduce reparation burdens,  declared it would no longer accept the Reparation Commission's conclusions on Germany's capacity to pay.
	   - France decided to determine German reparations independently and threatened to seize German assets,  particularly productive ones like the Ruhr coal mines,  if Germany defaulted.
	   - Instead of a potential moratorium,  Germany faced the prospect of paying France whatever it deemed appropriate or risking sustained occupation of valuable territory.
	1. **Impact on International Loan Plans**
	   - An international committee,  led by American financier J.P. Morgan,  Jr.,  had been exploring the possibility of extending Germany a gold loan to rebuild its economy and ease external debt burdens.
	   - This loan was contingent on progress towards a reparation moratorium,  as repayment would be unlikely without it.
	   - Following the French declaration,  the loan committee concluded that extending credit to Germany was impossible.
	1. **Assassination of Foreign Minister Walter Rathenau**
	   - Rathenau,  despite some belligerent speeches,  was one of the few German politicians trusted by the Allies and enjoyed significant domestic support.
	   - His assassination by a right-wing group eliminated a key figure capable of mediating a settlement with the Reparations Commission and securing Reichstag approval.
	   - This event underscored the threat of nationalism and extremist populism in Germany.

## 3. Capital Flight and the Collapse of the Mark
- **Foreign Capital Withdrawal**
  - Unlike earlier periods,  foreigners rushed to withdraw their capital from Germany.
  - Approximately one-third of all deposits in German banks were foreign-owned,  and foreign speculation had been a significant support for the German economy and balance of payments.
  - Over the following months,  about two-thirds of these deposits vanished,  and capital inflows collapsed.
- **Accelerated Capital Flight by Germans**
  - Simultaneously,  capital flight by Germans accelerated,  with well-to-do citizens rushing to move their wealth abroad before confiscatory taxes from the January compromise took effect.
  - The mark collapsed,  triggering the onset of hyperinflation.

## 4. Liquidity Crisis in the German Banking System
- **Acute Liquidity Crisis and Bank Runs**
  - The result was an acute liquidity crisis in the German banking system,  leading to bank runs.
  - The central bank's printing rate could not keep pace with the flight of marks abroad and rising prices.
  - By July,  banks were forced to operate on three-day work weeks and informed depositors of insufficient cash to honor deposits or make weekly wage payments for large business clients.
  - Some banks began illegally printing their own marks.
- **Self-Reinforcing Liquidity Crisis**
  - The liquidity crisis was self-reinforcing,  as depositors,  witnessing banks' struggles to honor liabilities,  withdrew deposits in increasing numbers,  exacerbating the crisis.

## 5. Central Bank's Response to the Crisis
- **Accelerated Money Printing and Debt Monetization**
  - By August 1922,  the economy was on the brink of financial collapse.
  - The central bank responded by rapidly accelerating the pace of mark printing and monetizing a growing share of government debt.
- **Purchasing Commercial Bills and Providing Direct Credits**
  - The central bank began purchasing commercial bills en masse.
  - As the liquidity crisis deepened in the fall,  it further accelerated the provision of direct credits to the banking system.

## 7. Conclusion
- The period from June to December 1922 marked the beginning of hyperinflation in Germany,  driven by the collapse of reparation settlement expectations,  capital flight,  and a severe liquidity crisis in the banking system.
- The central bank's response,  including accelerated money printing and debt monetization,  highlighted the challenges of managing economic stability during periods of extreme financial distress.
- Understanding these dynamics provides insights into the causes and consequences of hyperinflationary spirals and the complex interplay between international obligations,  domestic economic policies,  and political instability.

# Economic Dynamics in Post-WWI Germany: Hyperinflation and Policy Responses

## 1. Introduction to Hyperinflation and Monetary Policy
- **Reichsbank's Role in Preventing Financial Collapse**
  - By the end of the year,  the Reichsbank held about one-third of all commercial bills in circulation.
  - Credits to the banking system increased by 1,  900 percent.
  - These interventions prevented the financial system from collapsing and led to a ten-fold increase in the money supply.
- **Transition from Inflation to Hyperinflation**
  - Unlike previous currency depreciation and money printing episodes,  this round sent inflation skyrocketing.
  - The scale of liquidity injection needed to offset foreign capital pullback contributed to this shift.
  - Changing inflationary psychology also played a significant role.
	- Initially,  inflation was perceived as semi-managed.
	- Eventually,  it was seen as out of control.

## 2. Inflationary Psychology and Economic Behavior
- **Classic Patterns in Inflationary Depressions**
  - With each round of printing,  more money leaves the currency instead of going into economic activity.
  - Domestic currency holders observe that those shorting cash and buying real/foreign assets fare better than those saving and investing domestically.
  - This leads to a shift from investing printed money in productive assets to purchasing real assets (like gold) and foreign currency.
- **Foreign Investor Behavior**
  - Foreign investors no longer return due to repeated losses.
  - By August,  prices were rising over 50 percent a month,  signaling an approaching hyperinflationary spiral.
  - Policymakers recognized the situation but felt compelled to continue printing.

## 3. Challenges in Stopping Hyperinflation
- **Difficulty in Halting the Printing Press**
  - Once an inflationary depression reaches the hyperinflationary stage,  stopping printing is extremely difficult.
  - Extreme capital flight and inflation feed off one another,  making money scarce even as it loses value.
- **Keynes' Observations in Hamburg**
  - During the early phase of hyperinflation,  Keynes described rapidly changing shop prices and the valueless yet scarce mark.
  - Shops were reluctant to accept marks,  and banks struggled with cash shortages.
  - The Reichsbank advised banks to limit check cashing to 10,  000 marks,  and some institutions couldn't cash checks for weekly wages.

## 4. Consequences of Stopping the Printing Press
- **Potential Economic Collapse**
  - Halting the printing press would result in an extreme cash shortage and total financial system collapse.
  - An economist noted that stopping printing would halt payments to merchants,  employees,  and workers.
  - National and economic life,  including factories,  mines,  railways,  and government functions,  would cease.
- **Misconceptions About Hyperinflation**
  - People often think hyperinflations are caused by reckless money printing and can be stopped by turning off the printing press.
  - In reality,  inflation spirals push policymakers into choosing printing as the least bad option among terrible alternatives.

## 5. Political and Economic Pressures
- **Weimar Germany's Dilemma**
  - The cost of not printing included potential economic collapse and political
