Chapter 5: The Last 500 Years Part 2: The Big Cycle of the United States and the Dollar

# **Chapter 5: The Last 500 Years Part 2: The Big Cycle of the United States and the Dollar**

**To remind you, I did this study so that I could understand how we got to where we are and how to deal with the situations we are facing, but I am no great historian. I'm just a guy with a compulsion to understand how these things work and to bet on what will happen, who has access to great research assistants, fabulous data, incredibly informed experts, lots of insightful written research, and my own experiences. I'm using all of this to try to figure out what's true and what to do about it. I am not ideological. I am mechanical. I look at reality as a perpetual-motion machine with cause/effect relationships driving developments through time. I am sharing this information with you to take or leave as you like and to have you point out any inaccuracies you think might exist as we try to figure out together what's true and what to do about it.** 

**This chapter is a continuation of the last chapter in which we started to look at each of the leading reserve currency empires over the last 500 years, starting with the Dutch and British empires. We first saw the Dutch and then the British rise to become the richest and most powerful reserve currency empire and then decline into relative insignificance in cycles that were driven by timeless and universal cause/effect relationships. We ended with the British Empire declining in the first half of the 20th century. That brought us up to World War II, after which the British Empire was replaced by the US Empire. In this chapter we will examine the US and in the next we will examine China—now the two leading world powers—to see how they are progressing along the path of the archetypical cycle. That will complete our examination of the rises and declines of the leading empires over the last 500 years. We will then make one more quick review of the past before trying to squint into the future.** 

**As we move closer to the present, I will increasingly shift from describing each country's story individually to weaving the most relevant countries' stories together chronologically so you can better see the interactions, and I will do it in greater detail. I will start in 1930 and bring the story up to the present for both the US and China, and then I will focus more closely on US-China interactions, which are the most important ones today. While telling the story this way will make it a bit more complicated, it will help you see how what is happening now is similar to what happened in the past because the most important forces and cause/effect relationships behind them are essentially the same**. As we delve into the particulars of the last 90 years, it is easy to lose sight of the big arcs, most importantly the three big cycles—i.e., the long-term debt/monetary cycle, the wealth and political gap cycle, and the global geopolitical cycle—as well as the eight major types of power and the 17 major drivers behind them. **I will try to keep it simple, emphasizing just the most important developments in just the most influential countries, but if you find that the story starts getting more complicated than you'd like, remember that you can just read the text in bold in order to get the main points without complication.** 

**World affairs and history are complicated because there is a lot going on both within and between relevant countries. Understanding just the most important relevant issues of just the most important countries is challenging because one has to see all of these perspectives accurately and simultaneously. All countries are living out their own stories that transpire on a daily basis, and these stories are woven together to make up the world story. But typically, at any one time, there are only a few leading countries and a limited number of major themes that make up the major story of the changing world order. Since the end of World War I, the most relevant stories have been those of Great Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union, and China. I'm not saying that these are the only countries that matter because that isn't true. But I am saying that the story of the changing world order since World War I can be pretty well told by understanding the main developments within and between these countries. In this chapter I will attempt to briefly tell the stories of these countries and their most important interactions. This is the highlights version of the more complete version of the stories that I will pass to you in Part 2 of this book.** 

## **In telling these stories I will try to convey them without bias.** I believe that to accurately understand both history and what is happening now, I need to see things through the relevant parties' eyes, including those of enemies. *While there are of course allies and enemies and it is tempting to demonize the enemies, most people and countries are simply pursuing their own interests in the ways they believe are best for them, so I find it productive to try to see things through their eyes and counterproductive to demonize them.* **If you hear me say things that sound sympathetic to former or existing enemies—like "Hitler built a strong economy before going to war"—please**

**know that it is because I am seeking accuracy and need to be truthful rather than politically correct in conveying my thinking.** While I might be wrong and we might not agree, that's all OK with me as long as I am describing the picture as accurately as I can.

**Before I begin recounting the story of the United States I'd like to remind you of the archetypical Big Cycle that I described earlier so you can keep it in mind as you read about how events transpired up to the present. Though a super-oversimplification of the whole thing, in a nutshell it appears to me that the archetypical Big Cycle transpires as follows.** 

**A new world order typically begins after radical changes in how things work within countries (i.e., via some form of revolution) and between countries (typically some form of war). They change in big ways who has wealth and power and the approaches used to get wealth and power. For example in 1945, when the latest world order began, the US and its capitalist and democratic allies squared off against the communist and autocratic approaches of the Soviet Union and its allies. As we saw from studying the Dutch and British empires, capitalism was key to these countries' successes but also contributed to their failures. It was successful because the pursuit of profit motivated people, and the competitive process of allocating capital and profit making directed resources relatively efficiently to what people wanted enough to pay for. In this system those who allocated efficiently profited, which led to them gaining more resources, while those who couldn't allocate well died economically.** 

**At the same time, this system of increasing wealth produced widening wealth and opportunity gaps, as well as decadence in the form of people working less and increasingly living on borrowed money. As the wealth and opportunity gaps grew, that produced increasingly widespread views that the system wasn't fair. When the debt problems and other factors led to bad economic times at the same time as the wealth and values gaps were large, that produced a lot of internal conflict that led to large, revolutionary changes in who had wealth and power and the processes for getting them. Sometimes these big changes were made peacefully, and sometimes they were made violently. When the leading countries suffered from these internal challenges at the same time as rival countries had become strong enough to challenge them, the risks of external wars increased. When these seismic shifts in how wealth and power are distributed occur within countries (i.e., via revolutions) or between countries (typically through wars, though sometimes peacefully), the old world order breaks down and a new world order begins, and the process starts all over again.** 

**The Typical Big Cycle Behind Empires' Rises and Declines**

# To refresh your memory, the chart below shows the relative powers of the leading countries as measured in indices that measure eight different types of power—education, competitiveness, innovation/technology, trade, economic

output, military, financial center status, and reserve currency status. In examining each country's rise and decline I look at each of the eight measures and convey the highlights of their stories while diving into key moments to understand how they transpired in a more granular way. We will now do that with the United States and China, which as you can see in this chart are currently the leading powers.

#### **The US Empire and the US Dollar**

While this section primarily focuses on the story of the US since it overtook the British Empire as the dominant global power during the world wars, we will first take a quick look at the whole arc of its rise and its somewhat recent relative decline. The chart below shows the eight types of power that make up our overall measure of power. **In it you can see the story behind the US's rise and decline since 1700. We start in 1700 because that was just before the emergence of the United States. While the area now occupied by the United States was of course inhabited by native people for thousands of years, the history of the United States as a nation begins with the colonists, who revolted against the colonial power of Great Britain to gain independence in 1776.** In the chart you can see the seeds of the US's rise going back to the early 1800s, starting with rising strengths in education and then in innovation/technology and competitiveness. These powers and world circumstances allowed the US to create massive productivity growth during the Second Industrial Revolution, which was from around 1870 to the beginning of World War I and then beyond it. These increased strengths were reflected in the US's increasing shares of global economic output and world trade, as well as growing its financial strength, exemplified in New York becoming the world's leading financial center, continuing leadership in innovations, and great usage of its financial products. You can see that these measures of the United States' powers relative to its own history reached their peaks in the 1950s immediately after the Allies won World War II. At that time, the gap between the US and the rest of the world was at its greatest and the US dollar and the US world order became dominant. Though the United States was clearly the dominant power in the post-World War II period, the Soviet Empire was a rival, though it was never nearly as strong overall. The Soviets and their communist satellite states vied against the much stronger US and US allies and satellite states until Soviet power began to fade under the weight of its growing inefficiency around 1980 and then collapsed in 1989-91. That is about when China began to rise to become a comparable rival power to the US where it is today.

#### **Rough Estimates of Relative Standing of Great Empires**

**As you can see, while the United States' relative strengths of education, competitiveness, trade, and production have declined significantly and steadily over the last 100 years (to now be around the 50-60th percentile versus other leading powers), its relative strength in innovation and technology, reserve currency status, financial center power, and military have remained at or near the top. At the same time, as we will see when we delve into China's picture, China has gained on the US in all these areas, has become comparable in many ways, and is advancing considerably faster than the US.** 

Let's now drop down from the 40,000-foot level to the 20,000-foot level and pick up our story in 1930 so we can see how the United States evolved to become the dominant world power. While we focus predominantly on the US story, the linkages between economic conditions and political conditions within the United States and between the United States and other countries—most importantly with the UK, Germany, and Japan in the 1930s, with the Soviet Union and Japan from around 1950 until 1990, and with China from around 1980 until now—must be understood because economics and geopolitics within and between countries were and always are intertwined.

### **1930 to 1939/41: The Economic War**

As a principle:

*Before there is a shooting war there is usually an economic war.* 

And:

*Severe economic downturns with large wealth gaps, large debts, and ineffective monetary policies make a* 

*combustible combination that typically leads to significant conflicts and revolutionary changes within countries.* 

And:

*During periods of great conflict there is a strong tendency to move to more autocratic leadership to bring order to the chaos.* 

**In 1929 the Roaring '20s bubble burst and the global depression followed. It led to virtually all countries having significant internal conflicts over wealth that led them to turn to more populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders and policies. These moves were either to the right or to the left and occurred in varying degrees. The extremities of these degrees varied by country, according to their circumstances and the lengths and depths of their democratic or autocratic traditions. In Germany, Japan, Italy, and Spain, their extremely bad circumstances and their less well-established democratic traditions led to extreme internal conflicts and a turn** 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_4_Figure_0.jpeg)

**to populist-autocratic leaders of the right (i.e., fascists), just as at different points in time the leaders of the Soviet Union and China, which also endured extreme circumstances and had no experience with democracy, became populist, autocratic leaders of the left (i.e., communists). The US and the UK had less severe conditions and much stronger democratic traditions, so they became more populist and autocratic than they were, but not nearly as extreme as other nations.** 

**In addition to these economically motivated conflicts within countries and the political shifts that arose from them, all of these countries faced increased external economic conflicts as they fought for greater shares of a shrinking economic pie. Because power rather than law rules international relations, there was a sequence of intensifying tests of power that led to war and then to peace and the new world order in 1945.** 

To help to convey the picture in the 1930s, I will quickly run though some geopolitical highlights of what happened from 1930 until the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Then I will quickly move through the war and come to 1945 when the new world order began. I will then look at where this world order has brought us up until now. While these stories are interesting in and of themselves, they are most important to understand because of the lessons they provide for thinking about what is now happening and what's ahead.

Because the United States and China are now in an economic war that could conceivably evolve into a shooting

war, and I've never experienced an economic war, I studied a number of past ones to learn what they are like. That taught me a bit about economic warfare, helped me better understand what is happening now, and made me aware of possibilities that I hadn't previously considered. Comparisons between the 1930s leading to World War II and today, especially with regard to economic sanctions, are especially interesting and helpful in considering what might be ahead. For that reason, I delve into the story of this period in a bit more detail than you might care to read. If you find that to be the case, just read the bold for the highlights.

**The economic wars started about 10 years before the hot wars. The Great Depression brought economic suffering to virtually all nations, which led to fighting over wealth within and between countries that led to the hot wars that began a decade later.** 

In 1929 gold (and to a lesser extent silver) was money, and paper money represented a promise to deliver it (there was a Type 2 monetary system in the world, as explained in Chapter 2). In the Roaring '20s a lot of debt (promises to deliver paper money that was convertible to gold) was created to buy speculative assets (particularly stocks). **When the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy in 1929 to curtail the speculation, the bubble burst and the global Great Depression began.**

The debt problems in the US were ruinous for American banks, which curtailed their lending around the world, hurting international borrowers. At the same time the depression created weak demand, which led to the collapse in US imports and other countries' sales to the US. As their incomes weakened their demand fell and more credit problems occurred in a self-reinforcing downward economic spiral. At the same time the US turned protectionist to safeguard jobs, so it raised tariffs (via the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act) in 1930, which further depressed economic conditions in other countries.

*Turning protectionist and raising tariffs to protect domestic businesses and jobs during periods of economic bad times is common. It leads to reduced efficiency because production does not occur where it can be done most efficiently, and it typically contributes to greater global economic weakness as raising tariffs usually leads to tariff wars that typically cause the country that raised tariffs to lose exports too. It does however benefit those entities protected by the tariffs and can create political support for the leader who is imposing the tariffs.* 

**When the Great Depression began, Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union, and China were already suffering.** Germany struggled under the burdens of its World War I debt and the occupation of the Rhineland by foreign forces. Japan suffered a classic big debt crisis in 1927 that was followed by a severe depression in 1930-31 and then a classic massive currency devaluation, fiscal stimulation, and debt monetization that pretty much wiped out financial wealth in Japan. The Soviet Union suffered from its 1917-22 revolution and the civil war, a lost war to Germany, a costly war with Poland, a famine in 1921, and political purges and economic hardships through the

#### 1930s. China suffered from civil war, poverty, and a famine in 1928-30. **So when things worsened in 1930, bad conditions became desperate conditions in these countries, which set in motion the economic and eventually military conflicts that followed.**

To make matters worse droughts in the US and in the Soviet Union soon followed. The drought/famine in the Soviet Union, in combination with extreme government policies, was so severe that it caused millions of deaths. *Harmful acts of nature (e.g., droughts, floods, and plagues) have often caused periods of great economic hardship that when combined with other adverse conditions have led to periods of great conflict.* Over the next several years in Russia internal political fighting and fears of Nazi Germany led to purges of hundreds of thousands of people who were accused of spying and shot without trials.

While Germany had previously been saddled with tremendous reparation debts following World War I, in 1929 it was beginning to emerge from under the yoke of these via the Young Plan, which provided for considerable debt relief and the departure of foreign troops from Germany by 1930. However, **the global depression hit Germany hard, leading to 25% unemployment, massive bankruptcies, and extensive poverty. As is typical, a battle between populists of the left (communists) and populists of the right (fascists) emerged.** Adolf Hitler, the leading populist-fascist, tapped into the mood of national humiliation to build a nationalist furor, casting as the enemy the World-War-I-ending Treaty of Versailles and the countries that imposed it. He created a nationalist program of 25 points that gave something to everyone and rallied support around it. **In response to internal fighting and a desire to restore order, Hitler was appointed chancellor in January 1933,** drawing large support for his Nazi Party from industrialists who feared the communists. Two months later, the Nazi Party won the most support and the most seats.

**In the United States in 1932 there was the presidential election that led to the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who many considered a populist of the left. Promptly after his inauguration, in March/April 1933, he defaulted on the promise to convert paper dollars into gold, provided money to all banks so depositors at those banks could get their money, ordered all gold in denominations of more than \$100 to be turned in for paper money at a rate of \$20.67 per ounce, and devalued the dollar in relation to other currencies. There were also big fiscal spending programs that led to large budget deficits and large debts that the Federal Reserve bought with money that it printed.** 

As a principle: *Deflationary depressions are debt crises caused by there not being enough money in the hands of debtors to service their debts. They inevitably lead to the printing of money, debt restructurings, and government spending programs that increase the supply of, and reduce the value of, money and credit. The only question is how long it takes for government officials to make this move.* 

**In the case of the Great Depression, it took from the October 1929 peak to Roosevelt's March 1933 action to make the move. From that point until the end of 1936—the year the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy and caused the recession of 1937-38—the stock market returned over 200%, and the economy grew at an average real rate of about 9%!** 

As a principle: *During periods of severe economic distress and large wealth gaps, there are typically revolutionarily* 

*large redistributions of wealth. When done peacefully these are achieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors' claims, and when done violently they are achieved by forced asset confiscations.*

**In Roosevelt's first 100 days in office he created a number of big government spending programs that were paid for by big tax increases and big budget deficits financed by debt that the Federal Reserve monetized.** He provided jobs programs, unemployment insurance, Social Security supports, and labor- and union-friendly programs. After his 1935 tax bill, then popularly called the "Soak the Rich Tax," the top marginal income tax rate for individuals rose to 75% (versus as low as 25% in 1930). By 1941, the top personal tax rate was 81%, and the top corporate tax rate was 31%, having started at 12% in 1930. He also imposed a number of other taxes. Despite all of these taxes and the pickup in the economy that helped to raise tax revenue, budget deficits increased from around 1% of GDP to about 4% of GDP because the spending increases were so large. Specific developments through the Great Depression are explained more completely in Chapter 2: "The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity" or in great detail in Part 2 of my book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*.

Meanwhile in Germany, Hitler continued to pursue nationalist policies, refusing to pay reparation debts to creditor countries. He also stepped out of the League of Nations and took autocratic control of the country in 1934. By holding the roles of both chancellor and president, he became Germany's supreme leader. *In democracies there are always some laws that allow countries' leaders to grab special powers.* **Hitler seized them all.** He invoked "Article 48" to put an end to many civil rights and suppress political opposition from the communists and forced the passage of the "Enabling Act," which allowed him to pass laws without the approval of the parliament and the president. He pursued the autocratic advancement of the "Aryan race" and was ruthless against any opposition e.g., he took control of or censored newspapers and broadcasting companies, created a secret police force (the Gestapo) to find and fight all opposition, deprived Jews of all rights of citizenship, and took control of the Protestant Church's finances and arrested church officials who opposed him. Declaring the Aryan race superior, he prohibited non-Aryans from serving in government.

**Hitler also took that same autocratic/fascist approach to building the economy, coupled with big fiscal and monetary stimulation programs.** To create a strong economy for Aryan Germans, Hitler quickly privatized stateowned businesses and encouraged corporate investment that was paid for by borrowing. He acted strongly in support of raising their living standards. For example, he set up Volkswagen to make cars affordable and accessible to most people, and he directed the building of the Autobahn. He financed this substantially increased government spending by forcing banks to buy government bonds. The debts that were produced were paid back by the earnings of companies and the central bank (the Reichsbank) monetizing debt. These policies by and large worked well. **This is another good example of how** *borrowing in one's own currency and increasing one's own debt and deficits can be highly productive if the money borrowed is put into investments that raise productivity that produces more than enough cash flow to service the debt and, even if it doesn't cover 100% of the debt service, it can be very costeffective in achieving the economic goals of the country.*

As for the economic effects of these policies, **when Hitler came to power in 1933 the unemployment rate was 25%. By 1938 it was nil. Per capita income between his coming to power and five years later in 1938 increased by 22% and real growth averaged over 8% per year between 1934 and 1938. Consistent with the rise in the growth, as shown in the below charts, German equities rallied nearly 70% in a steady trend between 1933 and 1938 until the onset of the hot war.**

#### **Also in 1935 he began to build the military,** making military service required and increasing Germany's military spending much faster than any other country because **the German economy needed more resources to fuel itself and needed to get these from other countries so it built and used its military power to help get them. One could argue that getting them militarily was more cost-effective than trying to produce goods to trade with others to earn income to buy what was needed.**

Like Germany, **Japan was also hit exceptionally hard by the depression and became more autocratic in response to it.** Japan was especially vulnerable to the depression because, as an island nation without adequate natural resources, it relied on exports for income to import necessities. When its exports fell by around 50% between 1929 and 1931, it was economically devastated. **In 1931, the depression in Japan was so severe that the country went broke**—i.e., it was forced to draw down its gold reserves, abandon the gold standard, and float its currency, which depreciated it so greatly that Japan ran out of buying power. **These terrible conditions and large wealth gaps led to fighting between the left and the right. In 1932 that led to a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism to forcefully restore order and bring back economic stability. To that end, Japan's military took control and pursued military options to get Japan the resources it needed by taking them away from other countries. Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and later expanded through China and Asia to obtain natural resources (e.g., oil, iron, coal, and rubber) and human resources (i.e., slave labor). As in the German case, it could be argued that this path of military aggression to get needed resources was the best path for the** 

**Japanese because relying on classic trading and economic practices wouldn't have gotten them what they needed.** 

*Shifting to more autocratic, populist, and nationalist leaders and policies during times of extreme economic stress is typical, as people want strong leadership to bring order to the chaos and to deal strongly with the outside enemy.* In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the rightwing, militaristic, nationalistic, and expansionistic movement.

**In the years that followed, this movement in Japan, like that in Germany, became increasingly strong with its top-down fascist command economy, building a military-industrial complex with the military mobilized to protect its existing bases in East Asia and northern China and its expansion into other territories. As was also the case in Germany, during this time, while most Japanese companies remained outside government ownership, their production was controlled by the government.** 

**What is fascism, and why was it adopted in countries like Germany and Japan? Consider the following three big choices that one has to make in order choose a country's approach to governance: a) bottom-up (democratic) or top-down (autocratic) decision-making, b) capitalist or communist (with socialist in the middle) ownership of production, and c) individualistic (which treats the well-being of the individual with paramount importance) or collectivist (which treats the well-being of the whole with paramount importance). Pick the one from each category that you believe works best for your nation's values and ambitions and you have your preferred approach. Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and collectivist. Fascists believed that top-down autocratic leadership, in which the government directs the production of privately held companies in a way that individual gratification is subordinated to national success, is the best way to make the country and its people wealthier and more powerful. The United States and Great Britain believed that the democratic, capitalist, and** 

**individualistic mix was better, while the Soviet Union believed that the autocratic, communist, and collectivist mix was best.** 

**In pursuing its capitalist approach, in 1936-37, the Federal Reserve tightened money and credit to fight inflation and slow an overheating economy, which caused the fragile US economy to go into recession and other major economies to weaken with it, further raising tensions within and between countries.** Meanwhile in Europe, the conflict in Spain between the populists of the left (the communists) and the populists of the right (the fascists) flared up into the brutal Spanish Civil War. Franco of the right, with the support of Hitler, purged all left-wing organizations in Spain. In November 1937, Hitler held a secret meeting with his top officials to announce his plans for German expansion in Europe to gain resources and bring together the Aryan race. **Hitler then put his plans for expansion into action, first annexing Austria and then seizing a part of Czechoslovakia that contained oil resources. Europe and the US watched warily, not wanting to get drawn into another war so soon after the**  **devastation of World War I. Then on September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland. That is when England and France declared war on Germany, which is why that is the date that marks the beginning of World War II in Europe.** 

**In the Pacific in 1937 Japan spread its occupation of China, brutally taking control of Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nanking alone.** While the US remained isolationist, it did provide China's Chiang Kai-shek government with fighter planes and pilots to fight the Japanese, thus putting a toe in the war, and conflicts between the US and Japan began to flare when a Japanese soldier struck the US consul in Nanking and Japanese fighter planes sank a US gunship anchored nearby.

**The US remained reluctant to enter the wars in Europe and Asia.** In fact, in November 1940, Roosevelt was reelected for a third term by promising to keep the US out of the war, even though the US was already taking action to protect its interests, especially in the Pacific. Still the US began using economic supports for countries it sympathized with and economic sanctions against those it did not—e.g., earlier in 1940, US Secretary of War Henry Stimson initiated aggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of 1940. **In mid-1940 the US moved the US Pacific Fleet to Hawaii. In October, the US ramped up the embargo, restricting "all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere."74 The plan was to cut off the resources needed by Japan in order to strangle them into submission and force a retreat from most of the areas they had taken over.**

**While in March 1941 the US still wanted to avoid the war, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act, which allowed it to lend or lease war supplies to nations that it deemed to be acting in ways that were "vital to the defense of the United States," which included Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and China.** This was good for the US both geopolitically and economically because the US made a lot of money selling weapons, food, and other items to countries that the US favored in the war. These soon-to-be allied countries were having problems producing them while waging war, and they (most significantly Great Britain) ran out of money (i.e., gold) so the US decided to be more supportive and postpone payment until after the war (and in some cases avoiding payment entirely). **The Lend-Lease policy, although not an outright declaration of war, ended the United States' neutrality.**

**As a principle,** *when countries are weak, opposing countries take advantage of their weaknesses to obtain gains.* At the time, European Allied countries (France, Netherlands, Great Britain) had colonies in Asia and were overstretched fighting the war in Europe so they were unable to defend these colonies from Japanese takeovers. **Beginning in September 1940, to obtain more resources and take advantage of the European preoccupation with the war on their own continent, Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia,** starting with French Indochina. In 1941, Japan extended its reach by seizing oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies to add the "Southern Resource Zone" to its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Southern Resource Zone was a collection of mostly European colonies in Southeast Asia whose conquest would afford Japan access to key natural resources (most importantly oil, rubber, and rice). The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was a bloc of Asian countries controlled by Japan. The German and Japanese fascist governments were on a roll.

**At the same time this Japanese territorial expansion was a threat the US's own Pacific ambitions and continued to heighten tensions with Japan. In July and August 1941 Roosevelt responded by ordering the freezing of all** 

**Japanese assets in the United States, closing Japan's ability to ship through the Panama Canal, and embargoing all oil and gas exports to Japan.** This cut off three-fourths of its trade and 80% of its oil. Japan calculated that it would be out of oil in two years. **This put Japan in the position of having to choose between backing down and attacking the US.** 

As with all wars *the unknowns about what will happen in a war are far greater than the knowns a) because rival powers go into wars only when their powers are roughly comparable (because otherwise it would be stupidly suicidal for the obviously weaker power to go to war) and b) because there are way too many possible actions and reactions to anticipate. The only thing that is known at the outset of war is that it will probably be extremely painful and possibly* 

<sup>74</sup> As quoted in Harry Elmer Barnes, *Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace: A Critical Examination of the Foreign Policy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt And Its Aftermath*, 1953.

#### *ruinous. As a result, smart leaders typically only go into hot wars if there is no choice because the other side pushes them into the position of either fighting or losing by backing down.* **That is how World War II began.**

**On December 7 and 8, 1941, Japan launched coordinated attacks on US military forces in the Philippines and at Pearl Harbor. That marked the beginning of World War II in the Pacific which brought the US into the war in Europe too.** 

While Japan didn't have a widely recognized plan to win the war, it appears that those Japanese leaders who were optimistic planned to destroy the US Pacific Fleet and believed that the US would lose because it was fighting a war on two fronts (Europe and Asia) and because its individualistic/capitalist political system was inferior to Japan's and Germany's authoritarian, fascist systems and their command military-industrial complexes. They also believed that they had the greater willingness to endure pain and die for their country, which is a big driver of which side wins.

#### **Before going on to describe the hot war known as World War II I want to reiterate the most common economic warfare techniques. They have been and still are:**

- 1) **Asset Freezes/Seizures:** Preventing an enemy/rival from using or selling foreign assets they rely on.
	- These measures can range from asset freezes for targeted groups in a country (e.g., the current US sanctions of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard or the initial US asset freeze against Japan in World War II) to more severe measures like unilateral debt repudiation or outright seizures of a country's assets (some top US policy makers are now talking about not paying our debts to China).
- 2) **Blocking Capital Market Access:** Preventing a country from accessing their own or another country's capital markets (e.g., in 1887 Germany banned the purchase of Russian securities and debt to impede Russia's military buildup, the US now issuing threats of doing this to China).
- 3) **Embargoes/Blockades:** Blocking trade in goods and/or services either in one's own country, or in some cases with neutral third parties, for the purpose of weakening the targeted country or preventing it from getting essential items (e.g., the US oil embargo of Japan and cutting off its ability to ship through the Panama Canal) or blocking exports from the targeted country to other countries thus cutting off their income (e.g., France's blockade of the UK in the Napoleonic Wars).

If you're interested in seeing some of the specifics and variations that have taken place in these from 1600 until now, they are set out in a table in Appendix I.

#### **1939/41 to 1945: The Hot War**

In 1940, after the war began in Europe and prior to the US entering, Germany, like Japan, looked unstoppable; it captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, and formed a stronger alliance with Japan and Italy, who had common enemies and were ideologically aligned. By seizing territory rapidly, Hitler's army was able to conserve oil and gain resources quickly (e.g., it gained access to oil by annexing Romania). Its roll seemed unstoppable. Its thirst for, and acquisition of, natural resources remained a major driver of the Nazi war machine pushing its campaigns into Russia and the Middle East. The war with the communist Soviet power was inevitable as Germany's conquests in Western Europe put these two big and ideologically opposed powers on a collision course. The only question was when. While the Soviet Union and Germany had signed a non-aggression pact to postpone it, the Soviet Union invaded several Eastern European states, including the Baltic states, and took control of them. Germany invaded Russia in June 1941, which put Germany in an extremely costly war for both the Western European and Russian/Soviet sides.

**When the US entered the European and Pacific wars after the attack on Pearl Harbor, classic wartime economic policies were put in place in most countries by leaders who became more autocratic and whose autocratic approaches were broadly supported by their populations in opposition to the evil enemy.** 

**Just as it is worth noting what classic economic war techniques are, it is worth noting what classic wartime economic policies within countries are.** *Classic wartime economic policies include government controls on just about everything as the country shifts resources from profit making to war making—e.g., the government determines a) what items are allowed to be produced, b) what items can be bought and sold in what amounts (rationing), c) what items can be imported and exported, d) prices, wages, and profits, e) access to one's own financial assets, and f) the ability to move one's money out of the country. Because wars are expensive classically g) the government issues lots of debt that is monetized, h) relies on non-credit money such as gold for international transactions because its credit is not accepted, i) governs more autocratically, j) imposes various types of economic sanctions on enemies including cutting off their access to capital, and k) experiences enemies imposing these sanctions on them.* 

The table below shows the economic controls that were put in place during the war years in each of the major countries.

The market movements during the hot war years were heavily affected by both government controls and how countries did in battles as the odds of wins and losses changed. The table below shows the controls over markets and capital flows that were put in place by country during the war years.

*Stock market closings in a number of countries were common, leaving investors in stocks stuck without access to their capital.* If you want to see these closures and how they transpired to understand the range of possibilities and the cause/effect relationships behind them, you can see a list of them in Appendix II.

**Because losing wars typically leads to a total wipeout of wealth and power, movements of those stock markets that remained open in the war years were largely driven by how countries did in key battles as these results shifted the probability of victory or defeat for each side.** For example, German equities outperformed at the beginning of WWII as Germany captured territory and established military dominance while they underperformed after Allied powers like the US and UK turned the tide of the war. After the 1942 Battle of Midway, Allied equities rallied almost continuously until the end of the war, while Axis equities were flat or down. As shown, both the German and Japanese stock markets were closed for the end of the war, didn't reopen for around five years, and were virtually wiped out, while US stocks were extremely strong.

**As a principle:** *Protecting one's wealth in times of war is difficult, as normal economic activities are curtailed, traditionally safe investments are not safe, capital mobility is limited, and high taxes are imposed when people and countries are fighting for their survival. During difficult times of conflict protecting the wealth of those who have wealth is not a priority relative to redistributing wealth to get it to where it is needed most.* 

#### **That was the case in those war years***.*

While we won't cover the actual battles and war moves, the headline is that **the Allied victory in 1945 produced a tremendous shift of wealth and power**.

World War II was an extremely costly war in lives and money. The numbers are gigantic and extremely imprecise. **An estimated 40-75 million people were killed as a result of it, which was 3% of the world's population, which made it the deadliest war yet.** More than half of these losses were Russian (around 25 million) and Chinese (around 20 million). Germany lost around 7 million people—just over half were military deaths and the rest were German civilian deaths, mostly from the Holocaust (and millions more non-Germans were also victims). Britain and the United States each lost around 400,000. The financial cost of the war was both enormous and inestimable, according to most experts, but, based on my research, was in the vicinity of \$4-7 trillion in current dollars. What we do know is that **on a relative basis the US came out a big winner because the US sold and lent a lot before and during the war, basically all of the fighting took place off of US territory so the US wasn't physically damaged, and US deaths were comparatively low in relation to those of most other major countries.**

In Part 2 of this chapter, we will explore the new world order starting with the US as the dominant power and tell the story that brings us right up to this moment. Then we will turn to China.

# **The Big Cycle of the United States and the Dollar, Part 2**

#### **The New World Order from 1945 until Now**

**As is typical after wars, World War II's winning powers—most importantly the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union (then called "the Big Three")—led meetings to create the new world order, which included carving up the world into geographic areas of control and establishing new money and credit systems.** While France, China, and a couple of other countries were technically aligned with these winning countries, they were lesser players. And with Germany, Japan, and Italy defeated and broken by the war, they were neither leading nor independent powers; they were subordinate to and aligned with the US. Britain, which was essentially bankrupt, was also aligned with the US. The Soviet Union was the leading rival power that was not aligned with the US, so it formed its own camp with its own allies. While there was relatively good cooperation between the two camps immediately after the war, **it didn't take long for the world to become divided between the US-led capitalist/democratic camp and the Soviet-controlled communist/autocratic camp, each with its own monetary/economic systems, though there were a small number of less significant countries that were non-aligned.** 

**The chart below shows the aggregate power indices for the US, UK, Russia, and China since the end of the war, which conveys this big picture.** 

**We will now delve into this story more closely.** 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **The Post-War Geopolitical and Military System**

**The three major powers and others got together in different conferences—the Yalta Conference, the Potsdam Conference, and the Bretton Woods Conference were the most notable—and carved up the world with UScontrolled capitalist/democratic countries on one side and Soviet-controlled communist/autocratic countries on the other, with each bloc having its own monetary systems. Germany was split into pieces, with the United States, Great Britain, and France having control of West Germany and Russia controlling East Germany. Japan was under US control, and China returned to a state of civil war between communists and the capitalists (i.e., the Nationalists). Unlike after World War I when the United States chose to be relatively isolationist, after World War II the United States took the primary leadership role in the world as it had most of the economic, geopolitical, and military power.** 

Geographically the US-led Western world extended east from the US through Western Europe into Germany, which was split into West Germany (which was controlled by the US and its allies) and East Germany along a line of division that became known as the Iron Curtain. East of that line, going through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Korea was Soviet-controlled. Korea, like Germany, was split with the Soviets controlling the north and the Americans controlling the south. China, which was essentially left weak and in civil war, got back Shanghai and other previously held areas within the mainland but was left without Hong Kong (though with an agreement from 1898 to get large portions of it back after 99 years) and Formosa (now Taiwan). China had an initially cooperative relationship with the Soviet Union that didn't last long. In the other direction, going west of the US into the Pacific, the US-controlled areas extended all the way to the southern half of Korea. The British Empire's areas of control or influence remained largely the same right at the end of the war, except for some minor additions. As for geopolitical institutions, the United Nations was created in 1945, and it was located in the US (New York), reflecting the US being the leading world power.

**Ideologically, the US-led world was capitalist and democratic while the Soviet-led world was communist and autocratic. The US-led monetary system for the US-led countries linked the dollar to gold and most other countries' currencies were tied to the dollar. This system was followed by over 40 countries.** Because the US had around two-thirds of the world's gold then and because the US was much more powerful economically and militarily than any other country, this monetary system has worked best and carried on until now. The Soviet Union and those countries that were brought into the Soviet Union's bloc were much less rich and were built on a much weaker foundation.

The split was clear from the outset. President Truman summarized it outlining what is now referred to as the "Truman Doctrine" in a March 1947 speech:

"At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one. One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression. The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and

the suppression of personal freedoms. I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."75

*Governance between countries is very different from governance within countries. That is because within countries there are laws and standards of behavior that govern, whereas between countries raw power matters most, and laws, rules, and even mutually agreed treaties and organizations for arbitration such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization don't matter much. Operating internationally is like operating in a jungle in which there is survival of the fittest and most anything goes. That is what makes having a strong military so important.*

**Military alliances were built along the same ideological and geopolitical lines.** In 1949 a military alliance of 12 countries (with more joining later) that were in the US camp formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and in 1954 the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization was established among the US, UK, Australia, France, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia. In 1955, a military alliance of seven countries that were in the Soviet camp formed the Warsaw Pact.

**As shown in the chart below the Americans and Soviets invested massively in building up their nuclear weapons and a number of other countries followed. These weapons were never used because of the deterrence of mutually assured destruction. Still there were a couple of times it came close (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962).** Today, in varying amounts and degrees of capabilities, 11 countries have nuclear weapons or are on the brink of having them. Having nuclear weapons obviously gives one a big negotiating chip in the world power game so it's understandable why some countries would want to have them and other countries would not want other countries to have them. Of course, in addition to building nuclear capabilities, various new other weapons systems were created, and though there were no nuclear wars, there were a number of wars to counter communism and other geopolitical US adversaries, most notably the Korean War in the 1950s, the Vietnam War in the 1960s, the two Gulf Wars in 1990 and 2003, and the War in Afghanistan from 2001 until now. These were costly in terms of money, lives, and public support for the United States. Were they worth it? That's for others to decide. For the Soviet Union, which had a much smaller and weaker economy than the US, spending enough to compete with the US militarily and to maintain its empire was bankrupting.

Of course military power consists of a lot more than nuclear weapons and a lot has changed since the Cold War. Where do things now stand? While I'm no military expert, I get to speak to some who have led me to believe that, while the US remains the strongest military power overall, it is not dominant in all parts of the world in all ways, and military challenges to it are rising. I'm told that there is a significant chance that the US would lose wars against China and Russia in their geographic areas of strength—or at least would be unacceptably harmed—and would also be unacceptably harmed by some second-tier powers. This is not the good ol' days early after the beginning of the post-1945 world order in which the US was clearly the sole dominant military power that could not be threatened by others. While there are a number of high-risk scenarios, the most worrying one is a forceful move by China to bring Taiwan under its control.

What would the next military conflict look like? It seems clear that new war technologies would be deployed so the war of the future will be very different from the last war in the same ways more recent wars were fought with different technologies than the ones before them. Classically the country that wins wars outspends, out-invests, and outlasts the opposition. *Because spending on the military takes government money away from spending on social programs, and because military technologies go hand in hand with private sector technologies, the biggest risk for the leading powers is that they lose the economic and technology races over time.*

#### **The Post-War Monetary and Economic Systems**

*Money and transactions between countries were and still are very different from money and transactions within countries. That is because within countries governments get to control the key aspects of money and transactions (such as what money is used, how much of it there is, what it costs, who handles it and how, etc.), whereas in transactions between countries the key aspects of money and transactions have to be mutually agreed-on.* **For example, within a country the government can mandate that only the paper money that it prints is acceptable, whereas between countries only the money that those who are transacting agree is acceptable will be acceptable. That is why gold and reserve currencies have been so important in transactions between countries while people within countries typically exchange this paper with others in the country, oblivious to the fact that that money is not much valued outside the country.**

**Within countries individuals were not allowed to own or transact in gold76 because governments wanted to be able to control the supply and value of people's money and the distributions of people's wealth.** People's abilities to own gold could threaten the system because gold is an alternative money that is not controlled by the government that people could use instead of the government's money. So (to simplify a bit) within countries people or companies would use the government-controlled paper money and when they wanted to buy something from another country they would typically exchange their own paper currency for the sellers' paper currency with the help of their central bank and the central bank would settle up with the other central bank in gold. Or, if they were American, they would typically pay in dollars and the seller would turn that money in to its country's central bank for its local currency and that central bank would turn its surplus of dollars in for gold, so gold would leave the US central bank reserve account and go into the other central bank account. As a result, a central bank's gold reserve savings would go down if a country spent more than it earned and would go up if a country earned more than it spent.

**As for the particular new post-war monetary and economic systems, there was one for the US-led camp and one for the Soviet-led camp,** though there were also some non-aligned countries that had their own non-aligned currencies that were not widely accepted. Those countries in the US camp—which consisted of 44 countries gathered in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944 to make a monetary system that put the dollar and gold at the center of it. The Soviet Union created its own monetary system built around its currency, the ruble. It was a much less significant monetary system.

**The Bretton Woods Agreement put the dollar in the position of being the world's leading reserve currency. This was natural because the two world wars made the US the richest and most powerful country by far. It earned this money via its large exports, and by the end of World War II it had amassed the greatest gold/money savings ever. That savings accounted for around two-thirds of the world's government-held gold/money and was equivalent to eight years of import purchases. Even after the war, it continued to earn a lot of money by continuing to export a lot. In other words, the US was very rich.** 

**By comparison, other countries were broke, which made it difficult to buy what they needed from the US and other countries.** Besides not having any money Europe and Japan had virtually nothing to sell after the war because their economies were destroyed. **As a solution, and to fight the spread of communism, the US offered massive aid packages to Western Europe and Japan (known as the Marshall and Dodge plans) which were a) good for these devastated nations, b) good for the US economically because these countries used the money to buy US goods, c) good for the US's geopolitical influence abroad, and d) good for reinforcing the dollar's position as the world's dominant reserve currency because they increased its usage. All leading central banks in history have followed variations on this process. Most recently China's Belt and Road Initiative has offered similar advantages to China.**

As for monetary policy, from 1933 until 1951 the amount of money, the cost of money (i.e., interest rates), and where that money went was controlled by the Federal Reserve to serve the greater objectives of the country rather

<sup>76</sup> For example, Americans were by and large not allowed to own gold from 1933 to 1974.

than to let the free market allocate money and credit.77 More specifically it printed a lot of money to buy debt, capped interest rates that lenders could charge, and controlled what money was allowed to go into, so high inflation did not drive interest rates to unacceptable heights and there were no investment options more attractive than the debt the government wanted people to save in.

**Following a brief post-war recession that was due to the government's war spending declining, the US entered a prolonged period of peace and prosperity because the new and mutually reinforcing Big Cycles transpired. Most importantly a new debt cycle began with the new monetary system, wealth and values gaps were reduced so the environment was one of greater unity in pursuit of peace and prosperity, and there was a dominant power that nobody wanted to fight. Also, stock prices were very cheap. As a result, the US economy and markets were very strong for many years to come.** 

During the post-war adjustment period between mid-1945 and mid-1947 over 20 million people were released from the armed forces and related employment so unemployment rate rose from 1.9% to just 3.9%.78 At the same time pent-up demand and savings to finance that demand had built up so the removal of rationing laws, which had limited people's ability to buy consumer goods, fueled a consumer spending surge. Cheap mortgages were also available for veterans, which led to a housing boom that fueled the expansion. There was a return to profit making activities, which raised the demand for labor so employment was very strong. Exports were strong because the US government (via the Marshall and Dodge plans) helped build the market for US goods abroad to be strong. Also the US private sector went global and invested abroad from 1945 through the 1970s. That environment was great for business, profits, and stocks because American corporations were extremely profitable after the war at the same time that stocks were very cheap in relation to bonds (e.g., stock earnings and dividend yields were a lot higher than bond yields). Stocks were cheap because those who went through the depression and war years were very risk-averse, so they significantly preferred a safe income stream to a risky one. This set of conditions made a multi-decade prosperity and bull market in stocks that reinforced New York's dominance as the world's financial center, bringing in more investment and further strengthening the dollar as a reserve currency.

This peace and prosperity also provided the funds to improve education, invent fabulous technologies (e.g., go to the moon), and do a lot more. In other words, post-war the United States was in one of those great mutually and self-reinforcing Big Cycle upswings. It was popularly believed in the mid-1960s that economics was a science so we could expect economic prosperity and the stock market always went up with wiggles around the uptrend so one should make "dollar cost average" purchases—i.e., buy consistently so that one would buy on the dips as well as the highs. Because of that confident psychology, which was the opposite of the conservative psychology that existed in the 1950s, the stock market hit its high in 1966, which marked the end of the good times for 16 years, until the 1982 stock market bottom, though nobody knew it at the time because the mood was one of great optimism and the decline from the market top looked like one of those dips that one should buy into.

It was during the 1960s that my own direct contact with events began. I started investing in 1961 at age 12. Of course I didn't know what I was doing at the time and had no appreciation for how lucky my contemporaries and I were. I was born at the right time (just after the war at the beginning of a post-war Big Cycle upswing brought about by the early upswing in the long-term debt cycle and a dominant world power that produced decades of peace, prosperity, and bull markets) in the right place (in the United States, which was the most prosperous and powerful country in the world). I was also very lucky to be raised by parents who loved and cared for me in an era when the American Dream of equal opportunity allowed me to get a good public school education and come out into a job market that gave me equal and excellent opportunity at an exciting time of idealism and dreaming big that inspired me. I vividly remember John Kennedy, a charismatic leader who inspired the nation to journey to the

<sup>78</sup> https://www.mercatus.org/publications/economic-history/economic-recovery-lessons-post-world-war-ii-period

<sup>77</sup> While 1933 to 1951 was the period from the Roosevelt peg break to the Monetary Accord between the Federal Reserve and Treasury, the policy of explicit yield curve control, in which the Federal Reserve controlled the spread between short-term and long-term interest rates, lasted from 1942 to 1947.

moon and to fight to eliminate poverty and assure civil rights.79 One could dream big, work hard, and make those dreams happen, and successful people were role models then. In the 1960s it was great to be middle class. The United States was the leading manufacturing country so labor was valuable. Most adults could get a good job, and their kids could get a collage education and rise without limitation. Since the majority of people were middle class the majority of people were happy.

Throughout the prosperous 1960s, the US did the classic things that helped the world to become more dollarized. For example, US banks rapidly increased their operations and lending in foreign markets. In 1965, only 13 US banks had foreign branches. By 1970, 79 banks had them, and by 1980 nearly every major US bank had at least one foreign branch, and the total number of branches had grown to 787.80 Global lending of dollars by American banks boomed. However, as is typical, a) those that prospered overdid things by operating financially imprudently while b) global competition, especially from Germany and Japan, increased. As a result, the lending and the finances of Americans began to deteriorate at the same time as its trade surpluses disappeared.

# **The Late-1960s Weakening Fundamentals That Led to the End of the Bretton Woods Monetary System**

As explained in Chapter 2, when claims on hard money (i.e., notes or paper money) are introduced, at first there is the same number of claims on the "hard money" as there is hard money in the bank. However, the holders of the paper claims and the banks soon discover the wonders of credit and debt. They can lend these paper claims to the bank in exchange for an interest payment so they get interest. The banks that borrow it from them like it because they lend the money to others, who pay a higher interest rate so the banks make a profit. Those who borrow the money from the bank like it because it gives them buying power that they didn't have. And the whole society likes it because asset prices and production rise.

After 1945, foreign central banks had the option of holding interest-rate-paying debt or holding non-interest-rateearning gold. Because dollar-denominated debt was considered as good as gold, convertible into gold, and higherearning because it provided interest (which gold didn't provide), central banks shrank their gold holdings relative to their dollar-denominated debt holdings from 1945 until 1971. As explained in the Appendix to Chapter 2, "The Changing Value of Money," investors making such a move is a classic behavior and ends when a) the claims on the real money (i.e., gold) substantially exceed the amount of real money in the bank and b) one can see that the amount of real money in the bank (i.e., gold reserves) is going down. That is when no interest rate can be high enough for it to make sense to hold the debt (i.e., claims on the real money) rather than to turn one's paper money in for gold. At that time a run on the bank occurs and a default and debt restructuring have to happen. That is what led to the breakdown of the gold-linked Bretton Woods monetary system.

While the following summary repeats some of what was said in prior chapters, it is appropriate to recall it here.

As is typical of this peaceful and prosperous part of the cycle, **in the 1950-70 period there was productive debt growth and equity market developments that were essential for financing innovation and development early on and became overdone later. In the 1960s Americans spent a lot on consumption and Germany and Japan, which had largely recovered from the war, were increasingly effective competitors in producing manufactured goods such as cars so US trade balances were worsening. At the same time, the US government was spending increasing amounts on fighting the Vietnam War and domestic social programs (called "guns and butter").** To finance all this spending, **the US Federal Reserve allowed the creation of a lot more claims on gold than could actually be converted into gold at the set \$35 price.** As the paper money was turned in for the hard money (gold), **the quantity of gold in the US central bank went down at the same time as the claims on it continued to rise. As** 

<sup>80</sup> https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/1999/0999lead.pdf

<sup>79</sup> While I subsequently discovered that the equal opportunity I was afforded wasn't made available to a lot of people, I learned from all the people around me—so it was a common belief for all of those I knew—that it should be made available to all people regardless of race, creed, color, or gender so programs like the Civil Rights Movement and the War on Poverty were aimed at providing it. Unlike my earlier descriptions of earlier times that were solely based on my research, my descriptions of the post-1960s period comes with vivid memories of what I had contact with.

**a result, the Bretton Woods monetary system broke down on August 15, 1971, when President Nixon, like President Franklin Roosevelt on March 5, 1933, broke the US's pledge to allow holders of paper dollars to turn them in for gold. As shown in the below charts, as the US was spending more than it was earning and the paper money claims on gold were turned in for gold, US gold reserves went down until the US government realized that they would run out and stopped allowing the conversion at which time the dollar plunged in value relative to gold and the two leading alternative currencies, which were the German deutschmark and the Japanese yen.** 

As I recounted in Chapter 2, **I remember the devaluation of the dollar very well. I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time.** I was watching on TV as President Nixon told the world that the dollar would no longer be tied to gold. I thought, "Oh my God, the monetary system as we know it is ending," and it was. The next day was Monday. When I got to work I expected there to be pandemonium, with stocks falling. There was pandemonium all right, but stocks were rising. Because I had never seen a devaluation before, I didn't understand how they worked. Then I looked into history and found that on the evening of March 5, 1933, also a Sunday, President Franklin Roosevelt had given essentially the same speech, doing essentially the same thing, which yielded essentially the same result over the following months (a devaluation, a big stock market rally, and big gains in the gold price). As I looked further, I saw that it had happened many times before in many countries for the same reason—**too much debt that needed money to ease the debt burden**—with essentially the same proclamations by top government officials. More recent cases that you might remember include the Fed announcing QE on November 25, 2008, which followed Congress approving Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's request for the federal government to provide \$700 billion for asset purchases; Mario Draghi in July 2012 stating that the ECB would "do whatever it takes," which was followed by massive printing of money and buying of government debt; and March 15, 2020, when President Trump and leaders of both houses of Congress agreed on an over \$2 trillion stimulus plan, and Fed Chair Powell announced big interest rate cuts to 0%, a \$700 billion QE plan, and a slew of other supports, with both announcements followed by other big increases in these numbers.

### **The Inflationary and Troubled 1970s**

**After the 1971 delinking of the dollar and other currencies from gold, the world moved to an unanchored fiat (Type 3) monetary system and the dollar fell in value against gold, other currencies, stocks, and eventually just about everything. The new monetary system was negotiated by the leading economic policy makers of the United States, Germany, and Japan.** If you want to read a great description of this process of figuring out how to go from the old monetary system to the new fiat one, I recommend *Changing Fortunes* by Paul Volcker and Toyoo Gyohten. Volcker was the leading American policy maker to determine how the new post-Bretton Woods monetary system would work. **He was the person who knew more about monetary systems and was more at the center of the US dollar system from before the 1971 monetary breakdown (he was the Undersecretary of International Monetary Affairs under Nixon when Nixon severed the link with gold) through the 1970s inflation that resulted from its breakdown. He was eventually called on to break the back of inflation as head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 until 1987. He did more to shape and guide the dollar-based monetary system before, during, and after these years than any other person. I was lucky enough to have gotten to know him well so I can** 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_21_Figure_1.jpeg)

**personally attest to the fact that he was a person of great character, capabilities, influence, and humility—a classic hero/role model in a world that lacks hero/role models, especially in economic public service. I believe that he and his thinking deserve to be studied more.** 

**As a result of going off the gold-linked monetary system that constrained money and credit growth, there was a massive acceleration of money and credit, inflation, oil and commodity prices, and a panic out of bonds and other debt assets that drove interest rates up and caused a run into hard assets like real estate, gold, and collectibles for most of the next 10 years, from 1971 to 1981.** 

**I remember inflation psychology very well; it led Americans to borrow money and immediately take their pay checks to buy things to "get ahead of inflation."** The panic out of dollar debt also led interest rates to rise and drove the gold price from the \$35 that it was fixed at in 1944 and officially stayed at until 1971 to a then-peak of \$850 in 1980. **I remember inflation becoming the biggest political problem, which led President Nixon to create controls on prices and wages, which created great economic distortions that, along with Vietnam and Watergate, brought him down. Then President Ford passed around buttons that said "WIN," which stood for "Whip Inflation Now." I remember President Carter facing even worse inflation problems, and he brought Volcker back as head of the Fed to break the back of inflation. Volcker was effective, but it cost Carter his presidency. I saw up close how the loose money and credit policies of the 1970s led to** dollar-denominated debt being liberally lent by banks to borrowers around the world, especially to those in fast-growing, commodityproducing emerging countries, and I saw how the world was in the bubble phase of the debt cycle in the late 1970s. **I saw how the panic out of dollars and dollar-debt assets and into inflation-hedge assets, as well as the rapid borrowing of dollars, risked leading dollars and dollar debt to cease being an accepted storehold of wealth.**

While most people didn't understand how the money and credit dynamic worked, they felt the pain of it in the form of high inflation and high interest rates, so it was a chronic political issue. At the same time, in the 1970s there was a lot of pain, conflict, and rebellion due to the war in Vietnam, oil embargoes that led to high gas prices and gas rationing, labor union fights with companies over wages and benefits, Watergate and the Nixon impeachment, etc. **At the time, it was also widely believed that the labor unions were out of control with their demands for more pay and less work and needed to be controlled, so liberalism was losing popularity and conservatism was gaining popularity.** These problems peaked in the late 1970s as inflation spiked and 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days at the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran. Americans felt that the country was falling apart and lacked strong leadership. At the same time economic conditions in communist countries were even worse.

**In China, Mao Zedong's death in 1976 led Deng Xiaoping to come to power in 1978, which led to a shift in economic policies that included capitalist elements like private ownership of businesses, the development of debt and equities markets, entrepreneurial technological and commercial innovations, and even the flourishing of billionaire capitalists—all under the strict control of the Communist Party. This shift in Chinese leadership and approaches, while seemingly insignificant at the time, was going to germinate into the biggest single force to shape the 21st century.** 

### **The 1979-82 Move to Tight Money and Conservatism**

President Carter, who like most political leaders didn't understand the monetary mechanics very well, knew that something had to be done to stop inflation and appointed a strong monetary policy maker, Paul Volcker, as head of the Federal Reserve in August 1979. In October 1979, **Volcker announced that he would constrain money (M1) growth at 5.5%. I ran the numbers, which led me to figure that, if he really did what he said he was going to do, there would be a great shortage of money that would send interest rates through the roof and would bankrupt debtors who could not get the credit they needed and would drive up their debt-service expenses to levels that they couldn't afford to pay. While it was unimaginable that he would do that, Volcker stuck to that plan despite great political backlash and drove interest rates to the highest level "since Jesus Christ," according to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.** 

**In the 1980 presidential election Jimmy Carter, who was perceived as a nice but weak liberal Democrat, was voted out and Ronald Reagan, who was perceived as a homebody conservative whom Americans expected would**  **be stronger and impose disciplines where they were needed, was elected. Leading countries at the time (reflected in the G7 that consisted of the US, UK, Germany, Japan, France, Italy, and Canada—which reflects how different the world power balance was 40 years ago versus today) made analogous moves in electing conservatives to bring discipline to their inflationary chaos. On January 20, 1981, the same day Reagan was inaugurated as president, the Iranians released the hostages. Early in their terms, both Reagan in the US and Margaret Thatcher in the UK had landmark fights with labor unions.** 

*Economics and politics have swings between the left and the right in varying extremes as the excesses of each become intolerable and the memories of the problems of the other fade.* **It's like fashion—the width of ties and the lengths of skirts. When there is great popularity of one extreme, one should expect that it won't be too long before there will be a comparable move in the opposite direction.** 

**The move to monetary tightness broke the backs of debtors and curtailed borrowing, which drove the world economy into its worst downturn since the Great Depression. In seeing the stock market, the economy, and the prices of inflation-hedge assets plunging, the Federal Reserve slowly started to cut interest rates, but the markets continued to decline. Then Mexico defaulted on its debt in August 1982. Interestingly, on the day that Mexico defaulted on its debt (August 23, 1982), the US stock market rallied, which was a straw in the wind that I missed.** 

**What happened next created another jarringly painful learning experience for me. While I was able to anticipate the debt crisis, which was profitable for me, it also led me to realize that the banks that had lent that money wouldn't get paid, which led me a) to anticipate a debt-default-triggered depression that never came, b) to lose a lot of money betting on it, and c) to be very publicly wrong. As a result of my personal losses and losses of clients, I had to let everyone in my fledgling Bridgewater Associates go and was so broke I had to borrow \$4,000 from my dad to help pay for my family's bills. At the same time this painful experience was one of the best things that ever happened to me because it changed my whole approach to decision making. It gave me the fear of being wrong and the humility I needed to balance with my audacity without killing my audacity. It led me to make Bridgewater as an idea meritocracy in which I brought in the smartest independent thinkers I could find to argue with me, which resulted in our doing great over the next 40+ years. I still carry that fear of being wrong, which is why I am doing this research, why I want the greatest thinkers in the world to challenge my thinking and to stress test it, and why I am passing this research to you for you to take or leave as you see fit.** 

Why was I wrong in 1982, and what did I learn that would be an important principle for the future? What I had missed and learned from this experience was that **when debts are in the currencies that central banks have the ability to print and restructure, debt crises can be well-managed, so they are not systemically threatening**. Because the Federal Reserve could provide the banks that made the loans that weren't being paid back with money, they didn't have a cash flow problem, and because the American accounting system didn't require the banks to account for these bad debts as losses, there was no big problem that couldn't be worked out. I also learned that *t***he value of assets is the reciprocal of the value of money and credit (i.e., the cheaper money and credit are, the more expensive asset prices are) and the value of money is the reciprocal of the quantity of it in existence, so when central banks are producing a lot of money and credit and making it cheaper, it is wise to be more aggressive in owning assets.** 

# **The Disinflationary and Booming 1980s**

In the 1980s there was a stock market and economic boom that was accompanied by falling inflation and falling interest rates in the United States at the same time as there were inflationary depressions in the debt-burdened emerging economies that didn't have a central bank to bail them out. The debt-restructuring process progressed slowly from 1982 until 1989 when an agreement called the Brady Bond agreement, named after Nicholas Brady, who was the US Treasury Secretary at the time, was created and started to bring to an end to "the lost decade" in these countries (as agreements were reached with different countries through the early '90s). **This whole 1971- 91 up-and-down debt cycle, which profoundly affected just about everyone in the world, was the result of the US going off the gold standard, the inflation that resulted from it, and having to break the back of the inflation**  **through tight money policies that led to the strength in the dollar and dramatic fall in inflation. In the markets that big cycle showed up via a) the soaring of inflation and inflation-hedge assets and bear markets in bonds in the 1970s, b) the 1979-81 bone-crushing monetary tightening that made cash the best investment and led to a lot of deflationary debt restructuring by non-American debtors, and then c) falling inflation rates and the 1980s' excellent performance of bonds, stocks, and other deflationary assets.** The charts below convey it very well, as they show the swings up and down in dollar-denominated inflation rates and interest rates from 1945 to the present. One needs to keep these moves and the mechanics behind them in mind in thinking about the future.

Through it all the dollar remained the world's leading reserve currency. The entire period was a forceful demonstration of the benefits to the US of having the world's reserve currency that most of the world's debts and money are denominated in.

### **1990-2008: Globalizing, Digitalizing, and Booming Financed by Debt**

Geopolitically, because of its economic failures, the Soviet Union could not afford to support a) its empire, b) its economy, and c) its military at the same time in the face of US President Ronald Reagan's arms race spending. As a result the Soviet Union broke down in 1991 and abandoned communism.

It was apparent that communism failed or was failing everywhere, so many countries moved away from it. The breakdown of the Soviet Union's money/credit/economic system and its large foreign debts were disastrous for the Soviet Union economically and geopolitically through most of the 1990s. That is a whole other interesting story that we won't get into now. In any case, it is notable that in the 1980-95 period most communist countries abandoned classic communism, and the world entered a very prosperous period of globalization and free-market capitalism.

**Since the early 1990s there have been three economic cycles that brought us to where we now are—one that peaked in the 2000 dot-com bubble that led to the recession that followed, one that peaked in the 2007 bubble that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, and one that peaked in 2019 just before the 2020 coronavirustriggered downturn. During this 1990-2000 period we also saw the decline of the Soviet Union, the rise of China, globalization, and advances in technologies that replaced people, which was good for corporate profits and widened the wealth and opportunity gaps.** 

Notable markers that reflected these developments were making the internet (i.e., the World Wide Web) available to the public on August 6, 1991, which kicked off the dot-com/tech boom, and the creation of the World Trade Organization on January 1, 1995, to facilitate globalization. "Technology development" and globalization that replaced American workers' jobs, especially those in the manufacturing sector, flourished from the 1990s until around Donald Trump's election in 2016. In that roughly 30-year period countries and country borders faded in importance, and items and the incomes they produced were generally made wherever they could be most costeffectively produced, which led to production and development in emerging countries, accelerating mobility of

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_24_Figure_1.jpeg)

people between countries, narrowing wealth gaps between countries, and ballooning wealth gaps within them. Lower-income workers in developed countries suffered, while higher-income workers in productive emerging countries made fortunes. Though a bit of an oversimplification, it's accurate to say that **this was a period in which workers in other countries (especially those in China) and machines replaced middle-class workers in the United States.** 

The chart below shows the balances of goods and services for the United States and China since 1990 in real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) dollars. As you will see when we look at China in the next section of this book, China's economic reform and open-door policies after Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978 and the welcoming of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 led to the explosion of Chinese competitiveness and exports. Note the accelerations in China's surpluses and the US deficits from around 2000 to around 2010 and then some narrowing of these differences, with China still tending to run surpluses and the US still running deficits.

**During this period debt and non-debt liabilities like pension and healthcare liabilities grew a lot in the US and debts were used to finance speculations leading up to the dot-com bubble of 2000 and the mortgage bubble of the mid-2000s that led to busts that were stimulated out of by the creation of more money and debt. These debt cycles are both undesirable and understandable because there is a tendency to favor immediate gratification over long-term financial safety, particularly by politicians.** 

*Most people pay attention to what they get and not where the money comes from to pay for it, so there are strong motivations for elected officials to spend a lot of borrowed money and make a lot of promises to give voters what they want and to take on debt and non-debt liabilities that cause problems down the road.* **That was certainly the case in the 1990-2008 period.** 

**Throughout the long-term debt cycle, from 1945 until 2008, whenever the Federal Reserve wanted the economy** 

**to pick up it would lower interest rates and make money and credit more available, which would increase stock and bond prices and increase demand. That was how it was done until 2008—i.e., interest rates were cut, and debts were increased faster than incomes to create an unsustainable bubble economy that peaked in 2007. When in 2008 the bubble burst and interest rates hit 0% for the first time since the Great Depression, that changed. As explained more comprehensively in my book** *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises* **there are three types of monetary policy—1) interest-rate-driven monetary policy (which I call Monetary Policy 1 because it is the first to be used and is the preferable way to run monetary policy), 2) printing money and buying financial assets, most importantly bonds (which I call Monetary Policy 2 and is now popularly called "quantitative easing"), and 3) coordination between fiscal policy and monetary policy in which the central government does a lot of debt-financed spending and the central bank buys that debt (which I call Monetary Policy 3 because it is the third and last approach to be used when the first two cease to be effective in doing what needs to be done).**

**The charts below show how the debt crises of 1933 and 2008 both led to interest rates hitting 0% and were followed by big money printing by the Federal Reserve.** 

**This shift had big effects and implications.** 

#### **The 2008-20 Money-Financed Capitalist Boom Period**

**In 2008 the debt crisis led to interest rates being lowered until they hit 0%, which led the three main reserve currency countries' central banks (led by the Fed) to move from an interest-rate-driven monetary policy (MP1) to a printing-of-money- and buying-financial-assets-driven monetary policy** 

**(MP2). Central banks printed money and bought financial assets, which put money in the hands of investors who bought other financial assets, which caused financial asset prices to rise, which was helpful for the economy and particularly beneficial to those who were rich enough to own financial assets, so it increased the wealth gap. The putting of a lot of money into the financial system and the driving down of bond yields provided companies with a lot of cheap funding that they used to buy back their own stocks and stocks of related companies that they wanted to acquire, which further bid up stock prices. Basically, borrowed money was essentially free, so investment borrowers and corporate borrowers took advantage of this to get it and use it to make purchases that drove stock prices and corporate profits up. This money did not trickle down proportionately, so the wealth and**

**income gaps continued to grow. As shown in the charts below, the wealth and income gaps are now the largest since the 1930-45 period.** 

**In 2016, appealing to those white, socially and economically conservative voters who were hurt by these trends, Donald Trump, a blunt-speaking businessman/capitalist populist of the right, led a revolt against establishment politicians and "elites" to get elected president by promising to support people with conservative values who had lost jobs and were struggling. He went on to cut corporate taxes and run big budget deficits that the Fed accommodated. This was good for stocks, capital markets, businesses, and the capitalists who owned them. While this debt growth financed relatively strong market-economy growth and created some improvements for lower-income earners, it was accompanied by a further widening of the wealth and values gap leading the "havenots" to become increasingly resentful of the "haves." At the same time the political gap grew increasingly extreme with intransigent capitalist Republicans on the one side and intransigent socialist Democrats on the other. This is reflected in the two charts below. The first one shows how conservative Republicans in the Senate and House (via the dashed and solid red lines) and how liberal Democrats in the Senate and House (via the dashed and solid blue lines) have become relative to the past. Based on this measure they have become more extreme, and their divergence has become larger than ever before. While I'm not sure that's exactly right, I think it's by and large right.**

#### **Ideological Positions of the Major Parties**

**The next chart shows the percentage of votes along party lines. As shown approximately 95% of the votes in the House and the Senate have been along ideological lines as of 2016, the highest level in over a century. It continues to be reflected in the reduced willingness to cross party lines to compromise and reach agreements. In other words, the political splits in the country have become deep and intransigent.** 

**At the same time, as the US dominance and relative wealth decline and rivalries are intensifying in the US under Trump, this more populist and nationalist leader has taken a more aggressive negotiating posture concerning economic and geopolitical disagreements a) with international rivals, particularly China and Iran, and b) with allies such as Europe and Japan regarding trade and paying for military expenditures. The conflicts with China over trade, technology, geopolitics, and capital are the most important and are intensifying. Economic sanctions such as those that were used in the 1930-45 period are being used or put on the table for possible use.**

**Then, in March 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic came along and with it the isolation it necessitated, incomes, employment, and economic activity plunged, the US central government took on a lot of debt to give people and companies a lot of money, and the Federal Reserve printed a lot of money and bought a lot of debt. So did other central banks. As a reflection of this the charts below show the unemployment rates and central bank balance sheets of major countries for as far back as data is available. As shown, all the levels of central bank printing of money and buying of financial assets are near or beyond the previous record amounts in the war years.**

**As history has shown and as explained in the appendix to Chapter 2, "The Changing Value of Money,"** *when there is a great increase in money and credit, it drives down the value of money and credit, which drives up the value of other investment assets***—much like Nixon's August 1971 move, which led me to realize that it was the same as Roosevelt's March 1933 move, which was like Volcker's August 1982 move, which was like Ben Bernanke's November 2008 move, which was like Mario Draghi's July 2012 move, and has become standard operating procedure by central banks that will persist until that approach no longer works.**

#### **The Post-1945 Story in More Charts and Tables**

**What follows is a series of charts that show the most important financial and economic shifts over the period that we just covered. They tell an interesting story of how things have changed. Before I show you them I'd like to remind you of what the archetypical cycle looks like so you can keep it in mind while reviewing these charts.** 

As explained in Chapter 2, "The Big Cycle of Money, Credit, Debt, and Economic Activity," for all countries—like for all individuals, companies, nonprofit organizations, and local governments—the basic money equation is reflected in a simple income statement of revenue and expenses and a simple balance sheet of assets and liabilities. When one's revenue, most importantly from what one sells, is greater than one's expenditures, there is positive net income, which leads one's assets to rise relative to one's liabilities (most importantly debt), which, all else being equal, raises one's net savings. When one's income is less than one spends the reverse happens.

Exports are the main revenue source between countries. To convey the picture of export earnings, the chart below shows the share of global export sales of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union/Russia, and China from 1900 until the present. It shows which countries were and are the biggest export earners. As you can see, **a) US exports soared while British exports plunged in each of the two world wars (which made the US rich), b) British exports fell from about 30% of the total in 1900 to less than 5% today (which made Britain a lot less rich), while c) after World War II US exports were relatively steady between 20% and 25% until around 2000 when d) Chinese exports rose from around 5% to around 15% now (making China much richer), which is now the largest in the world, and US exports fell to about 14% (making it a much less strong export-income earner).**

**But exports are only half the net-income picture. It is export earnings minus import spending (i.e., the balance of goods and services) that makes the net income of a country that comes from trading with foreigners. To convey that picture for the US, the next chart shows US exports of goods and services minus US imports of goods and services since 1900. As shown the US sold more than it bought until around 1970 and then started to buy more than it sold.** 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_30_Figure_4.jpeg)

#### **Naturally,** *if one buys more than one sells one has to finance the difference by some mix of drawing down one's savings*

*and/or borrowing. One can think of a country's savings as being its foreign-exchange reserves.* **The United States financed its deficits by running down its reserves/savings and building up a lot of debt that is owed to foreigners.**  The chart below shows the net international investment position of the United States as a percent of US GDP. It conveys that, while the US used to hold more foreign assets than foreigners held US assets, that has strongly reversed. That is because the US borrowed a lot from the rest of the world and drew down assets.

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_31_Figure_0.jpeg)

The charts below show the debt piece—i.e., a) the total debt the United States owes the rest of the world and b)

the total debt the United States owes the rest of the world minus the total debt the rest of the world owes the United States. As shown, while the US had no significant foreign debt at the beginning of this new world order, it now has large foreign debts. Fortunately for the US (and less fortunately for others), this debt is in US dollars.

#### **As for reserve assets, the charts below show both gold and non-gold reserves for these four major powers since 1900.**

The first set of charts below shows a) the total amount of gold reserves (in volume of gold terms), b) the total value of the gold reserves as a percent of the country's imports, and c) the total value of gold reserves as a percent of the size of the economy for the US, Britain, the Soviet Union/Russia, and China. They are meant to convey a picture of how much savings in gold these countries had and have a) in total, b) in relation to their needs to import from abroad, and c) in relation to the size of their economies. As shown, **the United States had enormous gold reserves—approximately 10x those in the UK—and was tremendously rich by these standards in 1945, which came about by its large net earnings previously shown, and the US spent down these gold reserves until 1971 when it was forced to stop redeeming its paper money for gold. Since then the quantity of US gold reserves has remained virtually unchanged and the value of these reserves has changed with changes in its market price. As shown below the UK drew down its gold reserves to very low levels, while Russia and China have built theirs up in recent years, though they remain low.** 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_32_Figure_0.jpeg)

However, gold reserves are not a country's only reserves, especially lately. Since central banks hold foreigncurrency debt assets (e.g., bonds) as well as gold assets in their reserve savings, the size of their total reserves does a better job of conveying their savings. The picture of the changes in this measure of relative savings is shown in the charts below. **Note in the charts how enormous the US total reserves were in 1945 (accounting for about 8.5 years of imports) relative to those of other countries and note how enormously the relative sizes of these reserves have shifted since then, especially with the rise in total reserves in China. Note that China now has the largest foreign-exchange reserve and the US doesn't have much.** As shown above, the US and the UK have around 70 days of imports in reserves, while for Russia and China that figure is around 700 and 600 days, respectively. The gap in the chart in the war years period was due to an absence of data during that period. As explained in Chapter 1, a classic dynamic is that non-reserve-currency countries that want to save naturally want to save in reserve currencies, which results in them lending to the reserve currency country. That happened with the US and its dollar-denominated debt. It was especially true in the US-Chinese relationship over the 30-40 years when the Chinese produced goods inexpensively and sold these goods to eager Americans buyers who wanted to pay for them with borrowed money that the Chinese lent them from their export earnings because the Chinese wanted to save in dollars. As a result of that the Chinese are now holding about \$1.1 trillion of US debt, which is about a third of their total reserves though less than 5% of US debt. Japan holds about \$1.2-1.3 trillion of it. Because these debts are denominated in US dollars the US won't have a problem paying them back because the US Federal Reserve can print the money and pay them off with depreciated dollars.

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_33_Figure_3.jpeg)

**At this time, China has the world's largest reserves. The United States, while not having large reserves, has the power to print the world's reserve currency.** *The ability to print money and have it accepted by the world, which is an ability that only a major world reserve currency country (especially the United States) has, is the most valuable economic power a country can have. At the same time, a country that does not have sizable reserves (which is the position the US is in) is highly vulnerable to not having enough "world money." That means that the US is now very powerful because it can print the world's money and would be very vulnerable if it lost its reserve currency status.* 

![](Attachments/ChangingWorldOrder__page_34_Figure_0.jpeg)

What types of money and credit have been and now are most important? The chart below shows the percentages of reserve assets that are held in all countries' reserves combined. As shown, gold's share of total reserves has fallen from 65% in 1945 to about 10% today, though devaluation of the dollar and the surge in gold's price led gold's share of central bank reserves to be the largest until the early 1990s, after which its share of world reserves declined to only 10%. **The US dollar accounts for over 50% of reserves held and has unwaveringly remained the primary reserve currency since 1945, especially after it replaced gold as the most-held reserve asset after there was a move to a fiat monetary system.** European currencies have remained steady at 20-25% since the late 1970s, the yen and sterling are around 5%, and the Chinese RMB is only 2%, which is far below its share of world trade and world economic size, for reasons we will delve into in the Chinese section of this book. As has been the case with the Dutch guilder and the British pound, the status of the US dollar has significantly lagged and is significantly greater than other measures of its power. That means that **if the US dollar were to lose its reserve status and significantly depreciate in value it would have a devastating effect on the finances of those countries holding those reserves as well as private-sector holders of dollar-debt assets. Who would be the winners? Those with dollar-debt liabilities and those with non-dollar assets would be the big winners.** In the concluding chapter, "The Future," we will explore what such a shift might look like.

The next chart shows shares of world production for the **US, UK, Russia, and China**. It is shown on a purchasing power parity basis, which means after being adjusted for differences in prices of the same items in different countries. For example, if an item in one country was twice the price of the same item in a different country, it would be counted as twice as much production even though it's the same thing if counted on a non-purchasing power adjusted basis and it would be counted as the same amount of production if counted on a purchasing power parity basis. As shown **the United States produced many times as much as the other major countries produced in 1945, and though its share declined, it remained much higher than any other country until recently when it was surpassed by China. In non-purchasing power parity terms China's output is about 70% of the US output and growing at a significantly faster pace.** Let's not split hairs over small differences in imprecise measures. The most important headline is that **the United States was the dominant economic producer in 1945 and didn't have a comparably sized economic competitor anytime in the last 100 years up until recently and now it does in China, which is of comparable size. China is also growing significantly faster, so if this continues, it will soon be as dominant an economic power as the United States was in 1945.**

#### **Where the US Is in Its Big Cycle**

**I think we know roughly where it is.** 

**As previously explained the Big Cycle of rising and declining empires and their reserve currencies is a cycle that begins with a new world order that comes after a war in which a) there is an environment of peace, prosperity, and productivity in which debt growth is allocated well and sustainably (i.e., most debts are used productively to produce incomes that are greater than debt service so most debts are paid back), equities do well, and the society gets rich with individuals benefiting from the prosperity, though they benefit disproportionately, which eventually leads to b) excessive debt growth to finance speculation and over-consumption, which results in incomes being inadequate to service the debt, which leads to c) central banks lowering interest rates and providing more credit, which produces greater wealth gaps and more over-indebtedness, until d) overindebtedness becomes so large and central banks lose their ability to create credit growth that produces selffunding debt growth (i.e., in which debts don't accelerate relative to the incomes needed to service them without central bank subsidies), which e) produces severe economic downturns with large wealth gaps that lead to internal conflict and leads to f) lots of printing of money, big debt restructurings, and big wealth distributions via tax changes g) that create financial, economic, and political vulnerabilities for the leading power relative to emerging powers that lead to wars that define the winners and losers and produce the new world order.** 

**The stats seem to suggest that the US is roughly 75% through that cycle, +/- 10%.** 

**Is it reversible?** 

**Most world powers that experience this cycle have their "time in the sun," which is brought about by the uniqueness of their circumstances and the nature of their character and culture (i.e., they have to have the essential elements to work hard and smart, be disciplined, become educated, etc.) and have their decline phases continue through them slipping into relative obscurity. Some do this decline traumatically, and some do it gracefully.** 

**From studying history we can see that reversing a declining power is very difficult because that requires undoing a lot that has already been done. For example, bringing one's finances to the point that one's spending is greater than one's earnings and one's assets are greater than one's liabilities can only be reversed by either working harder or consuming less, which is not easily done.** 

**Still, this cycle needn't transpire this way if those in their rich and powerful stages stay productive and safe by continuing to work hard and smart, earn more than they spend, save a lot, and make the system work well for most of the population. A number of empires and dynasties have sustained themselves for hundreds of years and the United States, at 244 years old, has proven itself to be one of the most durable now in existence. I think the most important question is how we adapt and change by asking ourselves and honestly answering some difficult questions. For example, while the capitalist profit-making system allocates resources relatively efficiently, we now need to ask ourselves, "Who is it optimizing these efficiencies for?" and "What should be done if the benefits are not broad-based?" "Will we modify capitalism so that it both increases the size of the pie (by increasing productivity) and divides it well?" These questions are especially important to answer in an era when the greatest efficiencies can be gained by technologies replacing people so employing people will increasingly become unprofitable and inefficient, making one uncompetitive. "Should we, or should we not, invest in people to make them productive even when it's uneconomic to do so?" "What if our international competitors choose robots over people so we will be uncompetitive if we choose to employ people rather than robots?" "Is our democratic/capitalist system capable of asking and answering such important questions and then doing something to handle them well?" So many more important questions come to mind. When we think about the future, which we will do in the concluding chapter of this book, we will have to wrestle with these questions and many other difficult ones.**
