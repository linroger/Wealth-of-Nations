[[How Countries Go Broke-Chapter 8 to Chapter 11 Notes]]
## Part 3:

### Looking Back

***While in Part 1 I laid out the mechanics of money-credit-debt-markets-economics and in Part 2 I showed the archetypical sequence that led to central governments and central banks to go broke, in this part I show what happened over the last 80 years so that you can see how it aligned with the template and use that review of history as a foundation for looking ahead which will be done in Part 4. I believe that what is covered in this part will give you an interesting and valuable unconventional perspective of what happened and why that will be a foundation for thinking about what will happen. It will certainly provide you food for thought and debate.***

### Chapter 8: An Overview of What Has Happened Since 1944

**I will now look at what happened over the 80 years since 1944, which is when the new world order and the new monetary order came into existence. Regarding the five big forces, while my focus will primarily be on 1) the debt/money/economic force, I will also describe 2) the internal order and political cycle that goes with it (i.e., the political left versus political right cycle), 3) the international order and geopolitical cycle that goes with it (i.e., the great powers conflicts), 4) the acts of nature forces (droughts, floods, and pandemics), and 5) humanity’s advances, especially through technology, because these forces are so intertwined that they can’t be understood separately. I urge you to observe how they together produced the big swings and evolutionary changes that took us from 1944 until now.**

**Of course, this is a very brief description of what happened in a limited number of countries with an emphasis on the most important developments in the countries that were “important” in shaping the changes in the world monetary and geopolitical order. Because US money, credit/debt and other forces were so dominant, naturally the US and its money and credit played the biggest role in shaping this period, hence also in shaping my description of this period. Still, these same five forces were the major forces that drove what happened in all countries in the same basic ways.\[1\]**

**Once again, if you don’t want to read all that I have here and instead want to skim it, I suggest that you just read what is in bold.**

**The Past Is Prologue: How to Look at It**

**To begin, I want to share two of my principles with you that are relevant to how I am approaching this study.**

- ***If you want to see how and why big events have unfolded, be careful not to focus precisely on small events and not to lose sight of how and why the big things are changing. People who try to see things up close and precisely typically miss the most important things because they are preoccupied with looking for precision. Also, if you look at things up close, you will never see the most important big things. So, when looking for the big things, pay attention to the big things.***
- ***Everything that happens does so for reasons that make it happen, so we should strive to understand and explain the cause/effect relationships that drive changes and create from them a logical template-model that both explains past changes and aligns the template-model with what is actually happening and, if there are discrepancies, work to understand and resolve them. This template-model should be timeless and universal, meaning that it should explain all the big important developments in all time frames and in all countries, though not necessarily precisely or in detail. If it fails to explain all the big developments in all time frames and countries, that indicates that an important influence is missing and needs to be added to the model.***

**What I am saying is that in the most fundamental ways, the previously described processes and cycles have happened in all countries over all time similarly, though none of them have been exactly the same. So, to see the processes and cycles, you need to pay attention to the biggest, most important changes that happened, keeping in mind the reasons for the big changes and the big differences.**

**In one sentence what I am saying is that what has timelessly and universally (i.e., throughout the millennia and across countries) driven the Big Debt Cycle changes and has created the big debt and economic problems is the creation of unsustainably large amounts of debt assets and debt liabilities relative to the amounts of money, goods, services, and investment assets in existence.****This always has and inevitably will always lead to big debt crises and “runs” on banks. By a “run” I mean a turning in of debt assets (that have no intrinsic value—i.e., their only value is to buy things) to “banks” in order to get real money, which the bank doesn’t have enough of to meet the demand, so the bank either defaults, or in the case of central banks with fiat monetary systems, “prints” fiat money. Classically, when the holders of those financial assets actually try to convert them back into money and buy things and see that they can’t get the buying power they believe they have stored in their debt assets, the run accelerates which causes the “run on the bank” that feeds on itself which causes great shifts in markets’ values and wealth until debts are defaulted on, restructured and/or monetized, reducing the debt burdens relative to incomes, and a new equilibrium is reached. The debts are almost always monetized, by which I mean that it is almost always the case that the central bank creates a lot of money and credit to make it easier to pay back the debt, which devalues the money and debt.**

**There are variations in how each of these cases plays out. However, during these times, we almost always see that it becomes relatively undesirable to hold the debt assets (i.e., bonds) for long relative to holding other storeholds, such as equities and gold, which don’t lose buying power when the value of money goes down.\[2\]**

You could miss this if you pay too much attention to exactly how banks and central banks have worked, especially if you don’t look at them over time or across countries. For example, while it’s true that long ago there weren’t central banks like there are today, central banks work in essentially the same way as non-central banks except central banks can print money. So, the debt dynamic with them works essentially the same way for central banks as private banks except that, when there is a debt crisis, the central banks can print money. Similarly, while the debt dynamic works essentially the same way across countries, in countries that have well-established reserve currencies, the borrowers and lenders are more inclined to have confidence in them so there is more stability. To see how the debt dynamic works, it would also be a mistake to overly focus on how it is now working without keeping in mind how the debt cycle evolves over time. For example, if I didn’t know how central banks (especially the Fed) used quantitative easing when they needed to ease and interest rates hit 0%, even though that never happened before in my lifetime, I wouldn’t have known what they could do and did in 2008. Similarly, throughout history, most central banks have switched from having a linked/backed currency (e.g., a gold-backed currency) to having a fiat currency (allowing them to freely create money) when they had too many debt assets and liabilities relative to the currency it was supposed to be backed by, and they have tended to switch back to a fixed/linked currency when they abused the fiat currency system by printing too much currency, which created too much depreciation of its value for it to be an effective storehold of wealth. I am confident that to understand what is happening and what is likely to happen, you must keep in mind the big changes that happened in history and the cause/effect relationships that drove them—i.e., you must understand how “the machine” works—and not get hung up with trying to be precise with the little stuff or focusing too exactly on what is happening now.

To emphasize the importance of the big things, I describe things in a simplified way, so it’s easy for some people to say, “That’s not exactly right!” and be correct. I am intentionally conveying this template-model in a not exact way in order to draw attention to the most important things.

While I will now explain how I believe the cyclical debt/money/economic dynamic that I previously described has transpired since it began in 1944, I want to re-emphasize that this dynamic isn’t specific to the last 80 years. The big cycle dynamic that I am describing, and that we are now in, is working in the same basic way as past cycles have worked for thousands of years in all countries—i.e., it has been driven by the same basic and logical cause/effect relationships that you will see if you don’t squint at the details.

Let’s now look at what happened since the end of World War II when the new world order began. While I will be putting what happened in the context of the Big Debt Cycle, you will see that the other four forces also swung greatly and interacted with the debt cycles to shape what happened. You will see all five forces ebb and flow like waves, sometimes small ones and sometimes big ones, sometimes reinforcing each other and sometimes negating each other, and sometimes with big ones coming together to create perfect storms. As for the debt cycle force, to repeat, the main thing to keep in mind is:

- ***Normally, when central banks want to be stimulative, they lower interest rates and/or create a lot more money and credit, which creates a lot more spending and debt. This stimulation both extends the expansion phase of the cycle and raises debt assets and liabilities relative to incomes, which makes the debt asset and debt liability balance more precarious. History shows us that when central banks can’t lower interest rates anymore and want to be stimulative, they print money and buy debt, especially government debt. That gives debtors, most importantly governments, money and credit to prevent them from defaulting and allows them to continue to borrow to spend more than they are earning until the debt assets and liabilities become too great to balance, which is when a debt restructuring and/or debt monetization must occur.***

**What Happened Since 1944**

**I am now going to take you through the Big Debt Cycle that began in 1944, which we are now in the late stages of, and explain how it transpired as a function of the earlier described mechanical cause/effect relationships.**

**In reviewing what happened relative to this template, I will go beyond the major debt/money/economic events to include the major events that arose from the other four big forces because all of these five forces were so entwined that it is impossible see them separately. As we go through this period to the present, please note the big swings in all five of these influences and how they affected each other.**

**To make clear how it transpired relative to the previously explained money/debt template, I will divide the post-1944 period into four phases signifying the four main monetary regimes that drove the credit-debt dynamic since 1944. We will begin in 1944 because that is when the new monetary, geopolitical, and in many cases, domestic political orders began.**

Because I was born in 1949 and have been a global macro investor for most of my life, I both experienced and studied most of what I am going to describe, so I am going to share some personal descriptions to help enrich the picture and pass along some lessons that I learned from going through these experiences, especially through my painful mistakes, which stick in my mind much more than my winning decisions. As you watch the story of the last 80 years unfold, observe the almost in-unison swings in the five forces from one extreme to another. Note that they were so extreme that each decade was more likely to be more opposite than similar to the decade before it, yet at the end of each, the psychology and markets expected more of the same, so those were the key times to understand the fundamentals well and bet against the crowd on the unexpected developments that were logically probable.

**The Current Big Debt Cycle in Brief**

**Before I get into what happened, I’d like to show you the Big Debt Cycle in few charts, starting at 1900 with the United States. Showing this whole 1900 period will give you a greater perspective. I have focused on the US dollar debt charts because the world money and debt market has been a US dollar debt market during this Big Cycle, even though it is the case that other countries have also had their own big cycles.**

**In the US, from 1944 to 2024 there were 12.5 short-term debt cycles (i.e., at this writing we are about halfway through the 13th) that averaged about six years in length and added up to one Big Debt Cycle that brought the central government’s debt-to-income ratios up and worsened the central bank’s balance sheet in the ways shown in the charts below.**Said differently, the US and its credit markets have been in the long-term leveraging-up phase of the long-term debt cycle, and they haven’t yet entered the deleveraging part of the long-term debt cycle, though there have been some brief deleveragings along the way. These charts show the big picture. Most people overlook this big-picture arc because they are focused on the short-term wiggles, which don’t even show up in these charts.

**This first chart shows US private debt relative to GDP since 1900. This Big Debt Cycle beginning in 1944 is obvious. Note the peak in 2008 and the slight decline since then. The decline happened as the US central government and US central bank stepped in in a big way to help the private sector, which is shown in the next two charts. As previously explained, this is typical of the beginning of the late stage of the Big Cycle.**

**The chart below shows US government debt relative to GDP, with the dots signifying projections by the Congressional Budget Office in 10 and 20 years. As shown, it is evolving in a big cycle, is now at the highest level since 1946 (around the end of World War II), and is projected to be much higher in the future.**

**Now I will put the last two charts into one chart so you can see how they relate to each other. You can see how private and public sector debt levels have been related: most importantly how the government tended to acquire more debt when the private sector was acquiring less.**For example, you can see how the government’s debt as a share of GDP has increased dramatically since 2008, while the private sector’s debt-to-GDP went down. That is because in order to provide the private sector with more support, the central government got itself into more debt. Therein lies the problem.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQEZ2nCg9eNb5g/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242279515?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=RdUaG7tdyCudK_KoBRLKlx2N8VSPl4J1mps0DrhKuqQ)

The next chart shows the central government debt service as a percent of the money it takes in. As shown, it is now at about 100% and it is projected to rise to about 150% in 15 years. To visualize what that means, imagine that the amount of money you had to pay in debt service each year was 50% greater than you earned each year. It’s unimaginable. So, what is the belief that is behind how that situation will work? It is the belief that the government will be able to 1) roll over the debt that is coming due, 2) sell the new debt that it needs to borrow to fund the deficit, and 3) have holders of the existing debt not sell it (i.e., that those who are lending to the government decide that they want to continue lending to the government because it’s not too risky).

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQF6jrMLF-u7sQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242322044?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=egcYLU11HWVTQEZMXgYN1uNIIZcgoD74qMPz0CmR8cQ)

***Because everything that happens does so because of reasons that make it happen, if one looks and thinks about them, one can see indicators of the cause/effect relationships, see them unfolding, and use them as indicators of what is likely to happen.*****To help paint the picture I will pass along a few more of these.**

**The next chart shows the 10-year Treasury bond rate and a three-year moving average of the inflation rate.*****The relationship between interest rates and inflation rates is important because when interest rates are high relative to the inflation rate there is an incentive to save and earn the interest rate, and when interest rates are low relative to the inflation rate there is an incentive to borrow and hold assets that benefit from inflation and the growth that low interest rates foster.***

In the chart below, you can see the big cycles of interest rates reflected in the 10-year Treasury bond yield and a three-year moving average of the inflation rate. The bond yield consists of two parts—the expected inflation rate and the expected real bond yield. Both are important in affecting the value of money and debt as a storehold of wealth and as a cost of funds. Note that on the upswing of this big cycle, all short-term cyclical swings in bond yields (i.e., those that took place in the cycles of recessions, stimulations, strong growth, and rising inflation periods that led to tightening money and credit that then led to recessions and falling bond yields) and all the cyclical declines in bond yields were higher than the ones before them until 1981. Also note that each of the short-term cyclical swings in bond yields from 1981 until 2020 were lower than the ones before until nominal interest rates nearly hit 0% and real interest rates were significantly negative. That reflects the big cycle in inflation expectations and the real interest rates’ movements around these expectations. While nominal interest rates are important, real interest rates are even more important because that is an indicator of the attractiveness of Treasury bonds as a storehold of wealth.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHDCidBkSXsgA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242365591?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=u5xdfFyQwE-IsUQn2VDjLJ2Z3lif7kXaVfr9Lz21xNU)

In the chart below you can see the real 10-year bond yield. In years after 1997, I am using the real yield on a 10-year Treasury inflation-protected bond.\[3\] In my opinion, the real bond yield is the most important number to watch in the financial world. That is because it shows what real return you can certainly get (i.e., free of inflation risk and default risk) on your wealth,\[4\] which is the most foundational rate for all capital markets. To earn more than that rate, one has to earn it through cleverness. Even more importantly,**it is the best single indicator of whether it is better to be a borrower-debtor or a lender-creditor** —e.g., when real interest rates are low, it is much easier to borrow money and convert it into profits than when real interest rates are high. As such, it is a great tool for central banks to use to modulate credit and economic activity. As shown, the real bond yield has averaged about 2% over the last 100 years, which is a rate that is neither too low for borrower-debtors nor too high for lender-creditors. The period of great differences from this 2% were periods of excessively cheap or excessively expensive credit/debt that contributed greatly to the big swings in the Big Debt Cycle.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQGlkRkKZIsBGA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242396220?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=fRBWo9VpduZUqBUCVlVcPFOZvIvuUyIDc-FAVu9X98M)

When looking at nominal bond yields relative to inflation-indexed bonds’ real yields, I can also see the breakeven inflation rate, which is the inflation rate that the market is betting on. Since one can make money betting against that rate if one thinks inflation is higher or lower than the market believes, and the markets are pretty tough to beat, one can use that inflation rate as a pretty good naïve estimate if one doesn’t have a market-beating way to make a better estimate. Because I can see in the market pricing both the “discounted” (i.e., market expected) inflation rate and the discounted real interest rate that I can lock in, I see the bond yield and price as consisting of these two important drivers. I am always watching them rather than just the Treasury bond interest rate, and I often think of and trade the two pieces—i.e., the inflation rate and the real interest rate—separately. Their past estimated pricing is shown below.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQHqwIjGTp_evw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242420319?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=MQPyW739RVSzjB9xGz-6bgHCygxbUSrkHsmV2KK_FbY)

**I always think about the 10-year real rate and its two parts because it is the most important governor of all capital markets.**I have been intimately involved with it for a long time. For several years, when there wasn’t an inflation-indexed bond market in the US, I invested in non-US inflation-indexed bonds that I currency-hedged to create a synthetic equivalent of a US inflation-indexed bond. That came about because a great investor, David White of the Rockefeller Foundation, explained that he had to give away 5% a year and asked me what I thought was the surest way of investing to fund that, which prompted me to think about leveraging and hedging foreign inflation-indexed bonds. That led Bridgewater to become the largest global inflation-indexed bond manager in the world, and I was invited to work on the design of the Treasury Inflation Protected (TIPS) bond market with Larry Summers when he ran the US Treasury. Since then, we have had a real market showing real bond yields to both look at for guidance and to invest in, which has been foundational to all my investment thinking. I believe that the inflation-indexed bond markets that exist around the world are much underappreciated and underused relative to their potential, for the reasons I just explained. I recommend that you watch them as indicators and use them as storeholds of wealth.

***The relationship between short-term rates and long-term rates (i.e., the yield curve) is also very important because when short-term interest rates are high relative to long-term rates that indicates money is tight and encourages the holding and lending of cash, which becomes more attractive than borrowing and investing in other investments.***Movements in the attractiveness of different assets affect the nominal interest rate yield curve—i.e., the difference between the 10-year nominal bond yield and the nominal short rate\[5\]—reflecting the changing tightness of money and the changing incentives to hold cash relative to bonds.\[6\] That is because normally a higher interest rate is required by lender-creditors to hold longer-term debt and because higher long-term interest rates than cash rates provide a reward-inducement for lending. When the central bank wants to slow credit growth and economic demand it raises short-term rates relative to long-term rates, and when it wants to stimulate it does the opposite. When both 1) real yields are high and 2) the yield curve is nearly flat or inverted, money and credit are tight, which is typically a good environment for lender-creditors and a bad environment for borrower-debtors, and when 3) real yields are low and 4) the yield curve is relatively positive, that is typically a good environment for borrower-debtors and a bad environment for lender-creditors. When central banks shift these things extremely that leads to extremely good and bad environments and a lot of volatility for both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors, which is also disruptive to economies and causes pain and inefficiencies.

**I think that the Fed should not be as extreme and volatile as it has been in its use of interest rates to influence monetary policy.****If I were running monetary policy, my goal would be to keep the long-term real interest rate relatively stable at a rate that balances the needs of both borrower-debtors and lender-creditors and doesn’t contribute to making the debt bubbles and busts. That would mean seeking to have the real T-bond yield around 2%, varying that target by something like 1%, and targeting the yield curve slope so that a) the short-term rate is about 1% below the long-term rate and b) the short-term rate divided by the long-term rate is about 70%, give or take about 2% and about 50% respectively.**

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQGQYQft9zdnuQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242454534?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=qfXL9kJzR2rXsoAZQ5qX0hlNlxTwqOU1V2MmfdyQTbY)

**Setting policy in a way that produces fewer big and volatile swings in real interest rates and yield curves would lead to less volatility. In turn, that would lead to less harm to borrower-debtors and lender-creditors (and everything else they affect in the economy), and it would allow them to plan better.**In other words, with a more consistent policy, borrower-debtors and lender-creditors would both know that they could expect a reasonable real rate, which should be acceptable to both of them so they could plan their activities accordingly. With that relatively certain borrowing rate, lending and economic conditions would adapt to that reasonable interest rate. Also, setting that rate would help provide both borrowers and lenders more stable cost-of-funds and real returns, which would make for more stable capital markets and yield more stable economic conditions, which would improve efficiencies that would enhance the running of capital markets and the economy.But let’s get back to exploring rates and how they impact the economy.

**Thus far I have just shown you the big picture of the Treasury interest rate, but that isn’t the rate that people, companies, and local governments borrow at. For that reason, watching credit spreads is helpful. Below is a chart that shows an average credit spread (for Baa corporate bonds) since 1920.**

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFUVe3bSskrEw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242491409?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=c4yHunmmHfHbEFf8Xgnoqcw3N5lUKRPKFN864mniDgE)

**The amount of interest owed on a debt is determined by the amount borrowed and the interest rate, which, together with the amount of principal to be paid back, is the amount of debt service.**

**Let’s revisit the chart shared earlier that shows total debt service (principal payments plus interest payments) for the US central government relative to its revenues and how much of that comes from principal payments and how much comes from interest payments.**Note that debt service was roughly flat from 1950 to 2000; that is because government debt levels were roughly flat or falling slightly over that period, so principal payments were also roughly flat to slightly falling. Interest payments rose slightly from 1950 to 1990, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly rose, then fell from 1990 to roughly 2022, as the average interest rate on government debt slowly fell.

I am using dots to show how this is projected to grow, based on the CBO’s estimates, over the next 10 and 20 years. The projected picture is very different from the recent past, because the central government’s debt levels are high and projected to rise fast, and the effective interest rate on these high debts is also projected to rise, which will cause a big increase in government debt service relative to government revenue, which produces a significant squeeze on spending unless there is a lot more borrowing, most likely financed by the central bank. Therein lies the problem.

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQFU5j2jhrk6Jw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738242523456?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=hT0O-ilRzqwsOICoSQIoMGjro20fjSo3Olvgf7-K8UA)

Who did the central government borrow the money from? It borrowed a lot of it from the central bank. It also borrowed a lot from commercial banks and foreign investors who lost money when interest rates rose. About one-third of it is from foreigners. These commercial and foreign buyers/holders of US debt have had losses in it as interest rates rose, and they have more of it as a percentage of their holdings than makes sense on a financial basis alone. In the case of the biggest foreign holders of US government bonds, they have so much because they want to store buying power in the most widely used and accepted currency of the greatest and most credible world power—said differently, because it is the leading reserve currency of the leading world power. Looking ahead, given that increased supply of US government dollar debt that is coming (as shown in the last chart) relative to the desired demand for it, it is hard to imagine that these big buyers/holders are likely in the future to buy the huge amounts of US Treasuries that they did in the past, especially if any of the key underpinnings of that demand weaken—e.g., the US government a) irresponsibly handles its debt and its domestic and foreign policy issues, b) if the US government threatens to sanction them by withholding payments of the debt, c) if the returns from holding this debt are bad, and/or d) the US loses its economic and geopolitical prominence.

As US debt service levels kept rising, debtors needed lower levels of interest rates to make debt service affordable. From 1980 until 2008, lowering interest rates was more than enough to keep debt service affordable even as debt levels kept rising. But **when rates nearly hit zero in 2008, as they did in the post-1933 period, private market demand for the bonds was inadequate to meet the supply so the central bank stepped in with money printing and buying the bonds, which put downward pressure on longer-term rates. It happened in two major waves—one in response to the 1929-33 debt-crisis-induced Great Depression when interest rates hit 0%, so in the post-1933 period, and again in response to the 2008 debt-crisis-induced Great Recession when interest rates hit 0%, so in the post-2008 period.**I wouldn’t have known that, and Bridgewater wouldn’t have been successful in this period if we hadn’t studied the timeframe shown in this chart. This is also what led to my first discovery of how the Big Debt Cycle works.

**As for the central bank,****the Federal Reserve and other central banks’ debt assets provide lower returns than the costs required to service their liabilities, so the modest rise in the interest rate that has occurred in this most recent tightening has caused the Fed to take modest operating losses (blue line below).**If the bonds on the Fed balance sheet were marked to market, its losses would be around $700 billion, or 2.5% of GDP (red line). This sounds significant but is relatively minor versus the central bank’s capacity to obtain funding. However, it is a red flag and would become a major problem if there was a big selling of US debt, which is what typically happens when that debt is perceived as a risky asset. As previously explained, for countries like the United States that have the ability to print their own money, that would lead to either a) a big and intolerable rise in nominal and real interest rates, which would contract credit and lead to a severe economic contraction, or b) a big central bank printing of money and buying of debt and providing of credit, which would lead to the devaluation of debt and money. The big central bank losses and bad conditions would also increase the likelihood that the central bank’s independence would be called into question. For those countries that have debt denominated in a reserve currency that is not theirs, conditions would be much worse.

**Debt Burdens Will Increase Globally**

In this introduction, I focused on the debt picture for the US. You can see below that this is not only an American issue. Debt burdens are projected to grow substantially across the developed world (excluding Germany) over the coming decades. It is crucial to understand how these dynamics will play out in order to understand how to make policy and trade in markets through these coming decades.

**To reiterate, I am going to take you through the Big Debt Cycle for the US because the US dollar was and still is the dominant reserve currency that most transactions were and are denominated in and most savings are in. However, in this chapter you will see the Big Debt Cycles of several countries unfold. In Chapter 14, I will dive more deeply into the Japanese Big Debt Cycle. To me, the US over the last 70-80 years, Japan after its bubble bursting, and the other cases I have looked at are all classic Big Debt Cycles that are operating in the previously described ways that are important for investors and policy makers in all countries to understand now that some of them are encountering Big Debt Cycles in their own countries and they will likely experience serious consequences from those in the US and the US dollar assets and liabilities. While reading this chapter, note the interactions of these debt cycles with the political, geopolitical, nature acts, and technology forces.**

**To reiterate, I think that there are short-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that add up to long-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that cause swings around uptrends in productivity that are due to humanity’s inventiveness especially of new technology so, figuratively speaking, it looks like this to me.**

We will now look at what happened through the phases of the long-term debt cycle.

### Chapter 9: The History and Lessons from Phase 1, from 1944 to 1971—A Linked (i.e., Hard) Monetary System (MP1)

**This type of monetary system, which I call Monetary Policy 1,\[7\] is one in which the currency can be used to buy a designated hard asset (most often gold) at a set price, and, because of that ability, the supply of the currency is supposedly limited. That is because if the supply of the currency becomes too large, its price should fall. This would lead people to take their money to buy the item the currency is backed by (e.g., the gold), which will lead to the currency being turned in, so taken out of supply, thus supporting the value of money. The problem with this system is that it has never worked in the long term because, even with the link to a hard asset, governments still issue more debt than they should, which leads to many more claims on the asset than the money is convertible into (e.g., gold) than can be converted at the specified price. The consequences of this are almost always a “run on the bank,” with people rushing to make the conversion, and the breaking of the promise to deliver the hard asset.**

**From 1944 to 1971 there was a gold-linked monetary system in which dollars, which at the time were considered like checks with no intrinsic value, were exchangeable for gold, which was considered the real money, at a fixed exchange rate. Other currencies were exchangeable for dollars at agreed-upon and changeable rates.**

During this 27-year period, there were five short-term debt/economic cycles, which were wiggles around an uptrend in debt relative to incomes during this period. In brief, here is what happened, including what happened with all five of the big forces.

World War II ended the prior world order and caused the transition to the new world order that we are now in. As always, the biggest winners of the war—in this case, the US, Great Britain, and their allies as well as the Soviet Union and its allies—determined the rules of the new world order including the new world monetary system.**In 1944 the US, Great Britain, and their allies created what would be the new monetary system**, which was called the Bretton Woods monetary system (because it was created in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire). It looked like most prior monetary systems that existed throughout the millennia **with “paper” money being linked to the real money (gold), which was held in banks (in this case, central banks)**, though it had its own particular characteristics, as they all did. In this case, because the US had about two-thirds of the world’s gold,\[8\] which was held by the US Treasury, the dollar became the world’s reserve currency. Other countries had their own currencies, so to get gold from the US central bank, they had to buy dollars and then use those dollars to buy the gold. Only countries’ central banks were allowed to buy gold; individuals were prohibited from buying gold with their paper money. In fact, in the US and most other countries, it was illegal for citizens to own gold because governments wanted people to save in debt assets in order to build the credit system and they didn’t want debt assets to have to compete with gold. This system was created for the United States and countries that wanted to join it, and the US wanted to let others in. Great Britain became a subordinate power in this new order because its financial and other powers were weakened by the war, while the United States became much richer because it entered the war late. The Soviet Union had its own monetary system, and ways of doing things that were independent of the US-dominated system.

**The main geopolitical competition was between the US (which was a capitalist democracy) and the Soviet Union (which was a communist autocracy).**The United States was much stronger economically and militarily than the Soviet Union, so it was able to provide financial support programs like the Marshall Plan to help build its allies, especially in Europe. These programs were done to enhance alliances, which was especially important at a time of the Cold War. Because the US was rich (it had two-thirds of the world’s gold which was money at the time), had the world’s reserve currency, and accounted for about half of world GDP, it could easily afford to provide this support to allies. Having the world’s reserve currency, which other countries wanted, gave it great buying power that it abused.

**At that time, China, which was allied with the winning powers against the Japanese in the war, was a destroyed and powerless country having suffered what it calls the “Century of Humiliation,” in which foreign countries took over different parts of China, conditions deteriorated terribly, and the whole system of government collapsed.**This roughly 100-year period began in 1839 and ended with the end of World War II. During this period, Japan took over Taiwan in 1895, which was given back to China by the winning powers at the end of the war.**Between 1945 and 1949, China had its version of a classic civil war between hard-right capitalists and the hard-left communists. That led to the communists driving the capitalists out to Taiwan, Chinese communists siding with Russian communists, and the United States alienating China. At that time and since, it was agreed that there was only one China and Taiwan is part of China, and the argument was over who controlled Taiwan and China. Arguments about this issue have festered for a long time and are intensifying, which is especially important because of the powers the US and China have and because Taiwan is the center of chip production, which today is even more important than oil production was in the last cycle.**

**In that early post-war period, inventive people, especially American scientists and entrepreneurs who were primarily financed by the capitalists with government support, continued to come up with great new technology that would eventually have huge effects.**For example, in 1956 “artificial intelligence” and the personal computer were invented, and in 1957 the satellite was invented. In the mid-1950s the technical foundations of the internet were developed. Of course, there were too many inventions that had big economic, political, geopolitical, and environmental effects for me to delve into here.

**Because Great Britain was heavily indebted and in fast relative decline economically and militarily, it rapidly and persistently had its bonds and money devalued in the classic ways that were described earlier and that are important to keep in mind when looking at the US now.**Immediately after the war, Britain had a lot of debt, and it had colonies and military bases in over 40 countries that it couldn’t afford to maintain.I won’t repeat all the steps, but I will point out that this overextended British Empire had debt problems that led to a managed 30% devaluation of its currency in 1949, which was followed by a series of devaluations in the years that followed, all to relieve its debt burdens at the great cost of its debt holders. The decline in the value of the currency and debt was classic. There were debt payment problems and the inevitable losses of the controlled foreign territories that made it obvious to the world that Great Britain was declining, which reinforced the desire not to hold its debt and currency and led to their further declines. Most obviously, when Egypt took over the Suez Canal in 1956, loyal holders of Great Britain’s bonds sold them. In 1967, another financial crisis led to another major devaluation and abandonment of its debt and money being held as a storehold of wealth, and in 1976 Britain’s financial condition got so bad that it had to go to the IMF for financial help. The decline of the British pound and Britain is the most recent classic case study of the decline of a reserve currency, which is described at length in my book *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*.

**In the early 1960s, the US short-term money and credit cycle was expansionary, which was great for the US markets and economy until 1965-66 when inflation rose to 3.8% and the Fed tightened monetary policy, inverting the yield curve for the first time since 1929 and leading to a recession in 1969-70. That produced, in 1968, what would be the peak inflation-adjusted price in the S&P 500 for the next 25 years, with that long period of bad performance due to the big cycle influences I described earlier in this study.**That long period of terrible stock and bond market performance and terrific gold and other inflation-hedge assets performance was primarily due to the needed creation and devaluation of money to deal with the debts (i.e., the debtors’ obligations to deliver money) being too large relative to the actual amount of real money in existence. That paradigm taught me a lot about the need to be able to make money in all types of market environments and the skills required to do it. It also puts me today in a very different mindset from most investors who haven’t been through something like that and have views based just on their experiences and so think that being long just in equity-like assets and ignoring the big cycles is the best way to invest.

**In the 1960s, there were also some nail-biting political and geopolitical conflicts that made a big impression on me, most notably when the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 brought the world’s two most powerful countries to the brink of nuclear war.**I was 13 at the time and vividly remember watching John F. Kennedy’s address to the country explaining the situation and wondering if there would be nuclear war or which country would back down. Cuba’s leader, Fidel Castro, wanted to go to war, which could have been a nuclear war. The stock market didn’t behave nearly as badly as I thought it would have. What happened was that the Soviet Union pulled its missiles, which were aimed at the US, out of Cuba, and the United States pulled its missiles that were aimed at the Soviet Union out of Turkey. This allowed both countries to claim victory without telling their people about their concessions made, and I got my first lesson about how brinkmanship diplomacy really works and how markets behave during such dramas (when the damages that would result from the conflict are unacceptably high). In November 1963, JFK was assassinated, which also had only a brief passing effect on the markets and economy; there was the civil rights movement; and big spending on “guns” (the Vietnam War) and “butter” (US domestic social programs). These and numerous other seemingly earthshaking events that didn’t have much effect on markets helped me to realize why they didn’t affect the markets more and sort out what really matters and doesn’t matter to market prices and the economy. While I won’t delve into all that matters, I will tell you that what matters to markets is the money that investments earn, so big political events like threats of war don’t matter much until they start to affect those cash flows. That is why, from an investment perspective, I don’t worry about the headline-grabbing events of today that don’t matter much and suggest that you do the same. Also, I learned that most of these global threats turn out to sound more threatening than they actually are because most countries’ leaders will step back from the brink rather than choose to go over it. However, to be clear, there are times that international conflicts have impacts, such as on supply lines and the value of currencies, and there are rare occasions when leaders don’t step back and things blow up, so that these conflicts become very consequential. Because I view protecting myself against these events as being like buying insurance to be protected against an improbable, unacceptable loss, I look for ways to be insured against them even though I don’t expect them to happen.

**In the 1960s, there was also a big geopolitical swing in the relationship between China and the Soviet Union. They changed from being “friendly” countries to becoming “enemy” countries, which led to a corresponding big geopolitical swing between China and the United States** **from being “enemies” to “friends.”** That led to Henry Kissinger’s secret visit to China in 1971 and then Nixon’s visit in early 1972, which set the stage for China’s opening up after Mao Zedong died in 1976. These developments, like the earlier mentioned technology developments, were like small seeds of change being planted that grew into enormous changes that would affect all five forces everywhere. They mattered a lot even though they didn’t seem to matter much at the time.

During this 1945-70 period, the US overspent and financed that overspending by borrowing, especially **in the 1960s on the Vietnam War and the “war on poverty,” so its paper-money promises to give real money (gold) far exceeded what it had in its bank. That mattered a lot, though it didn’t seem to at the time because the bad finances grew slowly until they led to the blow-up. You see, early in the 1950s and 1960s, most countries were happy to accept these “paper” dollars in return for their goods and services because they wanted to accumulate dollars as savings. As a result, the US could overspend liberally. Also, over those years other countries, especially Germany and Japan, gradually recovered from their big losses from the war and became competitive economically, which led the US balance of payments to worsen. In the late 1960s period, one could see the US and the UK having bank runs on their central banks because holders of paper money turned it in to get the real money (gold), so the US central bank’s reserves of gold steadily declined.**

Seeing the US central bank running out of the real money (gold), Charles de Gaulle, the French president at the time, in 1965 openly called for a reform of the monetary system. Other holders of paper dollars caught on and the run accelerated and the US spending and deficits didn’t slow down, so the run on the US central bank ended like most such central bank runs end. For previously described reasons, the selling of the debt drove interest rates up and the currency down at the same time as the economy weakened.**The US central bank** **did not have enough real money (gold) in the bank to meet its obligations to exchange it for the paper money at the promised price.**

**On the night of Sunday, August 15, 1971, President Nixon got on the television and announced that the United States was no longer going to allow dollar holders to turn their dollars in for gold. That ended the monetary system, and money, as we knew it. It immediately devalued money, raised inflation, and made it much easier to pay debts for the reasons I previously explained.**I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the time. It was a summer job between college and business school. I figured that ending the money system as we knew it and preventing people from getting the real money was a big, bad deal, so I expected the stock market to be down a lot. Instead, it was the best day for the market that year—stocks were up more than 3% on Monday. Because I had never experienced a currency devaluation before, I was ignorant about how they worked. That led me to study history, which led me to find out that, in 1933, President Roosevelt had done the exact same thing (default on the promise to allow people with dollars to exchange them for gold at the promised exchange rate) for the exact same reason (the US created more promises for gold than it had in gold, and it was running out of gold and money during a bank run), which had the exact same effect (the devaluation, big market rallies in stocks and gold). The only real difference from Nixon was that Roosevelt made the announcement on the radio, not television, which wasn’t around yet. In both cases, delinking the currency meant the central government didn’t have to deliver the real money and freed themselves to create a lot of money and credit. This made it easier to have the debts and stimulate the economy, leading equities, gold, and commodity prices to rise and the economy to pick up. That’s when I learned that when central banks create a lot of money and credit, the value of money and credit goes down and the price of most things goes up. I realized that these moves were classic cases of “hard” currency (gold-linked) exchange rate systems breaking down, leading to the devaluations of the money and debt. Once I saw this happen in these two cases, I saw that it happened throughout history in almost all such cases, and I learned the principle that ***when there is a big debt problem that is intolerably painful, central banks will “print money” and distribute it to make it easier for debtors to pay their debts, which will devalue the money and debt relative to other assets****.*That helped me make a lot of money and avoid a lot of painful losses.

### Chapter 10: The History and Lessons from Phase 2, 1971 to 2008—A Fiat Money, Interest-Rate-Driven Monetary Policy (MP2)

**The August 1971 breakdown of the monetary system changed the value of money and how the system worked—i.e.,****the gold-linked system was replaced by a fiat monetary system in which central banks stimulated and restrained money/credit/debt growth by changing interest rates.**I call this type of monetary system (i.e., one in which fiat currencies are managed via interest rate changes) Monetary Policy 2 (MP2).\[9\] I make these distinctions between types of monetary policy because they work very differently, and it is important to understand these differences. The most important differences between MP1 and MP2 are that a) in an MP2-type monetary system the amount of money and credit provided by lender-creditors to borrower-debtors is primarily driven by the cost of money (i.e., interest rates) and b) is not restrained by the link to hard currency (e.g., to gold). Because the amount of money and credit was unrestrained and because the world’s central banker (the Fed) wanted to accommodate what happened, this changed policy led to a very classic combination of economic stagnation and inflation, which was called stagflation.

**From 1971 to 1982: Stagflation and Tightening and the Move from the Political Left to the Political Right**

**From 1971 until the end of 1981, the Federal Reserve increased the supply of money by 100%, and the broader measures of money supply that included some bank accounts and cash instruments (called M2) increased by 180%. The prices of a) goods and services (measured in CPI), b) stocks, and c) gold went up by a) about 140%, b) around 30%, and c) about 10x respectively. Stock prices fell by 45% in real terms. Of course, debtors benefited because they could pay their debts with much more available and much cheaper dollars and creditors suffered because the value of the money they were promised dwindled. In that 10-year period, a holder of 10-year Treasury bonds lost around 40% in inflation-adjusted terms, and holders of Baa corporate bonds had slightly negative returns in inflation-adjusted terms. In other words, starting in 1971 and through the next few years, the Fed dealt with the debt crisis by creating a lot more money and credit, which created great debt relief for debtors and great losses of buying power for creditors, which encouraged borrowing and discouraged lending.**This decade of debt monetization developments made a big impression on me and taught me some invaluable lessons about the need and ability to make money in all kinds of markets. I think that current investors who have only lived in an environment in which equity-like assets have had positive real returns are approaching investing by only looking to buy equity-like investments to provide great real returns, and that is a mistake.

**The most important difference between today’s US money (i.e., dollars), which has been the most important world money since 1944, and dollars in the 1945-71 period is that today’s money is and has been fiat money since 1971. That has meant, and it still means, that the Fed (which is essentially the world’s central banker because the US dollar is the world’s dominant medium of exchange and storehold of wealth) can more freely create money and credit than in the past. Other central banks can do the same, so this affects all mediums of exchange and storeholds of wealth. For previously explained reasons, doing that is the easiest and most subtle way for governments to alleviate debt burdens and confiscate wealth.**By the way, fiat monetary systems have existed throughout history, so studying those in the past provides invaluable lessons of how they work that can provide clues for how the one we are in will go as the debt cycle progresses.

While the gold-dollar-based system broke down in 1971, the US remained the dominant world power economically, militarily, and in most other respects, and most world trade and capital transactions were done in dollars, so the dollar remained the world’s leading currency that governments, companies, and people wanted to save in despite the fact that it was such a terrible storehold of wealth in the 1970s.

In the 1971-81 period, it paid to be a borrower-debtor because the big devaluation that started in August 1971 had immediate inflationary effects, which were accompanied by big rises in oil and other commodities’ prices and a fiat monetary system that gave central banks the freedom to continue to keep creating credit and keep interest rates low.

The inflation of the 1970s came in two waves driven by two short-term debt cycles and geopolitical shifts. The big easing of monetary policy in 1971 after the delinking with gold got it going. Then,**in 1973, the British Empire and colonialism were breaking down, so there was a big geopolitical shift in the Middle East that led to the first “oil shock” that caused more inflation**. It was mostly a fight about money, as it normally is. More specifically, at that time, the colonized countries of the Middle East (and elsewhere) were overthrowing the colonialists that controlled them and nationalizing the colonialist claims on the assets of the colonized. In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and Libya nationalized most of the oil properties that were owned by the “Seven Sisters” (the seven major oil companies), and in October 1973, war broke out between the Arabs and Israelis. These events led to oil prices rising a lot, which led central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, to pursue highly accommodative monetary policy in order to ease the economic pain of rising prices, which allowed more money growth, which produced more inflation in almost everything, especially in commodities and real estate.**Commodity producers, especially in emerging countries, boomed, so naturally dollars from Europe, the US, and elsewhere began to be lent to emerging countries’ commodities producers, which began their debt-financed booms and bubbles, which contributed to the “stagflations” in the US and most of the world.**

In the early 1970s, a lot of dollars were held in other countries, especially in European countries, so there was the growth of what was called the Eurodollar market. Those dollars had to be lent out. Because there was high inflation in the world due to the previously described currency devaluations, commodity prices were high, so it seemed good to lend to commodity-producing emerging countries. That fueled a boom that created a bubble in these countries, with the lender-creditor to them being US, European, and some Japanese banks.

In the 1970s, there were two short-term money/credit/debt/economic cycles that each transpired in classic ways with the Fed’s decisions to ease and tighten monetary policy driving them, though the second money/credit/debt and inflation surge was much bigger than the first.

In the 1971-74 period, money was easy, inflation, and economic activity rose, and the oil-exporting countries embargoed oil, which sent oil prices and inflation higher. So, from the end of 1973 to 1974 the Fed tightened money and credit, raising interest rates, inverting the yield curve, which sent the markets and the economy into severe declines. That led to a recession. That completed that short-term debt cycle.

**Then it happened again. Easy money and credit following the recession caused inflation and economic activity to pick up and there was a second oil price shock that was due to and caused by internal political and international geopolitical conflicts.**In Iran, the Shah’s domestic order was overthrown, which led to the US embassy being seized and American hostages being held by those who took power. That began the conflict with Iran that remains with us. This development was both inflationary and humiliating for the United States. The charts below show the average interest rate (the average of the 90-day Treasury bill rate and the 10-year Treasury bond rate) and the CPI inflation rate from 1971 through 1981. As you can see, in the 1970s interest rates rose more slowly than inflation rates, so real interest rates were low until they were negative (as low as -4% at certain points, compared to the average up to that point of 2%). These artificially low interest rates relative to inflation rates were great for borrower-debtors and terrible for lender-creditors which encouraged borrowing and buying which drove inflation rates up and interest rates followed until the inflation became so bad that changes had to be made which led to the reverse. You can clearly see the two short-term debt cycles reflected in this chart. The vertical lines in these charts represent January 1980.

**At the same time, workers and labor unions had become stronger, which raised wage inflation and squeezed company profit. As shown in the chart below, labor’s share of revenue had increased from 68% in 1965 to the US historical high of 74% in 1980. That both reflected and influenced the political cycle that accompanied the debt cycle.**

**Enough was enough. The combination of high inflation, weak dollar, bad economic conditions, bad conditions for businesses, and geopolitical crises was intolerable for voters.**

**The debt/money/economic, domestic-political, and international-geopolitical pendulums/orders had swung too far, to their extremes, so big changes were made and conditions were reversed. Pretty much everything changed and moved in the opposite direction. More specifically, in reaction to the uncontrolled inflation, Paul Volcker was appointed chair of the Federal Reserve to shift monetary policy from very easy to extremely tight, and in reaction to the generally terrible conditions that occurred under left-leaning governments, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Helmut Kohl and other right-leaning governments gained control.****In other words, there was one of those classic roughly synchronized debt/economic and political swings that typically occurs because the people’s discontentment with their conditions causes discontentment with the country’s leaders and the party in power.**

**When Paul Volcker was appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve in 1979 to fight inflation, he severely tightened the supply of money and credit growth**, whichled to the tightest money and the highest level of interest rates “since the birth of Jesus Christ” (according to German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt).

**The chart below shows the CPI inflation rate (as a simple proxy for inflation), the average of the three-month and the 10-year interest rate (as a simple proxy for interest rates) and the yield curve (the three-month rate minus the 10-year rate—as a simple proxy for the tightness of monetary policy). From these charts, you can see the two short-term credit cycles in the 1970s and you can see the next one emerging in the early 1980s. You can see that money was made very tight money to fight inflation around 1980.**

**In addition to the monetary tightening, high real rates, and falling inflation there was a shift from liberal to conservative labor policies. Thatcher in the UK, Reagan in the US, and Kohl in Germany (all moderate conservatives) led strong fights against labor inflation and labor unions that cut labor’s share of the revenue pie, which reduced inflation and raised corporate profits. These conservative leaders also cut taxes on income and corporate profits and pursued tougher geopolitical policies.**

The new Iranian leadership released the hostages exactly as Reagan took office in response to his threat of severe consequences if they didn’t. Thatcher went to war with Argentina and won; the war was over Argentina’s attempt to take the Falkland Islands, which were a group of small, nothing-special, British-controlled colonial islands. And Reagan accelerated the Cold War with the Soviet Union, which eventually ended the Soviet Union.

**The strong moves by the American central government and central bank changed the flow of money and power and the direction of most everything. The markets respected strength and loved the combination of falling interest rates, falling inflation rates, high real interest rates, improving profit margins, and falling tax rates.**It was a capitalist’s delight.I remember the changes in policies and the changes in mood very well, especially the willingness of these leaders to have the fights to do the difficult things, even when doing these difficult things was painful.

**As a result of all of these things, the 1980s were more opposite than similar to the 1970s—i.e., it was a decade of disinflationary growth, strong stock and bond prices in developed countries, and debt bubbles popping leading to classic inflationary depressions in emerging countries.**

Throughout this period, I was deeply involved with these markets and the circumstances that drove them, which gave me the perspective that allowed me to identify great investment opportunities and to describe the mechanics of the process in the last chapter. But that’s not to say that I fully understood all the mechanics behind these big moves from the start. In 1982, I had been dead wrong because I expected the big debt crisis to cause big debt problems for American banks, the stock market, and the American and world economies. I was wrong because I failed to anticipate how forceful the change in global financial flows away from emerging markets and into American markets would be and how well the Federal Reserve and the regulators would protect the American banks. That failure provided me with painful great lessons about the need to watch capital flows and how to do it, about how to diversify to reduce my risks without reducing my returns, and about how to be humble. That painful experience, like my others, turned out to be great because it educated me, which radically improved my and Bridgewater’s performance over the next 30+ years.

**As you can see, all these big movements in markets and economies that had big effects on politics, geopolitics, and technology development were driven by money/debt/capital flows. For that reason, I decided to become an expert on capital flows.**

**The decade from 1971-72 to 1981-82 was a very painful and very classic decade of debt restructurings and debt monetizations that played out following the archetypal template previously described. As is quite typical, the decade that followed it was more opposite than similar.**

**From 1982 to 1990: Falling Inflation, Strong Growth, and Levering Up; from One Debt Crisis to Another; Still Operating with an MP2 Monetary Policy**

**The 1979-82 monetary policy changes shifted the environment from benefiting borrower-debtors, as it had in the early 1970s, to benefiting lender-creditors, as it did in the 1980s. As shown below, it lowered the inflation rate, which lowered interest rates while keeping real interest rates relatively high in the 1980s.**The charts below update the previous chart, showing interest rates and inflation rates through 1990 so you can see how different the 1980s were from the 1970s. The monetary policy moves that ended the 1970s’ decade-long period of rising inflation, rising nominal interest rates, and low real interest rates created the 1980s’ period of falling inflation and its relatively high real interest rate environment, which began a long period of falling interest rates. With those things happening and profit margins widening, the 1980s were more opposite than similar to the 1970s. They were almost ideal for the markets and the economy because strong growth was accompanied by falling inflation, falling interest rates, and big stock and bond market gains in the US and most developed countries. As shown below from the early 1980s to the early 1990s inflation had fallen a lot and interest rates and the tightness of credit had fallen more, thus shifting the environment from one that was great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors to one that was slightly good for borrower-debtors and slightly bad for lender-creditors.

**In the 1980s, the previously described tight money and short dollar (debt) conditions drove the dollar higher until 1985 when there was the “Plaza Accord,” which was an agreement to get the dollar to fall, which it would have done anyway because the large current account deficit and the large demand for dollars were unsustainable.**Throughout these years, there were big swings in interest rates and inflation that felt massive as you lived through them. But the overall dynamic is clear (seen in the prior chart): in the 1980s, inflation rates fell as a result of the tightness of money in the 1980-82 period, then interest rates also fell, following inflation down but keeping real interest rates relatively high.**Those high real rates were great for lender-creditors and terrible for borrower-debtors. And then when nominal interest rates fell after inflation began to fall, it was great for bond and stock prices because the discount rate used to value future cash flows fell, and the lower rates made borrowing easier. All of this was good for economic activity. And along with declining inflation it created an ideal set of circumstances for US markets and the economy.**

**But where was this transfer of wealth from? It came from the** **borrower-debtors who held high-interest debt liabilities and debt assets, especially emerging market borrower-debtors who had borrowed in dollars and had their earnings in local currency, and those that lent to them (especially US multinational banks). The cycle that they experienced was classic. The high interest rates not only made dollar debt more expensive to service, but it also helped drive a rally in the dollar. Those countries that had debt liabilities and debt assets denominated in the tight foreign currency (US dollars) that they couldn’t print faced debt default problems, while those countries that had debts in currencies that they could print had their currencies plunge in value due to the money printing. In other words, that produced monetary inflation (i.e., inflation in the currencies they could print) and monetary deflations in the currencies that they owed and couldn’t print.**

**The debt bubbles of the late 1970s turned into classic debt busts when there was a big tightening that tortured both sides with an ugly deleveraging in the 1980s. Those countries facing debt busts, including many emerging countries, experienced a classic full debt cycle over these 20+ years that included inflationary depressions because there were great debt monetizations that depreciated the value of the money and debt denominated in their local currencies while they had deflationary debt default problems in the foreign currency debt that they couldn’t monetize.**That cycle transpired in accordance with the template laid out in the last chapter. The debt bust for these countries created a classic “lost decade” with inflationary depressions in these countries and classic debt workouts for the banks that had lent to them. Eventually, in 1991, there was a classic end to the debt bust that occurred in the way described in the last chapter—i.e., the local currency debt was devalued and the foreign currency debt was restructured. Also, near the end of the cycle, most overly indebted governments sold their government assets to build foreign exchange reserves, and they linked their domestic currencies to the dollar, completing their Big Debt Cycles.

**Of course, each country experienced its own cycle and we will explore a few of these cases, notably China and Japan in Chapters 13 and 14. But there were also important geopolitical shifts during this time that impacted the big cycle for all nations in important ways.**

**During the 1980s, the geopolitical landscape changed as the Soviet Union fell, China rose, and wealth gaps increased. These changes were mostly driven by the Soviet Union’s inadequate financial and economic system.**More specifically, the United States had much more money and productivity than the Soviet Union and so it out-competed the Soviet Union in most everything; notably Reagan had the US outspend and outcompete the Soviet Union in military spending. That led to the Soviet Union’s debt, economic, currency, economic, political, and geopolitical collapses, which were manifest in the fall of the Berlin Wall in late 1989 and the official collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991.

**Deng Xiaoping coming to power in China in 1978 brought about big changes in the 1980s that had big impacts on shaping the changing world order up until now. Deng’s ascension was the beginning of China’s big money/credit/debt/economic cycle. Before then, there was little credit/debt/savings/economic activity. Deng changed that by creating China’s “open door” and “reform” policies, which bought in foreign capitalists with their money and their talent. This swing from pure and extreme communism to market-oriented, capitalism-infused “communism” had a huge impact on China and the rest of the world. That shift unleashed a wave of productivity that led** China to become the greatest trading and manufacturing power ever because it was able to produce many tradable goods at much lower costs than could be produced elsewhere. That had a huge impact on China and other countries, as we will explore later. Because of my relationships in China and my financial market skills I was able to contribute to and watch up close China’s big transformation during this period. I will detail China’s Big Cycle evolution in much more detail in Chapter 13. Suffice it to say for now that China became extremely productive, to a degree that it swamped the world with attractively priced items, earned a ton of money, and lent a ton of money to Americans and others so they could buy Chinese goods. So, Americans got the goods and the Chinese got Americans’ debt and I’m still trying to work out who got the better or worse deal.

**In the 1980s the most important big inventions were laptop computers, lithium-ion batteries, the internet, search engines, the digitalization of thinking, apps, DNA profiling, and big advancements were made in GPS, video-game consoles, microprocessors, and satellite television. Americans remained the leading inventors and investors while other countries were the leading producers.****Most importantly in the 1980s, the technology development force, in which entrepreneurs supported by capitalists, led to the internet being developed which led to the launching of the World Wide Web in 1991 which led to the dot-com bubble emerging in the 1990s’ Big Debt Cycle which led to the dot-com bubble bursting in 2000 when the Fed tightened money to rein in the rapid debt-financed speculation on the dot-com miracle.**

**From 1990 Until 2000: More Disinflation and Leveraging Up, Which Led to a Bubble**

**In brief, as with all decades, the 1990s brought many developments that seemed giant at the time and are barely memorable in retrospect. I wonder if I am giving you too much detail or not enough. To me, at the time these events were unfolding, every minute seemed like an eternity; now I struggle to remember them, which led to my principle that “everything seems bigger up close.” That has helped me keep things in perspective and navigate these changes.**

**Looking back, I am happy to see that I did well navigating them, which I know is because of what I learned and am trying to convey in this study. In brief, the changes I’d highlight are:**

- **The Soviet Union fell in 1991.**
- **Iraq invaded Kuwait to get its oil and the first Gulf War happened in 1990-91, which contributed to rising oil prices, tight money, and a classic recession from mid-1990 to early 1991.**
- **European currencies that were linked together in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) in 1979 broke apart in September 1992. Then Europe went from a bunch of independent countries to a European Union in 1993 and a currency union with the creation of the euro in 1999. They made these choices to unify despite the unimaginable challenge of unifying such different and independent people who had a long history of fighting because in this globalized world they were not viable economic or geopolitical powers if operating separately as individual nations. It remains a highly fragmented union that is declining in competitiveness.**
- **In 1997-98 there was the Asian financial crisis, which, while concentrated in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea affected all countries in the region in the “Asian Contagion.” As is typical, these debt/economic crises led to internal social and political conflicts in all those countries to varying degrees. The worst were in Indonesia, then Malaysia, then Thailand, and the least bad were South Korea and China. These crises were all very classic following the previously described process and exhibiting all the classic leading indicators.**
- **Through most of the decade, globalization and connectivity through the internet were considered good things and flourished.**
- **Climate change started to get attention as an issue.**
- **As is typical, in the 1990s amazing new technology was developed, most importantly, Wi-Fi, smart phones, and e-commerce, and further big advancements were made in GPS, video games, and perhaps most significantly artificial intelligence.**
- **As in all big cycles, all big inventions were financed and accompanied by debt and equity cycles (e.g., the steam engine and the railroads come to mind). In this case, the early development led to excitement that turned into a bubble (in 1995-99), which contributed to an overheating economy and rising inflation which led the central bank (in this case, the Fed) to tighten monetary policy that burst the bubble (in this case, in March 2000) which produced a short-term cyclical downturn in the markets and the economy which ended when the tighter credit and the downturn reduced inflation which led the Fed to ease monetary policy in the classic way.**

**Also in this period, President Clinton succeeded in transforming a large budget deficit into a budget surplus, so it’s one of a number of cases worth remembering to help us think about how to handle things well. There are a few key elements to know about that case which are:**

- **It was done at a time when unemployment was falling and the economy and profit growth were strong, which both brought in tax revenue and allowed the fiscal tightening that is a growth-slowing, inflation-reducing force be well-absorbed. Said differently, the fiscal tightening was counter-cyclical.**
- **The increases in taxes and cuts in spending were significant but moderate.\[10\]**
- **It was done in a bipartisan way (which was key to getting it done) and led to the Balanced Budget Amendment of 1997.**
- **It was eventually and repeatedly overridden by a simple majority because it was simply a legislative statute. That is unlike a constitutional amendment, which is what Germany imposed at the end of the Weimar Republic’s hyperinflation and has worked ever since.**

**From 2000 to 2008: From the Bubble Bursting to Deleveraging to Releveraging Up to Creating a New Bubble That Popped and Led to the Great Financial Crisis and Debt Monetization**

- **I remember Y2K as the crisis that was supposed to come but didn’t, like so many others, yet what was unexpected happened.**
- **The debt/asset bubble burst in March 2000, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall by around 80%.**
- **On September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked which began the war on terror which led to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq**,but it remained a period of very little conflict between the great powers. This happening on the heels of the debt bubble bursting added to problems, which contributed to weakness.
- **These things led to a recession which reduced inflation and led to the next short-term debt cyclical easing of credit which then led to a recovery.**
- **In 2006 to 2007 another classic bubble developed. It was a big one, called the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). It was led by the mortgage/real estate sector being financed by a lot of debt, which led to big debt problems that spread quickly to affect almost everyone in all countries, like the Great Depression in the 1929-39 period did.**
- **What started with the real estate sector spread to both other financial assets and the real economy—unemployment hit 10% in late 2009 and major stock indices were down over 50% from their peak in 2007.**

**In the charts below, you can see the short-term debt cycles, reflected in the unemployment rate and equity prices.**

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E12AQG7JEf54VfMuw/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1738243415877?e=1749686400&v=beta&t=BICkxQFGEHit09G1gkKL-WQA4wU3uYo-ImGc7Iutfpg)

- **That drove interest rates to 0% (and below) around the world. Hitting zero eliminated central banks’ ability to ease and stimulate the next wave of credit/debt/economic expansion through interest rate cuts, so central banks turned to printing money and financial assets, also known as debt monetization, quantitative easing, and what I call Monetary Policy 3 (MP3) because it classically follows MP2, which is interest-rate-controlled money and credit growth.**

This time, and classically at such times, central banks did the “printing of money” (expanding their balance sheets) and buying and guaranteeing of debt to make up for the shortfall in the private sector’s demand for debt assets and to keep interest rates artificially low. They always do that even if it doesn’t make economic sense because their objective is to stabilize markets and economies, not to make a profit.**During this part of the Big Debt Cycle, the central bank becomes the big buyer and big owner of debt (the big creditor) rather than private investors. Because the central bank doesn’t mind having losses from holding the debt that has reduced in value, and because it doesn’t worry about getting squeezed, it can continue to prevent a debt crisis by printing money and buying debt.****It is willing and able to lose lots of money and have a negative net worth to protect the government’s and the private sector’s ability to spend even when their finances are bad. This can take place by debt monetization or quantitative easing, which are essentially the same things, though slightly different.\[11\]** One can see it occur via changes in central bank balance sheets by looking at their holdings of debt assets that were acquired by providing those who sold the debt assets to central banks with cash and credit. In the United States, Europe, and Japan, they own roughly 15%, 30%, and 40% of central government debt, respectively, and roughly 5%, 10%, and 20% of the total debt, respectively. In the charts that follow you can see this process unfold in the US. See the timing of the hitting of the 0% interest rate bottom and the printing-of-money expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. This ended Monetary Policy 2 (i.e., the interest-rate-driven policy to balance the supply and demand for money and credit via interest rate changes) to Monetary Policy 3 (which is for the central bank to make up the shortage of demand by purchasing long-term debt assets and expanding the Fed’s balance sheet). In addition to this happening in the US, it happened in most other countries.

**In the 27 years from 1981 (when interest rates hit “the highest levels since the birth of Jesus Christ”) to 2008 (when interest rates hit 0%), the Big Cycle unfolded with four short-term credit/debt/economic cycles unfolding in it, and when interest rates hit 0%, the interest-rate-driven-monetary policy (which I call MP2) had to be replaced by the quantitative-easing-driven monetary policy (MP3).**

Having studied the big cycles from 1918 to 1945, from when World War I ended, and the new monetary system that began when World War II ended, eight years before MP3 started we put into our investment system rules that if there was a debt contraction crisis and short-term Treasury and fed funds interest rates nearly hit 0%, we would bet on a bad contraction until the central government and the central banks became very stimulative in the ways they became stimulative in March 1933. That served us well in 2008 because we understood it, so we made a lot of money when others lost a lot of money. I saw the big picture of the Big Cycle in interest rates and debt. I saw that since the 1979-82 top in interest rates every cyclical peak and every cyclical trough in interest rates was lower than the one before it until they nearly hit 0% as debt levels increased, which made me wonder what would happen when interest rates hit 0% and let me see that when that happened in the past (in 1933) the central bank printed money and bought the debt. I also saw that the declines of real and nominal interest rates shifted conditions from those that benefited lender-creditors back to those that favored borrower-debtors, which allowed debt/income levels to rise. This downward trend in interest rates and increase in debt burdens set the stage for the next major shift in monetary policy, which we will explore in the next chapter.

**Here are some notable events in internal and external orders, technology, and acts of nature during this 2000 to 2008 period:**

- **Despite the tech bubble bursting, the internet and its effects continued to grow rapidly while many leaders were shaken and new players grew and boomed.**Social media (e.g., Facebook and YouTube) began in 2004 and 2005. The iPhone was released in 2007, which created the “everything device” because of all the things it has on it (phone, camera, and many tools in apps). It was a period in which the internet and computing impacted just about every aspect of daily life. Americans and the US system were behind these far more than others, and then China began to copy and compete effectively.
- **Domestically, political polarization in US politics began to increase, with Democrats turning away from the more centrist 1990s toward leaders more on the left like Barack Obama (though it’s striking how by today’s standards he’s a moderate Democrat), and Republicans eventually turning away from George W. Bush for not being sufficiently populist.**As is classic at this stage in the cycle, media took sides and propaganda was used, so US media became more polarized and polarizing as well.
- **Chinese and other emerging market producers became more competitive** and most everything manufactured, from everyday goods (apparel, toys, appliances, etc.) in the 1990s and 2000s to cars and hi-tech goods now, was inexpensively produced by the Chinese. It was wonderful for the Chinese sellers who earned a lot of money and for the American and other buyers who benefited from the good-value purchases that the Chinese offered and the Chinese sellers lending the money to the US to fund its deficits. This dynamic worked essentially the same way for the Chinese as it worked for Japanese goods manufacturers and their customers. In this case, it was the Chinese who were earning and lending money (e.g., buying US bonds) and who experienced protectionism because it put a lot of manufacturing workers in the US out of work. China, like Japan before it, put a sizable amount of its earnings into its foreign exchange reserves, which led it to buy a lot of US Treasuries because the dollar was the world’s leading reserve currency. That enabled the US government to ramp up deficits and debts without too much consequence (at least so far) while also helping to keep global goods inflation down, which allowed central banks to keep monetary policy easier and contributed to bull markets in stocks. This dynamic was good for the capitalists who owned the means of production and not good for the workers who were displaced.
- **The European Union and NATO continued to take in more Eastern European countries and move closer to the Russian border.**
- **Global warming continued**, with several notable impactful acts of nature, like Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005, raising more concerns about it.

### Chapter 11: The History and Lessons from Phase 3, from 2008 to 2020—Fiat Money and Debt Monetization (Monetary Policy 3)

**In the 2008-20 period:**

- **There were two short-term credit/debt/economic cycles. In each, the amount of debt creation and the amount of debt monetization was greater than the one before it.**

- **More specifically, in late 2008 the interest-rate-driven monetary system (which I call Monetary Policy 2) couldn’t be used to create money and credit anymore because interest rates hit 0% and, because that could not continue, central banks had to make up for inadequate free-market demand to buy these debt assets by printing money and buying them. As a result, a new monetary system (MP3)—where central banks buy large quantities of debt and provide credit funded with their balance sheets, which is essentially printing money, debt monetization, and quantitative easing—replaced MP2.**While there are slight technical differences between these things that I won’t digress into, they are essentially the same thing, which is **the central bank creating and providing money and credit to the government and marketplace to make up for an inadequate amount of private market lending. I call this Monetary Policy 3.**That began in 2008 and was the first time this monetary policy was used since 1933 (i.e., 75 years earlier). Such moves to debt monetization have occurred throughout history and are symptomatic of being in the late phase of the long-term debt cycle.
- **While the 2008 crisis began in the US, it spilled over into a global crisis, and virtually all developed central banks transitioned from MP2 to MP3 (and many emerging market central banks did too). These actions pushed up the prices of financial assets and pushed down the yields for lender-creditors and created cheap money for borrower-creditors. The stimulative monetary policies that flowed through the system further benefited the rich who had financial assets. The government bailing out the banks contributed to the perception that the system favored the rich which heightened animosity toward the rich capitalists, especially those who seemed to cause the problems and got away free and made a lot of money. Ultimately, the US was able to manage its private sector debt problems and engineer an economic recovery, even as public debt kept rising (effectively kicking the can down the road; more on that later).**
- **The continuing increases in imports of Chinese- and other foreign-produced goods took away American jobs at the same time as new technology was taking away jobs. These forces contributed to the hollowing out of the middle class, which increased tensions between the “elites/capitalists” and the proletariat. China came to hold a lot of US debt assets and the US lost lots of jobs in uncompetitive businesses, which contributed to the creation of large wealth and values differences in the US, anti-China sentiment, and great political and social polarity in the US. People who were hurting economically believed that the “elites” running things and the system were maximizing their profits at the expense of American workers. That, along with the 2008 debt/economic crisis and the fact that the government bailed out financial institutions and benefited those who held financial assets more than it was perceived to help the common man, also had a big impact on domestic conflict. As a result, the financial crisis led to a shift toward populism of the right (e.g., Tea Party movement) and populism of the left (e.g., Occupy Wall Street).**

**Conflict between the politically and socially right and the politically and socially left became greater in response to growing wealth and values differences in most countries, especially in the United States. In the US, the rise of populism of the right, especially among the non-college-educated, non-urban white population, led to Donald Trump’s election in 2016. That changed the American approach to the US and world orders in profound ways that wouldn’t be understood for many years (and, at the time of my writing in January 2025, still are not fully understood). I will describe these changes more extensively at the end of Chapter 12. However, said succinctly, President Trump produced a shift in the domestic, international, economic, political, and geopolitical orders to be much more autocratic, top-down, rightist, nationalistic, protectionist, militaristic, and aggressive. These shifts in policies to ones that are characterized by increased confrontation and reduced levels cooperation and that are also reflected in the breakdowns of multilateral organizations and increased unilateralism are analogous to those that occurred in the periods before World War I and World War II and in many times throughout history.**

- **Trump’s election led to big tax cuts for companies and individuals, the appointment of three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, big cuts in government regulations, the renegotiation of trade and military support deals with other countries, big tariffs, and immigration restrictions. Cutting income and capital gains taxes and reducing regulations helped stock prices rise and the economy grow, so the unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5% by the end of 2019.**
- **Then COVID, the first big pandemic since the Spanish flu** **in 1918-19, came along in early 2020**.

These developments and their outcomes (which, for those interested, are explained in more detail in my book *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order* ) are analogous to those in the early 1930s. They are not unexpected if one understands the Big Cycle.

**The big debt, political, geopolitical cycles and the relationships between them have been unfolding in pretty classic ways so they have been contributors to the overall Big Cycle transpiring in pretty classic ways. What we saw and are now seeing are these three big cycles transpiring along with big disruptions coming from nature (e.g., the pandemic and climate change) around advances in technologies, especially artificial intelligence (that should greatly improve productivity and be disruptive in other ways, too).**

**In Europe, events closely followed the template that I laid out previously, though Europe at the time consisted of 17 countries in the Eurozone, some debtors, and some creditors, which made the process more difficult.**The template of the cycle that I described in earlier chapters played out, in that the overly indebted countries that had their debts denominated in a currency they couldn’t print (the euro) suffered in the way I described, and the European Central Bank handled the situation in the typical way. I will use Greece as an example of how the cycle transpired and what happened to the heavily indebted countries that couldn’t print their own currency because they were tied to the euro. To show how the cycle tracked the template, I will restate what typically happens and then show what actually happened.

**1) The private sector and central government got deeply in debt.**In the 10 years prior to the 2008 financial crisis, Greece’s total debt as a percent of GDP increased by around 90% from 160% to 250%. The impetus was Greece joining the euro, making the country’s debt assets seem much safer (no devaluation risk, backstop from the ECB). Capital flowed in from across the Eurozone, and debt increased in every sector.

**2) The private sector suffered a debt crisis, and the central government got deeper in debt to help.**When the 2008 financial crisis hit, the Greek government responded with stimulus and bigger deficits that added to its debt. Because they couldn’t monetize debt, this worsened rather than alleviated the debt crisis, so Greece entered a deep depression.

**3) The central government experienced a debt squeeze in which the free-market demand for its debt fell short of the supply of it. That created a government debt problem.**The debt crisis became an acute public sector debt crisis in late 2009 and the Greek government revealed that it had been substantially underreporting its own debt and deficits.

**4) The selling of the government’s debt led to a) a free-market-driven tightening of money and credit, which led to b) a weakening of the economy, c) downward pressure on the currency, and d) declining reserves as the central bank attempted to defend the currency.**The obviously crushing debt burdens and the reporting fraud made Greek debt much less desirable to foreign investors, so they became sellers of Greek debt and Greece needed more stimulus to offset its depression-like conditions. Unavoidably, Greece pursued austerity, which caused the depression to get deeper and made government finances worse (as tax receipts dried up). The result was a massive sell-off in Greek debt, which raised interest rates more and worsened the debt problem even more. By 2012, short-term interest rates in Greece spiked to over 70%. Greek debt increased another roughly 70% of GDP, a combination of austerity not working and GDP declining (a dynamic I call an “ugly deleveraging”).

**5)** ***When there is a debt crisis, and interest rates can’t be lowered (i.e.., they hit 0%) the central bank “prints” (creates) money and buys bonds to ease credit and make it easier to service debt.***Actually, it doesn’t literally print money; it essentially borrows reserves from commercial banks that it pays a very short-term interest rate on.The ECB stepped in with huge amounts of crisis money printing and guaranteeing of debt, and expanded its balance sheet just as the Fed did. But that wasn’t nearly enough, and it became politically toxic as the more financially stable European countries decried this bailout of Greece, worrying that one way or another they would have to pay for it.

**6) If interest rates rise, the central bank loses money because the interest rate that it has to pay on its liabilities is greater than the interest rate it receives on the debt assets it bought.**We did not see this dynamic in this case. This typically happens when the central bank has purchased significant government debt at a fixed rate, financed via creating bank reserves that pay floating short rates, and then is forced to raise short rates because of flight from the currency or an inflation problem creating a negative net interest margin for the central bank and forcing the central bank to continue printing money to cover those losses. In the case of the European debt crisis, we saw the central bank purchase significant government debt and finance it via creating bank reserves, but in that period, Europe as a whole did not see an inflation problem or currency flight, so the ECB was not forced to raise interest rates and never had a negative net interest margin problem.

**7) Debts are restructured and devalued, reducing debt burdens.**It became clear that Greece needed a debt restructuring, and the money the ECB was spending on Greece was likely to lead to losses. There was even a chance Greece would leave the euro. Meanwhile, the exceedingly tight credit in Greece was crushing the economy. Ultimately, what was called the Troika (ECB, IMF, and the European Commission) engineered a debt restructuring paired with a bailout. In 2012, that restructuring reduced debt burdens by about 50% of GDP.

**8) Extraordinary taxes are raised, and capital flees the country and/or capital controls are imposed.**There was a bank run assmart citizens pulled money out of Greek banks. Needing money, new taxes were introduced, and there was discussion of capital controls, though none were imposed.

**9) There is a transition from a severely devalued currency to a stable currency.**This restructuring was enough to end the most acute phase of the crisis. Greece stayed in the euro. Reducing debt through an explicit restructuring is usually the more painful, drawn-out path. Greece took years to recover, but it did as they all eventually do. If Greece and other overly indebted countries could have printed the currencies they owed, they would have gone down the classic path that was previously described for countries in that position.

**Here are some other key developments:**

- **Regarding international relations, there were big resets economically and geopolitically that led to more allied and enemy geopolitical relationships that were analogous to those that occurred in the 1933-38 period (and numerous prior analogous periods). I won’t digress into these because that would draw us into past Big Cycles, but if you want to get into them, they are covered in my book** ***Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order.***
- **Climate change started to get a lot of attention.**In 2015, there was the Paris Agreement, which initiated an attempt to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Climate change is a big force that is very costly and will reshape what the human and natural worlds look like that I won’t digress into because the digression would be too great.
- **Regarding new technologies, computer chips rapidly advanced, cryptocurrencies were launched, self-driving-car features started rolling out, movie streaming became more widespread, 4G (and then 5G) wireless began, reusable rocket ships began to be used, and many more advances were made—too many to sensibly digress into here and now.**

\[1\] If you are interested in looking at many more cases over many more years, I suggest you look at my book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*,which examines 48 big debt crisis cases over the last 100 years, and at *Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order*, which examines many cases affected by many influences over the last 500 years. You can also see updated measures of the current conditions and the world as a whole in my [Great Powers Index](https://economicprinciples.org/downloads/DalioRay_Power_Index_Appendix.pdf).

\[2\] While the prices of risk-free debt will go up as interest rates go down, when central banks are stimulative and these default-free assets have appeal, interest rates will eventually become too low and debt assets will cease to be attractive.

\[3\] In the years prior to 1997, I am estimating the real bond yield based on the nominal yield and an estimate of market 10-year inflation expectations.

\[4\] If it were free of tax risk, it would be a perfect estimation of the real return you can certainly get.

\[5\] I look at both the short rate minus the long rate and the short rate divided by the long rate as measures of the yield curve for reasons I won’t digress into.

\[6\] The yield curve was typically upward-sloping, with short rates about 1% below long rates and 70% of long rates.

\[7\] In my book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*, I didn’t call this phase Monetary Policy 1 because the monetary policy that I was used to was the interest-rate-driven monetary policy, and so I called that Monetary Policy 1. Upon reflection, I decided to change the numbers.

\[8\] [https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2020/changing-relationship-trade-americas-gold-reserves](https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/regional-economist/first-quarter-2020/changing-relationship-trade-americas-gold-reserves)

\[9\] There are two other types of monetary policy that take place at the later stages of the long-term debt cycle that I call Monetary Policy 3 (MP3) and Monetary Policy 4 (MP4). I will touch on them later in this study. If you are interested in learning more about them, I describe them using a slightly different numbering system beginning on Page 36 of my book *Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises*, which you can get in PDF form [here](https://www.principles.com/big-debt-crises).

\[10\] The top tax rate went from 31% to 39.6%, the top marginal corporate tax rate went from 34% to 35%, and gasoline taxes were raised by about 4 cents per gallon, with total tax collections equaling about 19% of GDP annually (a 13% increase compared to what they were before). Spending was cut by 3% of GDP, equaling a cut in the budget deficit of 5% of GDP from the beginning of the plan (the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation) being enacted in 1993 to when the deficit shrank to a surplus in 1998.

\[11\] Both are intended to reduce debt problems and stimulate economic activity by the central bank buying government bonds. In the case of quantitative easing (QE) the central bank buys the bonds or other securities from private investors whereas in the case of debt monetization the central bank buys the bonds directly from the government. That normally doesn’t make much difference, though it can when the banking system is impaired.
