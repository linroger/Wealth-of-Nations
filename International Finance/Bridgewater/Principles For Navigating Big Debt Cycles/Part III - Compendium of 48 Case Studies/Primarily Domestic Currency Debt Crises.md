# **48 Debt Crises**

This section goes through each of the 48 debt crises we examined, so that you can live through them on your own. This case list was generated by us systematically screening for periods of deleveraging across major countries over the last century focusing on those cases with a real GDP decline of more than 3%—as well as triangulating that list against the work of others like the IMF and prominent academics. This by no means encapsulates all the debt crises that have occurred over the past century, but it provides a good sample of debt crises and deleveragings that highlight the key similarities (as discussed in Part 1) as well as the differences.

Each case includes a simple computer-generated text analysis of what happened along with a bunch of charts showing the basic stats. These "auto-text" comments are observations of the basic stats and they present a very simplified version of our algorithmic analysis. I am providing you with these to show you how, by viewing cases through a simplified lens (based on the even more simplified template explained in Part 1), the important things pop. Note how the perspective you gain by seeing these situations in a simple way contrasts with the perspective you get when viewing the more complete blizzard of details described in Part 2. I hope seeing the cases at this level helps you more easily see the principle-level commonalities and differences explained in the "Archetypal Big Debt Crisis" template.

### **United States 1926–1936 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United States experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1926 and 1936.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 1926 and 1929, the United States experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. By the bubble's end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 125% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United States's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. Aided by that rising debt, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 13%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 31% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 250 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1929 to 1933. High debt levels left the United States vulnerable to a shock which came in the form of the 1929 stock market crash. The United States suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 26%), in stock prices (falling by 84%) and in home prices (falling by 24%). Unemployment rates increased by 23%. The United States's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United States needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 98% (26% annualized), driven by a mix of falling real incomes, deflation, and interest payments financed with new debt.

**\*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.**

### **United States 1926–1936 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1933. In terms of monetary policy, the government broke the peg to gold, M0 increased by 6% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -5% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United States was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 8 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it provided liquidity and directly purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 8% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 3%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 14% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 70% (21% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven primarily by rising real incomes and to a lesser extent by inflation. It took 7 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 25 years.

The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of the United States, as it helped set the stage for FDR, whom many people consider a populist leader, to take power.

# **United Kingdom 1927–1936 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1927 and 1936.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Unlike many other cases, the United Kingdom didn't experience a broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did build up a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 210% of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case, the debt was in the United Kingdom's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1929 to 1931. High debt levels left the United Kingdom vulnerable to a shock which came in the form of ripples from a stock crash in the US and the early Great Depression. The United Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 10%), and in stock prices (falling by 61%). Unemployment rates increased by 7%. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 13% (6% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by falling real incomes. This was partially offset by paying down existing debt.

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly shorter than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1931. In terms of monetary policy, the government broke the peg to gold, M0 increased by 2% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -8% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United Kingdom was not aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 1 out of 9 classic policy levers. This and other stimulative measures helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 4% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 3%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 8% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 29% (5% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven primarily by paying down existing debt and to a lesser extent by rising real incomes. This was partially offset by interest payments financed with new debt. It took 5 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 8 years.

# **Japan 1925–1936 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Japan experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1925 and 1936.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Unlike many other cases, Japan didn't experience a broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did build up a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 65% of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case, the debt was in Japan's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1927 to 1931. High debt levels left Japan vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 1929 global stock market crash. Japan suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%), and in stock prices (falling by 47%). Japan's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Japan needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 36% (8% annualized).

**\*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1931. In terms of monetary policy, the government broke the peg to gold, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 2%, and real FX averaged -26% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Japan was somewhat aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 3 out of 9 classic policy levers. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 4.7% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 3.9%). During this phase, debt as a % of GDP fell by 18% (4% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth.

The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Japan, as it helped set the stage for Hideki Tojo, whom many people consider a populist leader, to take power.

### **France 1926–1938 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, France experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1926 and 1938.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 1926 and 1929, France experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth and strong equity returns. Debts actually declined by 13% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis level of 205% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in France's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. Growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 9%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 45% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1929 to 1936. High debt levels left France vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of ripples from a stock crash in the US and the early Great Depression. France suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 17%), and in stock prices (falling by 57%). France's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though France needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was roughly flat through this period.

### **France 1926–1938 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1936. In terms of monetary policy, the government broke the peg to gold, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 2%, and real FX averaged -4% during the stimulative phase. Importantly, policy makers allowed inflation to run high (averaging 10% during this period), which boosted nominal growth and helped reduce the domestic debt burden. Over the cycle, France was somewhat aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 3 out of 9 classic policy levers. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 15% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 4%). During this phase, debt as a % of GDP fell by 37% (15% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher inflation. It took 21 years before real GDP reached its prior peak.

# **United Kingdom 1941–1967 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom experienced a classic wartime deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1941 and 1967. As is typical for winners of big wars, the United Kingdom experienced a brief postwar recession as the economy transitioned away from war production, and a more orderly deleveraging.

### **The War Phase**

Unlike the typical case that entails a bubble, this debt crisis had its roots in WW2. During the war, the United Kingdom borrowed a lot of money to finance its big fiscal deficit, shifted much of its economy to war production, and shifted much of its workforce to the armed services and war production. For these reasons, the economic stats are not reflective of typical economic linkages. Through the war, debts rose sharply. In this case, the debt was in the United Kingdom's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. Aided by wartime spending, growth was strong through this period (at 6%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 10%). Meanwhile, strong asset returns (equities averaged 16% annualized returns over the war period) helped to stimulate growth.

### **The Post-War Phase**

As the war neared an end, the United Kingdom entered a postwar recession, which ran from 1943 to 1947. Since the United Kingdom won the war, its post-war slump was less bad than it was for the losers. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 15%). As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 102% (25% annualized) as incomes declined and as the government continued to shoulder war-related costs (with a peak fiscal deficit of 31% of GDP during the ugly period).

#### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1947. In terms of monetary policy, the government devalued the currency versus gold by 30%, M0 actually decreased by 8% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 1%, and real FX averaged -10% during the stimulative phase. Importantly, policy makers allowed inflation to run high (averaging 4% during this period), which boosted nominal growth and helped reduce the domestic debt burden. This and other stimulative measures helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 7% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 2%). During this phase, unemployment rates were flat and debt as a % of GDP fell by 139% (7% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher inflation. It took 10 years before real GDP reached its prior peak.

### **United States 1943–1951 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United States experienced a classic wartime deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1943 and 1951. As is typical for winners of big wars, the United States experienced a brief postwar recession as the economy transitioned away from war production, and a more orderly deleveraging.

### **The War Phase**

Unlike the typical case that entails a bubble, this debt crisis had its roots in WW2. During the war, the United States borrowed a lot of money to finance its big fiscal deficit, shifted much of its economy to war production, and shifted much of its workforce to the armed services and war production. For these reasons, the economic stats are not reflective of typical economic linkages. Through the war, debts rose to 150% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United States's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. Aided by wartime spending, growth was strong through this period (at 13%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 19%). Meanwhile, strong asset returns (equities averaged 15% annualized returns over the war period) helped to stimulate growth.

### **The Post-War Phase**

When the fighting ended, the United States entered a postwar recession, which ran from 1945 to 1950. Since the United States won the war, its post-war slump was less bad than it was for the losers. Nevertheless, the United States suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 13%). Unemployment rates increased by 5%. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United States needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was roughly flat through this period.

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1950. In terms of monetary policy, M0 actually decreased by 0.9% of GDP and interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 1% during the stimulative phase. The central bank's choice to stay easy even as activity picked up sharply helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 11% during this period and sovereign long rates averaging 2%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 2% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 22% (14% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 6 years before real GDP reached its prior peak.

### **Norway 1984–1996 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Norway experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1984 and 1996.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 1984 and 1987, Norway experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth, strong equity returns, and strong housing returns. By the bubble's end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 211% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Norway's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 4% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 2% of GDP. Aided by that capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (housing prices averaged 19% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around 700 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1987 to 1992. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 58% of GDP, making Norway vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of ripples from commodity price declines. Norway suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%) and in home prices (falling by 38%). Norway's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Norway needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP was roughly flat through this period.

#### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1992. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 2% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 4%, and real FX averaged 3% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Norway was aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks and provided liquidity. It also enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth close to nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 6.1% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 5.5%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 4% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 35% (7% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 5 years before real GDP reached its prior peak.

Between 1987 and 1989, Finland experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of strong growth and strong equity returns. By the bubble's end, debts had reached a pre-crisis peak of 272% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Finland's domestic currency, though a high share was owned by foreigners, which left Finland with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were low but positive, averaging around 3% of GDP, while Finland maintained a current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that capital, growth was strong (at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 18% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around 700 bps). Competitiveness became an issue, as Finland's real FX peaked at +24%. Taken together, these bubble pressures and Finland's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1989 to 1993. High debt levels left Finland vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of asset price declines hitting bank solvency. Finland suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 12%), in stock prices (falling by 36%) and in home prices (falling by 32%). Unemployment rates increased by 13%. Finland's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Finland needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 32% (9% annualized) as incomes declined.

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly longer than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1993. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 7% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 3%, and real FX averaged -10% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Finland was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 6% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 4%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 6% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 72% (8% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 7 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 5 years.

### **Sweden 1987–2000 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Sweden experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987 and 2000.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 1987 and 1990, Sweden experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth, and strong housing returns. Debts rose by 15% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 239% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Sweden's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were low but positive, averaging around 2% of GDP, while Sweden maintained a current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was moderate (at 2%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%). During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around 500 bps). Competitiveness became an issue, as Sweden's real FX peaked at +15%. Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1990 to 1993. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 65% of GDP, making Sweden vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of housing price declines hitting bank solvency. Sweden suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 6%), in stock prices (falling by 34%) and in home prices (falling by 7%). Unemployment rates increased by 9%. Sweden's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Sweden needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 40% (12% annualized) as incomes declined and as the government had to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 10% of GDP during the ugly period).

### **Sweden 1987–2000 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively short bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 1993. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 5% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 3%, and real FX averaged -5% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Sweden was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. It also enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 5% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 4%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 1% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 28% (4% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 3 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 4 years.

## **Japan 1987–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Japan experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 1987 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 1987 and 1989, Japan experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 24% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 307% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Japan's domestic currency, the majority was owned domestically, and Japan was a net creditor (which helped keep the exchange rate strong even through shocks, due to capital repatriations). During the bubble phase, investment inflows were low, averaging around 1% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt, growth was strong (at 5%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 28% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around 450 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 1989 to 2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 78% of GDP, making Japan vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of real estate and stock market busts. Japan suffered from self-reinforcing declines in stock prices (falling by 67%) and in home prices (falling by 43%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%. Japan's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Japan needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 59% (3% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_46_Figure_5.jpeg)

## **Japan 1987–2017 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

In this case, the resolution of the debt problems was very slow, as monetary policy was not sufficiently easy to push nominal GDP growth above nominal interest rates for quite some time. Eventually, however, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 58% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -10% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Japan was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. It also enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 2% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 0%). During this phase, unemployment rates were flat and debt as a % of GDP fell by 43% (9% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven primarily by monetization and to a lesser extent by rising real incomes.

### **United States 2004–2014 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United States experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2004 and 2014.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2004 and 2007, the United States experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 38% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 349% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United States's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 8% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 6% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 3%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 14% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a large tightening (with short rates rising around 400 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2007 to 2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 68% of GDP, making the United States vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of a housing bust. The United States suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%), in stock prices (falling by 50%) and in home prices (falling by 28%). Unemployment rates increased by 5%. The United States's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United States needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 23% (15% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by falling real incomes.

**\*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.**

### **United States 2004–2014 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly shorter than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2009. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 16% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -10% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United States was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 6 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it recapitalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 3% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 2%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 3% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 59% (11% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real incomes, inflation, and paying down existing debt. This was partially offset by interest payments financed with new debt. It took 4 years before real GDP reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms recovered within 5 years.

### **Austria 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Austria experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Austria experienced a bubble that was most characterized by strong equity returns. Debts rose by 19% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 279% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Austria's domestic currency, is not a currency that Austria had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Austria with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. Aided by that capital, growth was strong (at 3%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 20% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and Austria's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 69% of GDP, making Austria vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Austria suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%), and in stock prices (falling by 66%). Austria's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Austria needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 39% (32% annualized) as incomes declined.

# **Germany 2006–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Germany experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2006 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Unlike many other cases, Germany didn't experience a broad-based bubble in the years before the crisis, but it was tied to other countries, economies, and financial markets that were experiencing bubble-like conditions. And it did build up a substantial debt stock, with debts reaching 261% of GDP prior to the crisis. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Germany's domestic currency, is not a currency that Germany had control over. Most of the debt was owned domestically.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the cycle turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 51% of GDP, making Germany vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Germany suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 7%), and in stock prices (falling by 53%). Germany's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure.

### **Greece 2005–2018 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Greece experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle starting in 2005.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Greece experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 40% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 206% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Greece's domestic currency, is not a currency that Greece had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Greece with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 22% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 13% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 10%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 19% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and Greece's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2017. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 42% of GDP, making Greece vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Greece suffered a fall in foreign funding (with capital inflows falling by 34% of GDP), leading to a tightening (short rates increased by 86%)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 27%), in stock prices (falling by 91%) and in home prices (falling by 42%). Unemployment rates increased by 15%. Greece's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Greece needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 101% (11% annualized), driven primarily by falling real incomes and to a lesser extent by interest payments financed with new debt.

So far, Greece hasn't transitioned into much of a "beautiful" phase, as the nominal growth rate was never pushed above nominal interest rates by adequate monetary easing.

The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Greece, as it helped set the stage for Alexis Tsipras, whom many people consider a populist leader, to take power.

As shown in the charts to the right, Hungary experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Hungary experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 45% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 214% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Hungary's domestic currency, though a high share was owned by foreigners, which left Hungary with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 6% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 8% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 14% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures and Hungary's dependence on foreign financing, combined with the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 31% of GDP, making Hungary vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. Hungary suffered a fall in foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 12% of GDP), leading to a tightening (policy makers hiked short rates by 5%)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 7%), in stock prices (falling by 73%) and in home prices (falling by 16%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%. Hungary's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Hungary needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 37% (7% annualized) as incomes declined and as the government had to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 5% of GDP during the ugly period).

After a relatively long bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 4% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -6% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Hungary was aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic policy levers. It also benefited from an IMF assistance program. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 5% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 2%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 7% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 51% (12% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios came mostly from income rising, driven primarily by higher real growth. It took 6 years before real GDP reached its prior peak, but equity prices in USD terms haven't yet fully recovered.

The crisis had a notable impact on the politics of Hungary, as it helped set the stage for Viktor Orban, whom many people consider a populist leader, to take power.

## **Ireland 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Ireland experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Ireland experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth, and strong housing returns. Debts rose by 94% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 271% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Ireland's domestic currency, is not a currency that Ireland had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Ireland with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 95% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 5% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 5%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 8%). Furthermore, moderate asset returns (equities averaged 5% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 220 bps). Competitiveness became an issue, as Ireland's real FX peaked at +17%. Taken together, these bubble pressures and Ireland's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 77% of GDP, making Ireland vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the European debt crisis. Ireland suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 9%), in stock prices (falling by 73%) and in home prices (falling by 53%). Unemployment rates increased by 9%. Ireland's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Ireland needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 35% (7% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by deflation. This was partially offset by defaults.

**\*The first two charts show gauges which measure bubble/depression conditions and tightness/easiness of money and credit. For each gauge, the difference from zero conveys the extent of the bubble while the crossing above/below zero represents the shifting into or out of the bubble.**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively long bust phase, ECB policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2013. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 14% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -19% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Ireland was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 7 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. It also benefited from an IMF assistance program and enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 6% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 0%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 8% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 116% (25% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real incomes and paying down existing debt. It took 6 years before real GDP reached its prior peak, but equity prices in USD terms haven't yet fully recovered.

# **Italy 2005–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Italy experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Italy experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt and strong growth. Debts rose by 29% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 270% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Italy's domestic currency, is not a currency that Italy had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Italy with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were moderately strong, averaging around 7% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 1% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was moderate (at 2%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 7% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and Italy's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2015. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 58% of GDP, making Italy vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the European debt crisis. Italy suffered a fall in foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 14% of GDP)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 9%), in stock prices (falling by 67%) and in home prices (falling by 15%). Unemployment rates increased by 6%. Italy's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Italy needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 48% (7% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by falling real incomes.

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a relatively long bust phase, ECB policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2015. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 16% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -1% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, Italy was aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 4 out of 9 classic policy levers. It also enacted structural reforms designed to increase labor market flexibility. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 1.8% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 1.2%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 1% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 36% (14% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of monetization and paying down existing debt. Real GDP has not yet reached its prior peak and equity prices in USD terms haven't yet fully recovered.

### **Netherlands 2006–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the Netherlands experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2006 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2006 and 2008, the Netherlands experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 10% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 355% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically the Netherlands's domestic currency, is not a currency that the Netherlands had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left the Netherlands with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 14% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 5%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 11% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. During this bubble period, policy makers initiated a moderate tightening (with short rates rising around 200 bps). Taken together, these bubble pressures and the Netherlands's dependence on foreign financing, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2014. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 68% of GDP, making the Netherlands vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. The Netherlands suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 4%), in stock prices (falling by 57%) and in home prices (falling by 20%). Unemployment rates increased by 4%. The Netherlands's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the Netherlands needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 74% (12% annualized) as incomes declined.

## **Portugal 2007–2017 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, Portugal experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2007 and 2017.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2007 and 2008, Portugal experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong equity returns, and strong growth. Debts rose by 36% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 273% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Portugal's domestic currency, is not a currency that Portugal had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Portugal with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 10% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 11% of GDP.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2013. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 48% of GDP, making Portugal vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the European debt crisis. Portugal suffered a fall in foreign funding (with portfolio inflows falling by 40% of GDP)—which in turn led to self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 10%), in stock prices (falling by 65%) and in home prices (falling by 18%). Unemployment rates increased by 9%. Portugal's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though Portugal needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 105% (21% annualized), driven by a mix of falling real incomes, interest payments financed with new debt, and net new borrowing. Those new debts came in part because the government had to borrow more in response to the crisis (with a peak fiscal deficit of 8% of GDP during the ugly period).

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, Spain experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt, strong growth and strong asset returns. Debts rose by 93% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 313% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in Euros, which, while technically Spain's domestic currency, is not a currency that Spain had control over. In addition, a high share of debt was owned by foreigners, which left Spain with some exposure to a pullback in foreign capital. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 27% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 10% of GDP.

# **United Kingdom 2005–2015 Case Auto-Summary**

As shown in the charts to the right, the United Kingdom experienced a classic deflationary deleveraging cycle between 2005 and 2015.

### **The Bubble Phase**

Between 2005 and 2008, the United Kingdom experienced a bubble that was driven by a self-reinforcing cycle of rising debt and strong growth. Debts rose by 89% of GDP during the bubble to a pre-crisis peak of 437% of GDP. In this case, the debt was in the United Kingdom's domestic currency, and the majority was owned domestically, too. During the bubble phase, investment inflows were strong, averaging around 14% of GDP, which helped to finance a current account deficit of 3% of GDP. Aided by that rising debt and capital, growth was strong (at 3%), while levels of economic activity were high (the GDP gap peaked at 4%). Furthermore, strong asset returns (equities averaged 8% annualized returns over the bubble period) encouraged more borrowing and helped to stimulate growth. Taken together, these bubble pressures, combined with tightening money and credit and the weakened conditions of related countries, created an unsustainable situation.

### **The Depression Phase**

Eventually the dynamic turned, producing a self-reinforcing bust and an "ugly deleveraging," which ran from 2008 to 2009. At its pre-crisis peak, debt service reached 82% of GDP, making the United Kingdom vulnerable to a shock—which came in the form of the 2008 global financial crisis. The United Kingdom suffered from self-reinforcing declines in GDP (falling by 6%), in stock prices (falling by 52%) and in home prices (falling by 19%). Unemployment rates increased by 3%. The United Kingdom's financial institutions also came under considerable pressure. As shown in the attribution chart to the right, even though the United Kingdom needed a deleveraging, its debt as a % GDP went up by 34% (24% annualized), driven primarily by interest payments financed with new debt and to a lesser extent by falling real incomes.

# **United Kingdom 2005–2015 Case Auto-Summary (cont.)**

### **The Reflation Phase**

After a slightly shorter than average bust phase, policy makers were able to provide enough stimulation to turn the deleveraging into a beautiful one and create a period of reflation, which began in 2009. In terms of monetary policy, M0 increased by 10% of GDP, interest rates were ultimately pushed down to 0%, and real FX averaged -5% during the stimulative phase. Over the cycle, the United Kingdom was very aggressive in managing its financial institutions and bad debts, pulling 6 out of 9 classic policy levers. In particular, it nationalized banks, provided liquidity, and directly purchased troubled assets. This stimulation helped bring nominal growth well above nominal interest rates (with growth averaging 4% during this period and sovereign long rates falling to 1%). During this phase, unemployment rates declined by 2% and debt as a % of GDP fell by 73% (12% annualized), as shown in the attribution chart to the right. Throughout this "beautiful" period, the reduction in debt-to-income ratios was driven by a mix of rising real incomes and inflation. This was partially offset by interest payments financed with new debt. It took 5 years before real GDP reached its prior peak, but equity prices in USD terms haven't yet fully recovered.
