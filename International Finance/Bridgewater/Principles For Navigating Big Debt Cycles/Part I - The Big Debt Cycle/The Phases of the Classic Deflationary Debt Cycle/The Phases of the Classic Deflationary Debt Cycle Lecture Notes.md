# The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle Lecture Notes

## Overview
- The classic deflationary debt cycle is characterized by seven stages.
- These stages are tracked by:
  - Total debt of the economy as a percentage of GDP.
  - Total debt service payments relative to GDP over 12 years.
- Archetype charts are used to illustrate these stages by averaging deflationary deleveraging cases.
## 1) The Early Part of the Cycle
- **Debt Growth and Income:**
  - Debt is not growing faster than incomes,  despite strong debt growth.
  - Debt is used to finance activities that produce fast income growth.
	- Example: Borrowed money is used to expand businesses,  increasing productivity and revenues.
- **Economic Conditions:**
  - Debt burdens are low; balance sheets are healthy.
  - Ample room for private sector,  government,  and banks to increase leverage.
  - Economic growth and inflation are stable,  creating a "Goldilocks" period.
## 2) The Bubble
- **Initial Bubble Formation:**
  - Debts rise faster than incomes,  leading to strong asset returns and growth.
  - Rising incomes,  net worths,  and asset values increase borrowing capacity.
	- Lenders base lending on projected income,  net worth,  and their own lending capacity.
- **Sustainability Concerns:**
  - Debt growth rates exceed income growth needed for servicing debts.
  - Borrowers feel wealthy,  spending more than they earn and buying assets with leverage.
  - Example: A person earning $50,          000 borrows $10,  000 annually,  spending $60,  000.
- **Economic Impact:**
  - Increased borrowing and spending lead to higher incomes and asset values.
  - Borrowing drives growth,  making it initially affordable.
- **Long-Term Debt Cycle:**
  - Promises to deliver money (debt burdens) rise relative to money supply and income.
  - Central banks lower interest rates,  raising asset prices and wealth.
  - Eventually,  debt service payments exceed borrowing capacity,  leading to deleveraging.

### The Start of a Bubble: The Bull Market
- **Bull Market Dynamics:**
  - Bubbles start as over-extrapolations of justified bull markets.
  - Lower interest rates make investment assets attractive,  boosting economic growth and corporate profits.
- **Investor Behavior:**
  - Rising asset values increase net worth and spending.
  - Confidence in prosperity supports leveraging-up.
  - New buyers enter the market,  fueling the bubble.
- **Lending Practices:**
  - Credit standards fall; banks and shadow banking systems increase leverage.
  - Financial engineering and new lending vehicles emerge.
- **Speculator and Lender Dynamics:**
  - Fast,  easy money reinforces the bubble.
  - Rising stock prices lead to more spending and investment,  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.
- **Debt and Market Dynamics:**
  - Large asset-liability mismatches occur.
  - Debts rise rapidly,  with debt service costs increasing even faster.
### Conditions During the Bubble
- **Debt Growth:**
  - Debt grows faster than incomes,  with a typical increase of 40%.
  - Rapid debt growth at 32%,  with income growth lagging at 13%.
- **Equity Markets and Yield Curve:**
  - Equity markets extend rally by 48%.
  - Yield curve flattens by 1.4%.

#### The Role of Monetary Policy
- **Monetary Policy Influence:**
  - Monetary policy often inflates bubbles rather than constraining them.
  - Central banks focus on inflation and growth,  neglecting bubble management.
- **Central Bank Challenges:**
  - Central banks target inflation and growth,  not debt growth.
  - Debt growth can finance bubbles if not managed.
- **Policy Implications:**
  - Central banks should target sustainable debt growth.
  - The economic pain of a burst bubble is significant,  necessitating proactive policy measures.
#### Spotting Bubbles
- **Identifying Bubbles:**
  - Bubbles share common characteristics,  making them identifiable.
  - Key indicators include high prices,  bullish sentiment,  and high leverage.
- **Framework Application:**
  - Historical bubbles exhibit similar patterns.
  - Systematic measures help identify bubbles across different markets.
### Applying the Framework to Past Bubbles
- **Historical Examples:**
  - USA 2007,  USA 2000,  USA 1929,  Japan 1989,  Spain 2007,  Greece 2007,  Ireland 2007,  Korea 1994,  HK 1997,  China 2015.
- **Key Indicators:**
  - High prices relative to traditional measures.
  - Prices discounting future rapid appreciation.
  - Purchases financed by high leverage.
  - New market participants and broad bullish sentiment.
  - Stimulative [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] risks inflating the bubble further.
## Conclusion
- Understanding the phases of the debt cycle and the role of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is crucial.
- Identifying bubbles requires a comprehensive analysis of market conditions and indicators.
- Proactive measures by central banks and policymakers can mitigate the risks associated with bubbles.

# Lecture Notes on the Deflationary Debt Cycle

## Introduction
- Understanding the deflationary debt cycle is crucial for anticipating economic downturns.
- The cycle is characterized by several phases,  each with distinct economic behaviors and outcomes.
## Key Concepts
- **Debt-to-Income Ratios:**
  - While useful,  these ratios are inadequate for predicting debt crises.
  - Averages can mask the specific debt-service abilities of individual entities.
  - Concentration of debt in key entities poses greater risks than a well-distributed debt burden.
## Phase 3: The Top of the Cycle

### Market Dynamics at the Top
- **Leveraged Buying:**
  - Prices are driven up by leveraged buying,  leading to an overvalued market.
  - The market becomes fully long,  leveraged,  and overpriced,  setting the stage for a reversal.
- **Psychological Factors:**
  - A general principle: when conditions seem too good to improve,  market tops are forming.
  - Overconfidence in continued growth despite signs of a peak.
### Triggers for Market Reversal
- **Central Bank Actions:**
  - Market tops often coincide with central banks tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].
  - Rising interest rates can trigger reversals.
- **Internal and External Factors:**
  - Growth and inflation pressures can lead to tightening.
  - External factors,  such as reduced foreign lending,  can also cause liquidity tightening.
  - Currency fluctuations can exacerbate debt-service challenges.
### Economic Impact of Tightening
- **Asset Prices and Wealth Effect:**
  - Tightening [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] negatively impacts asset prices,  reducing perceived wealth.
  - Borrowers face increased debt-service burdens,  slowing spending and investment.
- **Credit Market Reactions:**
  - Credit spreads widen as lenders become cautious.
  - Risky lending slows,  and there is a shift from risky to safer assets.
### Yield Curve and Lending Incentives
- **Yield Curve Dynamics:**
  - A flattening or inverted yield curve reduces the incentive to lend long-term.
  - Investors move to cash,  slowing credit growth and contributing to the market's decline.
### Early Signs of Economic Weakness
- **Sectoral Vulnerabilities:**
  - Initial signs of weakness appear in the most vulnerable sectors.
  - Risky debtors begin to default,  and credit spreads increase.
- **Central Bank's Role:**
  - Despite rising interest rates,  the economy's underlying weaknesses are often overlooked.
  - The fastest rate of tightening typically occurs months before the market peak.
## Phase 4: The "Depression"

### Characteristics of a Depression
- **Ineffectiveness of Monetary Policy:**
  - In depressions,  traditional [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] tools are less effective.
  - Interest rates are already near zero,  limiting further cuts.
- **Credit Spreads and Risk:**
  - Wide credit spreads exacerbate the inability to service debt.
  - The self-reinforcing "debt death spiral" emerges,  worsening financial conditions.
### The Role of Defaults and Restructurings
- **Impact on Financial Institutions:**
  - Defaults and restructurings hit leveraged lenders hard.
  - Runs on financial institutions occur,  requiring government intervention.
- **Liquidity Concerns:**
  - Liquidity becomes a major issue as investors seek to convert assets to cash.
  - Central banks may need to print money to provide necessary liquidity.
### Solvency vs. Cash-Flow Problems
- **Types of Financial Distress:**
  - Solvency problems arise when entities lack sufficient equity capital.
  - Cash-flow problems occur when entities cannot meet immediate cash needs.
- **Policy Responses:**
  - Solvency issues can be addressed through capital injections or regulatory changes.
  - Cash-flow issues require fiscal or monetary support to provide liquidity.
### Historical Context and Policy Lessons
- **Comparative Analysis:**
  - Differences between the 1980s and 2008 crises highlight the importance of policy responses.
  - Mark-to-market accounting and capital injections played key roles in 2008.
### Psychological Misconceptions
- **Misunderstanding of Deleveraging:**
  - Deleveraging is not primarily psychological but driven by credit and money supply dynamics.
  - The central bank's role in managing money supply is crucial to addressing these issues.
### Conclusion
- Understanding the phases of the debt cycle and the role of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] is essential.
- Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in specific sectors can mitigate the risks of a debt crisis.
- Proactive measures by central banks and policymakers are necessary to manage economic downturns effectively.

# Lecture Notes on Managing Depressions and Debt Crises

## Introduction
- Understanding the dynamics of depressions and debt crises is crucial for effective economic management.
- The collapse of wealth and the ensuing panic can lead to severe economic and social consequences.
## The Collapse of Wealth and Panic

### Wealth Dissipation
- **Unkept Promises:**
  - When debts are not repaid,  the perceived wealth tied to those debts vanishes.
- **Investor Reactions:**
  - Investors attempt to liquidate assets to raise cash,  testing the system's liquidity.
  - Failures in liquidity lead to panic-induced "runs" and sell-offs.
### The Cascade of Debt Defaults
- **Impact on Financial Institutions:**
  - Banks and entities relying on short-term funding face severe liquidity issues.
  - Debt defaults cascade,  affecting leveraged lenders and spreading fear.
- **Self-Reinforcing Fear:**
  - Fear leads to a scramble for cash,  resulting in a liquidity crisis.
### The Self-Reinforcing Cycle
- **Initial Imbalance:**
  - Debtors' incomes and borrowing are insufficient to meet obligations.
  - Asset sales and spending cuts are necessary,  leading to falling asset values.
- **Creditworthiness Decline:**
  - Falling asset values reduce collateral,  decreasing borrowers' creditworthiness.
  - Lenders become more reluctant to lend,  exacerbating the cycle.
## The Depression Phase

### Deflationary Forces
- **Debt Reduction:**
  - Dominated by defaults,  restructurings,  and austerity without significant monetary intervention.
- **Asset Write-Downs:**
  - Write-downs must be substantial to allow debt servicing.
  - Leveraged lenders face amplified impacts from asset devaluations.
### Economic and Social Impact
- **Rising Debt Burdens:**
  - As spending and incomes fall,  debt levels rise relative to net worth.
- **Loss of Wealth:**
  - Capitalists face significant losses in investment portfolios and incomes.
  - Defensive behaviors include moving money abroad and seeking safe investments.
### Real Economy Suffering
- **Monetary Policy Constraints:**
  - Uncontrolled credit contraction leads to economic and social catastrophe.
- **Worker Hardships:**
  - Incomes collapse,  job losses are severe,  and essential assets are lost.
## Managing Depressions

### Policy Levers
- **Four Broad Categories:**
  1. Austerity
  1. Debt Defaults/Restructurings
  1. Debt Monetization/Money Printing
  1. Wealth Transfers
### Balancing Policy Impacts
- **Initial Missteps:**
  - Policymakers often misjudge the balance between austerity,  money printing,  and redistribution.
- **Moral Hazard and Political Challenges:**
  - Reluctance to provide support due to moral hazard concerns and political pressures.
### Effective Policy Mix
- **Stimulative Remedies:**
  - Delays in applying stimulative measures worsen the deleveraging process.
- **Reflationary Deleveraging:**
  - Successful policies involve guarantees,  money printing,  and debt monetization.
## Detailed Examination of Policy Levers

### Austerity
- **Natural Inclination:**
  - Policymakers initially resort to austerity,  expecting those responsible to bear costs.
- **Economic Contraction:**
  - Spending cuts lead to income cuts,  worsening debt/income ratios.
- **Government Revenue and Deficits:**
  - Falling revenues and rising demands increase deficits,  prompting tax hikes.
### "Printing Money" to Stimulate the Economy
- **Central Bank and Government Roles:**
  - Decisions on protecting depositors and systemically important institutions.
- **Providing Liquidity:**
  - Central banks ensure liquidity by lending against a wider range of collateral.
- **Recapitalization and Nationalization:**
  - Governments may need to recapitalize or nationalize critical financial institutions.
### Debt Defaults/Restructurings
- **Cleansing Bad Debts:**
  - Critical for future economic stability and credit flow.
- **Orderly Process:**
  - Ensures economic and social stability while addressing credit problems.
## Conclusion
- Effective management of depressions requires a deep understanding of economic dynamics and timely policy interventions.
- Policymakers must balance deflationary and inflationary forces to stabilize the economy.
- The challenges of ignorance and political constraints often impede effective crisis management.

# Lecture Notes on Economic Policy Responses During Depressions

## Introduction
- Economic depressions require decisive policy actions to mitigate their severity and duration.
- The division of costs between government,  bondholders,  equity holders,  and depositors is crucial in managing the crisis.
## Policy Responses to Financial Crises

### Timing and Aggressiveness of Policy Actions
- **Decisive Action:**
  - Delays in policy responses often lead to unnecessary economic pain.
  - Quick and aggressive responses are critical in determining the depression's severity and length.
### Cost Distribution Among Stakeholders
- **Government vs. Private Stakeholders:**
  - Costs are divided between the government (society) and private stakeholders (bondholders,  equity holders,  depositors).
  - Nonsystemically important institutions typically absorb their losses and may go bankrupt.
### Resolution of Failed Institutions
- **Forms of Resolution:**
  - Mergers with healthy institutions (80% of cases).
  - Asset liquidation or transfer to government-established Asset Management Companies (AMCs).
- **Banking System Viability:**
  - Ensuring the banking system's viability is critical,  often involving liquidity and solvency measures.
  - Guarantees of bank liabilities have become common in developed countries.
### Protection of Creditors
- **Small Depositors:**
  - Preferential treatment with minimal or no losses,  often through deposit insurance schemes.
  - Coverage is expanded during crises to ensure [[A Primer on Bank Liquidity|bank liquidity]].
- **Equity and Subordinated Debt Holders:**
  - Typically absorb losses,  especially in non-systemically important institutions.
- **Domestic vs. Foreign Creditors:**
  - Domestic creditors may be prioritized over foreign creditors,  especially when loans are to private-sector players.
### Regulatory Reforms
- **Scope and Impact:**
  - Reforms range from modest to large,  affecting banking operations,  credit standards,  and market competition.
  - Political factors influence the nature and effectiveness of reforms.
## Management of Bad Debts

### Asset Management Strategies
- **Asset Management Companies (AMCs):**
  - AMCs manage restructuring and asset disposal,  accelerating debt problem resolution.
  - Publicly owned,  AMCs aim to minimize taxpayer costs and market disruptions.
- **Original Lender Management:**
  - Bad debts may remain with the original lender,  especially if state-sponsored or if effective resolution mechanisms exist.
### Handling Systemically Important Borrowers
- **Restructuring Strategies:**
  - [[Class Slide 4-Restructuring Debt Outside Bankruptcy|Debt Restructuring ]] to ensure manageable debt service.
  - New lending programs to maintain liquidity for strategically important businesses.
## Redistributing Wealth During Crises

### Wealth Inequality and Political Dynamics
- **Rising Inequality:**
  - Wealth gaps widen during bubbles,  leading to political and economic conflict.
  - Populism emerges as a response to perceived inequalities.
- **Taxation and Redistribution:**
  - Increased taxation on the wealthy,  particularly in income,  property,  and consumption taxes.
  - Wealth and inheritance taxes are less effective due to illiquidity.
## The "Beautiful Deleveraging"

### Balancing Economic Forces
- **Four Levers:**
  - Austerity,  debt defaults/restructurings,  debt monetization/money printing,  and wealth transfers.
- **Achieving Balance:**
  - Effective deleveraging requires balancing deflationary and reflationary forces.
  - Central banks provide liquidity and credit support,  while governments manage fiscal interventions.
### Central Bank's Role
- **Monetary Policy Tools:**
  - Central banks increase money supply by lending against a wider range of collateral and buying lower-quality debt.
  - The goal is to offset deflationary forces and achieve positive growth.
### Risks of Overstimulation
- **Avoiding Inflationary Deleveraging:**
  - Excessive money printing can lead to hyperinflation,  as seen in historical cases like Weimar Germany.
  - The balance between credit replacement and economic stimulation is crucial.
## Conclusion
- Effective management of depressions involves timely and balanced policy interventions.
- Understanding the dynamics of wealth distribution and regulatory reforms is essential for economic stability.
- Policymakers must navigate complex economic forces to achieve a "beautiful deleveraging" and ensure long-term growth.

# Lecture Notes on Policy Responses in Deflationary Deleveraging

## Introduction
- Understanding the policy responses during deflationary deleveraging is crucial for managing economic downturns.
- The effectiveness of these responses varies based on the monetary systems and the timing of interventions.
## Archetypal Path of Money Printing

### Waves of Money Printing
- **Two Classic Waves:**
  1. **Liquidity Provision:**
	 - Central banks provide liquidity to stressed institutions.
  1. **Large-Scale Asset Purchases:**
	 - Conducted to broadly stimulate the economy.
### Currency and Monetary Systems
- **Exchange Rate Dynamics:**
  - The real exchange rate versus trade partners reflects currency strength/weakness.
- **Monetary System Constraints:**
  - Governments with gold,  commodity,  or foreign-currency-pegged systems face tighter monetary policies.
  - Eventually,  painful debt contractions lead to abandoning these systems or altering exchange terms.
### Historical Example: The Great Depression
- **Gold Standard Suspension:**
  - Suspending the dollar-gold convertibility allowed currency devaluation and economic recovery.
- **2008 Financial Crisis:**
  - Easier implementation of money printing and asset purchases without changing currency regimes.
## Policy Makers' Reliance on Money Printing

### Reasons for Money Printing
- **Austerity and Restructuring Limitations:**
  - Austerity causes more pain than benefit.
  - Large restructurings can wipe out wealth too quickly.
- **Inflationary vs. Deflationary Balance:**
  - Printing money is not inflationary if it offsets credit contraction,  negating deflation.
### Historical Lessons
- **Quick and Effective Responses:**
  - Countries like the US in 2008-09 achieved better results with timely interventions.
- **Delayed Responses:**
  - Late actions,  as seen in the US during 1930-33,  led to prolonged economic pain.
## Typical Policy Responses and Economic Indicators

### Key Economic Indicators
- **Money Printing and Currency Devaluation:**
  - Average money printing around 4% of GDP per year.
  - Initial currency devaluation of about 50% against gold.
- **Fiscal Deficits:**
  - Deficits widen to about 6% of GDP during aggressive stimulation.
### Timing of Interventions
- **Depression Duration:**
  - Aggressive stimulation typically occurs two to three years into a depression.
- **Economic Conditions:**
  - Stocks fall over 50%,  economic activity declines by 10%,  and unemployment rises to 10-15%.
## Managing Deleveraging: Well vs. Poorly Managed

### Characteristics of Well-Managed Deleveraging
- **Central Bank Policies:**
  - Consider debt growth and asset markets in policy management.
  - Use macroprudential policies to target debt growth restraints.
- **Fiscal Policies:**
  - Tightened to prevent excessive debt growth.
- **Reflationary Measures:**
  - Aggressive monetizations and targeted macroprudential policies stimulate high-quality credit growth.
### Characteristics of Poorly Managed Deleveraging
- **Central Bank Delays:**
  - Slow to cut rates and provide liquidity.
  - Wait too long for aggressive monetization.
- **Government Austerity:**
  - Pursue austerity without adequate easing.
- **Systemic Institution Failures:**
  - Important institutions left damaged or failed.
## "Pushing on a String" Phenomenon

### Challenges in Late Debt Cycle
- **Diminished Policy Effectiveness:**
  - Lowering interest rates and debt asset purchases lose impact.
- **Low Growth and Returns:**
  - Economy enters a period of low growth and asset returns.
### Risks of Excessive Monetization
- **Currency Devaluation Concerns:**
  - Excessive printing can lead to "ugly inflationary deleveraging."
- **Alternative Currencies:**
  - People may shift to alternatives like gold if currency faith collapses.
## Monetary Policy Styles

### Monetary Policy 1: Interest-Rate Driven
- **Broad Economic Impact:**
  - Reduces interest rates to stimulate the economy.
  - Positive wealth effect,  easier credit purchases,  and reduced debt-service burdens.
### Monetary Policy 2: Quantitative Easing (QE)
- **Asset Purchases:**
  - Central banks buy financial assets,  impacting investors/savers.
- **Wealth Gap Concerns:**
  - Benefits investors more than non-asset owners,  widening the wealth gap.
- **Diminishing Returns:**
  - Effectiveness declines as risk premiums fall and asset prices rise.
### Monetary Policy 3: Direct Spending Incentives
- **Targeted Spending:**
  - Directs money to spenders rather than investors.
- **Coordinated Fiscal and Monetary Actions:**
  - Government spending and incentives stimulate economic activity.
- **Helicopter Money:**
  - Direct cash transfers to citizens without fiscal policy coordination.
## Conclusion
- Effective management of deflationary deleveraging requires timely and balanced policy interventions.
- Understanding the dynamics of monetary policies and their impact on the economy is crucial for achieving a "beautiful deleveraging."
- Policymakers must navigate complex economic forces to ensure long-term growth and stability.

# Lecture Notes on Central Bank Influence and Economic Recovery

## Introduction
- Central banks play a crucial role in shaping economic outcomes through various policy tools.
- These tools can be similar to fiscal policies and are essential in managing economic cycles,  particularly during deflationary deleveraging.
## Central Bank Influence through Macroprudential Policies

### Overview of Macroprudential Policies
- **Definition:**
  - Policies aimed at ensuring the stability of the financial system as a whole.
  - They target specific sectors or entities to manage credit availability and costs.
- **Purpose:**
  - Differentiate between entities to restrict credit in over-indebted areas while stimulating others.
  - Provide targeted credit support without broad economic impact.
### Examples of Macroprudential Policies
- **Credit Restrictions:**
  - Limiting credit to sectors with excessive debt.
- **Targeted Credit Support:**
  - Providing credit to specific entities or sectors needing stimulation.
## Continuum of Central Bank and Fiscal Policy Coordination

### Debt-Financed Fiscal Spending
1. **Increase in Debt-Financed Fiscal Spending:**
   - Often paired with Quantitative Easing (QE) to buy new issuance.
   - Historical Examples: Japan (1930s),  US (WWII),  US and UK (2000s).

1. **Debt-Financed Spending with Central Bank Support:**
   - Central banks print money to cover debt payments.
   - Examples: Germany (1930s),  China (2008).

1. **Direct Money Printing for Government Spending:**
   - Bypassing debt issuance,  directly providing funds to the government.
   - Historical Examples: Imperial China,  American Revolution,  US Civil War,  Germany (1930s),  UK (WWI).

1. **Helicopter Money:**
   - Direct cash transfers to households to stimulate spending.
   - Examples: US veterans’ bonuses (Great Depression),  Imperial China.
### Variants of Money Direction
- **Universal vs. Targeted Distribution:**
  - Equal distribution to all or targeted to specific groups (e.g.,  the poor).
- **One-Off vs. Recurring Payments:**
  - Single payments or ongoing support (e.g.,  Universal Basic Income).
- **Incentives to Spend:**
  - Money may expire if not spent within a certain period.
- **Directed Investment Accounts:**
  - Funds allocated to specific accounts for retirement,  education,  or small-business investments.
### Alternative Approaches
- **Debt Write-Downs with Money Creation:**
  - "Year of Jubilee" approach,  seen in Ancient Rome,  the Great Depression,  and Iceland.
- **Fiscal/Monetary Coordination:**
  - Ensures effective money provision and spending.
  - Challenges in coordination can lead to alternative approaches.
## Normalization and Economic Recovery

### Recovery Process
- **Normalization:**
  - The economy gradually returns to normal,  though recovery is slow.
  - Typically takes 5 to 10 years for real economic activity to reach previous peaks.
  - Stock prices may take longer to recover due to high equity risk premiums.
### Recovery Conditions
- **Equity Drawdown:**
  - Average duration: 119 months (range: 60 to 249 months).
- **GDP Drawdown:**
  - Average duration: 72 months (range: 25 to 106 months).
- **Debt-to-GDP Changes:**
  - Post-stimulation reduction: Average -54% (range: -70% to -29%).
## Conclusion
- Central banks have a range of tools to influence economic outcomes,  often in coordination with fiscal policies.
- Understanding these tools and their historical applications helps in managing economic cycles and achieving recovery.
- Effective policy coordination is crucial for a balanced and sustainable economic recovery.
