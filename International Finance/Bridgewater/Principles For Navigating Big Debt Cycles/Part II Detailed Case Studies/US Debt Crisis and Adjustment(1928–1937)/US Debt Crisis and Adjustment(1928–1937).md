# **US Debt Crisis and Adjustment (1928–1937)**

This section gives a detailed account of the big US debt cycle of the 1920s and 1930s, including the Great Depression, which is probably the most iconic case of a deflationary deleveraging. It takes you through the particulars of the case with reference to the template laid out earlier in the "Archetypal Big Debt Cycle." Though the Great Depression happened nearly a century ago, its dynamic was basically the same as what occurred in and around 2008. As with the other cases in this part, I both describe the timeline (which in this case is based on the library of books I've amassed on the Great Depression over the years rather than my personal experience trading through it) and provide a real-time "newsfeed" drawn from newspaper headlines and what the Federal Reserve was saying at the time that runs along the sides of the pages.

# **1927–1929: The Bubble**

Following the world war and the recession of 1920 to 1921, the US economy experienced a period of rapid technology-led growth. The continuing electrification of rural and small-town America and the growth of the middle class opened up huge markets for new technologies. The radio was the new, hot technology and the number of radio sets owned grew from 60,000 in 1922 to 7.5 million in 1928.1 The automobile industry also grew rapidly and by 1929 there were 23 million cars on the road—on average, about one per every five Americans (which was nearly three times higher than in 1920).2 Technological advances also led to a productivity boom (factory worker output per hour increased 75 percent from 1922 to 1928). Technology breakthroughs filled the newspapers, driving wide-spread optimism about the economy.

In the midst of that technology boom, the early part of the cycle (roughly from 1922 to 1927) saw strong economic growth and subdued inflation. The broader period became known as the "fat years," as both capitalists and workers experienced significant gains.3 Corporate profits rose to postwar highs, unemployment dropped to postwar lows, and real wages rose more than 20 percent. **In the pre-bubble years of 1923 to 1926, debt growth was appropriately in line with income growth because it was being used to finance activities that produced fast income growth.** At the same time, the stock market roared higher while experiencing little volatility—investors in US

stocks made over 150 percent between the start of 1922 and the end of 1927. The hottest tech stocks at the time—Radio Corporation of America (known to traders as "Radio") and General Motors—led the gains.4

**Then a bubble began to emerge. As is classic, the bubble had its roots in the dizzying productivity and technological gains of the period and people making leveraged bets that they would continue.** One writer explained the growing belief that the economy had entered a "New Era": "The New Era… meant permanent prosperity, an end to the old cycle of boom and bust, steady growth in the wealth and savings of the American people, [and] continuously rising stock prices."5

The US was an extremely attractive destination for investment from abroad. The US and most of the rest of the world were on a gold standard at the time, which meant governments promised to exchange their money for gold at a fixed exchange rate in order to provide assurance to lenders that they wouldn't just print a lot of money and devalue lenders' claims. Gold flowed from other countries to the US, because that was effectively how investors bought dollars. This played an important role in determining how events transpired during the lead-up to the crash in 1929, but we won't get into that now.

When other countries (France, Germany, and the UK) became worried that they were losing gold too quickly, they asked the US Federal Reserve to lower dollar interest rates to make dollars less attractive. More focused on growth and inflation than on the debt growth that was being used to buy financial assets, in the spring of 1927, the Federal Reserve Board cut its discount rate from 4 percent to 3.5 percent. This, of course, had the knock-on effect of encouraging US credit creation. This is a typical way that central banks inadvertently finance bubbles.

The economy accelerated in response to the easing, and news of the strong economy filled headlines and radio broadcasts nationwide. Over the second half of 1928, industrial production rose 9.9 percent and automobile production hit an all-time high. The boom made people euphoric. At the start of 1929, *The Wall Street Journal* described the pervasive strength of the US economy: "One cannot recall when a new year was ushered in with business conditions sounder than they are today…Everything points to full production of industry and record-breaking traffic for railroads."6

The easing by the Federal Reserve also produced **a bull market in stocks that showed every sign of a classic bubble**. I'll repeat my defining characteristics of a bubble:

- **1. Prices are high relative to traditional measures**
- **2. Prices are discounting future rapid price appreciation from these**

## **high levels**

- **3. There is broad bullish sentiment**
- **4. Purchases are being financed by high leverage**
- **5. Buyers have made exceptionally extended forward purchases (e.g., built inventory, contracted forward purchases, etc.) to speculate or protect themselves against future price gains**

- **6. New buyers (i.e., those who weren't previously in the market) have entered the market**
- **7. Stimulative monetary policy helps inflate the bubble, and tight policy contributes to its popping**

After prices nearly doubled over 1927 and 1928, **stocks sold at extremely high multiples financed by borrowing (i.e., margin)**. Many stocks were valued as much as 30 times earnings.7 The popular book *New Levels in the Stock Market*, published in 1929 by Ohio State professor Charles Amos Dice, captured **the pervasive sentiments of the bull market**. He argued that the broader base of investors in the market made higher valuations more or less permanent, proclaiming, "Among the yardsticks for predicting the behavior of stocks which have been rendered obsolete…[is] the truism that what goes up must come down."8

**New buyers flooded the market, and many of them were unsophisticated investors with no prior experience with stocks, one of the classic signs of a bubble.** Brokerage firms rapidly expanded to cater to aspiring speculators across the country; the number of branch offices outside of Wall Street increased by more than 50 percent between 1928 and 1929.9 "Wherever one went," a broker declared in 1929, "one met people who told of their stock-market winnings. At dinner tables, at bridge, on golf links, on trolley cars, in country post offices, in barber shops, in factories and shops of all kinds."10

**During this period, stock purchases were financed by high and rapidly increasing leverage, and more and more of this leverage occurred outside the regulated and protected banking system. Classically, new and fast-growing lending markets where a lot of levering up occurs are symptomatic of bubbles. Often, banks are able to make these new assets seem safe to investors via guarantees, or through the way the assets are combined and packaged—and without a crisis to stress-test them, it can be hard to tell how safe they actually are. These "innovations" typically lead to the next crisis if not monitored, understood, and managed by regulators. The bankers and the speculators made a lot of fast money in a symbiotic relationship (i.e., the bankers would lend to the speculators at fat spreads and the speculators would buy stocks on leverage, pushing them up and making money).** In 1929, call loans and investment trusts were the fastest-growing channels for increasing leverage outside the banking system.11

The call loan market, a relatively new innovation, developed into a huge channel through which investors could access margin debt. The terms of call loans adjusted each day to reflect market interest rates and margin requirements, and lenders could "call" the money at any time, given the one-day term. **Call loans created asset/liability mismatches among lenders and borrowers, since borrowers were using short-term debt to fund the purchases of risky long-term assets, and lenders were lending to riskier borrowers who were willing to pay higher interest rates. One of the classic ingredients of a debt crisis is the squeezing of lenders and borrowers who have debt/liability mismatches that they took on during the bubble.**

A new group of investors entered the call loan market to lend to the crowd of speculators. Because interest rates on call loans were higher than other shortterm rates and lenders could "call" back their money on demand, call loans became popular as a safe place for companies to invest their extra cash.12 Foreign capital also poured in from places like London and Hong Kong. As a historian later described it, "A great river of gold began to converge on Wall Street, all of it to help Americans hold common stock on margin."13 The share of funds in the call loan market that were coming from lenders outside the Federal Reserve System (i.e., non-banks and foreigners) rose from 24 percent at the start of 1928 to 58 percent in October 1929.14 This added risk to the market, since the Federal Reserve couldn't lend to these non-banks if they needed liquidity in a squeeze.

The charts below show the explosion in margin debt through the bubble and the accompanying rise in prices.

Investment trusts were another financial innovation that saw rapid growth during the bubble and helped draw new speculators into the market. First originated and popularized in Great Britain, investment trusts were companies that issued shares and invested the proceeds in the shares of other companies.15 The well-known economist Irving Fisher praised the "wide and well-managed diversification" that trusts provided investors who lacked sufficient capital to buy shares in multiple companies.16 As the stock market boomed, the number of trusts exploded. By 1929, new trusts were launching at a rate of nearly five per week, and these offerings were taking in one-third of the new capital raised.17

"Tightening on the strings of the country's supply of credit, a development foreshadowed last week, but not considered seriously by speculators in the stock market, brought about yesterday one of the sharpest declines in securities that has ever taken place on the Exchange. Only twice in the history of the Exchange have there been broader breaks." *–New York Times*

Promoters of trusts claimed that their diversification made the financial system safer. However, the use of leverage by many trusts to amplify returns in the bubble created risk for investors. And many speculators, unaware of the nature of the securities and believing that the recent past would continue, amplified this risk by taking out margin loans to lever up already-levered trust shares.18

As stock prices soared, speculators continued to lever up and make huge profits, attracting more buyers into the market to do the same. **The more prices increased, the more aggressively speculators bet that they would increase still more.**

**At the same time, supplies of stocks were increasing as the higher prices encouraged their production.**<sup>19</sup> **During this phase of the bubble, the more prices went up, the more credit standards were lowered (even though it would have been logical for the opposite to happen), as both lenders and borrowers found lending and buying stocks with borrowed money to be very profitable.** 

The leveraging was mostly taking place in the "shadow banking" system; banks at the time by and large did not look over-leveraged. In June 1929 banks looked much healthier than they had prior to the 1920–1921 recession: not only were they posting record earnings, their capital ratios were higher (17.2 percent versus 14.9 percent) and their liabilities were stickier, as time deposits made up a greater share of their liabilities (35.7 percent versus 23.3 percent).20 A series of large bank mergers during 1929 were viewed as a further source of strength by analysts.21 **Classically, bank earnings and balance sheets look healthy during the good times because the assets are highly valued and the deposits that back them are there. It's when there's a run on deposits and the assets fall in value that banks have problems.**

While the Federal Reserve governors debated the need to restrain the rapid lending that was fueling stock speculation, they were hesitant to raise shortterm interest rates because the economy wasn't overheating, inflation remained subdued, and higher interest rates would hurt all borrowers, not just speculators.22 **Typically the worst debt bubbles are not accompanied by high and rising inflation, but by asset price inflation financed by debt growth. That is because central banks make the mistake of accommodating debt growth because they are focused on inflation and/or growth—not on debt growth, the asset inflations they are producing, and whether or not debts will produce the incomes required to service them.**

Rather than raising its discount rate, the Fed enacted macroprudential (i.e., regulatory) measures aimed at constraining the supply of credit via banks. Some of these regulatory measures included lowering the acceptance rate for loans and increasing supervision of credit facilities.23 The Fed publicly released a letter it had written to regional banks, deriding the "excessive amount of the country's credit absorbed in speculative security loans" and threatening that banks attempting to borrow money from the Fed in order to fund such loans might be refused.24 But these policies were largely ineffective.

# **Late 1929: The Top and the Crash Tightening Pops the Bubble**

In 1928, the Fed started to tighten monetary policy. From February to July, rates had risen by 1.5 percent to five percent. The Fed was hoping to slow the growth of speculative credit, without crippling the economy. A year later, in August 1929, it raised rates again, to six percent. **As short-term interest rates rose, the yield curve flattened and inverted, liquidity declined, and the return on holding short duration assets such as cash increased as their yields rose. As loans became more costly and holding cash became more attractive than holding longer duration and/or riskier financial assets (such as bonds, equities, and real estate), money moved out of financial assets, causing them to fall in value. Declining asset prices created a negative wealth effect, which fed on itself in the financial markets and fed back into the economy through declining spending and incomes. The bubble reversed into a bust.**

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_7_Figure_19.jpeg)

**It was the tightening that popped the bubble**. It happened as follows:

The first signs of trouble appeared in March 1929. News that the Federal Reserve Board in Washington was meeting daily, but not releasing details of the meetings, sparked rumors on Wall Street that a clampdown on speculative debt was coming.25 After two weeks of modest declines and reports of an unusual Saturday meeting of the Reserve Board, the stock market broke sharply lower on March 25 and then again on March 26. The Dow fell over four percent and the rate on call loans reached 20 percent as panic gripped the market. Trading volumes reached record levels.26 A wave of margin calls on small leveraged investors resulted in forced selling that exacerbated the decline. After the Federal Reserve Board chose not to act, National City Bank president Charles Mitchell (who was also a director of the New York Fed) announced that his bank stood ready to lend \$25 million to the market.27 This

calmed the market, rates fell, and stocks rebounded. Stocks resumed their gains, but this foreshadowed the vulnerability of stocks to tightening in the credit market.

While growth had moderated somewhat, the economy remained strong through the middle of 1929. The June *Federal Reserve Bulletin* showed that industrial production and factory employment remained at all-time highs through April, and that measures of construction had rebounded sharply after falling through the first quarter.28

After another short-lived sell-off in May, the rally accelerated and the bubble reached the blow-off phase. Stocks rose about 11 percent in June, five percent in July, and ten percent in August. This rally was supported by accelerating leverage, as household margin debt rose by more than \$1.2 billion over the same three months.

Money continued to tighten. On August 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York raised its discount rate to 6 percent,29 as it became clear that macroprudential measures had failed to slow speculative lending. At the same time, concerns about the high stock prices and interest rates caused brokers to tighten their terms in the call loan market and raise margin requirements. After dropping them as low as 10 percent the previous year, margin requirements at most brokers rose to 45 to 50 percent.30

The stock market peaked on September 3 when the Dow closed at 381—a level that it wouldn't reach again for over 25 years.

It's important to remember that no specific event or shock caused the stock market bubble to burst. As is classic with bubbles, rising prices required buying on leverage to keep accelerating at an unsustainable rate, both because speculators and lenders were near or at their max positions and because tightening changes the economics of leveraging up.

Stocks started to decline in September and early October as a series of bad news stories eroded investor confidence. On September 5, statistician Roger Babson delivered a speech to the National Business Conference that warned about a collapse in prices due to "tight money." A 2.6 percent sell-off followed that became known as the "Babson break." On September 20, the collapse of Clarence Hatry's London financial empire on fraud charges jolted markets and forced some British investors to raise funds by selling their American holdings.31 On September 26, the Bank of England raised its discount rate from 5.5 percent to an eight-year high of 6.5 percent and a few European nations followed suit.32

Together, by mid-October, these events contributed to a 10 percent sell-off in the markets from their highs. The view among investors and columnists in the major papers was largely that the worst was over and the recent volatility had been good for the market. On October 15, economist Irving Fisher proclaimed that "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau."33

"Starting as a mild reaction, that grew in intensity with each succeeding hour, a drastic break in stock prices shook the New York Stock Exchange yesterday afternoon. Liquidation that swept through the market in the final hours cut millions of dollars from the open market value of securities. It was the widest decline of the year, accomplished in little more than two hours time. The break had been foreshadowed by the continued tightening of the financial structure as brokers' loans increased, week by week, and by the nervousness and apparent hesitation which has characterized market fluctuations during the last fortnight."

*–New York Times* 

#### October 8, 1929 **Recovery in Stocks Continues**

"The recovery on the Stock Exchange which began on Saturday was resumed yesterday, after a brief period of hesitation. Before the day was over, numerous advances running to 10 points had been effected, and the majority of stocks closed around the day's best prices."

## **The Stock Market Crashes**

Then the bottom of the market fell out. Since so much happened each day during this period, and to give you a granular understanding, I will transition into a nearly day-by-day account, conveying it via both my own description and in the newsfeed.

Stocks fell sharply on Saturday, October 19, which saw the second-highest trading volume ever in a Saturday session and the decline became self-reinforcing on the downside. A wave of margin calls went out after the close, which required those who owned stocks on leverage to either put up more cash (which was hard to come by) or sell stocks, so they had to sell stocks.34 Sunday's *New York Times* headline read, "Stocks driven down as wave of selling engulfs the market."35 Still, traders widely expected that the market would recover when it opened again on Monday. Over the weekend, Thomas Lamont of J.P. Morgan, looking at the economy, wrote to President Herbert Hoover that the "future appears brilliant."36

The week of October 21 began with heavier selling. One analyst described Monday's waves of sell orders as "overwhelming and aggressive."37 Trading volume again broke records. Another wave of margin calls went out and distressed selling among levered players was prevalent.38 But markets rallied into the end of Monday's session, so losses were smaller on Monday than they'd been on Saturday.

Tuesday's session saw small gains and Wednesday's opened quietly. But any hopes that the worst had passed were shattered before the market closed on Wednesday. An avalanche of sell orders in the last hour of trading pushed stocks down sharply, which triggered a fresh round of margin calls and more forced selling.39 The Dow suffered what was then its largest one-day point loss in history, falling 20.7 points (6.3 percent) to close at 305.3.

Because the sell-off was so sharp and came so late in the day, an unprecedented number of margin calls went out that night, requiring investors to post significantly more collateral to avoid having their positions closed out when the market opened on Thursday.40 Many equity holders would be required to sell.

Everyone who worked on the exchange was alerted to be prepared for the big margin calls and sell orders that would come Thursday morning. Policemen were posted throughout the financial district in the event of trouble. New York Stock Exchange Superintendent William R. Crawford later described

*–New York Times* 

#### October 25, 1929 **Financiers Ease Tensions**

"Wall Street gave credit yesterday to its banking leaders for arresting the decline on the New York Stock Exchange at a time when the stock market was overwhelmed by selling orders. The conference at which steps were taken that reversed the market's trend was hurriedly called at the offices of JP Morgan & Co."

"electricity in the air so thick you could cut it" before the open.41 Then the collapse and panic came.

After a quieter opening, the avalanche of selling materialized and panic took hold of the market.42 Sell orders poured in from across the country, pushing down prices and generating new margin calls, which in turn pushed down prices even more. The pace of selling was so frantic that operators struggled to keep up. One exchange telephone clerk captured the scene well: "I can't get any information. The whole place is falling apart."43 Rumors of failures swirled and as news spread, huge crowds formed in the financial district.44 By noon of what would become known as Black Thursday, the major indices were down more than 10 percent.

Around midday, a small group of the biggest bankers met at the offices of J.P. Morgan and hatched a plan to stabilize the market. "The Bankers' Pool," as they were known, committed to buy \$125 million in shares. Early in the afternoon, traders acting on behalf of the bankers began to place large buy orders above the most recent price.45 As news of the plan spread, other investors began to buy aggressively in response and prices rose. After hitting a low of 272 (down 33), the Dow Jones Industrial Index bounced back to close at 299, down only six points for the day.46 But as it turned out, this would just be

the first of many failed attempts to bolster the market. Below is the *New York Times* front page from the next day:

After the market closed on Thursday, a group of about 35 brokers began organizing a second effort to stabilize the market.

Another massive wave of margin calls went out Monday night and \$150 million of call loans had been pulled from the market before Tuesday's open.53 **The Federal Reserve attempted to counter the collapse in credit by providing liquidity.** After a 3 a.m. meeting with his directors, New York Fed president George Harrison announced before the market opened that the Fed would inject \$100 million in liquidity to ease the credit crunch in the money market by purchasing government securities. Harrison needed approval from the Fed Board in Washington, but he didn't want to wait; instead he made the purchases outside the regular Open Market Investment Committee account.54 **Classically the checks and balances designed to ensure stability during normal times are poorly suited for crisis scenarios where immediate, aggressive action is required. In the late 1920s, there were few well-established paths for dealing with the debt implosion and its domino effects.**

While the Fed's liquidity eased credit conditions and likely prevented a number of failures, it wasn't enough to stop the stock market's collapse on what became known as Black Tuesday. Starting at the open, large blocks of shares flooded the market and pushed prices down.55 A rumor that the Bankers' Pool had

shifted to selling fed the panic.56 The members of the New York Stock Exchange met at noon to discuss closing the exchange, before deciding against it.57 The investment trusts were hit especially hard as the leverage that buoyed returns through the bubble started to work in reverse. Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation fell 42 percent and Blue Ridge was at one point down as much as 70 percent before recovering somewhat.58 The Dow closed down 11.7 percent, the second worst one-day loss in history. The market had fallen by 23 percent over two days and problems with leveraged speculators and their lenders were already starting to emerge.

Stocks snapped back on Wednesday, rising 12.3 percent in **one of the sharp bear market rallies that classically occur repeatedly during the depression phases of big debt crises.** Following the rally, the NYSE announced that trading would begin at noon the next day and that the exchange would be closed on the following Friday and Saturday in order to catch up on paperwork.59

Both the Fed and the Bank of England cut rates on Thursday. The Fed dropped its bank rate from 6 percent to 5 percent in coordination with the Bank of England's move to decrease its discount rate from 6.5 percent to 6 percent.60 Traders also cheered the news that call loans outstanding had fallen by more than \$1 billion from the prior week. Believing that the worst of the forced selling had passed, markets rallied again.

But speculators looking to capitalize on the prior week's rally raced to sell when the market opened on Monday and stocks plunged again. By Wednesday, the Dow was down 15 percent on the week. Stocks continued to fall the following week as well.

corporate bonds (rated BAA and below) reached their widest level in 1929, so the riskier corporate bonds were flat to down. That sort of market action equities and bonds with credit risk falling and Treasury and other low credit risk assets rising—is typical in this phase of the cycle.

Naturally the financial and psychological impacts of the stock market plunge began to hurt the economy. As is typical, politicians and business leaders continued to talk up the strength of the economy, but stats showed weakness. Industrial production had peaked in July. More timely measures of freight car loading and steel utilization released the week of November 4 showed ongoing declines in economic activity. Sharp drops in commodity markets added to these worries. By mid-November, the Dow was down almost 50 percent from its September peak.

## **Policy Responses to the Crash**

Although the Hoover Administration's handling of the market crash and economic downturn is now often criticized, its early moves were broadly praised and helped drive a meaningful stock rally. On November 13, President Hoover proposed a temporary one percent reduction in the tax rate for each income bracket and an increase to public construction spending of \$175 million.61 Two days later, Hoover announced his plan to invite a "small preliminary conference of representatives of industry, agriculture and labor" to develop a plan for fighting the downturn.62 When they convened the following week, Hoover solicited pledges from business leaders to not cut spending on capital investment or wages, and from labor union leaders to not strike or demand higher wages.63 On December 5, Hoover convened a conference of 400 of the most reputable businessmen at the time, which in turn created a leadership committee of 72 of the top business tycoons of the 1920s headed by the Chairman of the US Chamber of Commerce.64 This mix of policies was successful for a time, as was Hoover's support for the Federal Reserve System's efforts to ease credit.

As mentioned, the New York Fed aggressively provided liquidity during the crash. Within a month, it cut its discount rate from 6 percent to 5 percent and then cut it again, to 4 ½ percent.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_13_Figure_25.jpeg)

These policy moves combined with other steps by the private sector to support the stock market, most notably John D. Rockefeller's bid for one million shares of Standard Oil Co. at \$50 on November 13 (effectively flooring the price at \$50).65 On November 13, the market bottomed and began what was to be a 20 percent rally going into December. A sense of optimism took hold.

# **1930–1932: Depression**

By New Year's Day of 1930 it was widely believed that the stock market's 50 percent correction was over, which helped drive a strong rebound in the first four months of the year.66 Stocks seemed cheap because there wasn't much evidence yet that company earnings would fall much, and investors were biased by their memories of the most recent downturns (e.g., in 1907 and 1920). In both cases, the worst was over after a correction of about 50 percent, and most assumed that events would play out similarly this time.

Helping to fuel the optimism, policy makers continued to take steps to stimulate the economy. The Fed cut rates to 3.5 percent in March, bringing the total rate cuts to 2.5 percent in just five months (sparking debate within the Fed over whether it was too much stimulation and risked weakening the dollar).67 On March 25, Congress passed two appropriation bills for state road building and construction projects, bringing the total fiscal stimulus to about 1 percent of GDP.68

The consensus among economists, including those at the American Economic Association and the Federal Reserve, was that the simulative policy moves would be enough to support an economic rebound. On January 1, the *New York Times* captured how sentiment had shifted since the crash, noting, "Lack of widespread commercial failures, the absence of serious unemployment, and robust recovery in the stock market have been factors calculated to dispel the gloominess."69 As a further sign of optimism, banks were actually expanding their investments through 1930; member banks' holdings of foreign, municipal, government, and railroad bonds all rose.70

By April 10, the Dow had rallied back above 290. But despite stimulation and general optimism, economic weakness persisted. First quarter earnings were disappointing, and stocks began to slide starting in late April. **In the early stages of deleveragings, it's very common for investors and policy makers to underestimate how much the real economy will weaken, leading to small rallies that quickly reverse, and initial policy responses that aren't enough.**

Over the second half of 1930, the economy clearly began to weaken. From May through December, department store sales fell 8 percent and industrial production fell 17.6 percent. Over the course of the year, the rate of unemployment rose by over 10 percent (to 14 percent) and capacity utilization fell by 12 percent (to 67 percent). Housing and mortgage debt collapsed. Still, at that point, the decline in the economy was more akin to a shallow recession. For example, levels of consumer spending remained above the lows of previous

recessions and many industries were not yet suffering from severe declines. The charts below show how both department store sales and industrial production had slipped but had not yet collapsed to the lows of the prior recession (the gray bars highlight 1930).

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_15_Figure_11.jpeg)

As the economy weakened, the sell-off across markets resumed. Stocks ended the period on a low note: By October of 1930, the stock market had fallen

below the lows reached in November 1929. Commodities also fell sharply. Market analysts and investors alike were realizing that their hopes for a quick recovery would not materialize.71 But Hoover remained optimistic.

**Although the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates and the Treasury bond market was strong, spreads continued to widen. This increased the interest rates facing most consumers and businesses**. For example, rates rose on long-term mortgage loans, and the yields on municipal bonds, which had performed well following the crash, began to rise as credit anxieties developed. Some industries were hit particularly hard by the worsening credit conditions. Railroads had large amounts of debts they needed to roll, and were facing both tighter credit conditions and decreased earnings.72 Because railroads were considered a vital industry, the government wanted to support them, likely with a bailout. (The railroad industry's circumstances in this period parallel the struggles the auto industry faced in the 2008 financial crisis.)

## **Rising Protectionism**

**As is common in severe economic downturns, protectionist and anti-immigrant sentiment began to rise**. Politicians blamed some of the weakness on anti-competitive policies by other countries, and posited that higher tariffs would help reverse the slump in manufacturing and agriculture, while restricting immigration would help the economy deal with unemployment.73

Protectionist sentiment resulted most notably in the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which imposed tariffs on nearly 20,000 US imports. Investors and economists alike feared that the proposed 20 percent increase in tariffs would trigger a global trade war and cripple an already weak global economy.74 As the act neared passage in early May, a group of 1,028 economists issued an open letter to Hoover imploring him to veto the bill if it passed in Congress.75 Foreign governments also expressed opposition and hinted at retaliation.76 However, tariffs—particularly on agricultural imports—were one of Hoover's campaign promises, so he was reluctant to renege even as the pushback against the Smoot-Hawley tariffs became more intense.77

Source: Irwin, "Clashing Over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy"

Soon the US faced a wave of retaliatory protectionist policies. The most impactful initial response came from the US's largest trading partner, Canada, which at the time took in 20 percent of American exports. Canadian policy makers increased tariffs on 16 US goods while simultaneously lowering tariffs on imports from the British Empire.79 As similar policies piled up in the years that followed, they accelerated the collapse in global trade caused by the economic contraction.

**Restricting immigration (both legal and illegal), another common protectionist response to economic weakness, was also pursued by the Hoover administration in 1930**. On September 9, Hoover put a ban on immigration, allowing travel only for tourists, students, and working professionals, describing the policy as necessary to deal with unemployment. He later reflected in his memoir his view that, "directly or indirectly all immigrants were a public charge at the moment—either they themselves went on relief as soon as they landed, or if they did get jobs, they forced others onto relief."80

## **Bank Failures Begin**

Banks had largely held up well following the stock market crash, but as those they lent to were hurt by the crash and the economy weakened, they began to feel it. In 1930, bank net earnings declined about 40 percent compared to the prior year, but they remained on sound footing.81 Several of the largest banks even increased their dividends. They looked strong at the time compared to the markets and the economy, and many analysts believed that they would be a source of support through the downturn.82 The majority of early failures were confined to banks in the Midwest and country banks that had a lot of money in real estate loans, and were exposed to losses from a drought.83 While the failures started small, they spread as credit problems spread.

By December, 1930 bank failures had become a meaningful risk to the broader economy. Worries about the banks led to runs on them. **Runs on**

## Before I get into the banking failures, it's important to discuss the gold

standard, since it played an important role in determining how the 1930s debt crisis transpired. As I described in prior sections of the book, when debts are denominated in one's own currency, deleveragings can generally be managed well. **Being on a gold standard is akin to having debts denominated in a foreign currency** because creditors could demand payment in gold (as was often written into contracts), and policy makers couldn't freely print money, as too much printing would lead people to redeem their money for gold. **So policy makers were working with a limited toolkit until they broke the link to gold**.

The most important bank failure of this period was that of the Bank of the United States, which had some 400,000 depositors, more than any bank in the country at the time.84 The run on it began on December 10 because of a false rumor. Wall Street financiers—including the heads of J.P. Morgan and Chase—met at the New York Fed to determine whether they should provide the \$30 million that was required to save the bank. Many within the group thought that the bank was insolvent, not simply illiquid, so they should let it fail.85 New York Superintendent of Banks Joseph Broderick argued that its closing "would result in the closing of at least ten other banks in the city and … it might even affect the savings banks" (e.g., it was systemically important). He also noted that he believed the bank to be solvent.86 Broderick's colleagues ultimately did not agree with him. When the bank closed its doors the next day, it was the biggest single bank failure in history.87 The *New York Times* would later refer to its failure as "The First Domino In the Depression."88 It was

certainly a turning point for public confidence in the nation's banking system.

Banks are structurally vulnerable to runs because of the liquidity mismatch between their liabilities (i.e., short-term deposits) and assets (i.e., illiquid loans and securities), so even a sound bank can fail if it can't sell its assets fast enough to meet its liabilities. **Because of the gold standard, the Federal Reserve was restricted in how much it could print money, limiting how much it could lend to a bank facing liquidity problems (i.e., act as a "lender of last resort"). There were also legal constraints. For instance, the Fed at the time was only allowed to give direct access to its credit to member**

The Chelsea Bank operated entirely outside the financial district and its closing has no bearing on the position of other banking institutions. It is, moreover, a small bank as New York banks go, not a member of the Clearing House or the Federal Reserve system."

The end of 1930 also saw the political winds beginning to shift. With the downturn playing prominently in voters' minds, the Democrats swept Congress in the November mid-term elections. This foreshadowed FDR's win in the presidential election two years later.90

## **First Quarter, 1931: Optimism Gives Way to Gloom as Economy Continues to Deteriorate**

At the start of 1931, economists, politicians, and other experts in both the US and Europe still retained hope that there would be an imminent return to normalcy because the problems still seemed manageable. The bank failures of the previous quarter were thought to be inconsequential, and not damaging to the overall financial system.

By March, all business indexes were pointing to a rise in employment, wages, and industrial production. Bank runs led to a less than 10 percent drop in deposits.91 The news reflected growing economic confidence: on March 23, the *New York Times* declared that the depression had bottomed, and the U.S. economy was on its way back up.92 New investment trusts were being formed to profit from the expected "long recovery."93

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_18_Figure_12.jpeg)

Optimism was also bolstered by the recovery of the stock market. Through the end of February, the Dow rose more than 20 percent off its December lows. The following chart illustrates the index's rise.

Business activity, which began to recede in midsummer of 1929 after the rapid expansion of the preceding year and a half, continued to decline at a rapid rate during the last half of 1930, following a brief recovery in the spring. Almost all branches of industry shared in the decline. Employment declined, and total income of both wage earners and farmers decreased. At the same time wholesale prices throughout the world declined considerably, and retail prices also reflected this decline, although in smaller degree."

But the rally wasn't sustained. Growing concerns over Europe and indications of weak first quarter earnings caused stock prices to slip through March and end the quarter at 172.4, down 11.3 percent from their February highs.

## **The Growing Debate over Economic Policy**

**In a depression, the main ways that politics might play a role are by standing in the way of the implementation of sensible economic policies or by leading to extreme policies. These are important risks that can make a depression worse.**

After more than a year of economic contraction, the political debate over economic policy was intensifying. By this time, more than six million people were unemployed in the United States and there was no agreement among policy makers and business leaders on how to deal with it.94 Understanding this debate is key to understanding why policy makers took certain steps that ultimately worsened the crisis. It also helps illustrate many of the classic mistakes policy makers make when handling big debt crises.

The fiscal policy debate centered on whether or not the Federal government should significantly ramp up spending to support the economy. Senate Democrats, joined by some Republicans, pushed the President to increase "direct relief" for those facing particularly difficult circumstances. That would of course mean larger deficits and more debt, and it would mean changing the rules of the game to shift wealth from one set of players to others, rather than letting the game play out in a way that would provide good lessons to help prevent such problems in the future (i.e., the moral hazard perspective). There was also a strong belief that, if this money was just given away and not turned into productivity, it would be wasted. So while the Hoover administration had supported earlier fiscal stimulus, it opposed significant direct relief from the Federal government that would "bring an inevitable train of corruption and waste such as our nation had never witnessed." Hoover's administration instead advocated for what he called "indirect relief"—a mix of policies that included lobbying the private sector to invest and keep employment steady, reliance on aid from state and local governments, immigration restrictions, and macroprudential policies to encourage lending.95

While concerns over budget deficits limited stimulus spending, by 1931, the federal government budget deficit grew to 3 percent of GDP. The deficit was due to falling tax revenue, which had collapsed to nearly half of 1929 levels,

and an increase in social spending of about \$1 billion that had been approved the previous year. Treasury Secretary Mellon believed that balancing the budget was a necessary first step to restore business confidence.96 Hoover agreed for reasons he later summarized in his memoir: "National stability required that we balance the budget."97

**Worries over the deficit and a push for austerity are classic responses to the depression phase of a big debt crisis. Austerity seems like the obvious response, but the problem is that one person's spending is another person's income, so when spending is cut, incomes are also cut, with the result that it takes an awful lot of painful spending cuts to make significant reductions in debt/income ratios.**

For all the suffering that the Depression had caused, a sense of crisis-driven urgency hadn't yet developed. The economy was still contracting over the first half of 1931, but at a slower rate than the year before. Hoover was certain that indirect relief was meeting the needs of the people and he did not see the need to use additional fiscal supports.98 As we'll discuss later, this ultimately tipped the debate, and **the Hoover administration to make the classic rookie mistake of leaning too heavily on austerity and other deflationary levers**

relative to more stimulative policies until the pain of doing these things became intolerable.

## **Second Quarter, 1931: The Global Dollar Shortage Causes a Global Debt Crisis and a Strong Dollar**

Because dollar-denominated credit was collapsing and a lot of dollar-denominated debt that required dollar credit to service it existed around the world, a global dollar shortage emerged during the first half of 1931. **Classically, there is a squeeze in a reserve currency that is widely lent by foreign financial institutions when there is a collapse of credit creation in that currency.** Although other currencies faced a shortage amid the credit crunch, the dollar was particularly impacted because of its role as a global funding currency. At the same time, falling US imports reduced foreigners' dollar income, intensifying the squeeze. Note that virtually the same dollar squeeze dynamics occurred in the 2008 crisis for the same reasons.

As the financial markets and many other markets are global, one can't understand all that happened by looking only at the US. What happened in the US had a big impact on what happened in Germany, which led to big political changes that were felt around the world in the 1930s and early 1940s. In 1931

The extent to which such an influence has operated remains to be seen."

Germany was the epicenter of the emerging dollar squeeze. It had previously faced great difficulty paying back the reparation debt it owed and had been forced to borrow as a result. The country had become a popular destination for the "carry trade," in which investors would lend their dollars to Germany to earn a higher yield than they would get in dollars and Germans would borrow in dollars to get the lower interest rate. Once again, this type of behavior is classic in the "good times," when there is little perceived risk and large cross-country credit creation, and sets up the conditions that make the "bad times" worse when the reversal happens. At the time, Germany was highly dependent on this flow of money that could easily be pulled, and by 1931, American banks and companies held about a billion dollars in short-term German bills (equal to about six percent of German GDP).99 That made both the German borrowers and the American banks and companies very vulnerable.

Also, as is typical in such times, economies and wealth disparities fuel the rise of populist and extremist leaders globally, with the ideological fight between the authoritarian left and the authoritarian right. Both the German Communist party and Hitler's Nazi party made big electoral gains as the German economy struggled—with the Nazis going from under 3 percent support in the 1928 Reichstag elections to over 18 percent in September 1930. Meanwhile, the largest party (center left Social Democratic Party) slipped to less than a quarter of Reichstag seats.100 Together, the far right and far left parties easily had enough parliamentary support to force Germany into an unstable multi-party coalition government. Germany was essentially becoming ungovernable.

The global trade war made economic conditions and the dollar squeeze worse. The collapse in global trade depressed foreigners' dollar income, which in turn made it harder for foreigners to service their dollar debts. As shown below, US imports in dollars had fallen by about 50 percent from 1929 to 1931.

In a warning that would be echoed by global politicians and business leaders in

As such, he stressed the necessity for the US government to reduce debts owed to them from abroad.

The shortage of dollars made borrowing more expensive, creating a liquidity squeeze in central Europe. To alleviate the liquidity squeeze and allow the

continued financing of fiscal deficits, these governments naturally turned to some money printing (since the alternative of allowing the credit crunch to spiral was worse). This increased inflation, raising fears of a return to the hyperinflation of the early 1920s in Germany. In essence, Germany was facing a balance of payments crisis. On May 7, the US Ambassador to Germany, Frederic M. Sackett, told President Hoover of Germany's economic strain, listing its pockets of weakness: capital flight, currency difficulties, unemployment, global tightening of credit, pressures for debt payments, and refusals to renew foreign held German bank accounts.101

Austria was also facing major losses. On May 8, Credit Anstalt, the oldest and largest of Austria's banks, announced a \$20 million loss resulting partially from its role in the rescue of another failing bank in 1929 that had nearly wiped out its equity.102 A run ensued and this spread to a run on the Austrian currency. **When risks emerge that systemically important institutions will fail, policy makers must take steps to keep these entities running to limit the impact of their failure on other solvent institutions or the economy at large. Keeping these institutions intact is also important for keeping credit pipes in place for lending to creditworthy borrowers, particularly for financial systems with a concentrated set of lenders.** But since Austria was on the gold standard, policy makers couldn't print money to provide liquidity and other frantic attempts to secure loans to stabilize the bank failed.

Geopolitical strains made the crisis worse. France feared Austria and Germany's increasingly close ties. In an effort to weaken those countries, the French government encouraged the Bank of France and other French banks to withdraw the short-term credit they had provided to Austria.103

Viewing the interconnectedness of global financial institutions and the weakness of Europe as potential threats to its domestic recovery, the United States began to study methods of relieving the pressure on the German economy. On May 11, President Hoover asked Treasury Secretary Mellon and Secretary of State Henry Stimson to look into relaxing Germany's significant payments for war debts and reparations. A proposal was not put forth until early the next month.104

In the interim, bank runs spread throughout Europe. Hungary reported bank runs starting in May, leading to the imposition of a bank holiday.105 The German government nationalized Dresdner Bank, the nation's second largest bank, by buying its preferred shares.106 Major financial institutions failed across Romania, Latvia, and Poland.107

Germany was facing capital flight. The country's gold and foreign exchange reserves fell by a third in June, to the lowest level in five years. To stem the outflow of capital, the bank tightened monetary policy, increasing its discount rate to 15 percent and its collateralized loan rate to 20 percent.108

Investors took heavy losses as more and more bank failures hurt the stock market. In May, German stocks fell 14.2 percent, British stocks were down 9.8 percent and French stocks sold off 6.9 percent. In the US, the Dow sold off 15 percent in May following a 12.3 percent decline in April. The world was imploding.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_23_Figure_24.jpeg)

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_23_Figure_23.jpeg)

Political turmoil in Europe led funds to flow into the US, which increased demand for US Treasuries and pushed down interest rates. In an attempt to lessen the demand for dollars, the Federal Reserve reduced its discount rate to 1.5 percent.

On June 5, President Hoover suggested to his cabinet that all governments grant a moratorium of a year on all intergovernmental payments. President Paul von Hindenburg of the Weimar Republic made an appeal, stating that Germany was in danger of collapse, which helped push Hoover to swiftly adopt the plan.109 On June 20, Hoover officially announced his proposal for a moratorium on Germany's debts for one year. Under his proposal, the US would forgo \$245 million in debt service payments due over the next year from Britain, France, and other European powers. However, in order to receive these concessions, the allies had to suspend \$385 million in reparations due from Germany.110

In what became known as the "moratorium rally," the Dow rallied 12 percent in the two days following Hoover's announcement and ended the month 23 percent above the low that it had reached on June 2. German stocks rose 25 percent on the first day of trading following the announcement. Commodity prices soared in the following weeks.

"Led by New York, tremendous buying enthusiasm swept over the security and commodity markets of the world yesterday in response to week-end developments reflecting the favorable reception of President Hoover's proposal for a one-year moratorium on war debts and reparations."

On July 6, the moratorium negotiations finally concluded. Fifteen countries agreed to it, though the share of German reparations that were suspended in the final agreement was lower than Hoover's initial proposal. France refused to participate, but did agree to re-lend their reparations back in to Germany.111 The Dow slumped 4.5 percent on the day.

The chart below puts things in perspective; the arrow under the grey shaded area shows the moratorium rally. Notice how insignificant that 35 percent rally looks within the bigger moves. I can assure you that those sorts of moves don't seem small when you're going through them. Throughout the Great Depression, announcements of big policy moves like this one repeatedly produced waves of optimism and big rallies, amid a decline that totaled almost 90 percent. Investors were repeatedly disappointed when the policy moves weren't enough and the economy continued to deteriorate. As noted earlier, bear market rallies like this are classic in a depression, since workers, investors, and policy makers have a strong tendency to exaggerate the importance of relatively small things that appear big close-up.

## **Third Quarter, 1931: The Debt Moratorium Fails and the Run on Sterling Begins**

It quickly became clear that the debt moratorium wasn't going to be enough to save Germany. In early July, rumors circulated that one of Germany's largest banks, Danat Bank, was on the verge of failure.112 The Reichsbank, Germany's central bank, viewed it as systemically important and wanted to bail it out to avert the complete collapse of the German credit system, but it lacked the foreign reserves needed to do that.113

On July 8, just one day after the moratorium had been finalized, Reichsbank president Hans Luther began to reach out to policy makers from Britain to request further negotiations of Germany's current debts and the possibility of a new loan. Luther needed a new \$1 billion loan without political concessions. Policy makers from the other countries balked at this—no one wanted to lend even more to Germany.114 Hoover instead proposed a 'standstill' agreement, which would require all banks holding German and Central European short-term obligations to keep the credit extended, exposing them to big liquidity and potential solvency problems as they needed the cash to meet their obligations.115

This release of gold was connected with a largescale withdrawal of short-time funds from the German market. During the period from May 31 to June 23 the Reichsbank lost \$230,000,000 in gold and \$20,000,000 in foreign exchange, with the consequence that its reserves were reduced close to the minimum required by law." *–Federal Reserve Bulletin*

Naturally, banks were opposed to the standstill agreement and Treasury Secretary Mellon implored Hoover to reconsider. Hoover would not budge. He described his reasoning in his memoir: "This was a banker-made crisis… the bankers must shoulder the burden of the solution, not our taxpayers."116 **Hoover's instinct to have the banks bear the cost is a classic but misguided policy response to a debt crisis. Punishing the banks in a way that weakens them makes sense for a few moral and economic reasons, as mentioned in the discussion of the archetypal template, and it can be a political necessity as the public hates the bankers at such times—but it can have disastrous consequences for the financial system and markets.**

Without a forceful policy response in support of the banks, the collapse continued and Germany's depression became much worse, inciting riots across the country.117 Hitler was gearing up to run for Chancellor; he adopted the strongly populist stance of threatening to not repay the country's reparation debts at all. When the foreign ministers met in London on July 20, plans for a new loan slowly fizzled. Ultimately they put in place a three-month extension of an earlier loan along with a standstill agreement. The result was a classic run on the currency as described in the archetypal template.

## **The Run on Sterling**

Germany's problems proved to be a key source of contagion. UK banks had lots of loans to Germany, so they couldn't get their money out; when foreign investors saw that the UK's banks were in trouble, they began to pull their money. On July 24, France began withdrawing gold from England. This was interpreted as a lack of confidence in the pound, which prompted more countries to pull their deposits from Britain, and the run on sterling began.118

To defend the currency, the Bank of England sold its reserves (a third of them in August alone) and raised interest rates, both classic moves. Foreigners were watching the weekly declines in gold reserves, so the pressure on the pound only increased.

The Bank of England also sought loans from abroad to support the currency, but these loans effectively funded the flight out of sterling. On August 1, 1931, the Bank requested that the US government organize a loan from private US banks totaling \$250 million, which Hoover urged to be done right away.119 The flight from sterling continued and the Bank of England received another loan, this time of \$200 million from American banks and \$200 million from French banks, which was made on August 28.120 Hoover approved of them, but acknowledged after the fact that, "Both loans, however, mostly served to create more fear."121

On Saturday, September 19, having exhausted all of its foreign loans and with just over £100 million in gold reserves remaining, the Bank of England stopped supporting the pound and let it fall sharply, and of course the following day, officially suspended gold payments, a de facto default.122 Initially, the public did not understand what going off the gold standard would mean for their transactions. Newspapers lamented it as the end of an era.123

Sterling fell 30 percent over the next three months. On the first trading day since gold payments had been halted, sterling dropped to \$3.70, nearly 25 percent lower than its pre-default level of \$4.86. British policy makers didn't intervene in the market to slow the fall or maintain stability. Sterling exchange rates fluctuated greatly before dropping to a low of \$3.23 in December. Over the same period, the UK's equity market recovered and rose 11 percent in local currency terms.

Other countries followed the UK in abandoning gold convertibility so they could finally "print money" and devalue their currencies. Most of these devaluations were roughly 30 percent (e.g., the Nordic countries, Portugal, much of eastern Europe, New Zealand, Australia, India), in line with sterling's devaluation. The chart, below right, shows the depreciations for a few countries.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_26_Figure_4.jpeg)

Investors feared that government bonds would be defaulted on with devalued money. This led to a run out of bonds, which raised interest rates and drove bond prices down. In the United States, the Fed raised interest rates by 2 percent in order to attract foreign capital and hold the gold peg. Each government's bonds hit new lows in 1931. All except Switzerland's and France's declined at least 20 percent from their 1931 highs. Global stocks also sold off and some markets stopped trading altogether. On September 21, only the Paris Stock Exchange was open in Europe.124

UK stocks and bonds sold off during the currency defense phase and continued to weaken immediately following the devaluation, but then rebounded. Because the UK's debt was denominated in its own currency, there wasn't a risk that the government couldn't pay it back. Consistent with these pressures on the bond market, the UK's 5.5 percent bonds due in 1937 had dropped to \$92 after the devaluation from \$104 (as interest rates rose from 4.7 percent to 5.7 percent in December), but they moved back up to \$100 by the end of the year.125

The devaluation helped stimulate the export sector of the economy and allowed the Bank of England to ease significantly, cutting rates by one percent by the end of the year. Equilibrium was reached so that, by the end of October, banks in London were receiving money again. **In other words, the devaluation and money printing kicked off a beautiful deleveraging** (I'll go through this more later, when I discuss the US leaving the gold standard). Consistent with these pressures, UK stocks and bonds both rallied after selling off sharply through the currency defense phase and immediately following the devaluation. It is important to understand that these moves are very classic. Why they work as they do is explained in the archetypal template.

## **Fourth Quarter, 1931: The International Crisis Spreads to the US and the Depression Worsens**

As other currencies devalued and the dollar rose, it created more deflationary/ depressing pressures in the US. Sterling's devaluation in September 1931 especially stunned global investors and sent shock waves through US markets. Naturally investors and savers around the world began to question whether the US was safe from either default or devaluation, so they started to sell out of their dollar debt positions. That raised interest rates and tightened liquidity, bringing on the most painful period of the depression, lasting until FDR took the US off the gold standard eighteen months later to devalue the dollar and print money.

Stocks had sold off during the run on sterling. The Dow finished September down 30.7 percent, its largest monthly loss since the crisis began. On October 5, the market fell 10.7 percent in a single day. Amid the chaos, the NYSE once again banned short selling in a classic attempt to slow the sell-off.126 While previously "safe" treasury bonds had rallied as stocks crashed in 1929 and 1930, they were now selling off along with stocks, reflecting the US balance of payments crisis. The yield on long-term US treasuries rose to 4 percent, nearly 1 percent above their midyear lows. Due to the US's stock of debts and their rising debt service, there were concerns about the US Treasury's ability to roll

bonds that would come due in the following two years.127 The fear of devaluation led to particularly acute runs on US banks, so banks needed to sell bonds to raise cash, which contributed to rising yields.128

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_28_Figure_1.jpeg)

In September 1931, the dollar ceased to be a safe haven for the first time since the global debt crisis began. Gold reserves began to flow out of the US following sterling's devaluation as central banks in France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands all began to convert their dollars to gold. The US lost about 10 percent of its gold reserves within the three weeks following the sterling devaluation.

On October 9, in an effort to attract investors, the New York Federal Reserve Bank increased the discount rate from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent. This was no different than tightening, which is not a path to good things in a depression. **Classically, in a balance of payments crisis, interest rate increases large enough to adequately compensate holders of debt in weak currency for the currency risk are way too large to be tolerated by the domestic economy, so they don't work.** This was no exception, so a week later, the New York Fed again raised its interest rate to 3.5 percent.129 Rumors flew that the head of the New York Fed, George Harrison, had asked the French not to withdraw any more gold from the United States.130

Given the domestic difficulties, investors in the US had taken to hoarding gold and cash. This led to a series of bank runs in late 1931 that caused many banks to close and resulted in a big contraction in deposits for those remaining open. As banks' deposits fell, they began to call their loans in order to build up their cash reserves. Homes and farms were forced into foreclosure, and several companies went bankrupt as investors did not roll loans they had previously extended.131

#### November 1931 **Review of the Month**

"During the 6-week period following the suspension of gold payments by Great Britain there was a decrease in the country's stock of monetary gold amounting to \$730,000,000 and an increase in currency outstanding of \$390,000,000. Both of these factors increased the demand for reserve bank credit, and the total volume of this credit, notwithstanding a considerable decrease in member bank reserve balances, increased by \$930,000,000 during the period, and was at the end of October at the highest level in 10 years. The outflow of gold, which began at the time of the suspension of gold payments by Great Britain on September 21, was the largest movement of the metal during a similar period in any country at any time."

As money and credit contracted, the economy started to fall off a cliff. Over the second half of 1931, industrial production contracted by 14.3 percent and department store sales fell 12.9 percent. By the end of 1931, unemployment had reached nearly 20 percent, and domestic prices were falling 10 percent per year.

Department Store Sales (Nominal) Industrial Production

The Hoover administration took several steps to stem bank failures and stimulate the flow of credit in late 1931. The most notable among these was the creation of the National Credit Association, which provided a pool of private money that could be lent against sound collateral to provide liquidity to banks at risk of failing (i.e., a private central bank). The funds came from the banks and totaled \$500 million, with the ability to borrow another billion.132

At the same time, Hoover was looking for solutions for the collapsing real estate market. To stop foreclosures on mortgages of "the homes and farms of responsible people," he sought to create a system of Home Loan Discount Banks, which he did in 1932.In the meantime, he worked with both the insurance and real estate agencies to suspend foreclosures on farm loans by the Federal Land Banks, while providing the institution with \$1 billion so that it could expand its lending.133

The policies were well received and broadly inspired confidence among investors. The stock market rallied in response, up 35 percent from its October bottom to November 9, with a jump of more than 10 percent on the day the National Credit Association was announced. The rally made some believe the worst was over, as most significant rallies do. Yet there was no significant change in the total money and credit available, so the fundamental imbalance

Stocks reached a new low near the end of December.

## **First Half of 1932: Growing Government Intervention Unable to Halt Economic Collapse**

The depression deepened in 1932, as the economy continued to plunge with deflation and credit problems worsening. An astounding number of businesses were struggling or failing—in aggregate, businesses experienced \$2.7 billion in losses and bankruptcies hit record levels, with almost 32,000 failures and \$928 million in liabilities.134 News of bank failures filled the newspapers. As those losses rippled through the system, imposing losses on lenders and causing other businesses to close shop, the economy contracted still more.

**US Bank Suspensions by Year** 2,000 2,500

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_30_Figure_15.jpeg)

**It is classic in a big debt crisis: Policy makers play around with deflationary levers to bring down debt for a couple of years but eventually wake up to the fact that the depressing effects of debt reduction and austerity are both too painful and inadequate to produce the effects that are needed. So more aggressive policies are undertaken.** As it became clear that the Hoover administration hadn't done enough to reverse the credit contraction, it announced another set of policies during the first part of 1932 in an attempt to provide liquidity to the banking system and get credit going again.

On January 23, Hoover launched the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The RFC was funded with \$500 million in capital and had the ability to borrow from the Treasury or private sources up to \$3 billion; its goal was to provide liquidity to solvent banks to shore them up against failure.135 The RFC benefited from a more extensive mandate than the Federal Reserve—it was able to lend against a wider range of collateral and to a broader range of entities. It could also lend to state-chartered banks, banks in rural areas that were not a part of the Federal Reserve System (i.e., some of the banks most affected by the crisis), and railroads, which were an important industry at the time (like the auto industry in 2008).136 **Lending against a widening range of collateral and to an increasingly wide range of borrowers is a classic lever that policy makers pull to ensure that sufficient liquidity gets to the financial system, sometimes provided by central banks and sometimes by central governments.**

The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, designed principally 'to provide emergency financing facilities for financial institutions' and 'to aid in financing agriculture, industry, and commerce' was approved by the President on January 22, 1932. In announcing his approval the President said of the new corporation: 'It brings into being a powerful organization with adequate resources, able to strengthen weaknesses that may develop in our credit, banking, and railway structure in order to permit business and industry to carry on normal activities free from the fear of unexpected shocks and retarding influences.'" *–Federal Reserve Bulletin*

### February 1932

#### **National Summary of Business Conditions**

"Industrial activity declined from November to December by slightly more than the usual seasonal amount, while the volume of factory employment showed about the usual decrease. Wholesale prices declined further."

*–Federal Reserve Bulletin*

By the end of August 1932, the RFC had lent \$1.3 billion to 5,520 financial institutions, helping to reduce the number of bank failures.137 But the RFC was only able to lend against "good" collateral. And so it was unable to provide sufficient support to some of the institutions that needed it the most.138

Around this time, the Fed started to experiment with money printing. Going into the crisis, the Federal Reserve was only able to lend against gold or certain forms of commercial paper. With both in short supply, policy makers were once again faced with the trade-off between further tightening and undermining the dollar's peg to gold. **The 1932 Banking Act, signed by Hoover on February 27, attempted to alleviate the liquidity squeeze while maintaining the gold standard by increasing the Federal Reserve's ability to print money, but only to buy government bonds (which 75 years later would be called "quantitative easing").**139 This move was contentious, since it was clearly a weakening of the principles behind the gold standard, but the sense of urgency was such that the bill passed without debate.140 As Hoover framed it, the decision was "in a sense a national defense measure."141, **Later that year, Congress gave the Federal Reserve additional powers to print money and provide liquidity in an emergency.**<sup>142</sup> **This provision—Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act would end up being critical to the Fed's response to the 2008 debt crisis.** 

The Federal Reserve System bought nearly \$50 million in government securities each week in April and nearly \$100 million each week in May. By June, the system had purchased over \$1.5 billion in government securities. The following chart illustrates the Federal Reserve's purchases and holdings of government debt in 1931 and 1932.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_31_Figure_23.jpeg)

Once the Federal Reserve began purchases, yields on short-term Treasury securities fell rapidly with three month T-Bill yields falling more than two percent over the first half of the year. Fed purchases also relieved pressure in the market for longer-term treasury bonds, where the supply-demand imbalance for dollars had reached a breaking point amid large deficits and foreign reluctance to hold US assets. After rising above 4.3 percent in January, yields on ten-year treasuries fell below 3.5 percent over the next six months.

These moves ignited optimism and yet another rally, and the Dow Jones increased by 19.5 percent, reaching January's high. It closed above 80 in February.

**Senate Body Acts for Broad Inquiry on Short Selling; Banking Committee Will Go Beyond Hoover Idea in Stock Exchange Investigation**  "An investigation of the New York Stock Exchange was recommended today by the Senate Banking and Currency Committee. A subcommittee, headed by Senator Walcott, Republican, of Connecticut, immediately began drafting a resolution requesting authority for such an investigation from the Senate."

Policy makers also took a number of smaller steps to support the banking system during the first half of 1932. **Another classic move was the abandonment of mark-to-market accounting for banks.** In January, the Comptroller of the Currency instructed bank examiners to use par value as the intrinsic value of bonds held by national banks with a BAA rating or better.143 Under the prior accounting methodology, banks faced either major paper losses on the bonds they held or cash losses if they sold them. Those losses reduced their capital, forcing them to raise money or sell assets, further constraining liquidity and pushing down asset prices. The change in accounting rules relieved some of the most immediate pressure on banks.

**The Hoover administration also tried to get credit going with macroprudential measures**, most notably applying direct pressure on banks in an attempt to get them to lend. Hoover and Treasury Secretary Ogden Mills had blamed the banks for their inability to stimulate credit, and accused them of restricting loans and hoarding gold and cash. Hoover organized committees in the twelve Federal Reserve districts which tried to pressure large regional banks into lending, but this effort met with little success.144

Though some were helpful, none of these moves were enough to halt the

economic collapse. Pressure on US gold reserves continued because foreigners worried that with the monetary expansion and the expanding deficit, the US would not be able to sustain the dollar's conversion to gold at existing rates.145 As they rushed to make the conversion, gold left the country every month from March to June. In June net gold exports hit \$206 million, a level last experienced following the depreciation of sterling.146 That produced a tightening of credit.

In March, stocks sold off and the market suffered a decline that extended through 11 weeks. The Dow Jones dropped 50 percent, from 88 on March 8 to 44 on May 31. The Dow Jones closed in May on a low for the month, and volume further declined that month to about 750,000 shares per day.147 Early in the crisis, government efforts to increase lending and spending had led to sustained rallies in asset markets. At this stage, however, investors had become disillusioned. They worried that Hoover's programs were not making enough of a difference to make up for their vast cost, and markets continued to trend downward.

**Social unrest and conflict continued to rise globally.** In Germany, Hitler won the most seats in the Reichstag election. Japan slipped toward militarism, invading Manchuria in 1931 and Shanghai in 1932. In the US, strikes and protests were also increasing.148 Unemployment was approaching 25 percent, and those still employed faced wage cuts. Outside of cities, farmers faced ruin as prices fell and a drought destroyed their crops. In one dramatic expression of discontent, thousands of veterans and their families had marched on Washington in June (and stayed there) in an attempt to pressure the government to immediately pay them their veterans' bonuses.149 On July 28, US Army troops led by General Douglas MacArthur cleared the camp with tanks and tear gas. It was at this time that conflicts both within countries and between countries intensified, sowing the seeds of populism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and militarism that at first led to economic warfare and then military warfare in Europe in September 1939 and with Japan in December 1941.

## **Second Half of 1932: Further Contractions and the Election of FDR**

By the summer, the big stimulation and relief to banks appeared to be helping. The downward spiral began to moderate, asset prices stabilized, and production actually increased in certain areas of the economy, like autos. From May through June, commodities, stocks, and bonds all bottomed. Markets for both stocks and bonds improved during the second half of the year. In August and September, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied to a peak of 80, almost double its July low. You can see trajectory of the Dow in the chart below.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_33_Figure_21.jpeg)

*Time* magazine's August 8, 1932, edition claimed that the rally occurred because the gold outflow had finally ceased, rumors had spread about the country receiving foreign capital, and a railroad merger had been approved.

As optimism about the economy and asset markets began to increase, policy makers began to pull back on their earlier stimulative measures. Also, the RFC was weakened significantly by a scandal when it bailed out Central Republic Bank and Trust, which was headed by the previous chair of the RFC. The public was outraged—the RFC now seemed like a tool of fat-cat bankers.150 In response, Congress ordered the RFC to publish the names of all the institutions to which they had lent.151 This effectively meant that getting a loan from the RFC also required advertising that you were in trouble, which of course worsened pressure from depositor withdrawals. Borrowing from the RFC slowed, and withdrawals began to pick up pace.152

**Outrage over the government's role in "bailing out" financial institutions is one outgrowth of the "Main Street versus Wall Street," or "workers versus investors" conflicts that classically occur during depressions. As economic pain increases, populist calls to "punish the bankers that caused this mess" make it incredibly difficult for policy makers to take the actions that are needed to save the financial system and the economy.** After all, if the bankers quit in this chaos, the system would certainly shut down.

Politics also played a part in ending the Fed's purchases of government bonds. The Banking Act passed in February had been framed as a temporary measure due to concerns that it might weaken the dollar. Members of the Federal Reserve from Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston pushed for ending open market operations, arguing that since banks were accumulating increasing reserves but not significantly expanding credit, the program was not necessary (and the lower long-term interest rates from the program were hurting bank profitability). In July they stopped participating, and the New York Fed, unable to continue on its own, was forced to acquiesce.153

The administration was worried about the budget deficit ballooning, as receipts fell and expenditures rose.154 **With almost universal support, Hoover pushed to balance the budget through a mix of tax increases and cuts to federal expenditures.**155 On June 6, the Revenue Act of 1932 was signed into law. The act increased income taxes, corporation taxes, and various excise taxes. But despite these efforts, the budget deficit grew significantly relative to GDP because the austerity was contractionary and the economy shrank faster than the budget deficit did.156 **As mentioned earlier, Hoover's attempt to balance the budget through austerity was a rookie move that is classic in depressions.**

**As is also classic in deleveraging scenarios, the debate about what to do became antagonistically political, with strong populist overtones.** Roosevelt came on the scene with what, at the time, seemed like leftist populist policies. From the outset his presidential campaign struck a strongly anti-speculator tone. It opened with a speech that railed against securities firms' abuses and called for federal control of the stock and commodities exchanges.157 There were indications that he favored a devaluation of the dollar, which increased the pressure on the currency. To allay those fears, Roosevelt said he would not take the country off the gold standard, but investors were not convinced.158 **By the way, politicians and policy makers frequently make disingenuous promises that are expedient and inconsistent with economic and market fundamentals, and such promises should never be believed.**

Bank failures were ticking upward, open market operations had ended, the RFC had been neutered, government spending had been reined in, and the threat of devaluation loomed large. Gold outflows resumed and prices, which had recently begun to stabilize, started to fall. The economy's downward trajectory steepened.

The renewed pressure on the banking sector moved into higher gear in November. Right before the election, Nevada declared the first statewide bank holiday, a classic response to widespread bank runs. Although Nevada was able

Anderson Jr., economist of the Chase National Bank, declared yesterday in an address before the forum on investment banking of the Graduate School of Business Administration of New York University." *–New York Times* 

to avert the failure of its main state bank, the holiday sparked a national panic.159 Fearing that their bank might be next, depositors accelerated their withdrawals. Crisis dynamics were beginning to return.

The collapse of the economy throughout 1932 was breathtaking. The charts below show some of the economic stats, highlighting the period from sterling's devaluation until the end of 1932. Consumer spending and production fell by more than 20 percent and unemployment rose by more than 16 percent. Severe deflation had taken hold and prices were falling by almost one percent every month.

![](Attachments/BigDebtCycles_page_35_Figure_12.jpeg)

**Policy makers' reliance on the deflationary levers of debt reduction had pushed the US into a severe depression/"ugly deleveraging."** Since nominal interest rates were well above nominal growth rates, debt grew faster than income and debt burdens rose despite defaults.

But while investors were worried about the effects of a Roosevelt presidency, the populist nature of his campaign (along with the terrible economic conditions) propelled him to victory. Roosevelt was elected in November 1932, winning 22.8 million votes against Hoover's 15.8 million, the most popular votes ever won by a presidential candidate up to that time.

Driven by weak economic conditions, an uneven recovery (in which the elite was perceived to be prospering while the common man was still struggling), and ineffectual policy makers, populism was a global phenomenon in the interwar period (the 1920s to the 1930s), leading to regime changes not only in the United States, but also in Germany, Italy, and Spain. In the United States, inequality (in both income and wealth shares) peaked in the early 1930s, but

remained high for the rest of the decade. By the time of Roosevelt's election, the top 10 percent earned 45 percent of the income and owned 85 percent of the wealth while unemployment was over 20 percent. These conditions caused FDR to base his campaign on a "New Deal," which promised big changes for workers, debtors, and the unemployed.160

Europe had a similar set of economic conditions. Germany had experienced both a hyperinflation and the start of the Great Depression in the prior fifteen years. Inequality was also high—the top 10 percent earned about 40 percent of the income, while unemployment was over 25 percent. This set the stage for the Nazi party's ascent.161

## **1933: Preinauguration**

Gold continued to flow out of the country in anticipation of Roosevelt's reflationary policies, and Roosevelt now refused to reaffirm his commitment to the gold standard. Those around him attempted to persuade him to reassure the markets. Senator Carter Glass, who was Roosevelt's likely nominee for Secretary of the Treasury, declared that he would not accept the post if Roosevelt could not guarantee the country would stay on the gold standard.162 Hoover wrote a personal letter to Roosevelt, requesting that he clarify his policies.163 European investors in the dollar were worried: From Paris, the *New York Times* reported that "the confusion of mind in Europe's markets concerning the future tendency of the dollar must be ascribed to lack of information regarding the definite intentions of the new American government. Declaration by Mr. Roosevelt declaring firm resolution to maintain a sound currency would have an extremely reassuring effect." But Roosevelt stayed silent.164

In February, the crisis deepened. Facing bankruptcy, the Guardian Detroit Union Group, the largest financial institution in Michigan, sought a loan from the RFC. The group had little good collateral, so the RFC could not, under its mandate, offer it a large loan. Perhaps more importantly, the main shareholder of the Guardian Group was auto millionaire Henry Ford. Not wanting the appearance of doing more favors for fat-cats, the RFC suggested that it could make a loan if Ford also provided some support. But Ford, recognizing that the Guardian Trust was as systemically important as the Central Republic, refused. His attempt to call the RFC's bluff failed. The Union Guardian Trust and Guardian National Bank of Commerce, two of the Guardian Group's banks, were allowed to go bankrupt and Michigan was forced to declare a statewide bank holiday.165

**When policy makers fail to rescue systemically important institutions, the ripple effects can quickly spread to the whole system.** Since Michigan was part of America's industrial heartland, the impact on other states was especially large.166 Households and companies rushed to withdraw their savings from banks across the country. Ohio, Arkansas, and Indiana suffered bank runs. Maryland declared a bank holiday on February 25, and by March 4, there were withdrawal restrictions in over 30 states.167

The flow of gold out of the country turned into a wave. In the last two weeks of February, the New York Fed lost \$250 million, almost a quarter of its gold reserves.168

"Demand upon the reserve banks for currency in connection with holiday trade this year was about \$120,000,000, compared with \$225,000,000 to \$275,000,000 in other recent years. This decreased demand for currency reflected both a diminished dollar volume of retail trade, due chiefly to the prevailing lower level of prices, and a continued return of currency from hoarding. The demand for currency did not result this year, as it usually does, in an increase in the outstanding volume of reserve bank credit, since additions of about \$150,000,000 of gold to the country's monetary stock were more than sufficient to provide to member banks the funds necessary for meeting currency withdrawals." *–Federal Reserve Bulletin*

In the face of this pressure on gold reserves, Hoover attempted to invoke the War Powers Act and introduce capital controls, a classic but ineffective response to balance of payments pressures, but the Democrats would not allow it.169

The economy suffered enormously. In March, business had slowed to a shocking extent. That year, the Gross National Product hit its lowest point in the entire period of the depression at \$55.6 billion, which was 31.5 percent below its 1929 level in constant dollar terms.170

#### March 1933 **State Bank Holidays**

"During the month of February and the first few days of March, banking difficulties in different parts of the country caused the governors and legislatures of many States temporarily to close the banks in those States or to impose or authorize restrictions upon their operations. On the morning of February 14 the Governor of Michigan declared a bank holiday to February 21, 'for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, and for the equal safeguarding without preference of the rights of all depositors.' This holiday in Michigan was extended, in effect, on February 21, and on February 25 a bank holiday was declared in Maryland, followed within a few days by similar action in a large number of other States. On February 25, a joint resolution was adopted by the Congress of the United States authorizing the Comptroller of the Currency to exercise with respect to national banks such powers as State officials may have with respect to State banks."

issue dollars that were backed by bank assets instead of gold, which broke the link between the dollar and gold and **allowed the Fed to print money and provide the liquidity that banks desperately needed.** So that the Fed could print money without facing a run on its gold reserves, Roosevelt banned gold exports under the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act.171

Auditors began to work through the books of each US bank, starting with the largest banks and those known to be the safest. When auditors found a bank that was undercapitalized, they could either (a) recapitalize the bank by having the RFC issue preferred shares, (b) merge it with a healthier bank, or (c) close it. **Systemically important banks were always supported, while smaller banks were often allowed to fail.** Once auditors decided that a bank was sound, it would reopen with the ability to borrow from the Fed using any of its assets as collateral.172 As part of the Banking Act of 1933, the Treasury agreed to cover any losses the Fed incurred, effectively **guaranteeing the liabilities of every bank that they chose to keep open.**<sup>173</sup>

On Sunday, March 12, the night before the first wave of banks was set to reopen, Roosevelt gave a nationwide radio address explaining the plan for the banks and seeking to restore trust in the banking system:

*The new law allows the twelve Federal Reserve Banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks which reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call…It is sound currency because it is backed by actual, good assets…I can assure you that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress.*<sup>174</sup>

As banks in twelve cities prepared to open on Monday, policy makers and investors waited nervously to see how the public would respond. Instead of bank runs, the public proceeded to deposit more than \$1 billion into the banks, which is a classic example of how debt and liquidity problems prompted by runs can be rectified by providing liquidity rather than holding it back. Banks continued to reopen in the days that followed, and within a month member banks representing 90 percent of the deposits in the system had reopened.175 When markets finally opened on Wednesday, the Dow rose 15.3 percent and commodities also soared.

To get all that money, the link to gold had to be broken. But with all that printing, the dollar's value plunged against both other currencies and gold. This was virtually identical to what happened in August 1971, when I was clerking on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and thought that the crisis would send the stock market and economy down. What happened was the same as what happened in 1933, and for the same reasons, but I hadn't studied what happened in 1933, so I was painfully wrong. That was the first time that I was surprised by events that hadn't happened in my lifetime but had happened many times in history. Being stung by these experiences drove me to try to understand all big market and economic movements in all time frames and all economies and to have timeless and universal principles for dealing with them. That saved my butt a number of times (e.g., in 2008). The events I am describing to you that happened in the 1930s have happened many times before for the exact same reasons.

Within two weeks of leaving the gold peg, the Federal Reserve was able to decrease its liquidity injections; short-term rates decreased by one percent to two percent, bankers' acceptance rates dropped back to two percent, and call loan rates decreased to three percent.176 The money supply increased by 1.5 percent over the next three months, and the Dow was up by almost 100 percent over the next four months. These moves ended the depression on a dime. (Most people mistakenly think that the depression lasted through the 1930s until World War II so I want to be clear on what actually happened. It is correct that it took until 1936 for GDP to match its 1929 peak. But when you look at the numbers in the charts below, you can see that leaving the gold peg was the turning point; it was exactly then that all markets and economic statistics bottomed. Still, these average numbers can be misleading because the recovery benefited the rich more than the poor, and the post-1933 period remained more difficult for a lot of people than the averages suggest, which is likely why people often think of the depression as lasting through the entire decade.)

While leaving the gold standard, printing money, and providing guarantees were by far the most impactful policy moves that Roosevelt made, they were just the first of an avalanche of policies that were unrolled during his first six months in office. The shock and awe of all those big announcements of spending, coming week after week, built confidence among investors and the public, which was critical to putting the economy on a good footing. I'll describe some of those policies below, not because the particulars are all that important, but because together they paint the picture of a bold, multifaceted, and comprehensive policy push.

While they were still working to shore up the banks, policy makers **shifted their attentions to significantly increasing financial industry regulation and oversight. Changing laws in ways that would have made the last crisis less bad are typical at the end of big debt crises.** When you read through them, focus on how they map to the template for handling debt problems.

<sup>n</sup> *April 5 and 18*: Roosevelt took additional steps to delink the dollar from gold. First he outlawed ownership of monetary gold by the public

through an executive order. Two weeks later, he outlawed private gold exports and indicated support for legislation that would allow him to set the price of gold.177 (**devaluing and printing money**)

- <sup>n</sup> *May 27*: Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933, which would regulate the sale of securities.178 (**increased regulation**)
- <sup>n</sup> *June 5*: Congress banned the relatively common "Gold Clauses" in contracts, a provision that allowed the payee to opt to be paid in gold. Since gold had increased in value after the dollar was delinked from it, this amounted to a big restructuring of debts.179 (**restructuring debts**)

- <sup>n</sup> *June 16*: The Banking Act of 1933 (i.e., Glass-Stegall II) provided deposit insurance of up to \$2,500 through the newly formed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It also empowered the Fed to regulate interest rates on demand and savings deposits (Regulation Q ); set forth stringent regulations for banks; and required the separation of investment and commercial banking functions.181 (**establish deposit insurance, increased regulation**)

Roosevelt also announced new federal agencies and programs that added up to an unprecedented fiscal stimulus. Federal spending had fallen by more than \$1 billion in 1932 as Hoover tightened fiscal policy in an attempt to balance the budget. Even though he initially campaigned to balance the budget, FDR's policies would end up increasing annual spending by \$2.7 billion (5 percent of GDP) by 1934. These are some of the early stimulus bills:

- <sup>n</sup> *April 5*: Established the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which would employ 2.5 million people in public works projects over its nine years of existence.182
- <sup>n</sup> *May 12*: Established the Federal Emergency Relief Act to provide financial support to households with an initial funding of \$500 million.183
- <sup>n</sup> *May 18*: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) undertook massive infrastructure investment, providing power, flood control, and irrigation in one of the regions most affected by the Great Depression.184
- <sup>n</sup> *June 16*: The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) created the Public Works Administration (PWA), which had \$3.3 billion at its disposal to spend on large-scale public works. 185

As a result of all of this stimulation, deflation turned into acceptable rather than horrible inflation.

**As explained in the "Archetypal Long-Term Debt Cycle" section, balance is key in achieving a "beautiful deleveraging": Deleveragings become beautiful when there is enough stimulation to offset the deflationary forces and to bring the nominal growth rate above the nominal interest rate.** 

The economy roared to life over the next three months as terribly depressed levels of activity quickly became less terrible. Heavy machinery orders climbed by 100 percent, and industrial production increased by almost 50 percent.

## **1935: The Goldilocks Period**

The economy and the markets continued to recover through 1934 and into 1935, when the Federal Reserve began contemplating tightening once again. By 1935 the economy had recovered, deflation had disappeared, and stock prices had soared as a result of the Fed's earlier policies. At the time, home prices were rising faster than 10 percent per year, and the recovery in equity prices was even faster. The boost to wealth was big, though wealth and economic output remained below pre-depression, bubble levels.

#### October 2, 1935 **Increased Deposits Reported by Banks**

 "Banks here began yesterday to issue reports of

their condition at the end of September. These showed gains in deposits and resources, in some cases to the highest marks in the history of the institutions. Generally, there apparently have been only slight changes in the amount of United States Government securities held, according to the reports."

In the spring of 1935, the Fed became increasingly concerned about the rise in excess reserves.187 It feared that the surge in excess reserves could create an expansion in credit and inflation in the future. In March, a background memo was prepared to address the question of what the Fed should do. It recommended no action for the time being. The paper explored the question of whether excess reserves will encourage banks to lend more to the private sector by pushing down the yield on government securities, but it didn't yet see evidence of that happening, so the Fed held pat. A second issue the paper looked at was how to sell the debt that it accumulated (i.e., how to do a reverse Q.E.).188 The paper rejected doing this for the time being, expressing the view that it would prematurely give too much weight to inflation concerns that hadn't yet shown signs of materializing, and instead advocated encouraging the expansion.

The cyclical expansion and advances in the stock market and housing price gains continued, which caused the Fed to become more inclined to tighten. In October, another memo expressed heightened concerns over the excess reserves, pondering the appropriate time to reduce them and whether to do that through 1) asset sales or 2) increasing the reserve requirement. In November, the pros and cons of these paths were explored. The argument for reducing excess reserves was to get ahead of the potential for future inflation; the argument against it was that there was no evidence yet for restraint.

In its press release of November 22, the Fed discussed the stock market boom and expressed concerns about inflation. Fears of fueling a bubble were rampant because a number of policy makers, including FDR, remembered that the bubble of the late 1920s caused the stock market bust, which had contributed to the depression. As a result, they were very worried that the steep rise in the stock market in 1935 (nearly a quadrupling!) could fuel a recurrence. The November press release from the Treasury disagreed, noting that inflation was still far off.189

The Fed paid a lot of attention to how the stock purchases were being financed because they had heightened concerns about "speculative credit" after the excess in margin-borrowing during the late 1920s. Raising margin requirements was considered. However, the November Fed memo noted that the purchases were being financed by money, not credit, so no action was taken.190 Still, the stock market advance was considered an emerging bubble, and fears about too easy of a monetary policy remained, so the arguments about whether or not to apply restraints continued. One board member (George Harrison of the New York Fed) suggested raising reserve requirements to curtail the rise in stock prices. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau (still on the Fed Board at the time) rejected this notion. However, he recognized the concern that a rise in reserves could lead to inflation. In December, Emanuel Goldenweiser, the Fed's head of research, warned of a potential negative psychological reaction to raising reserve requirements. He recommended that the Fed issue a press release saying that any action on reserve requirements would be "precautionary" in nature, and thought that "there is no need to worry about inflation at this time with the very large volume of unused plant capacity and unemployment." At the end of 1935, following its last meeting, the Fed issued a press release stating that the volume of reserves and gold inflows "continues to be excessive" and warned that "appropriate action may be taken as soon as it appears in the public interest."191

# **1936–1938: The Tightening Causes Recession**

The debate continued at the start of 1936. FDR wanted to signal a concern around inflation ahead of the election, so he urged that reserve requirements be tightened that spring. Fed Chairman Eccles was worried that banks would accumulate a lot of bonds and loans at low rates and then get burned by inflation.192

In May the Fed did not move. While the Banking Act of 1935 meant Treasury Secretary Morgenthau had to resign from the board, he still had influence and was a strong proponent against acting. By that July, Fed Chairman Eccles met alone with FDR, explaining his intention to raise reserves and assuring the president he would not act if he felt interest rates would rise and that the Fed would buy bonds if they sold off. The Fed tightened reserves later that month. Eccles and the Fed moved without informing Morgenthau, who was furious. After a tiny sell off in bonds, Morgenthau ordered Harrison of the New York Fed to purchase bonds using the Treasury's accounts. The Fed Board in Washington joined in, buying bonds and selling bills as Eccles had promised the president.193 Between August 1936 and May 1937, the Fed doubled reserve requirements from about 8 percent to 16 percent, as shown below. The first tightening, in August 1936, did not hurt stock prices or the economy.

## **It is typically the case that the first tightening does not hurt stocks and the economy.**

Because the tightening did not have an effect, reserves were tightened more in two additional phases, the first in March 1937 and the second in May 1937. The largest increase was the first (about half the total), as shown below.

As a result of the reserve tightening, excess reserves fell from \$3 billion to less than \$1 billion.194,

The tightening of monetary policy was intensified by currency devaluations by France and Switzerland, continuing a battle of official devaluations to gain price and trade advantages. In September 1936, the Tripartite Agreement was reached by the United States, Britain, and France, which essentially stated that each nation would refrain from competitive exchange devaluations.195 By then, it had become obvious that all countries could just as easily devalue their currencies in response to other devaluations, creating a huge amount of economic turbulence that left everyone in the same place. At the end of the day, all currencies had devalued a lot against gold, but not so much against each other.

#### **Board Emphasizes Margins as Brake. Reserve Bank Body Intimates It Has No Fear of Speculative Stock Orgy**

"The power to raise margin requirements provides an effective instrument for controlling excessive credit demands by stock market speculators, the Federal Reserve Board said today in its monthly bulletin, intimating broadly that there was no need to fear a runaway speculative market so long as this instrument was available."

By 1936, war was brewing in Europe, driving capital flight to the US, which continued to fuel advances in stocks and the economy. That year, the president and other policy makers were becoming increasingly concerned by gold inflows (which allowed faster money and credit growth).196 The concerns were threefold:

- 1. *The rapid rise in the stock market.* At this time, stocks were up almost four times from their bottom in 1933 and were rising fast: by about 40 percent in 1935 and 25 percent in 1936. Policy makers worried that the gold inflows were coming from foreigners bringing in capital to buy US stocks.
- 2. *The inflationary impact of gold inflows increasing the monetary base.*  Inflation had risen from roughly 0 percent to around 2 percent in October 1936.
- 3. *The US was becoming vulnerable to an outflow of gold (i.e., capital withdrawal).* The specific concern was that the European nations would finance the coming war in part by selling their US assets and pulling gold out, while preventing US holders of their assets from repatriating capital.

To neutralize the effects of these inflows, in December, FDR ordered "sterilization" to begin. Normally, when people sold their gold to the US government in exchange for dollars, the number of dollars increased (i.e., money is printed), which, given the strong economic recovery, wasn't seen as desirable. Instead, starting December 23, the gold inflows/newly mined gold were sterilized—literally, the Treasury purchased gold inflows by drawing down its cash account at the Federal Reserve instead of printing money. From the end of 1936 to July 1937, the Treasury sterilized about 1.3 billion of gold inflows (approximately 1.5 percent of GDP).197 We can see the increase in sterilization and slowing of gold and other asset purchases in 1936/37 with money growth slowing and dropping below gold reserve growth. The Fed also tightened reserve requirements in order to take money out of circulation, as we have seen.

## **1937**

The economy remained strong going into early 1937. The stock market was still rising, industrial production remained healthy, and inflation picked up to around 5 percent. The second tightening came in March 1937 and the third in May. While neither the Fed nor the Treasury anticipated that the increase in required reserves combined with the sterilization program would push rates higher, the tighter money and reduced liquidity led to a sell-off in bonds and a rise in the short rate.198 Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was furious and argued that the Fed should offset the "panic" through open market operations to make net purchases of bonds. He ordered the Treasury into the market to purchase bonds itself. Fed Chairman Eccles pushed back on Morgenthau, urging him to balance the budget and raise tax rates to begin to retire debt.199

Additionally there was a fiscal tightening. Federal government outlays fell 10 percent in 1937 and another 10 percent in 1938. The Revenue Act of 1937 was passed to help to close loopholes in the Revenue Act of 1935 (which was sold as the "wealth tax").200 That act had increased the federal income tax for the highest incomes up to 75 percent.

The federal budget deficit went from around -4 percent of GDP to neutral. The reversal in the budget in 1937 was a consequence of a large increase in taxes, mostly from a rise in the Social Security tax, along with sizable but smaller cuts in spending.201

There was significant pressure on the government to pass redistributive policies, as the recovery thus far was perceived to be uneven (i.e., benefiting the elites over the common man). Workers saw the gains in corporate profits, but didn't see a subsequent increase in their own compensation. Inequality bred discontent, as evidenced by the sharp increase in the number and intensity of strikes from 1936 to 1937 (the number of strikes rose by 118 percent and the number of workers involved by 136 percent).202

In financial markets, the combination of monetary and fiscal tightening created a significant sell-off in risky assets. Stocks fell the most, but home prices stopped their gains and dipped negative. Credit growth slowed as well, both in aggregate and across all sectors. Nonfinancial business credit creation fell to almost -2 percent, and household credit creation was slightly less negative at about -1 percent. Spending and economic activity fell as a result. With that downturn, unemployment rose to 15 percent, though it was more like a short uptick, especially in comparison to the punishingly high rise at the start of the decade. Stocks bottomed a year later, in April 1938, declining a total of nearly 60 percent!

## **Late 1937–1938: Policy Makers Reverse Their Course**

As markets and the economy turned down in 1937, the Fed accelerated a twist into longer-dated assets and started to do a small amount of net asset purchases. By the end of the year, the Treasury began to reverse its sterilization program in partnership with the Fed.203 Money growth picked up again starting in 1938 and continued to rise with the reverse sterilization and renewed money printing. At the same time, gold inflows slowed and the economy and asset prices deteriorated. Before long, money growth had outpaced growth in gold reserves.

The Fed's twist is shown below. While the Fed didn't do much in the way of net asset purchases, it accelerated its buying of long-term bonds in 1937 while selling bills and notes (a process it had actually started in 1936). It also increased net assets by a small amount (slightly above 3 percent by 1938).

### **Fed Balance Sheet Public Debt Assets (% 1936 GDP)**

In the spring of 1938, the Fed added to the stimulus by lowering its reserve requirements back to 1936 levels, releasing about \$750 million.204 The federal government also increased deficit spending that year and again in 1939 heading into the war. While the government was almost running a balanced budget at the start of 1938, the deficit rose to almost 3 percent of GDP by the start of 1939. Deficit spending above 2 percent of GDP continued throughout the year.

In 1938, the stock market began to recover, though stocks didn't fully regain their 1937 highs until the end of the war nearly a decade later. Credit flows and the economy also recovered in 1939, following the stimulus and entry into the war.

**Stocks Up Irregularly in Increased Trading; Bonds Firm—Dollar Higher—Wheat, Cotton Steady**

"The demand for low-priced stocks, especially public utility issues, continued yesterday to feature the stock market. The market as a whole closed irregularly higher. The day's business on the Stock Exchange reached 1,995,000 shares, the heaviest volume since Oct. 19."

## **The Path to War**

While the purpose of this chapter has been to examine the debt and economic circumstances in the United States during the 1930s, the linkages between economic conditions and political conditions, both within the United States and between the United States and other countries—most importantly Germany and Japan—cannot be ignored because economics and geopolitics were very intertwined at the time. Most importantly, Germany and Japan had internal conflicts between the haves (the Right) and the have-nots (the Left), which led to more populist, autocratic, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders who were given special autocratic powers by their democracies to bring order to their badly-managed economies. They also faced external economic and military conflicts arising as these countries became rival economic and military powers to existing world powers.

The case is also a good example of Thucydides's Trap205—where rivalries between countries lead to wars in order to establish which country is more powerful, which are then followed by periods of peace in which the dominant power/powers get to set the rules because no country can fight them until a rival power emerges, at which time they do it all over again.

To help to convey the picture in the 1930s, I will quickly run though the geopolitical highlights of what happened from 1930 until the official start of the war in Europe in 1939 and the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. While 1939 and 1941 are known as the official start of the wars in Europe and the Pacific, the wars really started about 10 years before that, as economic conflicts that were at first limited progressively grew into World War II. As Germany and Japan became more expansionist economic and military powers, they increasingly competed with the UK, US, and France for both resources and influence over territories. That eventually led to the war, which culminated in it being clear which country (the United States) had the power to dictate the new world order. This has led to a period of peace under that world order and will continue until the same process happens again.

## More precisely:

- <sup>n</sup> In 1930, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff began a trade war.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1931, Japan's resources were inadequate, and its rural poverty became severe, so it invaded Manchuria, China to obtain natural resources. The US wanted to keep China free from Japanese control and was competing for natural resources—especially oil, rubber, and tin—from Southeast Asia, while at the same time Japan and the US had significant trade with each other.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1931, the depression in Japan was so severe that it drove Japan off the gold standard, leading to both the floating of the yen (which depreciated greatly) and big fiscal and monetary expansions that led to Japan being the first country to experience a recovery and strong growth (which lasted until 1937).
- <sup>n</sup> In 1932, there was a lot of internal conflict in Japan, which led to a failed coup and a massive upsurge in right-wing nationalism and militarism. During the period from 1931 to 1937, the military took over control of the government and increased its top-down command of the economy.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany as a populist promising to exercise control over the bad economy, to bring order to the political chaos of the democracy of the time, and to fight the communists. Within just two months of being named chancellor, he was able to take total authoritarian control; using the excuse of national security, he got the Reichstag to pass the Enabling Act, which gave him virtually unlimited powers (in part by locking up political opponents and also by convincing some moderates that it was necessary). He

promptly refused to make reparations payments, stepped out of the League of Nations, and took control of the media. To create a strong economy and attempt to bring prosperity to the people, he created a top-down command economy. For instance, Hitler was involved with setting up Volkswagen to build a more affordable car, and directed the building of the national German Autobahn (highway system). He believed that Germany's potential was limited by its geographic boundaries, that it didn't have adequate raw materials to feed the industrial military complex, and that German people should be ethnically united.

<sup>n</sup> At the same time, Japan became increasingly strong with its top-down command economy, building a military industrial complex, with the military intended to protect its bases in East Asia and Northern China and to expand its controls over other territories.

- <sup>n</sup> Germany also got stronger by building its military industrial complex and looking to expand and claim adjacent lands.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1934, there was severe famine in parts of Japan, causing even more political turbulence and reinforcing the right-wing militaristic and nationalistic movement. Because the free market wasn't working for the people, that led to the strengthening of the command economy.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1936, Germany took back the Rhineland militarily, and in 1938, it annexed Austria.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1936, Japan signed a pact with Germany.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1936–7, the Fed tightened, which caused the fragile economy to weaken, and other major economies weakened with it.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1937, Japan's occupation of China spread, and the second Sino-Japanese War began. The Japanese took over Shanghai and Nanking, killing an estimated 200,000 Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants in the capture of Nanking alone. The United States provided China's Chiang Kai-shek government with fighter planes and pilots to fight the Japanese, thus putting a toe in the war.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, and World War II in Europe officially began.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1940, Germany captured Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France.
- <sup>n</sup> During this time, most companies in Germany and Japan remained publically owned, but their production was controlled by their respective governments in support of the war.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1940, Henry Stimson became the US Secretary of War. He increasingly used aggressive economic sanctions against Japan, culminating in the Export Control Act of July 2, 1940. In October, he ramped up the embargo, restricting "all iron and steel to destinations other than Britain and nations of the Western Hemisphere."
- <sup>n</sup> Beginning in September 1940, to obtain more resources and take advantage of the European preoccupation with the war on their continent, Japan invaded several colonies in Southeast Asia, starting with French Indochina. In 1941, Japan extended its reach by seizing oil reserves in the Dutch East Indies to add the "Southern Resource Zone" to its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The "Southern Resource Zone" was a collection of mostly European colonies in Southeast Asia, whose conquest would afford Japan access to key natural resources (most importantly oil, rubber, and rice). The latter, the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," was a bloc of Asian countries controlled by Japan, not (as they previously were) the Western powers.
- <sup>n</sup> Japan then occupied a naval base near the Philippine capital, Manila. This threatened an attack on the Philippines, which was, at the time, an American protectorate.
- <sup>n</sup> In 1941, to aid the Allies without fully entering the war, the United States began its Lend-Lease policy. Under this policy, the United States sent oil, food, and weaponry to the Allied Nations for free. This aid totaled over \$650 billion in today's dollars. The Lend-Lease policy, although not an outright declaration of war, ended the United States' neutrality.
- <sup>n</sup> In the summer of 1941, US President Roosevelt ordered the freezing of all Japanese assets in the United States and embargoed all oil and gas exports to Japan. Japan calculated that it would be out of oil in two years.
- <sup>n</sup> In December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, and British and Dutch colonies in Asia. While it didn't

have a plan to win the war, it wanted to destroy the Pacific Fleet that threatened Japan. Japan supposedly also believed that the US was weakened by both fighting a war in two fronts (Europe and the US) and by its political system; Japan thought that totalitarianism and the command military industrial complex approaches of their country and Germany were superior to the individualistic/capitalist approach of the United States.

These events led to the "war economy" conditions explained at the end of Part 1.
