# Chapter 20-Macroeconomic Policies in the Global Economy

Economies get thrown off their long-term growth paths. During the U.S. dot. Com boom between 1997 and 2000 information technology ﬁrms saw their stock rise fast,  but the good times came to an abrupt halt in March 2000 after the U.S. Federal Reserve had increased interest rates for a sixth time in a little more than a year to combat inﬂation. The dot. Com bubble burst,  and a recession ensued. During the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and 2008 a large share of low-income and high-risk borrowers became delinquent. Banks that held the delinquent mortgages foreclosed on the homes,  but many mortgages had been resold from the originating bank to other ﬁnancial institutions,  bundled up with other mortgages into packaged securities,  and tracking creditors and debtors turned into ﬁnancial turmoil. The crisis led to the collapse of major ﬁnancial institutions and it spread. The deepest U.S. recession in almost a century followed. The U.S. job market has not fully recovered until today. In contrast,  developing countries managed to pull through the global recession with only minor dents to their growth paths,  while some observers of China even spotted signs of an overheating economy expanding faster than its long-term growth path. Japan’s baburu keiki ,  or bubble economy,  from 1986 to 1990 inﬂated both Japan’s stock prices and real estate values,  and after the Bank of Japan had tightened monetary conditions for a ﬁfth time to slow down inﬂation between 1989 and 1990,  asset prices plummeted. A prolonged depression followed,  and many speak of one or even two lost decades for Japan. Abenomics,  the economic interventions under Japan’s present prime minister Shinz¯o Abe’s government,  are meant to ﬁnally turn the economy around after more than two decades.

How can we shorten recessions and mitigate their depth? What macroeconomic policy measures can the central bank or government take? How effective are the tools in an open economy with free currency and capital markets? Macroeconomic intervention needs to be timely,  targeted,  and temporary. For timeliness,  we need precise information early and an economic framework to interpret the data. To target the policy effectively,  we need to use the right combination of monetary and ﬁscal tools. To limit the intervention,  we need to know when to stop.

# Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter you should be able to:

LO 1 Relate the conﬂicting objectives of internal balance and external balance to economic conditions and describe how monetary regimes in history resolved the conﬂicting objectives. LO 2 Explain how consumption typically responds to transitory changes in disposable income,  how the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] responds to transitory changes in disposable income and to the real exchange rate,  and how therefore gross domestic product relates to disposable income and the real exchange rate. LO 3 Describe why the real exchange rate is inversely related to gross domestic product in ﬁnancialmarket equilibrium in the short term and why the real exchange rate is positively associated with gross domestic product in real-side market equilibrium. LO 4 Analyze temporary and permanent monetary and ﬁscal policies and their consequences for the real exchange rate and real output in an open economy with free currency and capital markets. LO 5 Determine the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance under temporary and permanent monetary and ﬁscal policies and infer the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] response under different degrees of exchange-rate passthrough and at different time horizons.

# 20.1 External and Internal Balance: A History

Two main engines propel long-term growth. One main engine of growth is the accumulation of resources to raise per-capita incomes. Resources are the factors of production such as physical capital,  which accrues with investment,  or human capital,  which expands with education. The other main engine of growth is to innovate and improve an economy’s productivity. A productive economy generates more output from a given amount of resources. The most lasting and arguably only perpetual source of long-term growth is this latter productivity change because the accumulation of factors of production runs into diminishing returns,  whereas history suggests that human ingenuity for productivity change is unbounded.

Figure 20.1 shows real gross domestic product (GDP) in the United States and China between 1960 and 2012. Over these ﬁve decades,  Chinese real GDP grew from 1/16 of a trillion U.S. dollars to almost 4 trillion U.S. dollars (translated to the U.S. dollar in 2000),  at an annualized growth rate of 7.7 percent on average. Over the same period,  U.S. real GDP grew from 2.5 trillion to more than 11 trillion U.S. dollars (deﬂated to 2000 values),  at an annualized growth rate of 3.1 percent on average. Various booms and recessions have thrown the economies off their long-term growth paths during those ﬁve decades. Unemployment,  consumption and savings,  trade ﬂows and [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balances,  as well as the economies’ price levels and exchange rates ﬂuctuated alongside. This chapter investigates what shocks can explain such uc tu at ions and how macroeconomic policies may help restore economies to their long-term growth when capital markets are globally integrated. The upcoming model is designed to address short-term adjustments. It is not meant,  nor suited,  to analyze engines of long-term growth. In terms of Figure 20.1,  we take the solid black line of long-term growth as given and investigate only transient deviations from it.

# External and Internal Balance

International macroeconomic policy is caught between two conﬂicting objectives: internal balance and external balance. Internal balance concerns the health of the domestic economy. An economy achieves internal balance when there is full employment of the economy’s resources,  the overall price level is stable,  and the long-term engines of growth propel gross domestic production along a solid black line. External balance concerns the stability of economic relations with foreign economies. An economy achieves external balance when its [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] is neither excessively negative nor excessively positive. An excessive [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit is not stable because it indicates low domestic savings but high domestic consumption. Foreign investors,  who ﬁnance the excess of the economy’s investment beyond its savings,  may begin to lose conﬁdence as exuberant domestic investment implies that relatively risky projects are being undertaken,  and high domestic consumption does not bode well for the foreign investors’ chances to be repaid. Conversely,  an excessive [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus is not stable because it indicates low domestic investment in equipment or innovation despite high savings. Domestic savers and ﬁnancial institutions show little conﬁdence in their own economy’s business prospects and place most of their portfolios in foreign assets,  arguably at increasing risk. There is no simple threshold beyond which a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance becomes excessive. Even though the mark of ﬁve percent of domestic GDP is often regarded as an uncomfortable brink,  there are several examples of economies that passed the ﬁve-percent mark with little consequence. When the U.S. [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit dropped below negative ﬁve-percent of GDP in the past decade,  foreign capital kept ﬂowing in. Perhaps external balance is as hard to deﬁne as is moderation in general. To do “nothing in excess” is good advice,  but only moderately concrete.

Over the course of the past two centuries,  various international monetary systems and exchange rate arrangements allowed countries to achieve internal or external balance in different ways. In browsing through this history,  it is important to deﬁne international money . There is no single international currency,  so international money is better understood as a system of national currencies. Each national currency serves the main three functions of money: Money is a medium of exchange,  a unit of account,  and a store of value. What then constitutes international money is the order of the system of national currencies,  by which currencies become a medium of exchange of goods and services between economies,  a unit of account between countries,  and a store of value across borders. The order of the system—the “rules of the game”—are the laws,  treaties,  conventions and regulations to which the member countries of the system agree and adhere. Different international monetary systems have resolved the tension between internal and external balance in different ways. Over time,  the preferences for internal and external balance changed,  political circumstances evolved,  and ﬁnancial technologies advanced. With those changes the perceived suitability of the international monetary arrangements shifted as well.

When the world underwent its ﬁrst wave of globalization between 1870 and 1913,  numerous countries were on the gold standard. Those countries ﬁxed their currencies to gold at a set parity,  such as $U.S.\S\ 20.67$ for one ounce of gold in the United States. Under the gold standard,  an increase in gold supplies meant that gold became relatively more abundant,  so that its relative price compared to all other goods and services would fall,  or conversely the price of all goods and services in terms of gold would rise. In short,  an increase in local gold supplies would ultimately lead to inﬂation. Today,  we have ﬁat money. Fiat means “May there be … ” in Latin. Fiat money literally stands for “May there be … Money.” At a central bank’s pleasure,  money gets created in the form of electronic bits and bytes on commercial banks’ accounts. In such a ﬁat money economy,  more money supply means that the electronic digits become relatively more abundant so that their relative value declines,  whereas the relative price of all goods and services in terms of that money increases. Inﬂation results when electronic money grows at a faster rate than the supply of goods and services,  because more electronic digits start chasing after a relatively smaller amount of goods and services,  so the price level rises.

The gold standard and today’s ﬁat money system also differ strongly in how currencies were and are exchanged between countries. Under the gold standard,  all currencies were ﬁxed to gold at a given price and anyone,  domestic resident or foreigner,  could ask to receive an ounce of gold from the central bank at the set parity. As a consequence,  the exchange rate between currencies,  too,  was anchored: at the ratio of the two currencies’ gold parities. In Britain,  for example,  the parity was three pounds,  seventeen shillings and ten pence per ounce of gold in 1913,  and the gold parity was at $\mathrm{U.S.}\mathbb{S}20.67$ in the United States. Now just divide $U.S.\S\,  20.67$ by three pounds,  seventeen shillings and ten pence (if you can,  your author cannot) and you know the basic nominal exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and British currency in 1913. Today,  national governments decide which currency they accept for tax receipts and use for payments—typically their own central bank’s currency. The locally accepted currencies are then traded largely freely against each other on international currency exchanges mainly in London,  New York,  Frankfurt,  Singapore,  and Tokyo.

# The Gold Standard: 1880 to 1914

The main characteristic of the gold standard between around 1880 and 1914 was that the participating countries made their domestic currencies freely convertible into gold,  and placed hardly any restrictions on the trade of their currencies against each other on foreign exchanges. Central banks played a limited role compared to their tasks today. The main duty of a central bank was to preserve the ﬁxed parity between domestic currency and gold. The predecessors of the U.S. Federal Reserve system (which itself was only created in 1913),  for example,  had to hand out one ounce of gold for every U.S. $\S$ 20.67 whenever asked,  no matter who requested it and no matter for what total amount. Natural byproducts of these requirements were then that international currency and capital could freely ﬂow between the countries on the gold standard at stable exchange rates. The nominal exchange rate between the currencies of any two countries was inherently anchored at the relative gold parities that the two countries adopted. In practice,  there were exchange rate uc tu at ions around the anchor because the central bankers did not necessarily hold as much gold in their vaults as they had money in circulation. The Bank of England maintained a roughly stable share of about one-third of its paper money as gold reserves between the mid 19 th century and 1913. The United States,  in contrast,  allowed variation and U.S. gold reserves covered between 15 and 40 percent of the U.S. dollars in circulation at different points in time. Other countries permitted even more uc tu at ions. Italy’s gold reserve ratio,  for example,  could drop as low as 6 percent of money in circulation and then swing back to more than 40 percent. Consequently,  the nominal exchange rates would move with the variations in national money supplies. In the long term,  however,  the exchange rates were tied down by the ratio of the gold parities that the countries adopted.

External balance was another byproduct of the gold standard. Economists,  and central bankers in particular,  understood well how external balance would come about in the long run at least since David Hume’s (1889)’s treatise Of the Balance of Trade ,  in which Hume worked out the price-specie ﬂow mechanism . Hume’s basic insight is that any positive or negative [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance (any “imbalance”) results in cross-border gold ﬂows,  which in turn move the national price level,  and the national price changes ultimately eliminate the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] “imbalance”. The gold ﬂows and price changes only stop once external balance is restored. In short,  gold ﬂows prevent lasting [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] imbalances.

An example of the price-specie ﬂow mechanism in action is a country on the gold standard with an incipient trade surplus. Instead of accepting foreign paper money for the net exports,  the country’s residents can ask for gold at the foreign central bank’s parity. A country with an incipient trade surplus is therefore receiving gold inﬂows,  either physically or in the form of paper money equivalents. As these gold inﬂows make gold more abundant in the home country,  the relative price of goods and services in the home country increases (the goods and services now become relatively scarcer in terms of gold). The higher domestic price level makes domestic products relatively more costly both for domestic and foreign residents,  while the gold outﬂows from the foreign economy make foreign products relatively less expensive for everyone. The home country’s residents demand more imports,  and the gold ﬂows and price changes stop once the incipient trade surplus is eliminated and trade is balanced again.

The rules of the game of the gold standard were essentially a simple prescription to all central bankers: Preempt the price-specie ﬂow mechanism. Expedite the restoration of [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance with [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]. To prevent gold inﬂows if your country faces an incipient [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus,  expand domestic money supply,  accelerate inﬂation of the domestic price level and make domestic products relatively more expensive,  so that the incipient trade surplus is eliminated fast. To prevent gold outﬂows if your country faces an incipient [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit,  contract domestic money supply,  expedite deﬂation of the domestic price level,  which makes your domestic products relatively more attractive to residents both at home and abroad so that the incipient trade deﬁcit is reversed soon. If all central bankers were committed to preempt gold ﬂows in this way,  physical gold ﬂows would become unnecessary,  and external balance would follow.

In practice,  not all countries played by the rules of the game. As economic historians have shown,  certain countries frequently violated the rules. The burden to play by the rules fell mostly on the countries in [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. The reason was that countries with a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus welcomed the gold inﬂows and the price inﬂation they brought with them,  happily leaving the adjusting to the countries with [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits. For the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit countries,  the choice was not pleasant. They could either watch the gold leave under the price-specie ﬂow mechanism and see the domestic price level gradually decline; a country with an incipient trade deﬁcit ultimately pays for its net imports with gold inﬂows and these gold outﬂows make gold scarcer in the domestic economy,  so that the price of domestic products falls until trade is balanced again. Or countries with a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit could play by the rules of the game,  preempting the gold outﬂows by contracting money supply so that deﬂation ensues at home.

For internal balance,  deﬂation meant nothing good. Consumers who expect the price of goods and services to fall,  spend little,  particularly little on durable consumption goods,  save and wait. Businesses that expect the price of intermediate inputs,  equipment and machinery to decline,  invest little and wait. The resulting excess savings are exactly what pushes the home economy’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] back to balance,  but at the same time deﬂation causes domestic economic activity to slow down. An internal imbalance of the most unwelcome sort is about to result,  a recession. In short,  countries with incipient [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits had to sacriﬁce internal balance to restore external balance,  while the surplus countries were watching gold come in and accepted some additional inﬂation for as long as the external imbalance would last. The gold standard subordinated internal balance to external balance.

# The Interwar Period: 1918 to 1939

The unpleasant consequences of the gold standard for internal balance,  especially among [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit countries,  were also what made countries reluctant to return to the gold standard after the First World War. During the interwar period from 1918 until 1939,  countries slowly and often only partially returned to a gold standard of sorts. Central banks managed the convertibility of their currencies into gold,  maintaining gold parity selectively and not at all times. To control the ﬂow of capital across borders,  countries restricted the foreign exchange of their currencies.

The United States returned to gold parity in 1919. In 1922,  Britain,  France,  Italy and Japan agreed to cooperate and to gradually return to a gold backing of their currencies. Britain formally tied its currency to a gold parity in 1925. After the collapse of asset prices at Wall Street in 1929,  the United States entered a deep and lasting recession,  the Great Depression. The Great Depression spread around the world. Countries that remained on the gold standard longer,  without resetting their gold parity or abandoning gold backing altogether,  suffered the strongest economic decline. The countries on the gold standard ended up “importing” the U.S. recession,  partly because they had to tighten money supply in order to maintain external balance with the United States and other countries to which the Great Depression was transmitting.

In attempts to prevent the adverse consequences of a gold standard on their internal balances,  countries gave up on external balance. Their “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies were designed to stimulate their domestic economies through exchange rate devaluations in the hope to generate net exports. Countries placed restrictions on the foreign exchange of currencies and imposed tariffs on imports. Of course,  beggar-thy-neighbor policies are in vain if everyone pursues them. When everyone is devaluing and restricting trade,  then no devaluation lasts and the interventions generate no net exports for anyone. Instead,  both exports and imports decline in value as uncertainty about exchange rates,  foreign exchange restrictions and tariffs harm international trade and slow down growth. Economic conﬂicts ensue,  and destabilize the international economic order.

# The Bretton Woods Order: 1945 to 1971

The experience of the interwar period and the disastrous descent into the Second World War lead the United States and Great Britain to draw up an international monetary arrangement that would enshrine external balance again,  so that a stable international economic order could evolve (heeding a positive lesson from the gold standard) but that would also let countries avert adverse consequences for internal balance (avoiding a negative lesson from the interwar period). In 1944,  the year before the Second World War would end,  a U.S. and a British delegation of ofﬁcials and economists came together to design a new international monetary order. The U.S. delegation,  lead by Harry Dexter White,  and the British delegation,  lead by John Maynard Keynes,  met at a resort in Bretton Woods,  New Hampshire,  and came up with new rules of the game dubbed after the meeting place: the Bretton Woods system. At the core of this international ﬁnancial order were the newly created International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank,  both later located in Washington,  DC,  just blocks away from the U.S. president’s residence in the White House. The IMF was tasked with maintaining the international monetary order,  our focus here,  whereas the World Bank was setup to ﬁnance the international reconstruction after the war and the subsequent economic development of countries.

Instead of returning to an explicit gold standard,  the Bretton Woods system assigned the role of an anchor asset to the United States dollar. Concretely,  the Bretton Woods system prescribed to the central banks outside the United States that they preserve a ﬁxed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. Of the U.S. Federal Reserve,  the U.S. central bank network since 1913,  the rules of the Bretton Woods order required that the United States maintain a ﬁxed parity between the U.S. dollar and gold,  at $\mathrm{US}\S$ 35 per ounce.

In principle,  such a monetary system might turn into just another gold standard in disguise and again mean that countries,  especially those with an incipient [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit,  would have to sacriﬁce internal balance whenever they needed to restore external balance. That is where the IMF came in. If the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit was deemed to be a transient deviation from long-term external balance,  then the IMF would provide short-term ﬁnancing to cover the deﬁcit and extend credit for net imports,  paired with policy prescriptions to strengthen the repayment prospects. If a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit was considered the result of a long-term change,  caused by a shift in economic fundamentals that would make the country’s products lastingly less [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,  Competitiveness,  and the Terms of Trade|competitive]],  then a deﬁcit country was expected to apply for a reset of its currency’s ﬁxed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar,  and the IMF would grant or deny the application.

The Bretton Woods order was setup to allow countries a gradual restoration of external balance,  whenever needed,  and to maintain internal balance while the IMF was extending the short-term ﬁnancing to cover transitory [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits. For the two decades from 1950 to 1970,  the Bretton Woods system succeeded and largely realized its idea. Countries were able to keep external imbalances within moderate bounds,  and exchange rates were highly stable. Though possible,  only few countries applied for resets of the ﬁxed exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. To satisfy the world’s liquidity needs of U.S. dollars,  as world GDP and trade grew fast from the devastation s of the Second World War,  the United States turned into a net importer,  paying foreigners with the U.S. dollars that the global economy needed to settle [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] transactions.

The Bretton Woods system’s success,  however,  also laid the ground for its own demise. During testimony before U.S. Congress in 1960,  Yale economist Robert Trifﬁn exposed a conceptual ﬂaw in the Bretton Woods system that would soon become known as Trifﬁn’s Dilemma. If worldwide GDP and trade growth kept its pace,  and the United States continued to provide the world with the needed dollar liquidity by running [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits,  the increasing amount of U.S. dollars in circulation would continuously erode the gold backing of the U.S. dollar because the U.S. gold reserves could not plausibly grow as fast as U.S. money supply had to expand. The eroding gold backing and U.S. [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits would ultimately undermine conﬁdence in the U.S. dollar as a reserve asset. The dilemma therefore was to either abandon the Bretton Woods system and sacriﬁce stable exchange rates and external balances while sustaining the credibility of the U.S. dollar,  or to maintain the Bretton Woods system and straightjacket U.S. [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and world liquidity into a slower expansion course that might risk deﬂation and its dire consequences for internal balances.

Speculation against the U.S. dollar solved Trifﬁn’s Dilemma its way,  and the Bretton Woods system was abandoned. International support faded as several industrialized countries grew reluctant to accept high U.S. inﬂation rates during the 1960 s,  which they had to “import” while keeping their exchange rates ﬁxed. Among others,  French president Charles de Gaulle repeatedly asked the U.S. and British governments during the 1960 s to raise the parity of the U.S. dollar to gold,  but his proposals were rejected. Instead,  the United States government proposed to create an artiﬁcial world currency through the IMF (called Special Drawing Rights). That IMF money was ultimately created in 1969,  some central banks even adopted it,  but gold markets were unimpressed. In May 1968 the price of gold had already risen to $\mathrm{U}.S.\S$ 44 per ounce in London. Soon the French government started to hold the United States to its gold parity at $\mathrm{U.}S.\S35$ per ounce and began exchanging U.S. dollar bills for gold bars,  which shipped to France and the vaults of private speculators elsewhere in large quantities. By 1971,  the U.S. gold stock had fallen to half its 1960 level. Foreign banks by now held more U.S. dollars than the United States had gold reserves at U.S $\S35$ per ounce. In early August 1971,  as the U.S. dollar depreciated against European currencies,  Switzerland left the Bretton Woods system. On August 15,  1971,  U.S. president Richard Nixon had it. He issued an executive order to close the gold window and ended the convertibility between the U.S. dollar and gold. That day,  August 15,  1971,  was the birthday of today’s international monetary system.

# Today’s International Monetary System

Since about then,  the rules of the game are that anything goes. There are currencies with ﬁxed exchange rates,  managed exchange rates and freely ﬂoating exchange rates. In abandoning the Bretton Woods system,  the world’s governments showed that they were unwilling to accept a second gold standard,  rejecting its inherent risks of lasting deﬂation and depressed growth. In refusing to reform the Bretton Woods system,  the world’s governments also revealed that they had lost patience with a system of managed currencies centered around gold or an artiﬁcial IMF money,  rejecting the inherent regulations and controls. Today,  most major currencies such as the U.S. dollar,  the European Euro,  the Japanese Yen and some rising currencies such as the Brazilian Real are traded largely freely on foreign exchange markets,  and the Chinese government appears to gradually relax restrictions on the foreign exchange of Chinese Renminbi. As the currencies ﬂoat,  external balances ﬂuctuate. Internal balance requires close watch because periods of inﬂation tend to foster overpriced ﬁnancial assets,  and the ensuing ﬁnancial market troubles regularly present problems for internal balance.

With the historic experience of monetary systems in the rear mirror,  we now turn to building a framework that relates internal balance and external balance back to economic fundamentals with rigor. The framework will help us explore tools for macroeconomic intervention as we look ahead through the windshield. While on watch,  how can we make macroeconomic intervention timely and effective when needed,  and how do we limit its duration? Once the full international macroeconomic model is in place towards the end of the following Chapter 21,  we will revisit the history of monetary globalization with economics theory.

# 20.2 Output,  Consumption and Current Account Responses

A country’s gross national income GNI can be split into the components on which it is spent:

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=C+I+G+C A.
$$ 

Private consumption $C$ is the spending of private households on ﬁnal goods and services; private domestic investments $I$ are all the goods and services used to form domestic capital for production; government expenditure $G$ is the consumption or investment carried out by government agencies. These three spending components together,  $C+I+G,  $ are also called absorption (or gross national expenditures) because they are spent in the domestic economy. A ﬁnal use of a country’s national income is the credit given to foreigners,  which national accountants track in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance $C A$ .

Throughout this and the following chapter,  we adopt a sim pli cation. Let’s have the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] be roughly equal to the trade balance $T B$ :

$$
C A\approx T B=E X-I M.
$$ 

The trade balance is the difference between exports $E X$ and imports IM (also called net exports). If the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] is roughly equal to the trade balance $C A\,  \approx\,  T B,  $ ,  then domestic income is also roughly equal to domestic production: $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}\,  \approx\,  Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}.$ ,  as w ave seen in Chapter 14 before. By the precise accounting deﬁnition,  the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance CA is the sum of the trade balance TB and the income that our domestic factors of production earn while employed abroad,  less the income that foreign factors of production earn in our domestic economy. If net foreign income contributes little to the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]],  and therefore little to national income,  then national income almost equals domestic production: $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}\approx Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ .

The empirically largest component of the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance is indeed the trade balance. There is a rare group of countries (including oil-rich Kuwait and capital-poor Ireland) with a more noticeable difference between the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and the trade balance,  or equivalently between national income GNI and gross domestic product GDP. For a large majority of countries the relative difference between the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and the trade balance is no more than a few percent. Among those typical countries are major international creditors (who own more assets abroad than they owe) such as Germany or Japan. Among the group of typical countries are also major foreign debtors (who owe more to foreigners than they own abroad) such as the United States,  Australia or Spain. For many economies,  the difference between the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] and the trade balance is less than one percent. Moreover,  the net ﬂow of incomes across borders depends on past investment and migration decisions,  and on a largely given return on capital and expat earnings across borders. Foreign [[Operating Income vs. Net Income What's the Difference|Net Income]] is therefore not only a typically small component of the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]],  it also need not respond much to business cycle uc tu at ions. In summary,  the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] is roughly equal to the trade balance for most countries at most times and our forecasting mistake will be minor when we just set the two equal to each other for simplicity.

# Absorption and Disposable Income

Let’s see how absorption responds to transitory changes in national income. The ﬁrst component,  consumption spending,  increases with the domestic residents’ disposable income ,  and disposable income is income less tax payments: $Y^{\mathrm{{GNI}}}-T$ . We can therefore write consumption as a function

$$
C=C(Y_{\mathrm{\Phi_{(+)}}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T).
$$ 

The plus sign below the disposable income indicates that consumption typically increases with transient changes of disposable income.

Why? Micro economic theory shows that rational and forward looking households do not fully change consumption when they temporarily receive extra disposable income. Households will set aside some of their additional income as savings,  so they can also consume more in the future. Similarly,  rational and forward looking households who suffer a temporary shortfall in their disposable income will not fully reduce their consumption,  they will draw down from some of the earlier savings to smooth out the temporal income loss. Remember,  in this chapter we are only concerned with deviations from an economy’s long-term growth path and therefore only with transitory income changes for households.

A good guess is that about 80 percent of the average household’s extra disposable income goes to consumption,  and the other 20 percent to savings. That differs from country to country and time to time. Germans famously stack away much of their transient extra income in savings. U.S. residents in contrast have not shown much of an appetite for any savings over the past two decades,  but that changed after the Great Recession of 2008. For the qualitative predictions of our model the exact fraction of transitory disposable income that goes to consumption does not matter; the fraction might even be zero. However,  the average household’s propensity to consume or save extra disposable income does play a role for the magnitudes of macroeconomic responses. If households save only little of their extra income,  and withdraw only little savings when incomes fall,  then their spending sprees and cutbacks can magnify the impact of macroeconomic shocks,  or monetary or ﬁscal remedies,  on domestic production.

# Think Twice about Convention: What You Speak Is How You Save

You may wonder how we can be so bold now to assume that savings are a roughly given proportion of income in the short term. Have we not spent Part III of this book on a model where households and investors rationally choose their savings in response to such things as the anticipated return of the investment,  the global interest rate,  and the riskiness of the investment? Micro economic theorists would agree. Micro em piri cist s would point out that transitory income shocks do alter consumption in predictable proportions. Some micro em piri cist s would even go so far as to argue that our savings behavior is hardwired into us through the languages we speak.

In a recent study published in the American Economic Review ,  also reported in the magazine Science ,  economist M. Keith Chen (2013) documents that there is a strong link between the way a language treats the future and the way its speakers save and prepare for the future. Some languages require speakers to mark future events with explicit words or auxiliary verbs,  other languages don’t. At one extreme,  Mandarin has simply no tenses. Similarly,  a German speaker

Who is predicting cold weather gets away with just saying: “Morgen ist es kalt,  ” that is tomorrow it is cold . A French speaker,  in contrast,  has to separate time periods more clearly: “Il fera froid demain” to predict that it will be cold tomorrow,  but “il fait froid aujourd’hui” to state that it is cold today. In the extreme,  a speaker of the West Greenlandic language of Kalaallisut must be keenly aware of precise nuances of future times because there are at least 28 distinct ways to mark the future (nineteen verb-extending sufﬁxes,  four verbal roots,  one noun-extending sufﬁx,  one de-nominal verb-forming sufﬁx and three mood inﬂections; your author is sure glad to be allowed to write in English). English is an exception among the Germanic languages and more like French. In all other Germanic languages,  except English,  it is optional to use the future tense. An English speaker must mark the future.

Fine. Why should grammar matter for behavior? Chen (2013) argues there are at least two ways grammar would inﬂuence our thinking and therefore our choices. First,  English speakers have to distinguish between the present and the future,  so they consider the future more distant and care less for it. For other Germanic language speakers and Mandarin speakers,  in contrast,  the future is just as present as if it were happening now. Second,  a more precise language may lead its speakers to have more precise beliefs about timing,  and more precision makes a risk averse person more willing to save less while holding out for uncertain future rewards. Chen (2013) then codes up grammars into more and less precise ones about the future and shows that countries with less precise languages save on average 6 percent more of their GDP. By comparison,  [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balances hardly exceed that percentage.

Well,  you might think,  countries differ in lots of ways,  that might just be coincidence. Chen (2013) has more evidence in store. He singles out seven countries with multiple languages that differ in their precision about the future: Burkina Faso,  Ethiopia,  Estonia,  Nigeria,  Malaysia,  Singapore,  and Switzerland. Then he compares between fellow residents with identical income,  education,  family structure,  and country of birth,  but who speak different languages. He ﬁnds that speakers of imprecise languages save more,  retire with more wealth,  smoke less,  practice safer sex,  and are less obese. A Swiss German speaker has 36 percent higher odds to be a saver than a French speaker from Switzerland,  and a Mandarin speaking resident of Singapore has 81 percent higher odds to be a saver than an English speaking resident of Singapore. In short,  what you speak is how you save. And no,  the savings propensity is not in the German gene code,  it’s in the German grammar.

In the aftermath of the recent ﬁnancial crisis,  a policy concern has been to induce the residents of countries with [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surpluses to save less and consume more. Chen’s research suggests,  however,  that the deep cultural origins behind savings behavior might be hard to alter. Aware of the German propensity to save much,  and to remain frugal during hard times,  German policy makers in 2008 were looking for a way out that would help stimulate the economy and plausibly reduce the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus. There was hope: Germans do respond to consumption incentives when they are offered new cars for a good price. The German government therefore designed the ﬁrst dump-your-guzzler program of its kind during the recent crisis in late 2008,  offering a payment of $\in2.500$ (or $\mathrm{U}.S.\S\ 3.300\$ ) to every German car owner who would turn in her vehicle for a more fuel efﬁcient brand new one. The idea,  made in Germany,  spread. In the United States,  the copycat program to boost sales for car makers in Detroit became known as cash for clunkers.

Some critics view the dump-your-guzzler programs as large-scale destructions of valuable

Capital that is rolling around on our roads with decent fuel efﬁciency,  just to be exterminated for the beneﬁt of some car makers. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn predicted at the time that replacing the alleged guzzlers with somewhat more fuel efﬁcient cars would actually cause net environmental damage,  because the production of the new cars would emit more greenhouse gases than their better fuel efﬁciency could possibly make up over the otherwise remaining lifetime of the replaced cars,  had they not been eliminated. Perhaps one more issue for micro empiricists to settle. A general tax cut and the resulting increase in disposable income would have helped stimulate consumption just as well,  argues Hans-Werner Sinn,  with less damage to the domestic capital stock and less damage to the environment.

There are two more components in absorption,  investment $I$ and government spending $G$ . Our focus lies on the effects of macroeconomic uc tu at ions and policies in an open economy. Let us therefore ignore short-term changes in domestic investment $I$ and set its level to some given amount $I={\bar{I}}$ . (The Mathematical Appendix 20. II to this chapter shows you that the conventional assumption,  by which investment falls when domestic interest rates rise,  would amplify the effects that our model will predict but not change any qualitative result; so we can keep investment out of the analysis for now at no harm.) Finally,  government spending $G$ is an autonomous choice of the legislature or ﬁscal authorities,  and therefore a given for our analysis.

# The Current Account,  Disposable Income and the Real Exchange Rate

The real exchange rate $q$ is the relative price of a bundle of foreign goods and services in terms of the same bundle in the domestic economy and therefore deﬁned as

$$
q=\frac{E P^{*}}{P},  
$$ 

where $E$ is the nominal exchange rate in direct terms,  $P^{*}$ is the foreign price level and $P$ the domestic price level. If $q\,  =\,  1$ then one domestic consumption basket sells for the same price as a domestic consumption basket. If the real exchange rate exceeds one,  $q>1$ so that $E P^{*}>P_{i}$ ,  then foreign goods and services are relatively expensive,  and home goods and service do not afford an equal amount of their foreign equivalents. In other words,  if $q>1$ and $E P^{*}>P_{i}$ ,  then the home consumption basket is relatively depreciated and cheap for both foreigners and domestic residents. Conversely,  if the real exchange rate is below one,  $q<1$ so that $E P^{*}<P_{i}$ ,  then home goods and services afford more than an equal amount of foreign goods and services. Under $q<1$ ,  the home consumption basket is relatively appreciated and expensive for both foreign and domestic residents.

Under our sim pli cation that the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] is roughly equal to the trade balance,  we can also write

$$
C A\approx T B=E X-I M=E X-q\cdot E X^{*}.
$$ 

The variable $E X^{*}$ stands for the foreign value of exports from the rest of the world to the domestic economy. We can multiply foreign exports in foreign value $E X^{*}$ by $q,  $ ,  that is the relative price of foreign goods and services in terms of domestic goods and services. The product $q\cdot E X^{*}$ then gives us the value of exports from the rest of the world to us in terms of our our goods and services. It is convenient to write out the trade balance in this way because it clariﬁes the relationship of exports,  imports and their relative value with the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance.

Take the average household’s disposable income. How will a transient increase in disposable income affect the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]? We have already seen that both micro economic theory and macroeconomic evidence suggest that household spending on consumption increases with a transient rise in disposable income. The extra consumption can be spent on domestic goods or on foreign goods. If the extra consumption i pent entirely on foreign goods,  then $I M=q\cdot E X^{*}$ increases by just as much as overall consumption C . If some but not all extra consumption goes to foreign goods and services,  then $I M\,  =\,  q\cdot E X^{*}$ rises but not by as much as $C$ . At any rate,  the only direct effect of disposable income on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] can come from spending on imported consumption goods (because we ﬁxed investment $I$ and government spending $G$ so that they do not depend on disposable income and therefore neither does trade depend on them). Our home economy’s exports,  in contrast,  are only affected by foreigners’ disposable income. Expressing the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] as a function of disposable income $Y^{\mathrm{{GNI}}}-T,  $ we can therefore write

$$
C A\left(Y_{\mathrm{\tiny~\begin{array}{c}{(-)}\end{array}}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T\right)\approx E X-q\cdot E X^{*}(Y_{\mathrm{\tiny~\begin{array}{c}{(+)}\end{array}}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T).
$$ 

The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] drops with transient increases in disposable income because imports increase with extra disposable income.

The real exchange rate affects the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] in three ways. First,  if the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates to a higher level (a higher relative price of foreign goods $E P^{*}/P)$ ) then domestic goods and services become relatively inexpensive for foreign residents and our exports EX are in high demand abroad. Second,  if the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates then foreign goods and services are relatively expensive for domestic residents and foreign shipments $E X^{*}$ to us are in low demand here. Third,  being the relative price of foreign goods and services in terms of domestic ones,  the real exchange rate $q$ enters the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance directly: as the multiplicative price factor that translates foreign exports into relative home prices. Expressing the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] as a function of disposable income and also the real exchange rate $q,  $ ,  we can take all three effects into account and write

$$
C A\left(q,  Y_{\mathrm{\tiny~(-)}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T\right)\approx E X(\mathrm{\tiny~q~})-q\cdot E X^{*}(\mathrm{\tiny~q~},  Y_{\mathrm{\tiny~(+)}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T).
$$ 

What is the net effect of the real exchange rate on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance? Hard to tell. Grandma and many journalists might respond more assuredly and say: $^{\prime\prime}\mathrm{A}$ depreciation raises the trade balance,  of course,  because it makes foreign goods relatively more expensive and domestic goods relatively cheaper.” Right. But that’s not the full story. Grandma and the journalists emphasize what economists call the volume effect : As the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates to a higher level,  the volume of our exports EX to foreigners increases while the import volume of foreign shipments to us $E X^{*}$ declines. The plus and minus signs below $E X(q)$ and $E X^{*}(q)$ express exactly those relationships in the equation above.

Then there is the value effect . Contracts for exports and imports have to be signed well in advance of delivery. Suppose it takes six weeks or more for goods to ship overseas,  so trade contracts are written at least six weeks in advance. As a result,  no volume effect applies to any of the contracted shipments six weeks into the future. But the real exchange rate changes on the ﬁrms and traders,  whose contracts are set. The shipments have to go out,  as contractually agreed,  while their relative price moves. If the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates to a higher relative price of foreign goods,  then the value of our trade balance drops one-for-one because we now have to pay more for our contractually given import quantities. In the equation above,  the value effect stems from the multiplicative price factor that translates foreign exports into relative domestic prices,  and it affects the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance in the opposite direction of the volume effect.

Which effect dominates? If trade contracts cannot be altered for weeks,  then the value effect dominates for weeks. While the value effect prevails over the volume effect,  grandma and the journalists are wrong. But grandma and the journalists will ultimately be right—at least after several weeks. For now,  we need to decide how to proceed. Let’s follow grandma and the journalists (and defer the opposite case to later in the chapter):

$$
C A=C A\;(\underbrace{q}_{(+)},  Y_{\begin{array}{c}{(-)}\end{array}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T).
$$ 

A real depreciation of $q$ to a higher level leads to an increase in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance,  if the volume effect dominates the value effect—accepting grandma’s and the journalists’ view for now.

# Output,  Disposable Income and the Real Exchange Rate

We are ready to put the insights together. Under the arguments we made,  domestic output (gross domestic product GDP) must roughly equal gross national income GNI and therefore is:

$$
Y^{\mathrm{{GDP}}}\approx Y^{\mathrm{{GNN}}}\approx C(Y_{\underset{(+)}{\longrightarrow}}^{\mathrm{{GDP}}}-T)+\bar{I}+G+C A\underset{(+)}{\(\ q\ ,  Y_{\underset{(-)}{\longrightarrow}}^{\mathrm{{GDP}}}-T)},  
$$ 

where we have replaced disposable income with $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}\!-\!T$ everywhere because national income and GDP are roughly equal. A relationship like the one above is often said to describe economy-wide aggregate demand,  denoted with $D$ . When absorption increases,  more domestic consumption demand results in additional domestic output and income. When the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance increases,  more foreign demand for our exports results in additional domestic output and income. When the real exchange rate depreciates,  domestic producers and service providers generate extra export revenue. The additional export revenue from the depreciation can either raise proﬁts and corporate earnings,  or it can be passed on to workers through higher wages and bonus payments,  or both. The distribution of extra income from higher export revenues aside,  national income and therefore aggregate demand increase either way after a depreciation of the real exchange rate.

Output appears twice on the right-hand side of the aggregate demand relationship,  once with a positive sign (for consumption) and once with a negative sign (for the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance). Fortunately,  we can infer the net effect. Suppose all extra disposable income goes to consumption of foreign goods,  at the given real exchange rate,  and not a single penny is spent on extra domestic consumption. Then the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance drops by exactly the same amount as consumption increases. There is no net effect on output. We would then have to collapse the above equation for aggregate demand $D$ into

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D(\underset{(+)}{q},  I,  G),  
$$ 

Where aggregate demand on the right-hand side does not depend on national income or output itself because any extra penny goes fully to imports,  so there is no additional stimulation for domestic aggregate demand. This is an extreme but important case because we cannot know in theory whether aggregate demand responds to itself through raising national income and domestic spending,  or not. The predictions of our complete model will depend on the feedback of aggregate demand on itself through national income. In other words,  all our following qualitative results are correct if aggregate demand does not depend on national income and the above relationship applies.

The magnitude of expected economic responses may depend on the feedback of aggregate demand on itself through national income. This is often called the multiplier effect,  and an empirically difﬁcult mechanism to measure. Suppose not all additional disposable income goes to consumption of foreign goods,  some extra income does fall on domestic consumption. Under this scenario,  the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance $C A$ falls by a smaller amount than total consumption $C$ increases. The net effect of additional disposable income on aggregate demand and output is strictly positive:

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D(\underset{(+)}{q},  Y_{\underset{(+)}{G D P}}^{\mathrm{GDP}}\!-\!T,  I,  G).
$$ 

The net effect could be minuscule in theory. Perhaps just one penny out of the additional disposable income will be spent on domestic consumption goods,  all the remainder goes to imports from abroad. But the net effect cannot be negative. In the least favorable case for domestic stimulation the net effect is zero. As soon as one penny goes to domestic consumption,  the net effect of disposable income on aggregate demand is positive.

# Think Twice about Convention: Not So Fast With the Multiplier

In the economic tradition of John Maynard Keynes,  the multiplier effect plays a prominent role. Suppose the government raises spending,  for example to build infrastructure projects like the Hoover Dam near Las Vegas,  Nevada. The Hoover Dam generates electricity and regulates water supply. Large-scale infrastructure projects like this were the way John Maynard Keynes’s recommendations were implemented during the 1930 s to get the economy out of the Great Depression. While the infrastructure project should have economic value in itself,  the belief was that the contractors and workers on the jobs would then also spend their additional incomes on extra consumption,  which in turn would be someone else’s output and income,  and their consumption in turn would be yet someone else’s output and income,  and so forth. At any step of the iterations,  a fraction of the additionally generated income would also be saved,  not consumed,  so the spread of additional income generation would be limited and ultimately come to a halt. With some mathematics,  one can show that households with a marginal propensity to consume 80 percent of transient disposable income,  and to save 20 percent,  the multiplier of consumption would be as large as ﬁve times the initial spending on Hoover Dam. That is not a plausible magnitude. John Maynard Keynes famously quipped: 5 “I’d rather be vaguely right than precisely wrong.” Empirical macro economists today prefer to be precisely right.

Valerie A. Ramey (2011) reviews the state of economic knowledge about the government spending multiplier. She restricts her attention to studies that estimate the multiplier effect for the arguably most relevant type of stimulus spending: a temporary,  deﬁcit-ﬁnanced increase in government purchases. Her condensed summary is not good news for proponents of the multiplier: “I conclude that the multiplier for this type of spending is probably between 0.8 and 1.5.” A multiplier with a value below one is not a multiplier,  it is a dec el erat or. What a dec el erat or number such as 0.8 means is that,  of the initial spending on Hoover Dam,  only 80 percent became effective for domestic output. Does that mean that 20 percent went to waste? Not necessarily,

As we will soon see. In an open economy,  government spending,  especially if it is targeted at domestic goods and services,  will make the real exchange rate appreciate. The real exchange rate is the relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic ones,  and the additional domestic demand drives the relative price of foreign goods and services down,  compared to domestic ones,  because the additional government demand at home makes domestic products art i ci ally valuable. This reduces the trade balance,  imports go up in value and exports down,  and the initial effect of the stimulus gets dampened,  as households will turn to more imports than before,  even if the government may have set out to procure only domestic contractors and hire only domestic workers.

The dec el erat or might be worse,  but the multiplier could also be better. As Ramey (2011) explains: “Reasonable people can argue,  however,  that the data do not reject 0.5 or 2.0… . We now have many more estimates of ﬁscal multipliers than we did in Fall 2008 and early 2009,  when policymakers were trying to decide whether to use ﬁscal policy to try to stimulate the economy. Many of the studies are so recent,  however,  that the profession needs more time to interpret results and to check their robustness.” What can we learn for now? Maybe as many as four lessons from just one variable. First,  the simple mathematics with a rigid propensity to consume certainly does not capture reality. Second,  we better prepare macroeconomic models,  like the one here,  that do not depend on a multiplier effect. Third,  even if government spending does not raise output one-for-one,  the Hoover Dam construction does generate additional employment and economic activity during a recession (unless the dec el erat or suddenly turns negative). And anyway,  fourth,  perhaps the value of the Hoover Dam is mostly that it has been producing electricity and regulating water supplies for us for the past eight decades,  steadily as the economy ploughs forward on its long-term growth path.

While it is hard to forecast the economy,  a safe prediction is that the debate among economists about government interventions to alleviate business cycle swings is not going to subside any time soon. Perhaps the quickest way to explain the contrary views is to compare a recession to a light bulb that needs changing. How many free-market economists does it take to change a light bulb? None. If the light bulb needed changing,  the invisible hand of the free market would have already done it. How many Keynesian economists does it take to change a light bulb? Everybody. Changing the bulb will generate employment,  more consumption,  higher national income,  yet more employment,  … Somewhere between the extremes might lie a useful middle ground. This chapter will outline conditions for the effectiveness of short-term policy in a global market place. How many such middle-ground economists does it take to change the light bulb? Eight. One to turn the bulb,  and seven to hold the conditions constant.

# 20.3 The QQ–DD Model

Our macroeconomic model for the short term will combine two main markets: the ﬁnancial market,  including the domestic money and the foreign exchange marketplaces,  and the real-side market. We will represent the equilibrium in those two markets with one schedule for each market. We are most interested in the real exchange rate $q,  $ because it is closely associated with external balance,  and real output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ ,  which is a main element of internal balance. For the ﬁnancial market we will therefore consider a QQ schedule that relates the real exchange rate $q$ to real output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ and represents all $q$ and $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ combinations for which both the domestic money and the foreign exchange marketplaces are in equilibrium.

On the real side we will consider a DD schedule that relates aggregate demand,  and thus output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ ,  to the real exchange rate $q,  $ showing combinations of $q$ and $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ that reﬂect real-side equilibrium. The combined model for both schedules is the QQ–DD model,  where QQ stands for the real exchange rate (and its relation with real income) and DD for real aggregate demand (the relation of real output with the real exchange rate).

# TheQQScheduleofFinancial-marketEquilibrium

How do the real exchange rate and output relate to each other in ﬁnancial market equilibrium? In other words,  if real income changes,  how does the real exchange rate have to respond so that the domestic money and the foreign exchange marketplaces are both back in equilibrium? The QQ schedule answers this question and succinctly summarizes for us all we need to remember from the previous Chapter 19. It takes three steps to trace out the answer.

Suppose there is a transitory increase in real income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}},  $ ,  as the economy enters a transient boom in output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ on top of its long-term

# Fundamentals

- Key forces : Effects of income $Y^{\mathbf{GN I}}$ on currency demand and real-exchange rate on output $Y^{\mathbf{GDP}}$ • Factors of production: any
 - Factor mobility: capital and currency mobile across borders
 - Sectors: 2 (ﬁnancial sector and real sector)
 - Countries: 2 (Home and rest of world Foreign∗)
- Perfect competition,  transportation costs: Purchasing power parity fails in short run,  restored in long run
 - Constant inter temporal turns to scale: Constant real interest rate $r^{e}$ • Trade not balanced
 - Risk neutrality
 - Contracts perfectly enforceable

Growth path. First,  we can look at the domestic money and bond market. For given money supply,  held ﬁxed by the central bank,  the private sector will strive to use the additional income for spending and will demand more liquidity to pay for the planned expenditures. Households with higher real income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ will try to come by cash,  short-term credit on credit cards,  or small loans for consumption. Businesses with better output prospects $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ will try to obtain cash and short-term loans to acquire additional intermediate inputs,  raise inventories,  and perhaps expand their factory ﬂoor with additional machinery. In short,  the private sector as a whole will attempt to sell assets from the portfolios to raise cash. This will depress asset prices at Wall Street and elsewhere,  especially for short-term bonds,  and conversely raise the bond yields. The attempts to sell bonds will only end once the bond yields and interest rates are so high that households and businesses view the opportunity cost of holding cash as too much to demand additional cash. In the new domestic money and bond market equilibrium,  the private sector will not have received any additional cash; after all the central bank’s money supply is unaltered. In the aggregate,  only the nominal interest rate $R$ increases,  and the higher opportunity cost of holding money makes the private sector just content with the existing cash in circulation.

Second,  consider the foreign exchange market. The new domestic money and bond market equilibrium results in a higher domestic nominal interest rate $R$ . But the foreign nominal interest rate $R^{*}$ is unchanged. International investors correctly assess the increase in real income as transitory,  so expectations about the nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ level in the long term,  between the home country’s currency and any foreign currency,  are also unchanged. This cannot be a foreign exchange market equilibrium. The higher return that domestic currency holdings now command under the higher nominal interest rate $R$ make international investors—home and foreign residents active in the foreign exchange market—demand more domestic currency. The nominal spot exchange rate $E$ appreciates to a lower level (at which it takes fewer units of domestic currency to get one unit of foreign currency). More precisely,  international investors will only be content if the expected depreciation rate of $(E^{e}-E)/E$ is high enough so that the expected ca tal lo s on holding domes currency fully wipe out the additional interest differential between R and R $R^{*}$ that widened after R rose. For unchanged long-term ex ctations $E^{e}$ ,  a higher depreciation rate $(E^{e}-E)/E$ can only come about if the spot exchange rate E immediately appreciates so as to create the space for a larger subsequent depreciation towards the long-term exchange rate level of $E^{e}$ . The nominal spot exchange rate level $E$ drops.

Third,  we need to relate the nominal spot exchange rate $E$ to the real exchange rate $q$ . In the short run,  uc tu at ions in the nominal exchange rate $E$ fully carry over into the real exchange rate $q=E P^{*}/P$ . The empirical reason is that the price levels $P$ and $P^{*}$ only move slowly so that shortterm uc tu at ions in $E$ translate into short-term uc tu at ions in $q$ almost fully. In summary,  a transitory increase in real income and real output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ must result in a real-exchange rate appreciation of $q$ to a lower level so that ﬁnancial-market equilibrium is fully restored. Figure 20.2 depicts the QQ schedule as a falling curve in a diagram with the real exchange rate $q$ on the vertical and output $Y$ (real income) on the horizontal axis. Along the QQ curve,  the domestic money and the foreign exchange market are both in equilibrium.

# Evidence on the Nominal and Real Exchange Rates

How realistic is the assumption that the real exchange rate $q$ responds one-for-one to the nominal exchange rate $E$ in the short run? Economists in the tradition of economic thought inspired by John Maynard Keynes do not hesitate to accept that $q$ and $E$ move hand in hand in the short term because they typically posit that prices are sticky in the short run. Even economists critical of the Keynesian tenets,  however,  in general do accept that $q$ and $E$ are empirically inseparable in the short run. Chari,  Kehoe and McGrattan (2002) conducted a benchmark study. They assembled quarterly time series data on the nominal exchange rates and price levels for both traded and non-traded goods and services in the United States and major countries in Europe. One of the remarkable,  and in our context most important facts,  is that they ﬁnd a correlation coefﬁcient between the real exchange rate and the nominal exchange rate that is 0.\1. In other words,  even in their quarterly data—which average out the daily,  weekly and monthly swings—the changes in the real exchange rate match those of the nominal exchange rate almost 100 percent of the time. Just as we have assumed in our model,

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/65f2ec644612083a06afd737649df17eb7cf17166fd982990a5b1f29f937b632.jpg)

Figure 20.2: Joint Financial and Real-side Equilibrium

The nominal exchange rate pushes around the real exchange rate one-for-one in the short run at a quarterly frequency.

The left panel of Figure 20.3 depicts the time pattern of the nominal and real exchange rates,  and their parallel swings,  while the relative price level between the United States and Europe moves only gradually. There was a marked real appreciation during the 1980 s,  when domestic demand from a substantive ﬁscal expansion in the United States contributed to a rise in the relative value of U.S. goods and services. But the real exchange rate is at a level in the late period that is similar to the level in the early period. As in our ﬁnancial-market model,  in the long run the real exchange rate tends to its fundamental level (under relative purchasing power parity) and shakes off any monetary shocks from the nominal exchange rate. The left panel of Figure 20.3 also illustrates that the almost perfect co variation between the nominal and real exchange rate goes along with a substantive persistence over time. The correlation coefﬁcient of the real exchange rate in a given quarter with itself a quarter ago is 0.\1,  keeping its level the same from quarter to quarter 83 percent of the time. No surprise,  given their close association,  the nominal exchange rate has about the same auto correlation coefﬁcient with 0.\1. Compared to output,  however,  the exchange rates are far more volatile. The standard deviation of the real exchange rate between the United States and Europe is 7.52 (7.95 for the nominal exchange rate),  and that is a standard deviation 4.6 times that of U.S. GDP (4.9 times for the nominal exchange rate). In other words,  the exchange rates are roughly ﬁve times as volatile as output.

You might wonder whether these ﬁndings have to with Chari,  Kehoe and McGrattan (2002)’s use of the consumer price indexes in the United States and the European countries. A consumer price index measures an average household’s typical expenditure and includes many goods and services that cannot be traded. These non-traded price components might possibly not move much with international market conditions and could be a reason why the nominal and real exchange rates are so closely correlated and so persistent over time. Chari,  Kehoe and McGrattan (2002) anticipated this potential criticism and split the real exchange rate into two components: the component related to traded goods,  and the component related to non-traded goods. The right panel of Figure 20.3 shows their ﬁndings. Stunningly,  it is the traded-goods component that drives around the real exchange rate. The relative traded-goods price is the part of the real exchange rate on which consumers and businesses base their export and import decisions. We therefore make no mistake in our model when we suppose that the nominal exchange rate,  set on ﬁnancial markets,  fully translates into the real

Figure 20.3: Real Exchange Rate Components between the United States and Europe

Exchange rate that matters for real markets. In summary,  the setup of the ﬁnancial side of our model is closely in line with evidence that both Keynesian and non-Keynesian economists widely accept.

The QQ schedule incorporates this evidence. We took three steps to derive why temporarily high real income must result in an appreciated real exchange rate in overall ﬁnancial market equilibrium. Each step corresponds to one equation in the ﬁnancial-market model of Chapter 19. First,  money and bond market equilibrium requires that real money supply $M^{S}/P$ equals real money demand (the liquidity preference $L (\cdot),  $ ),  so:

$$
M^{S}=P\cdot L (R,   Y_{(+)}^{\mathrm{GNI}}),  
$$ 

Where the nominal interest rate (bond yield) $R$ is the opportunity cost of holding money and reduces real money demand,  and real income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ raises real money demand. Second,  equilibrium in the foreign exchange market requires that the Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) condition is satisﬁed: $R-$ $R^{*}\;=\;(E^{e}\,  -\,   E)/E,  $ so that any nominal interest rate differential $R\mathrm{~-~}R^{*}$ between the home and foreign economy is wiped out in expectation by a capital loss from an expected depreciation of the home currency $(E^{e}-E)/E$ . Third,  the deﬁnition of the real exchange rate $q$ means that the nominal exchange rate can be expressed as $E=q P/P^{*}$ . This is where the evidence enters. Under the equation,  $q$ and $E$ move hand-in-hand for given $P/P^{*}$ . Plugging UIP and the deﬁnition of the real exchange rate into the money and bond market equation above gives us three equations in one:

$$
M^{S}=P\cdot L (R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)-1,   Y_{_{(+)}}^{_{\mathrm{GNI}}}).
$$ 

That is the mathematical relationship behind the QQ schedule. The mathematical relationship also answers the initial question. If real income increases,  how does the real exchange rate have to respond so that the ﬁnancial market is back in equilibrium? A higher real income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ raises real money demand $L (\cdot)$ ,  so for given real money supply $M^{S}$ the term $R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)-1$ must increase,  too,  to restore the equation to equality. This implies that $q$ must fall because it enters a denominator in that term. The real exchange rate must appreciate. The QQ schedule in Figure 20.2 shows this negative relationship between $q$ and $Y$ .

# The DD Schedule of Real-side Equilibrium

There is little else we need to say about the DD schedule. If grandma and the journalists are right,  then we know from earlier in this chapter that

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D (\underset{(+)}{q},   Y_{\underset{(+)}{G D P}}^{\mathrm{GDP}}\!-\! T,   I,   G).
$$ 

This is the mathematical relationship behind the DD schedule. If grandma and the journalists are right,  that is if the volume effect of a real exchange rate change dominates the value effect,  then $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ increases with an increase in $q,  $ a real depreciation. Figure 20.2 shows the DD schedule in a $q-Y$ diagram. For the sign of the DD relationship,  it does not matter whether there is a multiplier effect from disposable income and consumption or not. A real depreciation of $q$ must be accompanied by a stimulation of $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ . Concretely,  even if any increase in real income raises consumption only for foreign import goods,  and not a penny is spent on extra domestic consumption goods,  then the DD schedule still slopes strictly upward in a $q-Y$ diagram. It will just be ﬂatter. However,  the slope of the DD schedule will alter the magnitude of impacts that monetary shocks can have.

# Joint QQ–DD Equilibrium

The QQ of ﬁnancial market equilibrium slopes strictly downward in the $q-Y$ diagram,  the DD schedule of real market equilibrium strictly upward. The overall equilibrium,  when both ﬁnancial and real markets are simultaneously in equilibrium is the unique possible $q-Y$ combination where both schedules intersect. The right panel of Figure 20.2 depicts this overall equilibrium at $q_{0}$ and $Y_{0}$ with a black dot.

The equilibrium is a stable one in the sense that shocks,  which may throw the economy off its equilibrium,  will be wiped out and market forces will bring the economy back to its equilibrium. Imagine a shock throws the economy off to a point such as the black dot associated with the real exchange rate level $q_{B}$ . Financial markets adjust immediately. The black dot associated with the exchange rate level of $q_{B}$ is off the QQ schedule and,  given any real-market output level,  the ﬁnancial markets restore equilibrium by moving the real exchange rate to a level $q_{A}$ within minutes. The next black dot associated with $q_{A}$ is on the QQ schedule,  so ﬁnancial markets are in equilibrium now. However,  the real market is not in equilibrium yet. That adjustment may take longer. Compared to its long-term equilibrium $q_{0},  $ the exchange rate at $q_{A}$ is still devalued. This means that the trade balance,  and therefore the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance,  is above its long-term level (because grandma and the journalists are right) and the export boom exerts a boost on real output. Real activity gradually increases,  but additional real money demand in the process of increasing real incomes raises the nominal interest rate,  which in turn leads to an appreciation of the nominal and thus real exchange rate. As the gradual move back to real-market equilibrium is under way,  the ﬁnancial market stays

Table 20.1: Shifters of the QQ and DD Schedules

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/0ba938e5c14061322297812569c3c87dd36a8132b59955ddd7c995764d0f4153.jpg)

Note : $q$ and $Y$ are on the axes of the $q-Y$ diagram and do not affect the positions of schedules QQ and DD; $q$ and $Y$ changes are reﬂected in moves along the schedules.

In equilibrium at all times. The arrows along the QQ schedule indicate the move as output nears its equilibrium level under a continuously appreciating real exchange rate. Eventually,  the stable equilibrium at $q_{0}$ and $Y_{0}$ will be restored.

Given the fact that the equilibrium is stable,  we can from now on compare equilibria under different scenarios. We can conduct what economists call comparative statics—comparing one static equilibrium to another one. For these exercises,  it will be important to understand how variables in our model other than $q$ and $Y$ affect the positions of the QQ and DD schedules. For the record,  Table 20.1 shows a complete list of all outside variables and how they shift each schedule in our model. No need to remember or learn by heart,  we will come to the important variable changes in due course. Why are the variables $q$ and $Y$ not among the shifters? Remember $q$ and $Y$ are on the axes of our diagram,  so as these variables change we move along the QQ and DD schedules. We do not alter their positions. We will use the model,  and the positions of the QQ and DD schedules,  to infer $q$ and $Y$ from the diagram.

How can we derive the results of Table 20.1? Take two examples for each schedule. For the QQ schedule suppose that money supply $M^{S}$ increases. A higher $\bar{M}^{S}$ raises the left-hand side of the ﬁnancial market equilibrium equation $\bar{M}^{S}=P\!\cdot\! L (R^{*}\!+\! (E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)\!-\! 1,   Y),  $ ,  so for any given $Y$ level we must plot the new QQ schedule at a position with a higher $q$ ( $\cdot_{q}$ has a positive effect on L given all other variables) so that the equality of the equation is restored—a shift up of the QQ schedule. Still for the QQ schedule suppose that long-term expectations of the nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ rise to a more depreciated level. This reduces the right-hand side of the ﬁnancial market equilibrium equation,  all else unchanged,  so for any given $Y$ level we must plot the new QQ schedule at a position with a higher $q$ (an increase in $q$ in the denominator offsets the rise in $E^{e}$ in the numerator) so that the equality of the equation is restored—also a shift up of the QQ schedule. For the DD schedule suppose that government spending $G$ increases. Government spending raises the right-hand side of the real market equilibrium equation $Y=D (q,   Y-T,   I,   G),  $ ,  so for any given $q$ level we must plot the new DD schedule at a position with a higher $Y$ ( $Y$ raises the left-hand side) so that the equality of the equation is restored—a shift of the DD schedule to the right. Also for the DD schedule suppose that tax collection $T$ increases,  reducing disposable income. A tax hike reduces the right-hand side of the real market equilibrium equation $Y=D (q,   Y-T,   I,   G).$ ,  so for any given $q$ level we must plot the new DD schedule at a position with a lower $Y$ (on the left-hand side) so that the equality of the equation is restored—a shift of the DD schedule to the left.

# 20.4 Macroeconomic Policy in the Global Economy

The model is ready. We can now return to our initial questions: What macroeconomic policy measures can the central bank and government,  and how effective are their interventions in a global economy with free currency and capital markets? For timeliness of the policies,  suppose we have precise information and know the current equilibrium point at which the economy is in the QQ-DD diagram. To study the effectiveness of policies,  we can conduct one experiment at a time: either raise money supply or adopt an expansion ary ﬁscal policy,  and trace the economy’s response. In modern economies,  largely independent central banks are responsible for [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] . Legislatures and executive ofﬁces at the national,  regional or local level conduct ﬁscal policy .

To limit the intervention,  we need to know when to stop the policy. For each policy,  we can discern whether to implement it temporarily or permanently. A temporary policy is reversed before long run effects set in. Temporary policies therefore only have short-run effects by design. As in the previous chapter,  prices are sticky in the short run. In our macroeconomic model,  rational investors do not change beliefs about the expected long-term nominal exchange rate level $E^{e}$ because the long-run will be unaffected as the temporary policy is going to be undone beforehand. In contrast,  permanent policy lasts in the long run. A permanent intervention has both short-run and long-run effects ,  and the two types of effects can potentially differ. For one,  prices become fully ﬂexible in the long run but they are sticky in the short run. Upon the announcement of the permanent policy,  rational investors immediately form new beliefs about the expected nominal exchange rate level $E^{e}$ in the long term. This gives us four combinations to consider,  temporary monetary and ﬁscal policies as well as permanent monetary and ﬁscal policies.

Throughout the analysis,  we will uphold our two main assumptions on the price level $P$ (from Chapter 19). First,  we follow Milton Friedman’s tenet that “inﬂation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon so only changes to money supply $M^{S}$ or money demand $L (\cdot)$ are allowed to affect the price level $P$ in the long term. Friedman’s uncompromising view might not be literally correct,  but it disciplines the analysis and will not lead us to wrong conclusions for ﬁscal policies in the global economy. (The model has enough degrees of freedom to make sure that ﬁscal policies do change the relative price of foreign goods through the real exchange rate $q$ .) Second,  the price level $P$ is sticky in the short run but fully ﬂexible in the long run. (If you prefer the price to be ﬂexible immediately,  just consider the long-term result for a permanent [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]].) In the background abroad,  the foreign nominal interest rate $R^{*}$ and the foreign price level $P^{*}$ are unaltered because they only respond to foreign monetary conditions.

# Temporary Monetary Expansion

A temporary monetary expansion raises $M^{S}$ for a while and then reverts back. A temporary ﬁscal expansion either raises government spending $G$ for a while or cuts taxes $T$ for a while and then reverts back. The private sector correctly anticipates the future reversal of these temporary interventions,  so the expectation of the long-term nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ is unaffected when policies are temporary.

Let’s start with a temporary monetary expansion. In the left panel of Figure 20.4,  the economy is at an initial equilibrium with output $Y_{0}$ and a real exchange rate $q_{0}$ . An increase in money supply ${\dot{M}}^{S}$ shifts the QQ schedule up to a new position depicted with $Q Q^{\prime}$ . The reason is that a higher money supply level,  for any given output $Y$ ,  must be associated with a lower nominal interest rate $R$ and a depreciated spot nominal exchange rate and therefore a depreciated real (high) exchange rate level $q$ . At the new position of the $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedule the domestic money and bond market is back in equilibrium.

Are we done? What else might change? The long-term nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ is unaffected under a temporary policy that will be reversed before the long term sets in. The price level $P$ is sticky in the short run under our common convention,  and there is no long run to consider because the policy will be undone before the long run begins. The other variables $T,  \,   I,  \,   G,  \,   R^{*}$ and $P^{*}$ do not respond. What about $q$ and $Y?$ They do respond,  but their changes are reﬂected in moves along the DD and $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedules,  so there is nothing else for us to do. We can simply read off the new equilibrium from the diagram. After the temporary monetary expansion,  the exchange rate has depreciated to a new level $q^{\prime}$ and output expanded to a new level $Y^{\prime}$ . A temporary monetary expansion stimulates the domestic economy through a real exchange rate depreciation.

What just happened? The monetary expansion from some $M^{S}$ to a higher $M^{S\prime}>M^{S}$ left some households and businesses,  including commercial banks,  with additional cash holdings. But at the old nominal interest rate $R,  $ the private sector’s [[Lecture 5- Dynamic Portfolio Choice|portfolio choice]] was set for lower real money holdings. First,  households and businesses therefore attempt to purchase interest bearing assets,  driving up the bond prices,  and down the bond yields $R$ until the lower opportunity cost of holding money (lower $R$ ) makes them just happy with the extra cash that the central bank pushed out the door and into their bank accounts and wallets. Second,  a lower domestic interest rate $R$ drives international investors out of domestic currency holdings and depreciates the nominal exchange rate $E$ . (To be precise,  the reduced interest rate differential $R-R^{*}$ must be accompanied by a larger subsequent capital gain from domestic currency holdings,  that is a lower subsequent depreciation rate $(E^{e}{-}E)/E$ for the foreign exchange market to be in equilibrium,  and this is only possible if the spot rate E depreciates immediately given ﬁxed long-term $E^{e}$ so that there is space for a stronger subsequent appreciation or at least less depreciation.) Third,  in the short run purchasing power parity breaks down and the real exchange rate $q$ moves one-for-one with the nominal exchange rate $E$ . These three steps together explain the upward displacement of the QQ schedule to $Q Q^{\prime}$ . Now the real market kicks in. The depreciated real exchange rate raises the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and stimulates output so that the economy moves along the $Q Q^{\prime}$ curve to the new equilibrium at $Y^{\prime}$ and $q^{\prime}$ . Note that the ﬁnal equilibrium level of $q^{\prime}$ is lower than the vertical displacement of the QQ schedule might have suggested. The reason is that the additional real output induces households and business to try to raise their cash holdings,  which for the given new ${\bar{M}}^{S\prime}$ dampens the interest rate $R,  $ exchange rate $E$ and $q$ changes. Before the long run begins,  the policy will be undone and the real exchange rate returns to $q_{0},  $ restoring purchasing power parity. Output returns to its initial level $Y_{0}$ .

# Temporary Fiscal Expansion

The government has two main instruments to implement a ﬁscal stimulus,  and essentially three combinations. No matter which of the three options the government chooses for ﬁscal expansion,  all three shift the DD schedule to the right. First,  the government can expand government spending $G$ and keep tax revenue $T$ constant. The additional unfunded spending results in a ﬁscal deﬁcit,  for which the government must raise credit on ﬁnancial markets. Every dollar of additional deﬁcit spending goes directly towards real output and income in the economy.

Second,  the government can cut taxes $T$ but keep spending $G$ unchanged. The unfunded reduction in tax revenue also results in a ﬁscal deﬁcit,  for which the government must raise credit on the private market. The effectiveness of the tax cut depends on the marginal propensity of the private households to use extra disposable income for consumption. Ironically for the sceptics who argue that there is no multiplier effect,  but also advocate for tax cuts,  if they are right then tax cuts are completely ineffective for stimulation. As we have seen,  the consumption multiplier is minor precisely

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/f66a912303daa609cc5d67d92b7f0f9d9cfde042f27a36000154cea485de87d8.jpg)

Figure 20.4: Effects of Temporary Macroeconomic Policies in the Short Run

When the households propensity to consume additional disposable income is negligible. Then the tax cuts go almost entirely into private savings accounts. In other words,  if there is no multiplier effect,  then tax cuts are completely ineffective for short-run stimulation because tax cuts can then not induce any additional consumption,  the cuts just raise savings. Of course,  altering the tax code may also have important consequences for an economy’s long-term growth trajectory,  a question that the ﬁeld of public ﬁnance studies carefully. This chapter’s focus lies on short-term business cycle management in the global economy. For tax cuts to make sense as a policy instrument for macroeconomic stimulus,  let’s assume that the households’ marginal propensity to consume transient income is not zero but positive,  as micro economic theory and empirical evidence suggests.

Third,  the government can pursue a combination of simultaneous spending and tax increases and get some net stimulus out of it. In fact,  the government could fully fund the extra spending $G$ with extra tax revenues $T$ ( $\Delta G=\Delta T$ ),  not incur any additional government debt,  and still exert a small stimulus on the economy. Why? If households do not fully cut back consumption as a response to the tax increase,  but draw down some of their savings,  then the direct government spending expands output $(\Delta G)$ more than the tax hike depresses consumption (by $-c\Delta T$ for a marginal propensity $c$ to consume). The net effect is a small stimulus (of exactly $(1-c)\Delta G)$ .

Consider a temporary deﬁcit-ﬁnanced increase in government purchases,  the ﬁrst and most common option of a ﬁscal expansion. The government will revert the temporary expansion of $G$ before the long term sets in. In the left panel of Figure 20.4,  the economy is at an initial equilibrium with output $Y_{0}$ and a real exchange rate $q_{0}$ . An increase in government spending $G$ shifts the DD schedule right to a new position depicted with $D D^{\prime}$ . The reason is that more government spending,  for any given real exchange rate $q,  $ must be associated with a higher output in real market equilibrium. At the new position of the $D D^{\prime}$ schedule the real market is back in equilibrium. Are we done? What else might change? The long-term nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ is unaffected under a temporary policy that will be reversed before the long term sets in. The price level $P$ is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon and real money demand does not change in the long term. In the short term,  prices are sticky. The other variables $\dot{T,  }\,   I,  \,   M^{S}$ ,  $R^{*}$ and $P^{*}$ do not change. What about $q$ and $Y?$ They do respond,  but their changes are reﬂected in moves along the $D D^{\prime}$ and QQ schedules,  so there is nothing else for us to do. We can simply read off the new equilibrium from the diagram. After the temporary ﬁscal expansion,  the exchange rate appreciates to a new level $q^{\prime}$ and output expands to a new level $Y^{\prime}$ . A temporary ﬁscal expansion stimulates the domestic economy. But the real exchange rate appreciation results in a smaller output increase than the initial horizontal displacement of the DD schedule would suggest.

Even though every dollar of additional deﬁcit spending goes fully towards domestic real output,  the additional real income results in higher money demand,  which the central bank does not meet while it holds $M^{S}$ constant. First,  the unmet money demand causes the nominal interest rate $R$ to rise until this opportunity cost of holding money makes the private sector just happy with their unchanged money holdings. Second,  the higher domestic interest rate causes a nominal appreciation of the spot exchange rate $E$ in the foreign exchange market. Third,  the nominal appreciation in turn leads to a real appreciation of $q$ by the same magnitude in the short run when prices are sticky. On the real side,  the appreciation of $q$ diverts domestic consumption to foreign imports. In our model,  only the households purchase foreign goods. In reality,  businesses will also turn to imported intermediate inputs and foreign equipment under the appreciation. Even if the government’s spending program were initially designed to hire only domestic workers and to exclusively contract domestic suppliers,  the resulting real appreciation from the extra government demand of domestic goods and services will shift subsequent domestic spending to foreign imports. The appreciation dampens the ﬁscal stimulus and results in a ﬁnal output increase that is smaller than the initial rightward displacement of the DD schedule.

# Timing of Policy Interventions

Our model shows that both temporary monetary and temporary ﬁscal policies can be used to stabilize the economy. The success of a temporary monetary expansion crucially depends on the assumption that prices are relatively stickier than the nominal exchange rate in the short run so that the real exchange rate depreciates (as the evidence by Chari,  Kehoe and McGrattan (2002) suggests). Temporary [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] can effectively offset transitory output uc tu at ions. Conversely,  however,  unanticipated monetary shocks can also have strong adverse effects on output. In contrast,  the success of a temporary ﬁscal expansion relies on the fact that the nominal exchange rate does not strongly respond in the short run so that the real exchange rate appreciation does not offset most of the initial government expansion. In a global economy with a freely ﬂoating exchange rate,  ﬁscal policy is therefore more limited in its success. On the other hand,  unanticipated ﬁscal shocks also have weaker output effects because they are mitigated by a dampening exchange rate response.

Both monetary and ﬁscal expansions also pose risks. Additional ﬁscal expenditures that are not tax funded,  or tax cuts that are not met by spending cuts,  result in budget deﬁcits that need to be funded with government borrowing. That borrowing may raise real interest rates,  reduce available credit to the private sector,  and harm private investment. Expansion ary monetary policies will ultimately result in inﬂation. If the private sector incorporates the expected inﬂation in its wage setting and pricing decisions quickly,  then that in ation ary bias does not allow prices to remain sticky for long and there is no net gain in output.

Interventions need to be timely to be effective. Many central banks today enjoy a large degree of autonomy that removes them from the political process. Monetary policy can therefore typically respond faster to changing economic conditions than other government agencies. Changes in ﬁscal policy,  in contrast,  depend on an often lengthy policy making process that involves legislature and executive government ofﬁces. Until the most recent Great Recession it had become a wide-held belief that lags in implementing ﬁscal policy were typically too long to be useful for combating recessions,  but ﬁscal measures have been prominent tools recently.

There is also a time lag in identifying the source of a shock and its expected duration. While we have gotten better at tracking the state of the economy,  most of our statistics are like the rear mirror in a car. It is hard to understand trafﬁc if you don’t get to look through the windshield. In the early 1930 s,  when the world economy was sliding into the Great Depression,  policy markers had to rely on just a few statistics: stock price indices on Wall Street for the ﬁnancial market,  and for the real side such sketchy numbers as freight car loadings tracking shipments of goods and a few indices of industrial production. Out of the frustration with such sparse glimpses at the economy came the invention of national accounting to measure gross domestic production and gross national income at a quarterly frequency. But as good as we have gotten,  the national accounts are still mostly a rear mirror. Some economists deﬁne a recession as a real decline in GDP over two or three consecutive quarters. For that deﬁnition,  it will take at least two quarters by design to identify a recession as such. In the United States,  the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) does not deﬁne a recession in such rigid terms. For the NBER,  a recession is “a signiﬁcant decline in economic activity spread across the economy,  lasting more than a few months,  normally visible in real GDP,  real income,  employment,  industrial production,  and wholesale-retail sales.” 7 The NBER’s last determination was announced in September 20,  2010 when it dated a trough of real GDP for June 2009,  more than a year after its occurrence. In the view of the NBER,  the Great Recession started in December 2007 when economic activity was at a peak and lasted until June 2009 when activity was at a trough. But the slow recovery of the labor market since 2009 makes the current expansion feel to many as if the economy were still in recession. One reason why it so tough to date economic uc tu at ions is that neither recessions nor expansions are smooth,  they often show reversals while they are under way. An expansion,  for example,  may include a short period of contraction followed by further growth. The NBER cites as the most recent example of a judgment that was less than obvious its decision for 1980-1982 “when the Committee determined that the contraction that began in 1981 was not a continuation of the one that began in 1980,  but rather a separate full recession.” As the economy ﬂuctuates,  it is hard to discern its state,  even harder to identify causes and yet harder to design remedies. At hindsight,  of course,  we will know more. However,  that is not necessarily a just i cation for inaction.

# Change of Perspective: Forecasting

Economists have famously forecast eight out of the past ﬁve recessions. How to do better?

The Wall Street Journal proposes to use its Guide to the 50 Economic Indicators that Really Matter . Wait,  that is not the full title,  which goes on to clarify: From Big Macs to “zombie banks,  ” the indicators smart investors watch to beat the market . Among the top 50 indicators are some from the rear mirror. You may have thought that our macroeconomic variables consumption $C_{s}$ ,  investment $I_{c}$ ,  government spending $G$ and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance CA won’t make it out of the rear view. Statistics that take time to compile,  revise and correct frequently end up among the lagging indicators . The Wall Street Journal is more generous. It lists the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance $C A$ among the statistics that provide a view through the windshield,  one of the leading indicators ,  and it lists government spending as between the windshield and the side window. Statistics outside the side window are often called coincident indicators .

Index number 50 by the Wall Street Journal’s count is another such coincident indicator. It goes by various titles,  including the “Vixen index,  ” the “Stud index,  ” and the “Hot Waiter/Waitress Index.” The indicator does not require much mathematics,  just keen watching in the local economy. The Wall Street Journal guide reports that this index was ﬁrst proposed by the competing New York Times magazine. When a journal enlists a competitor for information,  watch. By the Wall Street Journal’s account,  Hugo Lindgren,  the editor of the New York Times magazine,  states: “There’s a whole lot of businesses that are interested in hiring attractive people. That’s true for both men and women” (Simon Constable and Robert E. Wright 2011,  p. 260). But in the view of Hugo Lindgren and the Wall Street Journal,  beautiful women seem to be valued more than attractive men,  so a Vixen index beats a Stud index in forecasting precision,  and the Wall Street Journal calls index number 50 the “Vixen index.” That assessment might need some qu ali cation by location and context. The Wall Street Journal translates Lindgren’s proposal into concrete forecasting action this way: “When the waitresses at your local eateries and bars look smoking hot,  then it’s a sureﬁre guarantee that the economy is in the doldrums.” The reasoning is that beautiful people get better jobs than “at the local greasy spoon” when the economy booms. A restatement of the idea for general use is perhaps this version: When hot people work bad jobs,  things don’t look good for the economy. Everyone can build their own beauty-on-a-badly-paidjob indicator and assess the local economy to adopt accordingly savvy and surely highly risky investment strategies.

In general,  the best investment advice continues to be that you should buy low and sell high. When other investors are not buying yet,  chances are that you get to buy low. Awkward indexes may come in handy for trying to beat the market,  but they won’t work all the time. High returns only come at high risk. That’s another principle of ﬁnance as we saw in other chapters. If forecasting eight out of the past ﬁve recessions meant forecasting early,  then the forecasters probably made money ﬁve times and lost three times. That is still a net positive.

# Permanent Monetary Expansion

Permanent policies are not reversed in the near future and therefore do affect the long-term expected exchange rate $E^{e}$ . A permanent monetary expansion leads to an offsetting inﬂation of the price level over the long term and to a proportional depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. If we double money supply $M^{S}$ ,  then ultimately the price level $P$ will double and,  because relative purchasing power parity holds in the long run,  the nominal exchange rate will double The expectation $E^{e}$ doubles momentarily. With a permanent policy we can discern the economic consequences at two time horizons: the short run and the long run.

In the upper left panel of Figure 20.5,  start from the initial equilibrium with a real exchange rate $q_{0}$ and output $Y_{0}$ . Like a temporary monetary expansion,  a permanent monetary expansion increases money supply $M^{S}$ and shifts the QQ schedule up to a new position. The reason is that a higher money supply level,  for any given output $Y$ ,  must be associated with a lower nominal interest rate $R$ and a depreciated spot nominal exchange rate and therefore a depreciated (high) real exchange rate $q$ . Unlike a temporary intervention,  however,  a permanent [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] also changes investors’ expectations about the future nominal exchange rate level $E^{e}$ . Investors change their beliefs within a nanosecond,  faster than any asset price,  and the new expected nominal exchange rate $E^{e}$ has immediate consequences because investors act on their new beliefs. Investors correctly anticipate that,

Figure 20.5: Effects of Permanent Macroeconomic Policies in the Short and Long Run

In the long term,  relative purchasing power parity must be restored. They know that the permanent monetary expansion will result in an equivalent inﬂation of the price level $P$ and an equivalent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate to a devalued future level $E^{e}$ ,  just enough so that the real exchange rate will be back at its long-term level $\bar{q}$ under relative purchasing power parity. As a consequence,  the QQ schedule experiences a double displacement to $Q Q^{\prime},  $ ,  indicated in the graph with a shift beyond the lower red dot (which copies the short-run equilibrium after a temporary monetary shock as in the left panel of Figure 20.4 before.) At the new position of the $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedule the domestic money and bond market is back in equilibrium.

Are we done? What else might change? The price level $P$ is sticky in the short run under our common convention. The other variables ${\cal T},  \,  {\cal I},  \,  {\cal G},  \,  {\cal R}^{*}$ and $P^{*}$ do not respond. What about $q$ and $Y?$ They do respond,  but their changes are reﬂected in moves along the DD and $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedules,  so there is nothing else for us to do. We can simply read off the new equilibrium from the ﬁgure. It is marked with the label SR in the diagram. After the temporary monetary expansion,  the exchange rate has depreciated to a new level $q^{\prime}$ and output expanded to a new level $Y^{\prime}$ . A permanent monetary expansion stimulates the domestic economy through a real exchange rate depreciation,  and does so more strongly than a temporary monetary expansion. In the short $\mathbf{u}\mathbf{m},  $ there is a monetary stimulation in our open-economy model only if relative purchasing power parity breaks down and the real exchange rate level increases to $q^{\prime}$ . That is realistic,  as we have seen in Figure 20.3,  the nominal exchange rate pushes around the real exchange rate one-for-one at a quarterly frequency. So much for the short run.

In the log run,  prices become ﬂexible and the domestic price level increases by the same percentage as the permanent money supply expanded. This price increase between the short run and the long run shifts the $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedule back to its initial position QQ. The lower left panel of Figure 20.5 marks the resulting long-run equilibrium with the label LR. This price inﬂation both fully offsets the initial money supply increase (in the ﬁnancial-market equilibrium equation $P$ matches the earlier $M^{S}$ increase by scali down $L (\cdot),  $ ) and fully offsets the increase in the expected future exchange rate ( $P$ also scales down $E^{e}$ in the equation). The price level increase reduces real money supply $\breve{M}^{S}/P,  $ and raises the interest rate $R$ back to its initial level. At the same time,  the nominal exchange rate appreciates gradually between the short run and the long run,  undoing some of its overshooting. Recall from Chapter 19 that,  after a permanent monetary expansion,  the nominal exchange rate $E$ depreciates more in the short run than it needs to devalue for the long-run equilibrium. The spot exchange rate overshoots the ﬁnal degree of depreciation because sticky prices fail to adjust in the short run. In the long run,  relative purchasing power is restored with the real exchange rate back at ${\bar{q}},  $ because $E$ increases by the same percentage as $P$ in the long-run and $P^{*}$ remains unchanged. Money has no lasting consequence for real relative prices,  so $q$ returns to its relative purchasing power parity level. Consequently,  output is also back at its initial level in the long run,  once the short-run real depreciation fades.

For permanent [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]],  short run effects differ markedly from the long run effects. In the short run,  prices are sticky and relative purchasing power parity breaks down. In the long run,  in contrast,  prices are fully ﬂexible and relative purchasing power parity is restored even after a permanent monetary intervention.

Permanent monetary expansions are an effective policy tool in the short run in an open economy,  and they have no long-run effect. In the recent Great Recession,  central banks in developed economies such as the United States,  Europe,  Great Britain and Sweden have used monetary expansion at liberty. Once their conventional open-market interventions in the domestic bond markets for short maturities had run their course,  the U.S. and British central bankers intervened in bond markets with longer and longer maturities. Their built-up of lasting asset holdings with long maturities is called quantitative easing . The next chapter will have more to say about the rationale. These monetary interventions were designed to last,  and central bankers went to great length explaining the expected duration of their expansion ary monetary conditions to the public,  precisely with the intention to move investor beliefs and expectations. Long-term monetary easing also appears to be a part of the Abenomics package in Japan,  where the Bank of Japan further loosened monetary conditions in 2013. In short,  permanent monetary expansions are a frequent policy choice for stimulation.

# Permanent Fiscal Expansion

A permanent ﬁscal policy is not reversed in the near future and therefore also affects the long-term expected exchange rate $E^{e}$ . For a permanent ﬁscal intervention we can again discern the economic consequences in the short run and in the long run. Economists have different views about the importance of these time periods. John Maynard Keynes cared much about the here and now: “[T]his long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy,  too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is long past the ocean is ﬂat again” (John Maynard Keynes 1924,  p. 80,  emphasis from original print). Abba P. Lerner met Keynes during the 1930 s while Lerner was at the London School of Economics and visited Cambridge University,  where Keynes taught. After moving to the United States,  Lerner beat Keynes’s economic ideas into textbook shape and made them popular in classrooms. Lerner’s take was: “In the long run,  there is just another short run.” 8 The emphasis on short-term management still requires a good understanding of the long-term anchor,  to which the economy tends. It is particularly healthy to look at both time horizons for ﬁscal policy.

In fact,  it is best to start from the long term view,  and then work backwards. The lower right panel of Figure 20.5 depicts the long-term effects of a permanent ﬁscal expansion. Like a temporary ﬁscal expansion,  a permanent ﬁscal expansion increases government spending $G$ (or reduces taxes $T$ ) and shifts the DD schedule to the right to a new position $D D^{\prime}$ . The same $D D^{\prime}$ schedule must also represent a permanent ﬁscal expansion of equal magnitude because no other variable in the real-market equilibrium equation is affected.

What else changes? Under Milton Friedman’s tenet,  by which inﬂation is a purely monetary phenomenon,  the domestic price level $P$ does not move. However,  the permanency of the policy does alter investor beliefs and everybody resets expectations about the long-term nominal exchange rate level $E^{e}$ . Which way? We already know from the short-term effects of a temporary ﬁscal expansion before that the nominal and therefore real exchange rate appreciates. Now the same government intervention is permanent,  and every investor rationally expects that the lasting government demand for additional domestic goods and services raises their relative price compared to foreign goods. In other words,  the real exchange rate must lastingly appreciate,  but the price level $P$ is not changing. Instead,  the nominal exchange rate $E$ must move the real exchange rate to an appreciated (lower) level. Investors therefore rationally reset their expectations $E^{e}$ to an appreciated level. The consequence for the diagram is that the QQ schedule shifts downward: For any given output level,  a reduced $E^{e}$ level in the ﬁnancial-market equilibrium equation must be met by a reduced $q$ so the $Q Q^{\prime}$ schedule must be below the old QQ schedule at every possible level of output.

The resulting long-run equilibrium occurs at the red point marked LR in the lower right panel of Figure 20.5. The output is at its initial level $Y_{0}$ in the long run,  and the real exchange rate is permanently appreciated to a lower level $q^{\prime}$ . The lasting additional government demand for domestic output makes domestic products permanently more valuable compared to foreign ones. The government’s real-side intervention causes relative purchasing power parity to break down temporarily,  but in the long run and beyond relative purchasing power parity holds gain—now for the new $\bar{q}^{\prime}$ level. That’s it for the long run.

What about the short-run effects of a permanent ﬁscal expansion? There were two changes that we had to watch for the long-term outcome,  a change in aggregate demand shifting the DD schedule right to $D D^{\prime}.$ ,  and a change in expectations reducing $E^{e}$ and shifting the QQ schedule down to $Q Q^{\prime}$ . The same two changes must happen in the short run already. The permanent ﬁscal expansion is the policy change,  and investors reset their expectations within a nanosecond. Anything else in the short run? No,  prices are sticky. The other variables I ,  $M^{S}$ ,  $R^{*}$ and $P^{*}$ do not change. What about $q$ and $Y?$ They do respond,  but their changes are reﬂected in moves along the $D D^{\prime}$ and QQ schedules,  so there is nothing else for us to do. The short-run equilibrium must be exactly the same as the long-run equilibrium. The upper right panel of Figure 20.5 marks that insight with the label LR&SR on the red equilibrium point.

A permanent ﬁscal policy is completely ineffective,  both in the short run and in the long run,  because it triggers a strong real exchange rate appreciation that fully offset any domestic stimulus. In an open economy with free currency and capital markets,  a permanent ﬁscal expansion is doomed to bring in an equivalent amount of net imports that completely offset the government spending (or household consumption after a tax cut). In other words,  a permanent ﬁscal expansion at home stimulates only the foreign economy. This is an extreme result and the complete absence of a change in output is partly due to the mechanic nature of our macroeconomic model. However,  the result does suggest more generally that a permanent ﬁscal expansion likely triggers a strong appreciation in the real exchange rate that is bound to largely offset the initial government stimulus.

There could be potentially different short-run and long-run effects from a permanent ﬁscal policy,  but there aren’t. In the short run,  prices are sticky. Relative purchasing power parity breaks down. In the long run,  prices could become fully ﬂexible but,  by Milton Friedman’s tenet,  their changes are a purely monetary phenomenon. Real money demand is unchanged because output remains at $Y_{0}$ and real money supply is ﬁxed,  so prices do not move in the long run either. In the long run,  relative purchasing power parity remains broken in the sense that the real exchange rate permanently changes to a revalued level at $\bar{q}^{\prime}$ . Similar to other real side effects (such as,  for instance,  the Balassa–Samuelson effect in Chapter 15) permanent real side changes lastingly alter the relative price of domestic goods and services in terms of the foreign ones. But relative purchasing power parity does hold in the long term and beyond in the sense that there are no subsequent changes to $\bar{q}^{\prime}$ in the long-run equilibrium.

Our macroeconomic model offers a good reason why policy makers are generally calling for ﬁscal interventions to be targeted and temporary. The offsetting effect of a rapid real appreciation is particularly strong if investors reset their long-term exchange rate expectations. It is therefore preferable to limit ﬁscal expansions in their duration,  so that currency and capital market participants do not pursue strong changes in their long-term positions. While a temporary ﬁscal expansion also suffers a partial offset from a real exchange rate appreciation,  the weaker appreciation merely dampens the success of the stimulus. The foreign exchange market response does not fully eliminate the stimulus from a temporary ﬁscal expansion.

Quite adequately,  many stimulus programs in the Great Recession are temporary. The U.S. Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorized a total of $\ [U.S.\$ 787$ billion in ﬁscal stimulus,  including tax reductions and subsidies for business investment,  three-quarters of which (or $\mathrm{U}.S.\$ 584$ billion) had to be spent by 2010. China’s 2008-09 stimulus plan Ku\`od\`a N\`eix¯u Sh´ıxi\`ang Cu\`osh¯ı committed the country to spend a similar amount,  equivalent to $\mathrm{U.S.\$ 586}$ billion,  also within a short time window until 2010 for rural infrastructure,  transportation,  tax cuts,  business investment,  and similar uses—a remarkable amount given the size of the Chinese economy of only one-third of that in the United States. The elevated levels of Japanese ﬁscal spending throughout the 1990 s and 2000 s,  in contrast,  contributed to a continuously high value of the Japanese currency on foreign exchange markets while Japan’s public debt rose to the current world record level of 214 percent of GDP by 2012,  ahead of Zimbabwe and Greece ranked second and third in public debt per GDP by the CIA World Factbook 2013. Under this perspective,  it may not surprise that the Abenomics package of economic interventions calls for lasting monetary easing that can help devalue the Japanese currency.

# 20.5 External Balance and the Current Account Response at Impact

Grandma and the journalists are right about the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] response to the real exchange rate,  under a certain condition. The condition is known as the Marshall–Lerner condition . The Marshall– Lerner condition has its name from Alfred Marshall,  the 19 th century English economist who became one of the founders of modern microeconomics,  because the condition extends his work on price elastic i ties of demand to foreign trade. The condition is named after Abba P. Lerner because Lerner,  who helped make Keynes a “classroom name” for generations of students,  applied Marshall’s work to the trade balance. The price that matters for the trade balance is the relative price of foreign goods and services in terms of domestic ones—the real exchange rate in our model.

# The Marshall–Lerner Condition

In this chapter,  we take the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] $C A$ as roughly equal to the trade balance,  and the trade balance $T B$ is:

$$
C A\approx T B=E X (\underset{(+)}{q})-q\cdot E X^{*}(\underset{(-)}{q},   Y_{\underset{(+)}{\mathrm{GNI}}}^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T).
$$ 

As you saw before,  the real exchange rate affects the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] in three ways.

First,  if the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates to a higher level (a higher relative price of foreign goods $E P^{*}/P)$ then our exports $E X$ tend to increase because they are in high demand abroad. This ﬁrst effect is a volume effect because the relative price $q$ affects the export quantities. Second,  if the real exchange rate $q$ depreciates then foreign shipments $E X^{*}$ to us tend to fall because they are in low demand here. This second effect is also a volume effect because the relative price $q$ affects our import quantities. The two parts of the volume effect work in the same direction: A real depreciation raises export quantities,  reduces import quantities,  and therefore the combined volume effect raises the trade balance. The volume effect is what grandma and the journalists have in mind.

Third,  being the relative price of foreign goods and services in terms of domestic ones,  the real exchange rate $q$ enters the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance directly: as the relative price that translates foreign exports into their corresponding value in the domestic economy. This third effect purely concerns the relative valuation of foreign goods in terms of domestic ones,  and is therefore called the value effect . The third effect works exactly in the opposite direction from the two parts of the volume effect. If we set any volume effect aside,  then the only consequence of the value effect is to make foreign imports relatively more expensive to domestic residents. The value of the trade balance and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] drops because our gross exports do not pay for as many imports anymore as they used to afford us,  so a real depreciation reduces the value of the trade balance for given volumes of shipments.

What is the net effect of the real exchange rate on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance? It depends on whether grandma and the journalists and their volume effect weighs more than the value effect. The Marshall–Lerner condition is simply a mathematical way to say “it depends”: If the elasticity of the export response to the real exchange rate $(\eta_{\mathrm{Ex}})$ under the “ﬁrst” volume effect plus the elasticity of the import response to the real exchange rate $(\eta_{\mathrm{Ex^{*}}})$ under the “second” volume effect are larger than the one-for-one effect that the relative value has on the value of the trade balance (an elasticity of 1 ),  then grandma and the journalists are right:

$$
\eta_{\mathrm{E}X}+\eta_{\mathrm{E}X^{*}}>1.
$$

Figure 20.6: Time Path of the Current Account after Depreciation

This is the Marshall–Lerner condition. If it is satisﬁed,  that is if the sum of two volume effects dominates the value effect,  then a real depreciation raises the value of the trade balance. Otherwise grandma and the journalists are wrong and a real depreciation reduces the trade balance.

When is the Marshall–Lerner condition satisﬁed? Contracts for exports and imports are signed well in advance of delivery. Suppose it takes six weeks or more for goods to ship overseas,  so trade contracts are written at least six weeks in advance. For all the export contracts that are in force,  the foreigners’ demand elasticity for our exports is zero. Similarly,  for all the import contracts that are in force,  our demand elasticity for imports from abroad is zero. Initially,  therefore only the value effect matters. But a real depreciation makes the foreign clients of our exporters happy to write larger contracts than for just the old quantities: the real depreciation makes our goods relatively less expensive to foreign customers and they order more. In contrast,  the real depreciation makes our domestic residents reluctant to sign up for as large contracts as before: the real depreciation makes foreign goods relatively more expensive to domestic residents and they order less. In short,  as time progresses the volume effects take full force. For grandma and the journalists to be right again,  the Marshall–Lerner condition holds once suf cie ntl y many trade contracts have been rewritten.

Figure 20.6 shows a time path of the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance. The initial [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance is $C A_{0}$ . A real depreciation occurs at time $t_{0}$ in the left panel of the ﬁgure. At impact,  that is at the moment when the real depreciation ﬁrst hits,  there is a pure value effect and the Marshall–Lerner condition fails (grandma and the journalists are wrong). A drop in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance results. From then on,  new trade contracts are gradually written and there is an incipient volume effect that starts lifting the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance up. For a while,  however,  the new [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance will remain below the initial [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance of $C A_{0}$ . Only over time will the volume effect push the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance above its initial level of $C A_{0}$ . Once the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] crosses above its initial level,  we can afﬁrm that the volume effect must be dominating the value effect,  so the Marshall–Lerner condition holds and grandma and the journalists are right. To some,  the adjustment path of the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] looks like the upper-case letter $\mathrm {{}^{\prime\prime}J^{\prime\prime}} $ . Stephen P. Magee (1973) therefore called the adjustment process under an initially failing and subsequently satisﬁed Marshall–Lerner condition the “ J curve .” (You are not alone of you ﬁnd that the process looks more like an upper-case $^{\prime\prime}\!{\cal S},  ^{\prime\prime}$ but the name “S curve” seems to be reserved for the looks of Venus de Milo and other Greek sculptures.)

The implication of the $J$ curve for our QQ-DD model is depicted in the right panel of Figure 20.6. Then the Marshall–Lerner condition fails initially,  the DD schedule slopes downward. Only at a time horizon where the volume effect dominates the value effect is the DD schedule upward sloping.

# The XX Schedule for the Current Account Target

XX schedule down (given $\dot{q.}$ ) with increase of T (right given $Y$ ). In contrast,  autonomous changes in CA (),  such as shocks to tastes are similar effects that move the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] without affecting any variable of our model directly,  displace DD and XX by same magnitude in vertical dimension.

Empirically,  it has been found that trade in goods tends to be inelastic in the short term,  as it takes time to change consuming patterns and trade contracts. Bahmani-Oskoee & Ratha 2004 Thus,  the Marshall Lerner condition is not met,  and a devaluation is likely to worsen the trade balance initially. In the long term,  consumers will adjust to the new prices,  and trade balance will improve. This effect is called the J-curve effect. For example,  assume a country is a net importer of oil and a net producer of ships. Initially,  the devaluation immediately increases the price of oil,  and as consumption patterns remain the same in the short term,  an increased sum is spent on imported oil,  worsening the deﬁcit on the import side. Meanwhile,  it takes some time for the shipbuilder’s sales department to exploit the lower price and secure new contracts. Only the funds acquired from previously agreed contracts,  now devalued by the currency devaluation,  are immediately available,  again worsening the deﬁcit on the export side.

External balance reﬂected in $q$ on the $Y$ axis,  but [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] does depend on $Y$ ,  too. Bring in new schedule to clarify.

- The objective of expansion ary or contraction ary monetary and ﬁscal policies is often the management of the domestic business cycle,  or internal balance. There is also external balance,  however,  or Current Account Targeting. Governments choose to target [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] levels. We introduce XX schedule to discuss external balance: ${\mathit{C A}}^{\mathsf{t a r g e t}}={\mathit{C A}}\left ({\textit{q}},  {\mathit{Y}}-{\mathit{T}}\right)$ − .

Upward sloping because a depreciation of the nominal exchange rate causes a depreciation of the real exchange rate (if PPP fails). A depreciated real exchange rate raises the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (if the value effect is small). Slopes up less steeply than DD schedule because increase in $Y-T$ sets off a multiplier effect through consumption behind the DD curve. So,  E must rise more strongly along DD schedule to guarantee $Y=D (\cdot)$ . • Trade-offs between internal and external balance in Figure 20.7. • Exchange rate effects on trade under gravity: AndersonJ&al 13 Exchange Rate Effects on Trade under Gravity (NBER WP 18807).

- Exchange Rate Pass-Through. The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] only responds to exchange rate changes fully if the prices to consumers and investors reﬂect changes one-for-one. Exchange Rate Pass-Through : Exchange rate changes are completely passed through to ﬁnal consumers and investors. In practice,  pass-through can be incomplete even in the medium to long term. So,  [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] responses can suffer considerable delays. Reasons for incomplete pass-through (a form of price stickiness). Pricing to market by wholesalers and retailers. Domestic distribution costs. Costs of price adjustments to sellers,  possible loss of consumers.

- Time to relate [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] to earlier deﬁnitions of relative prices. Current Account Value and Trade Volumes. The real exchange rate $q$ is the relative price of foreign goods in terms of domestic goods. The real exchange rate $q$ affects trade volumes and [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] values in different ways. Trade volumes: Home exports $E X.$ ,  foreign exports $E X^{*}$ (think of volumes like physical quantities). Current account value in terms of home goods:

$$

$$ 

Because home import value $I M=q\cdot E X^{*}$ . Link back to ToT in trade section.

# Summary

- Economic origins of globalization?
- Two different views on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. In Part III: international savings and investment decisions purely determine [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. Tariffs irrelevant for ﬁnancially determined [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. Tariff affect trade volumes,  but not value of [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. Irrelevance in long run.
- Now in Part IV,  with PPP failing,  completely different view on [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. Rich interactions between trade balance,  [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]],  and ﬁnancial markets.
- Macroeconomic Changes and Their Output Effect. Nominal interest rates,  exchange rates and price levels can affect output in the short term (Prices are slow to adjust and PPP breaks down in the short term). Effects of macroeconomic policies come through their impact on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. Non-ﬁnancial view on the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. So far,  in Part III,  much of the emphasis was on $C A=S-I$ . Savings and investment choices played the dominant role. In Part III,  no consideration for $q$ because taken as constant under relative PPP. Now we consider the ﬂip-side of the coin: $C A\approx E X-I M$ and allow $q$ to vary in the short term (relative PPP unaffected by [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] and in the long term will hold again even after temporary real-side shocks to productivity or demand).
- Aggregate Demand and the Exchange Rate. A short-term model of aggregate demand and the exchange rate. Objective : Investigate the simultaneous effect of policies on the exchange rate and output. Building blocks : (i) Keynesian model of aggregate demand,  (ii) Monetary Approach to the nominal exchange rate $E$ . Similar to IS–LM framework common in closed-economy macroeconomics,  but one key difference in our model: Investment $I$ taken as unaffected by short-term moves in $R$ for simplicity. (Basic relationship between $E$ and aggregate demand unchanged even if $I=I (R-\pi^{e})$ .
- Components of Aggregate Demand simply known quantities from GDP deﬁnition (section 14.2 in Chapter 14). Aggregate demand: Amount of goods and services demanded by households and ﬁrms throughout the world. Aggregate demand consists of four components: Consumption $C_{i}$ ,  Investment demand $I_{s}$ ,  Government demand $G,  $ ,  Current account $C A$ (net foreign demand).
- Macroeconomic policy conducted by country governments. In an open economy,  however,  the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] will respond and transmit some policy impacts abroad. This may mitigate the effectiveness of some policies,  and augment the effectiveness of other policies. The assumptions of our model in this Part imply that,  in an open macro economy,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] by the central bank becomes more effective. Fiscal policy by the government,  in contrast,  becomes less effective than in autarky (the closed economy).

# Mathematical Appendix 20. I: Derivation of the $Q Q,  $ ,  DD and XX Schedules

Implicit Function Theorem to derive slopes of QQ,  DD and XX schedules. Consider the equilibrium equation $F (X,   Y)=0$ . Implicit Function Theorem:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}Y}{\mathrm{d}X}\bigg|_{\mathrm{F}(X,   Y)\,  =\,   0}=-\,  \frac{\partial F (X,   Y)/\partial X}{\partial F (X,   Y)/\partial Y}.
$$ 

(A useful tool derive the response of one variable $Y$ to a change in another variable $X$ ,  requiring that the equilibrium relationship is being restored.) Taking the total differential of $F (X,   Y)=0$ yields the statement of the theorem because

$$
\frac{\partial F (X,   Y)}{\partial X}\mathbf{d}X+\frac{\partial F (X,   Y)}{\partial Y}\mathbf{d}Y=0.
$$ 

XX Schedule: $C A^{\mathbf{target}}$ restoration through $\mathrm{d}E$ after $\mathrm{d}Y$ shock. XX schedule: $C A^{\mathrm{target}}=C A (Y,   E P^{*}/P)$ . Total differentiation of $\mathrm{XX}$ equation with respect to $E$ and $Y$ yields

$$
0={\frac{\partial C A}{\partial Y}}\,  \mathsf{d}Y+{\frac{\partial C A}{\partial q}}{\frac{P^{*}}{P}}\,  \mathsf{d}E
$$ 

Or

$$
\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}Y}\right|_{\scriptscriptstyle\mathrm{X}\!\mathrm{X}}=-\,  \frac{\partial C A/\partial Y}{(\partial C A/\partial q)\cdot (P^{*}/P)}>0.
$$ 

DD Schedule. DD equilibrium restoration through $\mathrm{d}E$ after $\mathrm{d}Y$ shock. DD sched e: $Y\,  =\,   C\,   (Y\,  -$ $T)\,  +\,  \bar{I}\,  +\,   G\,  +\,   C A\,   (\bar{q}\,   Y-T)$ . Total differentiation of DD equation with respect to E and $Y$ yields

$$
\mathbf{d}Y={\frac{\partial C}{\partial Y}}\,  \mathbf{d}Y+{\frac{\partial C A}{\partial Y}}\,  \mathbf{d}Y+{\frac{\partial C A}{\partial q}}{\frac{P^{*}}{P}}\,  \mathbf{d}E
$$ 

Or

$$
\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}Y}\right|_{\mathrm{\tiny{DD}}}=-\,  \frac{-(1\!-\!\partial C/\partial Y)+\partial C A/\partial Y}{(\partial C A/\partial q)\cdot (P^{*}/P)}>\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}Y}\right|_{\mathrm{\tiny{XX}}}>0.
$$ 

QQ Schedule: QQ equilibrium restoration through $\mathrm{d}E$ after $\mathrm{d}Y$ shock. Q sch dule: $M^{S}\,  =\,   P$ · $L\left (R^{*}+E^{e}/E-1\,   Y\right)$ . Total differentiation of QQ equation with respect to E and $Y$ yields

$$
0=-P\frac{\partial L}{\partial R}\frac{E^{e}}{E^{2}}\,  \mathrm{d}E+P\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}\,  \mathrm{d}Y
$$ 

Or

$$
\left.\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}Y}\right|_{\mathrm{QQ}}=-\,  \frac{-(\partial L/\partial R)\cdot (E^{e}/E^{2})}{\partial L/\partial Y}<0.
$$ 

All these derivations are instances of the Implicit Function Theorem.

Derivation of Marshall–Lerner Condition. Current Account Response to Real Depreciation. Current account balance: $C A (q)\,  =\,   E X (q)\,  -\,   q\,  \cdot\,   E X^{*}(q)$ . Total differentiation of $C A$ with respect to $q$ yields

$$
\mathrm{d}C A=\frac{\partial E X}{\partial q}\mathbf{d}q-q\cdot\frac{\partial E X^{*}}{\partial q}\mathbf{d}q-E X^{*}(q)\mathrm{d}q
$$ 

Or

$$
\begin{array}{r c l} {{\displaystyle{\frac{{\bf d}C A}{{\bf d}q}} }}& {{=}} & {{\displaystyle{\frac{\partial E X}{\partial q}} -q\cdot\frac{\partial E X^{*}}{\partial q}-E X^{*}(q)}}\\ {{}} & {{=}} & {{\displaystyle{\left[\frac{\partial E X/\partial q}{q\cdot E X^{*}/q}-\frac{\partial E X^{*}/\partial q}{E X^{*}/q}-1\right]\cdot E X^{*}} }}\\ {{}} & {{=}} & {{\displaystyle{\left[\eta\cdot\frac{E X}{I M}+\eta^{*}-1\right]\cdot E X^{*}} .}}\end{array}
$$ 

So,  ${\mathsf{d}C A}/{\mathsf{d}q}>0$ iff $\begin{array}{r}{\eta\cdot\frac{E X}{I M}+\eta^{*}>1}\end{array}$ · . Volume effect dominates value effect if (and only if)

$$

# Mathematical Appendix 20. II: Comparison Between the QQ–DD,  IS–LM and AA–DD Models

The QQ–DD model is a four-equation system at heart. The difference to other models does not lie in the use of these four equations. In fact,  other known models rely on the same basic equations. A predecessor of modern macroeconomics is John Maynard Keynes’s (1936) book The general theory of employment,  interest and money . John R. Hicks (1937) ﬁrst translated the insights by Keynes (1936) into today’s standard IS–LM model (Investment–Savings IS and Liquidity Preference–Money Supply IS– LM model). A version of the same four-equation system for the open macro economy is the AA–DD model from Paul R. Krugman,  Maurice Obstfeld and Marc J. Melitz (2011).

Behind the QQ schedule are three equations. First,  money market equilibrium,  by which real money supply $M^{S}/P$ equals the liquidity preference (or real money demand) $L (\cdot)$ :

$$
M^{S}=P\cdot L (R,   Y_{(+)}^{\mathrm{GNI}}).
$$ 

Second,  foreign exchange market equilibrium,  in which we require the uncovered interest parity condition (UIP) to be satisﬁed:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{R=R^{*}+(E^{e}-E)/E=R^{*}+E^{e}/E-1.}\end{array}
$$ 

Third,  the deﬁnition of the real exchange rate:

$$
q=E P^{*}/P.
$$ 

Behind the DD is one equation for real-side equilibrium,  by which output must be the same as aggregate demand if output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ approximately equals real income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ in the open economy:

$$
\begin{array}{r c l} {{Y^{\mathrm{GDP}} \approx Y^{\mathrm{GIN}}}}& {{=}} & {{C(Y^{\mathrm{GIN}} -T)+I (R-\pi^{e})+G+C A\underset{(+)}{(\textit{q},   Y^{\mathrm{GIN}}-T)}}}\\ {{}} & {{=}} & {{D(\underset{(+)}{q},  Y^{\mathrm{GDP}} -T,   R-\pi^{e},  \underset{(+)}{G}).}}\end{array}
$$ 

These four equations can be grouped into different diagrams and curves. All three models—QQ– DD,  IS–LM and AA–DD— depict output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ on the horizontal axis of the main diagram,  but they differ on the vertical axis. The main QQ–DD diagram shows the real exchange rate $q$ on the vertical axis,  the IS–LM diagram shows the nominal interest rate $R$ on the vertical axis,  and the AA–DD diagram the nominal exchange rate $E$ . The three model therefore have to combine the main four equations in different ways. Table 20.2 shows for each one of the equations above how they enter the different schedules in the three models.

The QQ–DD model takes a $q-Y$ perspective on the open macro economy and the two main schedules combine the above four equations in the following way:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{QQ:}\quad}& {{}M^{S}=P\cdot L(R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)-1,  Y^{\mathrm{GDP}} )}\\ {\mathrm{DD:}\quad}& {{}Y^{\mathrm{GDP}} =D (q,   Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}\!-\! T,  \bar{I},   G),  }\end{array}
$$ 

Where $\bar{I}$ is not allowed to vary with $R$ . In the QQ–DD model,  the responses of $R$ and $E$ are left in the background to bring the real exchange rate $q$ to the foreground.

Suppose we wanted to complete the QQ–DD model and did let investment $I (R-\pi^{e})$ vary negatively with the expected real interest rate $r^{e}=R-\pi^{e}$ as in the IS–LM model. For the QQ–DD model

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/aacb914932ecd8341b13441c86796ebf65b939fa995fcd8682ad6c2f03b2265f.jpg)

With the real exchange rate $q$ on the vertical axis,  we need to express the nominal interest rate $R$ as a function of the real exchange rate $q$ and can use $R=R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)$ similar to the ﬁnancial market equilibrium condition. Investment then varies positively with the real exchange rate $q$ because investment is negatively related to $R,  $ and $R$ is negatively related to $q$ . The consequence is that aggregate demand now positively depends on the real exchange rate for two reasons: an increase in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance (if the Marshall–Lerner condition holds so that grandma and the journalists are right) and an increase in investment. We get an even more responsive $\mathrm{DD^{\prime}}$ schedule to changes in the real exchange rate,  compared to the DD schedule before,  but qualitative results do not change. The full QQ–DD ′ model becomes

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{QQ:}\quad}&{M^{S}=P\cdot L (R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P^{*}/P)-1,   Y^{\mathrm{GDP}})}\\ {\mathrm{DD^{\prime}}\!:\quad}&{Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D (\underset{(+)}{q},   Y_{\mathrm{\tiny~\Phi~}(+)}^{\mathrm{GDP}}\!-\! T,   R^{*}+(E^{e}/q)(P_{\mathrm{\tiny~\Phi~}(-)}^{*}\!/P)-1-\pi^{e},  \underset{(+)}{G}).}\end{array}
$$ 

The DD ′ schedule now also depends on the monetary variables $E^{e},  \,   P,  \,   P^{*},  \,   R^{*},  \,  \pi^{e}$ . This is a realistic extension,  but the qualitative predictions of the model are the same as before—a good reason to skip the complications.

The IS–LM model prefers an $R-Y$ perspective on the domestic macro economy and the two main schedules combine the above four equations in the following way:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} {{\mathrm{LM}} {:}\quad}&{M^{S}=P\cdot L (R,   Y^{\mathrm{GDP}})}\\ {{\mathrm{IS}} {:}\quad}&{Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D ([E^{e}/(1+R-R^{*})](P^{*}/P),  Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}{-}T,  R-\pi^{e},  G),  }\end{array}
$$ 

Replacing the real exchange rate with its deﬁnition $q\,  =\,   E P^{*}/P$ in the IS equation and using UIP to then replace the nom al exchange rate with $E\,  =\,   E^{e}/(1+R-R^{*})$ in terms of $R$ . In th IS–LM model,  the responses of E and $q$ are left in the background to bring the nominal interest rate R to the foreground.

The AA–DD model adopts an $E-Y$ perspective on the open macro economy and the two main schedules combine the above four equations in the following way:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{AA}{:}\quad}&{M^{S}=P\cdot L (R^{*}+E^{e}/E-1,   Y^{\mathrm{GDP}})}\\ {\mathrm{DD^{\prime\prime}}{:}\quad}&{Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=D (E\cdot P^{*}/P,   Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}{-}T,  \bar{I},   G),  }\end{array}
$$ 

Replacing the real exchange rate with its deﬁnition $q\,  =\,   E P^{*}/P$ in the $\mathrm{D}\mathrm{D^{\prime\prime}}$ equation. Now a ﬂexible price level $P$ in the long run shifts both the AA and the $\mathrm{D}\mathrm{D^{\prime\prime}}$ schedule. In the AA–DD model,  the responses of $R$ and $q$ are left in the background to bring the nominal exchange rate $E$ to the foreground.

The advantage of the QQ–DD diagram over the IS–LM presentation is that the real exchange rate plays the key role. In the globalized macro economy,  the real exchange rate permits a direct relation of the equilibrium outcome to the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] and to external balance,  while domestic output $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ already reﬂects internal balance. There are mainly two beneﬁts of the QQ–DD diagram over the AA–DD presentation. First,  in the long-run when prices become ﬂexible,  inﬂation and deﬂation only shift the QQ and not the DD schedule. This restriction clariﬁes that price adjustment is a monetary phenomenon and simpliﬁes the long-term analysis. Second,  the real exchange rate changes in the short run because purchasing power parity breaks down. Showing $q$ on the vertical axis,  the QQ– DD diagram illuminates how purchasing power parity is then restored for the long run. The QQ– DD representation also condenses in a visible way how Part IV of this book differs from Part III,  where purchasing power parity used to be satisﬁed in general so that money could be ignored for equilibrium outcomes.
