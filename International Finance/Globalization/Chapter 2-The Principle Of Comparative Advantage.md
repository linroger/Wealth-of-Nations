# Chapter 2-The Principle Of Comparative Advantage

[[Chapter 2-The Principle Of Comparative Advantage|Comparative Advantage]]

Imagine a place that grows avocados,  strawberries,  lemons,  and almonds all at lower prices than anywhere else in the world. The same place also makes motorcycles,  skateboards,  laptops,  and mobile apps. Whatever it makes is more competitively priced than in any other country. Should this place trade its products with other people around the world? After all,  no growers and manufacturers elsewhere can match the imaginary place's prices. Moreover,  what goods would other suppliers around the globe have to offer since it appears they would have little chance to compete?

As it turns out,  a solid economic answer to these questions has been known for two centuries and reconfirmed again and again ever since: It would be foolish for the residents of the imaginary place—and equally foolish for residents everywhere else in the world—not to trade with other people and firms abroad. Economies will,  and should,  globalize.

## 2.1 THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

What insights from the social sciences are both true and nontrivial? Paul A. Samuelson,  one of the first professors in the social sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Nobel Prizewinning economist,  once recounted his meetings with the mathematician and scientist Stanislaw Ulam at Harvard University. Ulam used to tease Samuelson with the challenge: "Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and nontrivial" (Paul A. Samuelson 1969,  p. 9). As long as Samuelson failed to come up with one example,  Ulam's challenge meant that all findings in the social sciences had to be either trivial,  or wrong. Years later,  Samuelson got an answer:

The principle of **comparative advantage**. The principle states that trade benefits every country even if one country is absolutely more productive at every single activity.

The principle of comparative advantage is not new. An early economist to formulate the principle was David Ricardo. Ricardo did so in his book *On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation*,  published in 1817. Almost two centuries have passed since then. The principle still holds true. It is the driving force behind globalization and,  in fact,  any economic exchange. Is it trivial?

In 1817,  few people had heard of **globalization**. The term only came into wide use during the

1990 s. Even today people familiar with globalization are either unfamiliar with the principle of comparative advantage or misunderstand it. Often they confuse it with the concepts of absolute advantage or competitiveness. As you will learn shortly,  those concepts are different. You may wonder how globalization can be beneficial if jobs are lost because of lower labor cost abroad or more advanced production elsewhere. What makes the principle of comparative advantage difficult to apply is that it requires us to make a **double comparison**.

Let's return to the imaginary place we were discussing. It looks a lot like California. The Golden State is blessed with a climate where avocados,  citrus fruit,  almonds,  and strawberries grow almost by themselves. The state is also one of the most innovative places to live in—one where the latest apps for your smart phone are being developed and state-of-the-art skateboards,  mountain bikes,  custom motorcycles,  even flying bikes to hover over desert soil are dreamed up and made. 1 Why trade with any other place?

What about Mexico? Should Mexico trade with California? Should California trade with its southern neighbor? Mexico is also blessed with a climate that sustains a strong agricultural industry,  and the country hosts a successful manufacturing industry from which major global constructionmaterials and telecommunications companies have emerged. Nevertheless,  the average earnings for Californian workers far exceed those of Mexican workers. The income per person in Mexico is roughly one-third of that in California.

As an example,  suppose California's workers produce only two goods. They either manufacture

100,  000 motorcycles or grow 10 million avocados,  or a mix of the two. Suppose that Mexico's workers produce only two goods. They either manufacture 30,  000 motorcycles or grow 9 million avocados,  or a mix of the two. Should both economies produce both goods?

Note that in this example,  California produces more of each good,  even though its workforce is smaller. (This would help explain why California's residents earn higher incomes.) In short,  California's economy has an *absolute advantage* when it comes to producing either one of the goods. 2

The fact that California has an absolute advantage does not mean that trading with Mexico is a bad idea. The principle of *comparative* advantage teaches us to ignore absolute differences. What matters is that California is *relatively* more productive in some activities than it is in others. This is where the double comparison comes in. Not only do we need to compare the production of goods between the two countries,  we also need to look at the production of each good relative to the other within each country.

Let's do that now. For every motorcycle California makes,  it has to give up 100 avocados. (Divide

10 million avocados by 100,  000 motorcycles; that gives you 100 avocados per motorcycle.) In other words,  a motorcycle costs 100 avocados in California. (If you find motorcycles too cheap in this example,  perhaps you can think of 100 pounds of Avocados for a motor scooter.) How many avocados do Mexicans have to give up for one locally made motorcycle? The answer is,  in Mexico 300 avocados buy one motorcycle. In short,  California is *relatively* more productive in motorcycle manufacturing. It costs fewer avocados per motorcycle in California to make a motorcycle. Thus,  Mexico is relatively more productive in avocado growing. This is all that will matter for the reasons for trade (our first theme),  the patterns of trade (our second theme),  and the welfare gains from trade (our third theme).

Now suppose both economies open up to trade. What should they do? What exactly does the principle of comparative advantage want them to do? For the answer,  it is useful to more precisely define comparative advantage. To do this,  let's introduce the idea of **opportunity cost**.

The opportunity cost is the cost of obtaining a good,  measured in terms of all other goods that one has to forego to get the good.

In other words,  there's no such thing as a free lunch. If Californians want to ride more motorcycles,  they got to give up some of their other goods; avocados in our example. How many exactly? For every additional Californian motorcycle made,  100 avocados are foregone and not grown in California. Similarly,  for every additional Mexican motorcycle made,  300 avocados are foregone and not grown in Mexico. The opportunity cost of motorcycle production is the foregone production of avocados.

Now that we have defined the concept of opportunity cost precisely,  we can define the principle of comparative advantage more precisely too:

A country has a comparative advantage in producing a good if the economy's opportunity cost of doing so is lower than it is in the rest of the world.

Let's use our example to put the principle of comparative advantage to work. Because California has a lower opportunity cost of producing motorcycles in terms of avocados compared to Mexico,  the two countries should specialize: California should solely make motorcycles,  and Mexico should allocate all its workers to avocado growing. If the countries do that and then trade what they make,  both economies will be better off.

You can see why this is so by looking at Table 2.1. First,  pick a reasonable price that will prevail after free trade. Prior to trading,  in California an avocado was worth 1/100 of a motorcycle. In Mexico,  an avocado was worth 1/300 of a motorcycle. The midpoint price of 1/200 of a motorcycle per avocado will do once we allow the two economies to trade. (You will see in later chapters how we can derive the exact price if we know the global relative demand for the goods; it is generally true that the relative world price must be somewhere between the two countries' opportunity costs.)

![|500](Pasted%20image%2020240217091320.png)

Note: All output measured in terms of avocados for comparison. Trade price set at midpoint between opportunity costs.

Let's measure the size of the two economies. We can use avocados as the common unit to measure an economy's size and overall income. California can grow 10 million avocados by devoting all of its workforce to agriculture. Mexico can grow 9 million avocados by devoting all of its workforce to agriculture. Since avocados are our unit of measurement,  we can therefore state that California's gross domestic product (GDP) is 100 million avocados,  and Mexico's GDP is 9 million avocados. However,  because they have the opportunity to trade with Mexico,  California's workers now only make 100,  000 motorcycles and produce no avocados. Nonetheless,  the state's GDP remains the same because producing 100,  000 motorcycles is equivalent to producing 10 million avocados. (Recall that an avocado buys 1/100 of a motorcycle in California.)

California's residents don't want to buy just motorcycles,  though. They also want to consume avocados. Say Californians export 30,  000 motorcycles to Mexico (out of the 100,  000 motorcycles they make) and import in exchange 6 million avocados at a free-trade price of 1/200 of a motorcycle per avocado. What is that consumption level worth to Californians? At the old price of 1/100 of a motorcycle per avocado in California,  the 70,  000 motorcycles Californians buy (100,  000 made minus 30,  000 exported) are worth 7 million avocados. And 6 million avocados come in as imports from Mexico. The two groups of goods consumed in California—70,  000 motorcycles and 6 million imported avocados—are worth the equivalent of 13 million avocados. That's an amazing 30 million *more* avocados than the 10 million avocados California can get out of its economy when closed. These 3 million extra avocados are California's gains from trade.

Does Mexico lose? No. Recall that Mexicans import 30,  000 motorcycles from California in exchange for 6 million avocados. That leaves 3 million avocados for local consumption (9 million that the country produced minus 6 million it exported). At the old Mexican price of 1/300 of a motorcycle per avocado,  the 30,  000 motorcycles imported are worth the same as 9 million avocados. In addition,  3 million avocados remain in Mexico for residents to consume. Consequently,  the residents there get to consume the equivalent of 12 million avocadoes with free trade. That is also 3 million avocados more than Mexicans used to have when Mexico was closed to trade. Wow. Both economies now

Provide their residents with extra consumption. Yet there was no innovation and no change in the productivity of either economy—just the magic of free trade. Specialization and trade are clearly a win-win proposition in this example.

In summary,  if each economy exports the goods in which it has a comparative advantage,  then all globalized economies gain from trade. *Comparative* advantage,  but not absolute advantage,  determines whether free trade is beneficial. Opportunity costs measure comparative advantage. How can we generalize these insights,  and what ensures countries trade to their benefit? The following two sections look at these questions.

You might be wondering if our example is realistic. After all,  Mexico doesn't just export agricultural products. It exports many other products,  including durable consumer goods and automotive parts. California sells numerous agricultural products to Mexico. In the big scheme of things,  however,  our example is not that far from reality. Have a look at Table 2.2. The final column shows that in 2010 more than two-thirds of the world's exports were manufactured products,  more than one-fifth were fuels and mining products,  and less than one-tenth were agricultural products. Now compare North America and South America to the worldwide average. North America includes Canada,  the United States and Mexico,  plus Bermuda. By the convention of the World Trade Organization (WTO),  South America includes all land south of Mexico,  starting with Central America,  then the Caribbean,  and all the way south to Cape Horn. North America's exports look a lot like the world average,  except with somewhat fewer fuels and minerals exported. In contrast,  South America exports mostly agricultural products—which is more than triple the world average—and exports less than a third of the world-average share of manufactured products. Mexico belongs to both Latin America,  sharing the Spanish language with many other countries south of the Rio Grande,  and to North America. Perhaps not surprisingly,  Mexico's comparative advantage pattern is somewhere between that of South America and the United States. In that sense,  an example with avocado cultivation south of the Rio Grande and the manufacture of motorcycles north of the Rio Grande is not unrealistic.

The comparisons we just made based on Table 2.2 also suggest how we could construct a measure of comparative advantage: compare the export shares of individual economies by product group to those shares in the world as a whole. That is a double comparison,  first among industries within a region,  then between regions. We will return to this idea towards the end of this chapter.

You might wonder whether we should rather use China as an example because it is the world's second largest economy and the world's top exporter. China sells far more to the rest of the world than it imports. You can already catch a glimpse of the imbalance in Table 2.2. Asia exported merchandize worth US$4.7 trillion in 2010,       far more than double the amount of North America's$2 trillion exports. A more detailed tabulation than that in Table 2.2 shows that of Asia's total exports,  $800 million went to North America (and$2.5 trillion remained in Asia). But of North America's total exports only$413 million went to Asia (and$960 million remained in North America). That left North America with a trade deficit of$383 million with Asia in 2010. Asia's total trade surplus with the rest of the world was$393 million,  almost all of which went to North America. North America's total trade deficit was even larger at$591 million in 2010. This trade *imbalance* is an issue that we will discuss in Part III of this book. In Parts I and II,  we will assume that trade is *balanced*,  which,  as you will see,  is a good approximation of the long term.

## 2.2 AN ECONOMY'S PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES

An economy's **production possibilities** play a crucial role in determining its comparative advantage. Instead of specific numbers,  from now on and frequently throughout this book we will use variables. Each variable will be assigned a letter. Two conventions are useful,  and both will stay with us throughout the remainder of the book. We will define each domestic industry's unit labor requirement a and then derive each economy's resulting production possibilities. As it will turn out,  this perspective is just another way to figure out each economy's opportunity cost of production,  which then lets us determine its comparative advantage. The benefit of taking this longer route to our final results is that we can relate the main concepts back to basic principles of production.

Productivity is one of the basic principles of production:

An industry is productive if it requires little input for its output.

By some historical accident in the international economics profession,  it has become common to formalize this idea with the notion of the **unit labor requirement**:

An industry i's unit labor requirement ai is the number of hours of labor needed to produce one unit of product i.

From now on,  the unit labor requirement for product i will be denoted with the variable ai. Admittedly,  this is a convoluted definition to characterize the labor productivity of a local industry. If the unit labor requirement is a high number,  that means the industry's labor productivity is weak: It takes many work hours to get one unit of output done. Conversely,  if the unit labor requirement is a low number,  it implies that the industry's labor productivity is strong: It does not take many hours of work to get a unit of output produced. In mathematical terms,  the unit labor requirement is the inverse of an industry's labor productivity. Once we determine the industry's production possibilities,  you will see that unit labor requirements are a useful construct because they are directly related to opportunity costs.

Variables are more general than specific numbers. But we can always assign specific numbers to the variables if we want to. Consistent with our example in the previous section 2.1,  we can choose for Mexico

- Avocados:$a^*_A =0.\1,       12$minutes of labor needed per avocado,
- Motorcycles:$a^∗_M = 60,       60$hours labor needed per motorcycle,
 And For California

- Avocados:$a_A =0.\1,       10.8$minutes of labor needed per avocado,
- Motorcycles:$a_M = 18,       18$hours labor needed per motorcycle.
The variables for Mexico receive an asterisk. The convention throughout this book will be that the home economy's variables receive no asterisk,  but the foreign economy's variables do get asterisks.

In the example from the previous section,  we said California was more productive growing avocados as well as producing motorcycles. Do the unit labor requirements match the example? Yes they do. It only takes 10.8 minutes of labor input per avocado in California versus 12 minutes in Mexico. And,  it only takes 18 hours to get a motorcycle made in California versus 60 hours in Mexico.

California has an absolute advantage in both production activities.

How do we arrive at the economy's output? In our example,  we said California could either manufacture 100,  000 motorcycles or grow 10 million avocados,  or a mix of the two,  and Mexico could either manufacture 30,  000 motorcycles or grow 9 million avocados,  or a mix of the two. To get to the unit labor requirements,  we need to specify each economy's total resources$\bar{L}$. For example,

$\bar{L}$= 1,  800,  000 in Mexico means that Mexico has a total labor supply of 1,  800,  000 worker hours.

If Mexico allocates all its workers to motorcycle production,  then it can make as many as 30,  000

Motorcycles: 1,  800,  000/60 =$\bar{L}$/a∗

M = 30,  000 motorcycles. Alternatively,  Mexico can allocate all its labor to avocado growing: 1,  800,  000/. 2 =$\bar{L}$/a∗

A = 10,  000,  000 avocados. For simplicity,  let's make California's economy the same size as Mexico. If California's labor force is also$\bar{L}$∗ = 1,  800,  000,  then the state gets to make at most 100,  000 motorcycles or grow at most 10 million avocados. (Concept check C 2.1 asks you to modify California's unit labor requirements when California has one-third of Mexico's workforce in the example. As you will see,  this modification does not change any of the following insights; so let's keep matters simple with two equally large economies.)

What we have just done,  without much ado about it,  is derive the end points of each economy's Production Possibility Frontier (PPF):

The Production Possibility Frontier shows the maximum amount of one good that an economy can produce for any given amount of the other good (s) produced.

The PPF for Mexico in our example is given by the equation

$$\begin{array}{r c l} {{a_{A}^{*}\cdot Q_{A}^{*}+a_{M}^{*}\cdot Q_{M}^{*}} }= \bar{L}^{*},       \\0.\1\cdot Q_{A}^{*}+ 60\cdot Q_{M}^{*} =  {{1,      800,      000,      }} \end{array}$$

where$Q_A^*$is Mexico's output of avocado and$Q_M^*$is its output of motorcycles. The product$a_A^*\cdot Q_A^*$is Mexico's employment in avocado growing,  and$a_M^*\cdot Q_M^*$is Mexico's employment in motorcycle manufacturing. Suppose Mexico chooses to make no motorcycles,  then$Q_M^* = 0$and$Q_A^* = \bar{L} /a_M^* =$1,  800,  000/60=30,  000 motorcycles,  the extreme production possibility we saw before. Now let's look at a less extreme production mix. Suppose Mexico is still a closed economy with no trade and its residents are happy with a production of just 15,  000 motorcycles. How many avocados can Mexico's labor force produce at most now? To make 15,  000 motorcycles,  $a_M^*\cdot Q_M^*=60\cdot15,      000=900,      000$workers must be allocated to motorcycle manufacturing. The remaining workers,  another 900,  000,  are then employed in agriculture. At a unit labor requirement of$a_A^*=$,  the agricultural workers can grow exactly 4.5 million avocados (900,  000/=4,  500,  000).

![|500](CleanShot%202024-02-17%20-000493@2x.png)

In summary,  if Mexico's economy completely specializes in the production of avocados,  then it can make 9 million of them. If the economy completely specializes in the production of motorcycles,  then it can make 30,  000 of them. An intermediate production possibility would be for Mexico to produce 4.5 million avocados and 15,  000 motorcycles. Another intermediate production possibility would be to produce 3 million avocados and 20,  000 motorcycles. The latter two examples are referred to as cases of *incomplete specialization*.

The left panel in Figure 2.1 depicts Mexico's production possibility frontier with a straight line from$L^*/a_A^*$on the vertical$Q_A$axis down to$L^* /a_M^*$on the horizontal$Q_M$axis. As you move along the PPF,  you can map out all the possible combinations of avocado output and motorcycle output. These are production mixes without any waste. Of course,  the economy can also make any combination of avocados and motorcycles below the PPF. But that would not be efficient. Some resources in the economy would remain idle and Mexico would unnecessarily produce less than the maximum amount of the two products it is able to make.

The PPF reflects all the concepts we discussed so far. The unit labor requirements$a_A^*$and$a_M^*$determine the end points and therefore the position of the PPF as well as its slope. In fact,  the slope is another fundamental of the economy. The slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost of motorcycles in terms of avocadoes. More generally:

The slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost of the product on the horizontal$x$-axis in terms of the product on the vertical$y$-axis.

This idea is depicted with the small triangle below the PPF. One step to the right along the PPF results in one extra motorcycle,  and for that$a_M^*/a_A^*$steps down are needed,  which means avocado production must be reduced by$a_M^*/a_A^*.$

Here is an algebraic way to compute the slope: Note that one more motorcycle requires$a_M^*$extra units of labor,  and one unit of labor taken out of the agricultural sector reduces Mexico's output of avocados by$1/a_A^*.$As a result,  one more motorcycle takes out$a_M^*/a_A^*$avocados. There is also a geometric way to compute the slope. Note that the small triangle below the PPF,  which indicates its slope,  is similar to the large triangle that runs from the point$L^*/a_A^*$on the vertical$Q_A$axis to the origin and over to the point$L^*/a_M^*$on the horizontal$Q_M$axis. The length of the vertical side of this large triangle is$L^*/a_A^*.$Divide this length by the length of the horizontal side of the triangle$L^*/a_M^*$to find:$(L^*/a_A^*)/(L^*/a_M^*)=a_M^*/a_A^*$after cancelling$L^*$from the ratio. Whichever way you prefer to derive it,  the slope of the PPF is therefore$a_M^*/a_A^*.$In the example,  this slope is 9 million avocados per 30,  000 motorcycles,  or 300/1.

California's PPF is$$

\begin{array}{rcl}a_A\cdot Q_A+a_M\cdot Q_M=\bar{L},  \\\cdot Q_A+18\cdot Q_M=1,  800,  000,  \end{array}

$$
and the right panel in Figure 2.1 depicts California's PPF. In the example,       its slope is 10 million avocados per 100,      000 motorcycles,       or 100/1.

Now comes the double comparison. We have already compared the two industries to each othen within each economy and found the opportunity cost of motorcycle production in terms of avocados to be 300/1 in Mexico. In California it is 100/1. That is the first comparison. For the second comparison,       we need to contrast the two opportunity costs in both economies. The opportunity cost of producing motorcycles relative to avocados is lower in California than it is in Mexico (100/1 versus 300/1). More generally,       the slope of the PPF for these two goods in California is flatter than it is for Mexico,       so California has a comparative advantage in the good on the horizontal axis,       motorcycles.
It can be hard to measure opportunity costs. Later in this chapter,       we will introduce an indirect way to assess the comparative advantage of a region's industries. In a closed economy however,       it is straightforward to find the opportunity costs of any good. A good's opportunity costs are simply equal to its relative price when the economy is closed. In the Ricardian model,       the price of a good is its production cost: $P_i=a_iw$,       where $w$ is the wage rate. One unit of good $i$ requires $a_i$ units of labor input,       which cost $a_iw.$ Dividing the production costs of motorcycles by the production costs of avocados then yields the relative price of motorcycles in terms of the other goods: $P_M/P_A=$ $(a_Mw)/(a_Aw)=a_M/a_A.$

A good's relative price in a closed economy is equal to its opportunity costs. The problem is,       of course,       that hardly any economy is truly closed to foreign transactions and then opens up. One of the few exceptions is perhaps Japan,       which in 1639 formally prohibited all contact and trade between its residents and outsiders. The arrangement lasted for more than 200 years. Daniel M. Bernhofen and John C. Brown (2004) used Japan's far-reaching opening to international trade in the 1860s to test the principle of comparative advantage. Utilizing data on prices in the closed economy and on laten trade flows,       Bernhofen and Brown found that prices and trade satisfied the predictions of the theory in every year.

## 2.3 FUNDAMENTALS OF THE MODEL

Economics is a social science that follows a specific method. To make sure all of the statements and their origins are clear,       we first set forth the basic assumptions that underlie an explanation or theory.

This book calls those basic assumptions the **fundamentals** of the economy. The fundamentals are the main "ingredients" of the model. By design,       no model is complete. A complete model would be like a map of the world with a scale of 1:1. Such a map would be comprehensive but quite useless to you as a guide. A model simplifies the set of ingredients and omits many aspects,       just as a map is drawn at a scale of 1:1,      000 or 1:24,      000.

Whenever we introduce a formal model in this book,       a list of the fundamentals underlying the model will come first. All of the results of the model will strictly follow from those fundamentals:
Once the assumptions are in place,       the derivations prove that the conclusions are inevitable. The clear benefit of this method is that it leaves itself open to only two forms of criticism. First,       one could object to the restrictiveness or lack of relevance of the model's assumptions,       which could mean that a more general model is called for. In a more general model,       some of the more restrictive assumptions would be relaxed and other relevant ones would be added. Second,       a person could empirically test the model's assumptions or predictions and use the failures of the model to design a more realistic and complete theory. This book will do both. We will gradually relax assumptions as we go along and see where new assumptions lead us. Typically,       they reconfirm the principle of comparative advantage in new ways. The book will also discuss empirical tests of the models.

The fundamentals of the Ricardian model,       which is a classical model of trade used by many economists,       are now familiar to you: the key fundamental is the unit labor requirement of each local industry,       which is fixed. In this model,       labor is the only factor of production,       and workers can freely change jobs between industries but cannot migrate across country borders.

There are two industries in the model,       agriculture and manufacturing,       and two countries. The industries produce with constant returns to scale. Under constant returns to scale,       doubling an industry's inputs doubles the output,       tripling all inputs triples output,       reducing all inputs by half cuts output in half,       and the like. Under perfect competition,       firms will not play a relevant role in such a world. Perfect competition means that no seller or buyer gets to strategically set prices;
Otherwise another seller or buyer could come in and outbid the manipulator with a better price. All that matters then is the industry as a whole. (We will relax this assumption in Part I when we discuss protecting infant industries,       and in Part II when we consider individual firms with an entry and exit choice.)

## FUNDAMENTALS.

## CHANGE OF PERSPECTIVE: NO LOGO

In her influential book *No logo: Taking aim at the brand bullies*,       Klein (2002) takes a different perspective on the economics of globalization. Rather than focus on industries and their comparative advantages,       Naomi Klein assesses how dominant large multinational enterprises (MNEs) are when it comes to international trade. A great deal of recent economic research shows that MNEs are important players in world trade,       and that their dominance characterizes the most recent wave of global economic integration. Upcoming chapters in this book will therefore investigate [[Chapter 6-Intermediate Input Trade and Offshoring|offshoring]] and how it's affected by MNEs.

Naomi Klein posits that MNEs have left societies with "no space,      " "no choice,      " and "no jobs."
By "no space" Klein means that the culture and education in countries are now driven by marketing. She describes how mergers and cross-border acquisitions lead to no cultural choices. She also argues that MNEs worsen employment and lead to "no jobs." Put succinctly,       in Naomi Klein's view,       globalization diminishes the cultures of countries and leads to low wages. Her slogan "no logo" is then a call to activism in response to the threats of globalization.

Naomi Klein's economic argument is not that there are no gains from globalization. Her concern with "no choice" is that globalization has benefitted almost exclusively a small group of corporate shareholders. Comprehensive research into the within-country and between-country sources of global income inequality between 1820 and 2010 by Bourguignon and Morrisson (2002) and Morrisson and Murtin (2011) suggests that within-country inequality has indeed risen in recent decades (see Figure 1.3 in the introduction). But the compression of between-country inequality dwarfs the within-country increase. On a global scale,       the rising income of Asia's poor has reduced global inequality fast. As we will see in later chapters on diverse firms and trade,       globalization may benefit especially more capable companies and entrepreneurs as Naomi Klein posits; but progressing globalization will spread opportunities and within-country inequality may drop. Naomi Klein's concern with "no jobs" is that MNEs offer unstable and low-paying employment both in their home countries and at their foreign locations.

In a contemporary report,       the globalization-critical charity Oxfam (2002,       p. 56) describes its efforts to promote employment conditions in Bangladesh and cites the experience of a 23-year-old mother of three children who favors export promotion at her employer:
"This job is hard—and we are not treated fairly. The managers do not respect us women. But life is much harder for those working outside. . . . People selling things in the street or carrying bricks on building sites earn less than we do. There are few other options. Of course I want better conditions. But for me this job means that my children will have enough to eat,       and that their lives can improve."
What would the employment conditions in Bangladesh (and elsewhere) be in the absence of globalization? This is a tough question. A good answer requires both relevant theory and rigorous empirics.

By assumption,       trade is balanced. (As explained earlier,       Parts III and IV will allow for trade imbalances.) Contracts are perfectly enforceable. (In Part I we will also consider incentives for innovation under uncertainty; Parts II and III will generally deal with uncertainty and moral hazard as they relate to trade and international capital markets.)
One fundamental of many models deserves special emphasis: the so-called **Law of One Price**.

Simply put,       the law of one price states:
Every product i sells at the same price $P_i$ in every country.

There is only a single final production stage in the Ricardian model,       there are no intermediate inputs,       so the Law of One Price postulates in our context that all final products sell at the same price worldwide. Mexico's avocados sell for $P_A$in both Mexico and California,       and California's motorcycles sell for $P_M$ in California and Mexico.

The term "law" makes it sound as if the Law of One Price were generally true. In practice,       it fails badly. You have probably noticed that the same product is sold at different prices in stores in the same city,       stores across the country,       and stores in different countries. There are good reasons to drop the assumption that the Law of One Price holds. To isolate things,       however,       let's defer failures of the Law of One Price to later models. (We will look at how transport costs and tariffs affect the Law of One Price in Chapter 7; we will study how imperfect competition affects pricing in Part II; and we will study the presence of prohibitively high transport costs and non-traded goods in Part III.)

## 2.4 THE RICARDIAN MODEL
![|500](CleanShot%202024-02-17%20-000496@2x.png)

The fundamentals provide the reasons for trade (our first theme). The key forces in the Ricardian model are technological differences. On their basis,       we can now derive the pattern of trade in the Ricardian model (our second theme) and the welfare gains from trade (our third theme).

So far we have treated the economies we've discussed as if someone prescribes what they should do. Someone in Mexico decided all of its workers would produce avocados. Someone in California decided all of its workers would produce motorcycles. In free-market economies,       of course,       there are no such dictators. Instead,       what Adam Smith called the *invisible hand* leads an economy toward the best course of action. To understand the equilibrium in a market,       we can look at product prices and the wage rate of labor. This is where our fundamentals come into play. In a worldwide market characterized by perfect competition,       the Law of One Price holds. This in turn implies that the price of motorcycles is $P_M$ worldwide,       and the price of avocados is $P_A$worldwide (as soon as the economies trade). To see this,       suppose the opposite is true—that is,       that the price of motorcycles,       for example,       is higher in one economy. Then all consumers,       both domestic and foreign,       would acquire motorcycles from the location that charges the lower price. The lower price would then become the worldwide price of a motorcycle.

Similarly,       there is only one type of labor in each economy,       and it is completely mobile between industries. So there is only one wage rate w for both industries in California,       and there is only one wage rate w∗ for both industries in Mexico. To see that,       suppose the opposite—that is,       that the wage is higher in one industry than in the other. Then all Mexican workers would quit their jobs in the low-paying industry,       go to work in the high-paying industry,       and only one wage rate would prevail. You can tell that the Law of One Price and perfect labor mobility are strong assumptions,       and there is good reason to relax them,       which we will do later. For now,       let's accept the fundamentals as they are and continue working towards the pattern and welfare gains of trade.

Every avocado and motorcycle producer initially faces the decision to produce or not. If the price of the product they produce $P_i$ is less than its production cost $P_i$ *< $a^*_i w$  then there is no production of good i (Qi = 0). The variable w is the workers' wage rate. If the product price $P_i$ is exactly equal to the production cost $P_i$ = $a_i w$ ,       then there is production of good i. How much,       depends on the demand for it. Similarly abroad: if $P_i$ = $a^*_{i}w$,       then there is production of good i.

I > $a_i w$  and earn Is it possible for producers to charge a price in excess of the production cost $P'_{i}$,       take an economic profit? Not under our assumptions. If one producer were to charge a higher price,       then every other producer would have an incentive to undercut and charge just a little less than P ′
over the entire market,       and make nice profits. The incentive to undercut does not go away until $P_i=a_iw.$ 

Perfect competition therefore implies that$$P_i=a_iw$$in equilibrium. Producers just break even.
Let's go back to our example. Once California's economy opens up to free trade,       the relative world price of a motorcycle $\bar{P_M^W}/P_A^W$ will prevail. This relative world price will differ from eithen economy's opportunity cost of producing a motorcycle $a_M/a_C$ (unless the opportunity costs of motorcyde production are identical everywhere around the world,       which is unlikely). Suppose$$\frac{P_M^W}{P_A^W}>\frac{a_M}{a_A}$$
What will producers in California do? They will have to specialize in one or the other activity.
The reason is that the sales price per unit labor requirement must cover the wage rate. If California specializes in motorcycles,       then the motorcycle price per unit labor requirement must satisfy $P_M^W/a_M=w$ (because $P_M^W=a_Mw).$ This implies,       however,       that $$ \frac{P_M^W}{a_M}=w>\frac{P_A^W}{a_A}$$ by the above relationship between the relative world price and opportunity costs. In other words,       avocado growing is no longer viable in the economy when there is motorcycle production. When markets are free and the relative world price of a motorcycle exceeds California's opportunity cost to make one,       then the economy completely specializes in the production of motorcycles. Conversely,       the foreign economy completely specializes in avocado cultivation.

The left panel of Figure 2.2 depicts the global equilibrium with free trade. The graph shows the production possibilities of the two economies simply by placing the two graphs from Figure 2.1 on
 Top of each other. The only information we have to start with is that the relative world price $\frac{P^W_M}{P^W_{A}}$  must fall in the range between the two economies' opportunity costs:
$$\frac{a_{M}^{*}}{a_{A}^{*}}>\frac{P_{M}^{W}}{P_{A}^{W}}>\frac{a_{M}}{a_{A}}.$$
Suppose the world price ratio were either above the upper opportunity costs (in Mexico) or below the lower opportunity costs (in California). Then either everyone in the world would produce motorcycles or everyone would grow avocados,       leaving consumers without one of the two goods. That cannot be an equilibrium.

Initially we only know the slope of the international trade line,       which is depicted with the green line at the upper-right end of the left graph in Figure 2.2. We do not know where to position the international trade line. Use a ruler,       keep it at an angle with exactly the slope of the international trade line,       and then slide the ruler towards the origin until it just touches a PPF. The first PPF it touches will be California's at the point at which California completely specializes in motorcycle manufacturing. Why? Producers in California realize that,       at the given relative world price of a motorcycle,       they will break even with motorcycle production but suffer a loss growing avocados. Keep sliding the ruler towards the origin until it touches Mexico's PPF. This will occur at the point at which Mexico completely specializes in avocado growing. Under the given relative world price,       Mexican producers suffer a loss if they make motorcycles but will break even growing avocados.

Is this market outcome the best possible one—an outcome that the economies should pursue if they got to dictate the best choice? Initially the green international trade line out to the upper right is at a position that is not feasible for any economy. Neither of the two economies can afford consumption of the two goods at a level beyond its production possibilities. So we lower the green line to a level closer to the origin. At some point it will just touch California's PPF—at the point where California completely specializes in motorcycle production. Should we lower California's trade possibilities line any further? We had better not because at this point California's consumers can afford consumption of the goods on the green international trade line. They can exchange their motorcycles for avocado imports from Mexico,       moving up along the green international trade line. Lowering California's trade possibilities line any further would imply that California's consumers forego consumption they can afford. Conversely,       Mexico's international trade line starts at its avocado production point. At this point Mexicans can exchange their avocados for motorcycles imported from California,       moving down the green international trade line. For each economy,       the green line opens up consumption possibilities that are now affordable with free trade but would not be feasible if the economy were closed and had to consume along its respective black PPF.

The resulting trade pattern is clear. California completely specializes its production in motorcycle manufacturing,       and Mexico completely specializes its production in avocado growing. So,       if anything gets traded in equilibrium,       it must be Californian motorcycles for Mexican avocados. This is the trade pattern that occurs after both economies open their markets to trade.

How much will be traded? That partly depends on consumer demand,       so we need to specify some type of global consumer preferences. As consumers grow richer and richer,       it is rational for them to choose combinations of the two products that lie further to the right and up in the graph. To make matters simple,       let's assume that consumers purchase fixed proportions of the goods: if they consume 200 avocados per motorcycle initially,       then they consume 400 avocados and 2 motorcycles after their budgets double,       and 800 avocadoes and 4 motorcycles after incomes double again. 3 For our graph,       these preferences mean that the product combinations consumers choose all sit on a ray emanating from the origin of the graph. The right panel in Figure 2.2 depicts the consumption ray with a black line.

Are straight rays from the origin a realistic description of demand? The likely answer is no. If the typical consumer in an economy spends one percent of her annual income on burger consumption,       then Bill Gates and Warren Buffet also would have to spend one percent of their annual incomes on burger consumption. No one can realistically eat that many burgers,       so in practice consumption bundles will not lie on straight lines. We simplified the demand-side explanation of trade with a ray from the origin not because we were trying to describe demand realistically. We do so to make the production-side explanations of trade as clear as possible. In general,       one has to be careful with explanations based on tastes behind demand. If we simply assumed that everyone in the world loves Californian motorcycles but hates Californian avocados,       we could "explain" the same trade pattern as the Ricardian model. Such a demand explanation would not be very general,       however,       nor would it give a chance to the potentially important role of production technology.

When Mexico was still a closed economy,       its consumers used to demand exactly the motorcycles and avocados produced. A black dot on Mexico's PPF represents that consumption choice. With free trade,       the country can afford the combination of the products represented by the green dot on Mexico's green international trade line. Similarly,       when California was still a closed economy,       its consumers used to choose the combination represented by the black dot on California's PPF. Now Californians can afford the combination represented by the green dot on California's green international trade line. Are the consumption choices under free trade mutually consistent? They are,       as the two red triangles show. The two red triangles are exactly equal in size. Along the horizontal line,       California's red triangle shows the number of motorcycles exported to Mexico,       which equals the number of motorcycles Mexico imported. (In the depiction,       the trade volume is a little less than 30,      000 motorcycles.) Mexico's number of imported motorcycles is the length of the horizontal line of Mexico's red triangle. The vertical line of Mexico's red trade triangle shows its avocado exports,       and the vertical line of California's red trade triangle shows its avocado imports. This is the world trade equilibrium.

The gains from trade for each economy are represented by all of the product combinations that are better than the closed-economy combination. The newly affordable combinations are represented by any point on or below the country's international trade line and above the country's PPF. They are the combinations above the black point or to the right of the black point,       or both. The set of combinations that is newly affordable with free trade and preferable is therefore each country's green triangle above the closed-economy point,       as shown in the right panel of Figure 2.2. The green triangles are conservative measures of the gains from trade. 4 For now we won't concern ourselves with precise measures of the actual gains from trade. We just note that they are positive for both economies.

The deep source of the gains from trade is that the production decision in an open economy is separate from the consumption choice. In the closed economy,       where no goods could be traded,       the black production dot and the consumption dot had to be the same. In the open economy,       in contrast,       the green consumption dot can be placed anywhere on the green international trade line. Only one extreme point of the green international trade line is the black production dot,       from where the economy trades its goods. The consumption choice can now differ from the production decision.

## THINK TWICE ABOUT CONVENTION: MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT GLOBAL TRADE ALL AROUND

Consider the following statement: "Free trade is only beneficial if a country is productive enough to compete." Does the statement sound plausible? No. It is false,       as the principle of comparative advantage just taught us. Regardless of an economy's overall productivity,       free trade will improve the prosperity of the country as a whole. The country need not have an absolute advantage in any activity. Trade is beneficial as long the country has a comparative advantage in at least one activity. The economy's overall productivity level does not matter.

Consider another argument against globalization: "Free trade is unfair,       and it's harmful if it is based in low-wage competition." This statement is also incorrect. Trade is beneficial if there is a comparative advantage. Absolute wage levels do not matter.

A third misconception of globalization is often stated like this: "Free trade worsens the plight of the average resident in low-wage countries." This statement is also incorrect. Again,       trade is beneficial if there is a comparative advantage. A typical resident's wage level does not matter for the gains from trade to occur.

The following is a slightly more-informed version of the previous statement: "Free trade worsens the plight of low-skilled workers in low-wage countries." Unfortunately,       the Ricardian model does not equip us with the tools we need to evaluate whether or not this statement is correct because all workers have the same skill levels in the model. In Chapter 4,       we will therefore deal with differently skilled workers. When we study the trade of final goods in that chapter,       you will learn that this statement is wrong too. A more accurate statement is as follows: "Under certain conditions,       free trade may worsen the plight of low-skilled workers in an open economy." We will get to those conditions.

Ardent supporters of globalization are guilty of having misconceptions about free trade as well. It's not uncommon for them to make claims like this: "Trade theory implies that free trade closes the income gap between poor and rich countries." This statement is false. To prove a statement wrong,       we need to find only one counter example. We just had one in this chapter:
Per-capita income differences persist in the Ricardian model after trade. In our example,       the combination of motorcycles and avocados Californians could afford was larger than Mexico's before and after the two economies traded. In other words,       California's real income continued to exceed Mexico's real income. A less dramatic version of the last statement is: "Free trade closes the income gap between poor and rich countries." Perhaps this is true. But the principle of comparative advantage doesn't imply it is. How trade affects growth is the subject of much debate. We will discuss this topic in detail in Chapter 9.

Two important features of the Ricardian model are peculiar. First,       both countries completely specialize their production. California only makes motorcycles,       and Mexico only grows avocados under free trade. In the real world,       most countries produce a little of many products. We will therefore soon generalize the Ricardian model and make the production possibilities of economies less rigid. Second,       under the model,       all workers in California and Mexico have the same skills and earn the same wage. In other words,       trade affects everyone equally. There are no losers from free trade. We will revisit the possibility that some worker groups might lose from free trade when we introduce different skill levels.

## 2.5 REVEALED COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

How can we identify which of an economy's industries have a comparative advantage in the real
 world? Bela Balassa (1965) introduced a measure that uses actual trade flows by country and industry to make this comparison. The measure is referred to as revealed comparative advantage.

Here is the definition of revealed comparative advantage as proposed by Balassa (1965): For a given period of time,       such as a year,       pick the observed exports $X_i^\mathrm{Country}$ of an industry $i$ in a given country. Compute the share of these exports relative to the country's total exports: $X_i^\text{Country}/\sum_kX_k^\text{Country}.$ The mathematical sign $\sum _k$denotes summation over all$k$ industries. Table 2.2 shows these shares region by region in percent. The share of an industry's exports relative to the country's total exports is large if its opportunity costs are low. This share therefore provides the first part of the double comparison: the comparison between industries.

Now compute the share of an industry's worldwide exports relative to the total exports worldwide: $X_i^\mathrm{World}/\sum_kX_k^\mathrm{World}$ .The final column of Table 2.2 shows the percentage shares for the world as a whole. The share of an industry's worldwide exports in the global total provides the second part of the double comparison: It is closely related to a comparison between a country and the rest of the world.

Instead of performing the double comparisons separately,       Balassa (1965) introduced a simple summary measure:
$$RCA^{\text{country}}_{i}\equiv\frac{X^{\text{country}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{country}}_{k}}{X^{\text{rated}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{rated}}_{k}},      $$

Dividing the share of an industry's exports in a given country by the country's total exports,       and then dividing the industry's worldwide exports by the global total exports. The revealed comparative advantage measure equals 1 if the industry's trade share in a country is identical to that in the rest of the world. Then the industry exhibits neither a comparative advantage nor a comparative disadvantage.

An _RCA_ measure of indicates the industry is at a strong comparative disadvantage. If the measure is large,       the industry has a strong comparative advantage. The measure does a good job ranking used with the setup products. The measure cannot be used,       however,       to rank non-exporting industries with a weak or no comparative advantage.

Figure 2.3 puts the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage to work using the information from Table 2.2. Africa,       the Commonwealth of Independent States (Russia and its neighbors),       and the Middle East are the leading global exporters of fuels and mining products. South America has the world's strongest comparative advantage when it comes to exporting agricultural products. In these emerging economies,       comparative advantage is highly concentrated. In contrast,       the revealed comparative advantages of the industries in Asia (including Australia,       Japan,       India,       and China),       Europe,       and North America are more evenly distributed. All three regions have a revealed comparative advantage in manufacturing. Europe and North America also each have a small revealed comparative advantage in agriculture. Asia is the world's global manufacturing powerhouse.

## SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

The principle of comparative advantage explains *why countries globalize*,       which is the first theme of this book. Comparative advantage is based on a double comparison: Not only do we need to compare two countries production of goods to each other,       we need to look at the production of each good relative to the production of other goods *within* the countries. By the nature of this double comparison,       every economy must have a comparative advantage in at least a few activities (except in the unlikely case that the relative costs of production are identical around the world; then trade does not matter).

The Ricardian model explains why some economies have a comparative advantage over others:
The industries in different economies differ in terms of their labor productivity. Markets that are [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] then ensure every economy exports the products in which it has a comparative advantage. That insight provides an answer to the second theme of this book,       *how countries globalize*. As to the third theme,       *should countries globalize*? The principle of comparative advantage predicts that trade makes all countries better off because a country's consumption possibilities after trade are always at least as large as its production possibilities,       and generally larger (except for the unlikely case when the relative costs production are identical around the world). The fundamental source of the gains from trade is the separation of consumption and production decisions.

In a closed economy,       the opportunity cost of a product is equal to its relative price: $*P_{i=1}*/*P_{i=2}*.$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| PPF                       | The production possibilities frontier shows the maximum output of one product *i* for any given amount of other product made. The slope of the PPF is the opportunity cost of product *i* at any level of output. The PPF in the Ricardian model with two products is: $*a_i1*-1 * Q_1 + *a_i2* * Q_2 = L$ for outputs *$Q_i$* and total labor endowment *L*. The PPF slope is: $-\frac{a_{i=1}}{a_{i=2}}$.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Comparative advantage     | A country has a comparative advantage in the production of product *i* if the economy's opportunity cost of producing it is lower than what it is in other countries. To determine the comparative advantage,       we must make a double comparison: one between industries and one between countries. In the Ricardian model with two products and two countries: $-\frac{a_{i=1}}{a_{i=2}}< -\frac{a'_{i=1}}{a'_{i=2}}$.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Relative world price      | Under free trade,       the relative world price of product $i$ in terms of all other products $P_{i=1}^W/P_2^W$ lies between the two economies' opportunity costs. In the Ricardian model with two products: $$a_{i=1}/a_2<P_{i=1}^{W}/P_{2}^{W}<a_{i=1}^{*}/a_{2}^{*}.$$                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Law of One Price          | Every product $i$ sells at the same global price $P_i$ in every economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## ASSESSMENTS CONCEPT CHECKS PRINCIPLE OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

C 1.1. Revisit Table 2.1. Instead of expressing a economy's total production and consumption in terms
Of avocados,       use motorcycles as the unit of account. Keep the fair trade price of 1/200 of a motorcycle per avocado. Show that GDP in California is 100,      000 motorcycles with and without free trade,       and 30,      000 motorcycles in Mexico. Show that California's consumption with free trade is equivalent to 130,      000 motorcycles if it imports 6 million avocados. What is Mexico's consumption with free trade in terms of motorcycles? What are the two economies' gains from free trade?
C 1.2. Revisit the example from Table 2.1. Now suppose the free trade price is 1/100 of a motorcycle
Per avocado. Express each economy's total production and consumption in terms of avocados. Show that California's gains from free trade are zero no matter how many motorcycles it exports. How large are Mexico's gains from free trade if it exports 6 million avocados in exchange for 30,      000 imported motorcycles from California?
C 1.3. Revisit Table 2.1. Now suppose the opportunity costs of a motorcycle in terms of an avocado are
1/100 in both economies,       and the free trade price is 1/100 of a motorcycle per avocado. Express each economy's total production and consumption in terms of avocados. Are there gains from free trade? Can there be losses from free trade?
C 1.4. Mexico and California grow almonds and produce computers. Mexico's workers can produce
300,      000 computers and grow 15 million almonds,       whereas California's workers can produce 1 million computers and grow 20 million almonds. In your argument,       start from a point of no trade and open markets to international trade. What are Mexico's and California's opportunity costs of computer manufacturing in terms of almonds? What is the pattern of trade? If the world price is 1 computer per 30 almonds,       how many computers will Mexico make,       and how many computers will California make? In your analysis,       demonstrate that there are gains from
Trade for both California and Mexico.

## PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES

C 2.1. Suppose California has only one-third of Mexico's labor force. These workers generate 600,      000
Hours of work per year. California can either manufacture 100,      000 motorcycles or grow 10 million avocados. What are the Ricardian unit labor requirements for California's motorcycle and avocado industries in this case? Does California still have an absolute advantage in motorcycle production and avocado growing in terms of labor productivity? Are the following production
Mixes feasible in California when its economy is closed: (1) QA = 5,       000,       000 and QM = 50,       000,       (2) QA = 5,       000,       000 and QM = 75,       000,       (3) QA = 5,       000,       000 and QM = 25,       000. Among the
Feasible production mixes,       just one is efficient and not wasteful. Which one?
C 2.2. Brazil and Venezuela refine oil and manufacture airplanes. Brazil can produce 80,      000 barrels of
Oil or 4,      000 airplanes. Venezuela can produce 100,      000 barrels of oil or 10,      000 airplanes. What is Brazil's opportunity cost of airplanes in terms of oil? What is Venezuela's opportunity cost of airplanes in terms of oil?


C2.3. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). Both countries have equally large labor forces $L=L^*.$ There are two industries: agriculture (A) and mining (M). The productivities of the industries are given by the following constant unit labor requirements:$$
\begin{array}{r|rr}&\text{Home}&\text{Foreign}\\\hline\text{Agriculture}&a_{LA}=4&a_{LA}^*=2\\\text{Mining}&a_{LM}=2&a_{LM}^*=1\\\hline\end{array}$$
State the closed-economy prices of mining goods in terms of agricultural goods in the domestic country $(P_M/P_A)$ and the foreign country $(P_M^*/P_A^*)$. Compute the relative incomes of the two countries,       $w/w^*.$

C2.4. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). There is one factor of production,       labor,       and both countries have equally large labor forces of $L=L^*=300.$ There are two industries,       agriculture and manufacturing. The production possibilities of the two countries are shown in the following table (if labor is exclusively allocated to one industry). $$\begin{array}{r|cc}&\text{Home}&\text{Foreign}\\\hline\text{Agriculture}&Q_A=100&Q_A^*=150\\\text{Manufacturing}&Q_M=50&Q_M^*=300\\\hline\end{array}$$
Complete the following table of unit labor requirements under the assumption that unit labor requirements are constant. $$\begin{array}{r|rr}&\text{Home}&\text{Foreign}\\\hline\text{Agriculture}&a_{LA}=&a_{LA}^*=\\\text{Manufacturing}&a_{LM}=&a_{LM}^*=\\\hline\end{array}$$ 
What are the relative prices $P_M/P_A$ in each country when there is no trade? In which industry does the domestic country have a comparative advantage? In which industry does the foreign country have a comparative advantage? How does comparative advantage change when the domestic country doubles its labor force to $L= 600$ but the foreign labor force remains constant at $L^*=300?$


C 2.5. When employing its full labor force,       Peru can produce either 300,      000 computers a year or 6
Million roses,       or a mix of the two. When employing its full labor force,       Canada can produce either 600,      000 computers or 9 million roses,       or a mix of the two. State the equation for Peru's production possibility frontier (PPF). What is its slope? Show that,       in the Ricardian model with constant unit labor requirements,       the slope of the PPF can be expressed as the ratio of maximum production quantities. Which country has the absolute advantage in producing computers? Which country has the absolute advantage in producing roses? Which country has the comparative advantage in producing computers? Which country has the comparative advantage in producing roses?

## FUNDAMENTALS OF THE MODEL

C 3.1. A typical assumption in trade models is that production factors are completely mobile between
Industries within a country,       but immobile across country borders. In the Ricardian model,       there is only one factor of production,       labor,       and all workers are the same in terms of skills and abilities. From these assumptions,       can the wage differ between industries within a country? Can wages differ between countries?
C 3.2. Balanced trade means that the value of a country's exports equals the value of imports at a
Given time horizon. Does this assumption properly reflect the trade relationship between the United States and China in the short term,       or between Germany and Greece? Do you think balanced trade is a good assumption at short time horizons,       or at long time horizons?
C 3.3. Constant returns to scale imply that the production cost per unit of output is constant,       no matter
How large or small the quantity produced. Perfect competition means that any unit of the same good must sell at a price exactly equal to the unit production cost. In such a market,       does it make a difference if there two,       a dozen or thousands of producing firms?
C 3.4. State the Law of One Price. Suppose one country imposes a tariff on its import good,       but the
Other country does not use tariffs. Will the Law of One Price hold? Suppose one but not the other country imposes a tariff on its export good. Will the Law of One Price hold? Suppose a monopoly sells its good everywhere in the world at the same high price. Does the Law of One Price hold?

## THE RICARDIAN MODEL

C 4.1. Brazil and Venezuela refine oil and manufacture airplanes. As in previous concept check C 2.2,       Brazil can produce 80,      000 barrels of oil or 4,      000 airplanes. Venezuela can produce 100,      000 barrels of oil or 10,      000 airplanes. Describe the pattern of trade between Brazil and Venezuela. Why is the pattern the way it is?
C 4.2. Suppose an economy is completely closed to foreign trade. How can one use its closed-economy
Prices industry by industry,       relative to world prices industry by industry,       to determine the
Country's comparative advantage? Suppose that the country's prospective trade partners heavily subsidize agriculture. Do the relative prices when there was no trade reveal which countries have a comparative advantage? Can one still determine the future trade patterns among the countries if they trade with one another at relative world prices?
C 4.3. Guatemala's production possibility frontier is acoffee · Qcoffee + atrucks · Q*trucks* = L,       where ai
are the unit labor requirements for producing one unit of good i. L is Guatemala's labor force.
Derive the maximum number of sacks of coffee Q*coffee* when Guatemala specializes completely in coffee growing. Derive the maximum number of trucks Q*trucks* when Guatemala specializes
Completely in truck manufacturing. What is Guatemala's opportunity cost of truck production
In terms of foregone coffee? If the world price ratio is Pcoffee
Ptrucks < acoffee
A*trucks* ,       will Guatemala specialize
In coffee or trucks?
C 4.4. There are two countries and two industries,       agriculture (A) and manufacturing (M). Productivities in the two industries in the Home country (no asterisk) and the Foreign country (asterisk) are given by the following constant unit labor requirements:$$
\begin{array}{r|rr}&\mathrm{Home}&\mathrm{Foreign}\\\hline\text{Agriculture}&a_{LA}=3&a_{LA}^*=4\\\text{Manufacturing}&a_{LM}=2&a_{LM}^*=1\\\hline\end{array}
$$

State the closed-economy price of manufactured goods in terms of agricultural goods at Home (PM/PA). In what industry does the domestic country have a comparative advantage? What good will the domestic country export if there is complete specialization in at least one country?

Suppose the foreign country increases its agricultural productivity so that a∗

LA = 1. Does this change the good that Home exports?

C 4.5. The production possibility frontiers for the domestic country (no asterisk) and the foreign country (asterisk) are depicted in the graph in Figure 2.4 A. Both economies' labor endowments are

Equally large,  $\bar{L}$=$\bar{L}$∗. Both countries produce cheese and wine. Calculate the opportunity cost

Of producing cheese in terms of wine for each country. Which country has an absolute advantage in cheese production? Wine and cheese are the actual products Ricardo used in his original model when he created it. He gave Portugal an absolute advantage in both the production of (Port) wine and (sheep) cheese. In the diagram,  is Portugal the domestic or foreign country? Which country has a comparative advantage in cheese production? Now let the two countries trade freely and each completely specialize in the production of one good. What is the possible

Range of the relative world price of cheese PC/PW? Choose one possible relative world price PC/PW. Is trade beneficial to both countries? Explain your answer and then graph it. Will trade

Equalize wages in the two countries?

## REVEALED COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

C 5.1. A measure of comparative advantage is the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage

$$RCA^{\text{country}}_{i}\equiv\frac{X^{\text{country}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{country}}_{k}}{X^{\text{world}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{world}}_{k}},      $$What value does the$RCA_i^{\text{Carry}}$index take for a country's import products that it does not export?

At all?

C 5.2. Explain the Balassa measure of comparative advantage

$$RCA^{\text{country}}_{i}\equiv\frac{X^{\text{country}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{country}}_{k}}{X^{\text{world}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{world}}_{k}},      $$

How does the measure identify a country's products or industries that have a *strong* comparative advantage? State a reason why it might not properly rank a country's products or industries with a *weak* comparative advantage (strong disadvantage).

C 5.3. Suppose the world is exactly like in Ricardo's trade model: There are only two industries and

Two countries,  and there is complete specialization under free trade. Show that the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage

$$RCA^{\text{country}}_{i}\equiv\frac{X^{\text{country}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{country}}_{k}}{X^{\text{world}}_{i}/\sum_{k}X^{\text{world}}_{k}},      $$

takes the same value for both countries' exporting industries regardless of their unit labor requirements. What is the value? Note:$\sum_kX_k^\mathrm{World}=X_{k=1}+X_{k=2}^*$when the countries completely specialize and$X_{k=1}=X_{k=2}^*$and the trade between them is balanced

C 5.4. Suppose a country subsidies the cars it exports. Will the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage under-estimate or over-estimate the country's true comparative advantage in the car industry?

## DISCUSSION QUESTIONS

Q0.\1. There are two goods,  burgers and cars,  and there are two countries,  Uruguay and Brazil.

Brazil's labor force is able to work 1 million hours a year and can either produce 300,  000 cars or 30 million burgers,  or a linear combination of the two. Uruguay's labor force is able to work 50,  000 hours a year and can either produce 10,  000 cars or 5 million burgers,  or a combination of the two. Which country has an *absolute* advantage producing cars,  and which country has an absolute advantage producing burgers? Which country has a *comparative* advantage producing cars,  and which country has a *comparative* advantage producing burgers? What is the opportunity cost of producing burgers in terms of cars in Uruguay and in Brazil? Suppose Uruguay and Brazil are the only countries that trade in the world. What is the Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage for Uruguay's car industry? What is it in the burger industry? The Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage for good i is

$$R C A_{i}\equiv\frac{X_{i}^{\mathrm{Country}}/\sum_{k}X_{k}^{\mathrm{Country}}}{X_{i}^{\mathrm{WorId}}/\sum_{k}X_{k}^{\mathrm{WorId}}},      $$

Where Xi are exports.

Q0.\1. Two countries,  Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk),  can grow food and produce manufactured products. The production possibility frontiers for the countries are depicted in the graph

In Figure 2.4 B. Both countries' labor forces are equally large,  L = L∗. Compute the opportunity

Cost of food in terms of manufactured products for each country. Which country has an absolute

Advantage in food production? Which country has a comparative advantage in manufacturing?

How do your arguments change if the labor forces are not equally large,  L ̸= L∗? Suppose the countries then begin trading with each other. What is the possible range of the relative world price of cheese PM/PF? Choose one possible relative world price PM/PF and depict the consumption choices of the countries after trade when each country completely specializes in one good. Is trading beneficial to both countries? Now increase L∗. If L∗ is large enough,  show that the foreign country can choose to consume a combination of both goods that requires it to produce both of them because the domestic country is too small to export sufficient quantities of the good it has a comparative advantage in.

Q0.\1. Discuss what insights Ricardian trade theory has to offer when it comes to evaluating the following three statements. (1) Trade depresses the real incomes of workers in emerging economies because their populations are larger in total than they are in industrialized countries. (2) The larger labor-cost differences are between emerging economies and industrialized countries,  the smaller are the gains from trade in industrialized countries. (3) Trade equalizes the per-capita

GDP across economies.
