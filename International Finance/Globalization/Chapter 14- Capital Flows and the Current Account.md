# Chapter 14Capital Flows and the Current Account

[[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]]

Once upon a time there was a politician,  running on the following election platform: “As soon as I am in ofﬁce,  I will make our region both a leader in exports and a top destination for outside investors. I will make sure that our region will run a trade surplus,  exporting more goods and services than we import. A trade surplus is what I call export success. Moreover,  I will also make sure that our region attracts foreign capital clearly in excess of the investments that our residents make abroad. Large net capital inﬂows are what I mean by a top destination for outside investors. Vote for me to make these successes in trade and ﬁnance happen for our region.” To live happily ever after,  should you vote for this politician?

# Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter you should be able to:

- LO 1 Understand that net export outﬂows go hand in hand with net capital outﬂows.
- LO 2 Explain the equivalence of net exports and net credit ﬂows either using the example of two island economies,  or using examples of accounting entries in the balance of payments,  or using main national accounting relationships.
- LO 3 Present a country’s production and consumption decisions over time given the country’s production possibilities. Then determine the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance in every period and explain how the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance relates to comparative advantage in terms of present and future resources.
- LO 4 Assess to what extent international capital markets help countries realize gains from trading present and future resources.

# 14.1 International Capital Flows and Trade

This chapter and all upcoming chapters make an important point that sets them apart from all preceding chapters: The trade between countries need not be balanced. Some countries run a trade surplus,  which means they export more in value than they import,  and other countries run a trade deﬁcit,  which means they export less in value than they import. The difference between the value of exports and the value of imports is called the trade balance $T B,      $ ,  or net exports:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{T B=E X-I M,      }\end{array}
$$

where the difference between the value of exports $E X$ and the value of imports IM is net exports. The trade balance can be positive or negative. A negative trade balance means a country has negative net exports,  or less exports than imports in value.

Notes : Exports and imports in $\mathrm{US}\S$ billions at current exchange rates are region-wide totals,  and include intra-regional shipments and un class i ed products. Imports inferred from shares of regional trade ﬂows (World Trade Organization 2011,  Table I0.\1).

For deﬁnitions of regions,  see World Trade Organization (2011,  Composition,  deﬁnitions & methodology).

Table 14.1 shows the trade balances for major regions of the world. The Americas are a region of major trade deﬁcits,  importing about 560 billion U.S. dollars more than they export in 2010. Europe is running a trade deﬁcit valued at 320 billion U.S. dollars. Asia,  in contrast,  currently provides roughly half of the world’s international trade surplus,  around 400 billion U.S. dollars. Close to the other half of the international trade surplus comes from the Middle East as well as Russia and its neighbors.

You may wonder what trade balances have to do with international capital markets. Foreign trade is about ﬂows of goods across borders. International capital ﬂows are about credit extended across borders. The two—trade and capital ﬂows—-have to do everything with each other. One is the ﬂip side of the other.

# Savings and Investment in Economies

Let’s start with two islands to understand the nature of global ﬁnancial transactions. If that sounds too simple to you,  keep in mind how J.P. Morgan,  one of the famous and arguably most successful global ﬁnanciers in history,  put it in the early 20 th century: 1 “No problem can be solved until it is reduced to some simple form. The changing of a vague difﬁculty into a speciﬁc,  concrete form is a very essential element in thinking.” Let’s heed Morgan’s advice and ﬂesh out this example. Each of the two islands has exactly one inhabitant: Robinson Crusoe lives on one island and runs his economy. Friday runs her economy on the other island .There are only two periods of time: the present (today) and the future (tomorrow),  and then the world ends. And there is only one good: avocados. In some places,  such as in Mexico or California,  residents have avocados with their main daily meals (often in the form of guacamole. Residents in other countries,  such as Brazil,  eat avocados only for an occasional dessert. Brazilians enjoy a sweetened version of avocado cream and call it abacate . Suppose Robinson is like a Brazilian. He is happy to defer some of his avocado consumption until a later time. Friday,  in contrast,  craves avocados with her meal now.

When Robinson wakes up today,  he ﬁnds a bumper crop of avocados in his backyard. We could also say Robinson has a comparative advantage in avocado resources today relative to both Friday and the anticipated harvest tomorrow,  and therefore a comparative dis advantage tomorrow when the unusual harvest times are over. What should he do with extra crop? If his island were a closed economy,  and he did not know about the existence of Friday’s neighboring island,  then he would not have much of a choice. He could consume some of the avocados,  and save others. That’s it. Of course,  saving avocados for a future period is not so easy because they may rot. So,  Robinson needs to turn his savings into an investment: He plants the saved avocados in the ground so that new avocado trees will grow from them and produce a future harvest. The future avocados are the return on Robinson’s investment today. In a modern economy,  the avocado investment would be facilitated by the ﬁnancial sector. Banks and other ﬁnancial intermediaries would collect Robinson’s avocado savings,  turn around,  and loan them out for productive uses. Those avocado investments would then yield a return if things went well,  and the ﬁnancial intermediaries would hand the return to Robinson.

# Savings,  Investment,  and the Current Accounts of Economies

If the two islands can trade with one another,  Robinson and Friday’s choices will be enhanced. When Robinson wakes up today and ﬁnds a pile of avocados,  he can consume some,  invest some in his own backyard,  and loan some of them to Friday. If Friday does not repay immediately with her island’s avocados,  then Robinson has just run a trade surplus,  and Friday has just run a trade deﬁcit of equal size. What can Friday offer Robinson in return? Today,  he just receives a cordial handshake from Friday as a promise from her to pay him back the avocados later (and to throw in some extra avocados as interest). In other words,  Robinson gave Friday a credit. In a modern economy,  there is typically more than just a handshake at this moment. Friday will issue a fancy security with a long list of rules and stipulations as to when and how she will honor her debt. But the essence of the transaction is the same. A net export is,  by its nature,  accompanied by a net capital outﬂow to ﬁnance the net export.

Such a sale is nothing peculiar in the international economy or anywhere else. If you want to draw a border around yourself,  and call yourself an island economy,  then chances are that most of your daily transactions involve receiving and giving international credit. Each time you sell something,  you are like Robinson in our example and give credit until the rest of the world pays you back with some real good. Each time you buy something,  you are like Friday in our example and receive credit until the rest of the world comes back to ask you for some real goods in exchange for the credit.

Suppose you sell your lunch box to your classmate. In return,  you get cash. In the United States,  the green dollar bills you will receive state “In God we trust.” And trust you need. The simple reason is that,  essentially,  you have just given up your good lunch for a modern form of an economic handshake,  a dollar bill. That dollar bill,  you cannot eat. You have accepted the inherent promise that someday in the future when you go to someone else to buy food,  the green dollar bill will be accepted again. Until that day,  you have given a credit to your buyer,  and you will only get to settle the credit once you have spent your dollar bill on food or something else with real consumption value.

We have just revealed the futility of the ﬁctitious politician’s platform in the beginning of the chapter. The politician claimed to make your region both a net exporter and a net recipient of foreign capital. That is simply impossible by the nature of credit. As you have just seen,  a net exporter (such as Robinson) gives a credit to foreigners to ﬁnance the net exports,  so the region is a provider of international capital. Conversely,  a net importer (such as Friday) is a recipient of foreign capital to ﬁnance the net imports. In short,  with every dollar worth of net exports ships a dollar of foreign capital out alongside,  a credit to ﬁnance the net export. A trade surplus is a capital outﬂow by the economic nature of credit,  a trade deﬁcit is a capital inﬂow.

Handshakes,  handwritten debt notes,  cash,  fancy securities with their repayment rules—none of them are real resources. They are all more or less vague promises of future repayment. Future consumption of the repayment is the real resource.

Even though Robinson receives just a promise for repayment,  the promise expands his basic choices. When he wakes up in front of his avocado pile he still must choose between consumption and savings. But there are now two ways in which he can invest his savings. In other words,  he now has a choice of two assets to include in his “portfolio” One of the assets are the avocado seeds dug into Robinson’s backyard. The other asset is the number of handshakes or promises Robinson receives from Friday for the avocados he ships to her today,  one handshake for each avocado loaned.

Another crucial lesson about an open economy is that today’s savings ﬂow (Robinson’s savings ﬂow for example) is not just equal to the amount of domestic investment (the amount of avocado seeds Robinson plants on his island). Instead the savings ﬂow can go to two assets: domestic investment and investment in foreign wealth. Foreign wealth is the total of all repayment promises our economy has received from foreigners,  less the promises our residents have given to foreigners. In the two-island economy,  Robinson’s foreign wealth is the total number of avocado promises,  or handshakes,  received from Friday (he did not make any promises in our example).

In the open economy,  a country’s savings equals the amount of its domestic investment plus the amount it invests in foreign wealth. Investments in foreign wealth are considered so important that every country tracks them separately in an account that is called the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] . The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] helps countries observe how their foreign credit and debt evolve overall and to take action if they ﬁnd the run-up of credit or debt to be too fast. What is Robinson’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance today—that is,  his island’s addition to its foreign wealth? The balance is equal to the number of handshakes Robinson receives,  one per avocado loaned. Robinson is granting international credit,  and that results in a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus.

What is the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance for Friday? Her balance is the number of handshakes she is giving Robinson. Friday is receiving international credit with her net imports of avocados,  and is therefore running a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. This is another way to see why the ﬁctitious politician’s statements are contradictory: A net exporter must run a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus,  with capital ﬂowing out,  whereas a net importer must run a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit,  with capital ﬂowing into the economy. An economy can’t have it both ways.

# 14.2 National Accounts

We have shown with our two-island model that one dollar of net exports results in the equivalent of one dollar of net credit home residents give to foreigners. This basic insight will not change. We now use the national accounts to show three more ways in which net exports go hand in hand with net capital outﬂows. The national accounts are a bookkeeping system to measure economy-wide activity and track macroeconomic variables such as consumption,  savings,  investment,  net exports,  and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. First,  the national accounts clarify how net exports are net credit to foreigners because they are national income not used or invested at home. Second,  we can take examples of entries in the national accounting system to see that a net export turns into net credit,  just as a net credit turns into a net export. Third,  we can apply the deﬁnitions of main variables in the national accounts and derive the main relationship under a mathematical perspective.

# Gross Domestic Product versus Gross National Income

In an open economy,  domestic production and national income can differ if a country’s citizens work abroad or if a country’s citizens invest their savings abroad. Gross domestic product (GDP) counts the value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders,  no matter whose countries’ production factors produce the domestic goods and services. For instance,  the value of the cars produced at BMW’s Spartanburg plant in South Carolina are part of the gross domestic product of the United States,  even though BMW (Bavarian Motorworks) is headquartered in Germany. The national accountants sum up the value produced by all farms,  manufacturers,  and service providers in a country,  no matter whom these businesses employ and whose capital they use.

In contrast,  gross national income (GNI) counts the income earned by a nation’s factors of production,  regardless of the countries the factors are at work in. So,  the national accountants track down the country’s passport holders and sum up their incomes from work and invested savings,  regardless of where those incomes are earned. Keep in mind that the value of production must be equal to the total factor incomes behind production because every company’s revenues must ultimately be disbursed to at least one of the three factors of production (labor,  land and capital): The revenues may be disbursed in part as wages to the workers,  as rental payments to the landlords who rent out the premises,  or as dividends to the company’s shareholders. GNI used to be known as gross national product (GNP).

Whereas GDP looks at the location of production,  GNI (or GNP) looks at the citizenship of the factor of production. The following are some examples of GNI. When a U.S. citizen goes to work in China as an expatriate,  then her income (her contribution to production) is counted in China’s GDP but in the GNI of the United States. When a U.S. multinational company invests in Ireland,  then the proﬁts from the investment are counted as part of Irish GDP but U.S. GNI. When a Mexican resident goes to work on a U.S. farm,  then his wage is counted in U.S. GDP but Mexican GNI.

For some countries,  the differences between GNI and GDP can be large. Ireland is sometimes called the Celtic tiger because of its fast GDP growth over the past decades. Others refer to Ireland as the Irish pussycat,  however,  because one-sixth of Irish production is generated by foreign investments and expatriates. Since 2000,  the country’s GNI has only been about 84 percent of its GDP. In Luxembourg,  more than one-ﬁfth of GDP is generated by foreign investments and the country’s GNI is on average only 79 percent of its GDP. Oil-rich Kuwait is a country at the other extreme,  having invested abroad much of its savings from oil revenues. Kuwait’s GNI has been on average about 10 percent above its GDP since 2000. In some recent years,  the country’s residents have earned as much as 18 percent more than their domestic economy produces.

# Balance of Payments

The national accountants record all foreign exchanges and international transactions in the so-called balance of payments . The name balance is somewhat misleading. The balance of payments is not like a balance sheet. A balance sheet for a business provides a snapshot of the company’s current assets and liabilities at a certain point in time,  such as at $12\,      \mathrm{a.m}$ . Of January 1 st,  2014. To the contrary,  the balance of payments tracks changes over a given period such as a year or a quarter of a year (say the ﬁrst quarter of 2014). The balance of payments is not a snapshot,  it is a recording of ﬂows (much more like a company’s income statement which also records ﬂows).

Nowadays,  national accountants split the balance of payments accounts into three groups. The important part for us is the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. By convention,  the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] records the value of all goods and services that cross a country’s border as well as the factor incomes that cross the border. The crucial income ﬂows are returns on ﬁnancial assets such as interest payments,  dividends,  capital gains,  and the like. Past cross-border investments generate these cross-border returns.

In addition to the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]],  there are two more groups of accounts in the balance of payments,  the capital account and the ﬁnancial account . In the capital account,  the national accountants place so-called non-market ﬁnancial ﬂows,  such as ofﬁcial debt forgiveness or foreign aid transfers. In the ﬁnancial account,  the national accountants book the purchases and sales of foreign assets—the ﬂipside of the goods and services ﬂows in the other two accounts under the rule of double bookkeeping. 4

It took economists many centuries to come to grips with the appropriate deﬁnition of the balance of payments. In the early days,  English economists used the terms “balance of trade” and “balance of payments” as if they were one and the same,  though the writers were aware of important differences between net exports and other [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] transactions. W. H. Price (1905) ascribes the ﬁrst use of the term “balance of trade” to Edward Misselden and his book The Circle of Commerce or the Balance of Trade,  in Defense of Free Trade from 1623. Misselden and other economic thinkers at the time were careful about the “invisibles” beyond merchandise trade ﬂows: factor payments such as merchants’ proﬁts earned abroad,  and the remittances made by religious organizations in England. All those transactions are part of the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] and therefore the balance of payments today,  but they used to be included in the old English deﬁnition of the “balance of trade.” Frank Whitson Fetter (1935) credits James Steuart and his work Political Oeconomy from 1767 with the ﬁrst distinction between the narrow “balance of trade” in the sense of net exports and the broad “balance of payments” including the “invisibles.”

It was possible for a country at the time to estimate its balance of payments because goods that ﬂowed through ports were taxed with tariffs,  so that the values of imports and exports were known,  and because the “invisible” foreign incomes were not that invisible after all because they were paid in gold and silver,  and precious metal shipments through ports were also registered. It was much harder for countries to estimate the variables of their national accounts that have to do with the domestic economy,  such as consumption,  savings,  and investment. It arguably took the modern income tax to make national accounting viable. One of the ﬁrst modern income taxes was introduced in Britain in 1799 to pay for military equipment in the wars against the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte,  but the tax was repealed again in 1816 after Napoleon was defeated. In the United States,  it took the 16 th amendment to the constitution to make income taxation practical and permanent in 1913.

Until the Great Depression,  the deep economic downturn during the 1930 s,  information on the state of the domestic economy was sketchy and un systematic. The administrations of U.S. presidents Herbert C. Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt had to rely on stock price indices,  freight car loadings,  and a few indices of industrial production to make their economic decisions. To help policy makers monitor the economy more carefully,  the U.S. Department of Commerce asked Simon Kuznets of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to develop a set of national accounts together with staff at the commerce department. Kuznets presented the original set of accounts in a report to Congress in 1934 (Simon Kuznets 1934) and would later win a Nobel Prize for his work. Much of the information for the accounts comes from tax records,  in particular from income tax payments. To track ﬂows of goods and services between sectors of the economy,  Wassily Leontief developed the input-output accounts,  which also became part of the national accounts and earned him a Nobel Prize. Today a commission of the United Nations publishes recommendations for a standard system of national accounts around the world. A major difﬁculty is the measurement of services ﬂows between countries,  now that those “invisibles” are no longer paid in gold or silver.

# Think Twice about Convention: Gross National Happiness in Bhutan

Lorenzo Fioramonti (2013) observes in his book Gross Domestic Problem: The Politics behind the World’s Most Powerful Number that,  perhaps for the ﬁrst time since the invention of GDP in the 1930 s in the United States,  many people regard the GDP measure as a problem. Fioramonti precedes the introduction to his book with a quote (attributed to environmentalist Paul Hawken): “We are stealing the future,  selling it in the present,  and calling it GDP.” Fioramonti argues that the ﬁxation on GDP growth compels policymakers to promote consumerism and attract shortterm investment,  and that GDP growth is accompanied by unmeasured costs such as high income inequality and natural resource depletion. GDP is an aggregate number and therefore silent about the distribution of incomes. Per-capita GDP can be high even if only a single person or household receives most of an economy’s income.

Fioramonti teaches political science in Pretoria,  South Africa,  and wonders why African leaders speak out against colonialism and imperialism but forget that GDP,  the most important statistic they use to measure economic success,  was “part of the package they got from the West.” Many developing countries,  especially in Africa,  only developed the statistical resources and expertise to measure GDP in the 1970 s with help from the United Nations,  the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Now,  says Fioramonti,  “African policymakers are among the most vocal cheerleaders for the GDP mantra,  not recognizing it as a western invention.”

The Western world is not all that satisﬁed either. In 2008,  French president Nicholas Sarkozy brought together leading economists in a commission—among them the two Nobel laureates,  Joseph E. Stiglitz and Amartya Sen,  as well as French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi—to recommend improvements that could be made to the national accounts. Some of the problems with GDP are long known. Trafﬁc jams may increase a nation’s GDP because they increase gasoline use and its production. But the jams obviously do not improve the quality of people’s lives.

GDP doesn’t take this into account nor the resulting air pollution,  so the measure provides an inaccurate estimate of what citizens regard as well-being.

The commission’s ﬁnal report in 2009 concluded that using GDP to measure production with GDP remains essential for monitoring economic activity because,  among other things,  it determines employment. The commission also recommended,  however,  that the statistical emphasis should gradually shift from measuring production to measuring people’s well-being,  and especially the sustainability of well-being over the long term. In addition to GDP,  governments should report and target GNI and perhaps net national income (NNI),  which is a nation’s income after subtracting the depreciation of economic resources,  such the country’s physical capital and natural resources.

When it comes to well-being,  the report cautioned that the quality of life depends on many aspects and recommended steps be taken to improve measures of health,  education,  personal activities,  and environmental conditions. As a result of these recommendations,  the World Bank’s main database,  the World Development Indicators ,  now adjusts domestic savings upward with educational investments and downward with net deforestation,  energy and mineral depletion,  as well as with particulate emissions damage.

The Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission also recommended governments develop and implement novel and reliable measures of the social connections,  political empowerment,  and insecurity of a country’s citizens because those concepts have been found to predict life satisfaction in social-science research.

The idea to measure economic well-being as life satisfaction is nothing new for Bhutan. Since 1971,  the Himalayan country places little value on GDP and instead periodically measures changes in well-being with representative surveys that lead to an index of gross national happiness (GNH). The GNH measure assesses the spiritual,  physical,  social and environmental health of its citizens as well as the country’s natural environment. The index is based on 124 survey questions,  with lighter weights attached to variables that Bhutan’s GNH agency considers more subjective,  such as spiritual satisfaction.

However,  despite its dedication to well-being,  the Kingdom of Bhutan remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Almost one-third of Bhutan’s 690,  000 people lived on less than $\mathrm{US}\S2.00$ a day in 2007,  when Bhutan’s poverty number was last reported,  and more than half of the population does not have access to adequate sanitation facilities (under World Health Organization standards).

Recent economic research analyzes happiness and life satisfaction through surveys and brain imaging. The Easterlin Paradox refers to the fact that measured happiness is remarkably constant over time,  or may even decline,  even when per-capita incomes rise (Richard A. Easterlin 1974). In Japan,  for example,  the per-capita income increased between 1958 and 1991 by a factor of 6. During that time,  inventions such as indoor toilets,  washing machines,  telephones,  and television sets became ubiquitous in most Japanese households. But people’s life satisfaction fell slightly over the same period (Bruno Frey 2008,  p. 39). Some psychologists and economists trace this fact back to adaptation in aspirations: People’s aspirations increase with their income. Richer people want more perhaps because they compare themselves to the other rich,  and studies present evidence that the desire for more may be so strong that it soon cancels improvements in happiness from higher real income (Frey 2008,  p. 38). A reverse effect may occur when people lose income. Unemployed people are initially sign i cant ly less happy than employed workers or self-employed

Persons,  but the unemployed seem to adjust to their fate and become less unhappy over time. Its ﬂeeting nature makes happiness hard to measure objectively,  hence the call for more research from the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi commission.

# The Trade Balance and Current Account

A country’s GDP can be split into its uses: private consumption $C$ ,  private domestic investment $I_{s}$ ,  government expenditures $G$ and,  in the open economy,  net exports $E X-I M=T B,      $ ,  so

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=C+I+G+E X-I M.
$$

Private consumption $C$ is the spending of private households on ﬁnal goods and services (the avocados that Robinson eats); private domestic investments $I$ are all the goods and services used to form domestic capital for production (the avocados that Robinson plants in the ground); government expenditures $G$ are the consumption or investments carried out by government agencies (avocados eaten or planted in the ground by Robinson’s government). These three spending components together,  $C+I+G,      $ are sometimes called absorption (or gross national expenditures) because they soak up today’s resources in the domestic economy (the avocados used up at home). A ﬁnal use of the resources available to domestic residents are gross exports EX (avocados shipped abroad).

There are two possible origins of these four types of uses $(C+I+G+E X)$ : The resources can come out of domestic production $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ (home grown avocados) or they can be imported IM (avocado imports). Absorption plus gross exports must therefore be equal to domestic production plus imports: $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}+I M=(C+I+G)+E X$ . This GDP relationship is an accounting identity. Once you subtract imports IM from both sides of the equation,  you arrive at the GDP relationship.

Beyond exports and imports of goods and services in the trade balance,  we also need to track the “invisible” factor incomes. To focus our thoughts,  let’s look only at the factor incomes that have to do with the international capital market. We will allow capital to cross borders,  but there are no migrants in our framework. (As you have learned,  the most recent globalization wave has integrated the global capital market more rapidly than the global labor market,  so this sim pli cation is not too far-fetched.) If labor hasn’t migrated (neither Friday nor Robinson has moved to the other island) this means that the only difference between a country’s GDP and GNI is the return it has earned on its foreign capital investments,  such as interest earnings on foreign credit (the extra avocados that Friday pays to Robinson in addition to her repayment of the initial amount avocados she borrowed).

To ﬁgure out the international capital incomes,  we need to know the principal on which the returns are paid. In ﬁnance,  the principal is the initial amount of a loan,  not including interest. We call a country’s net asset position abroad its foreign wealth position $W$ . Suppose Robinson has loaned some net exports of avocados to Friday in the past,  but Friday has also loaned some extra avocados to Robinson at other times. What is Robinson’s net asset position in this case? It is his gross (or total) claims on Friday’s future avocados less Friday’s gross (or total) claims on Robinson’s future avocados. We call this net asset holding Robinson’s foreign wealth position $W$ .

Foreign wealth is sometimes also referred to as the balance of foreigners’ net indebtedness to domestic residents,  or as the home country’s net international investment position (NIIP). If there is

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/b86c9fb05138e75ca5733313c95718e97b242ac32fd98feb37b56cdadb3166ec.jpg)

Figure 14.1: Gross National Income and Its Components: China versus the United States

one international interest rate $r^{*}$ ,  then Robinson’s factor income from his foreign wealth position is $r^{*}\!\cdot\!W$ . This is a positive number if Robinson has positive foreign wealth $W$ ,  meaning Robinson is a net creditor to Friday because he has exported more avocados to Friday in the past than Friday shipped to him. Conversely,  if Friday had shipped more avocados to Robinson in the past than she received back,  then Robinson’s $W$ would be negative,  meaning he would be a net borrower of Friday’s,  and $r^{*}\cdot W$ would therefore be a negative number: In other words,  Robinson would be paying more interest to Friday than she is paying him.

We now have collected the bits and pieces to state a country’s GNI:

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}+r^{*}\cdot W.
$$

Using the GDP identity $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=C+I+G+T B,      $ ,  GNI can also be split into its uses: private consumption $C_{s}$ ,  private domestic investment $I_{s}$ ,  government expenditures $G$ and,  in the open economy,  net exports $E X-I M=T B$ plus net international capital income,  so

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=C+I+G+T B+r^{*}\cdot W.
$$

National accountants like to have only a few terms for clarity,  so they bundle the trade balance TB together with the net transfers— ch is net international capital income $r^{*}\cdot W$ in our application— into the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance CA :

$$
C A=T B+r^{*}\cdot W.
$$

In national accounting terms,  GNI is therefore typically stated as

$$
Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=C+I+G+C A.
$$

Figure 14.1 shows the components of GNI for China and the United States as shares of GNI: $C/Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}\,      {+}\,      I/Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}\,      {+}\,      G/Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}\,      {+}\,      C A/Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=100\%$ . Over the past decade,  China has run a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus while the United States has run a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. Chinese residents consume less than two-ﬁfth of their national income. In contrast,  U.S. residents consume more than two-thirds of their national income. In China,  low consumption has allowed a whopping one-third of the income earned by individuals and corporations to go to Chinese capital formation over the past decade— that is,  to be invested in businesses to fuel output and economic growth. One-third is a very large investment rate—one rarely matched in history. In addition,  China invests almost 5 percent of its national income abroad. In the United States,  only about one-sixth of national income gets invested domestically. Moreover,  absorption—domestic consumption,  investment,  and government spending in the United States—adds up to more than 100 percent of GNI and exceeds the national income by more than three percent. The difference is ﬁnanced with credit from abroad,  mostly from China,  through a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. The red bars below zero show the U.S. [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits.

As a rule,  the decomposition of GNI into its uses is broken out as absorption $\left(C+I+G\right)$ and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance CA : $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=(C+I+G)+C A$ . But the decomposition of GDP into its uses is broken out as absorption $\left(C+I+G\right)$ and the trade balance it TB: $Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=\left(C+I+G\right)+T B$ . That is as it should be. We said the difference between GDP and GNI is a country’s net international capital income: $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}-Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=r^{*}\cdot W$ . The difference between a cou unt balance and trade balance is also the nation’s net international capital income: $C A-T B=r^{*}\cdot W$ − · . GNI therefore relates to the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] and absorption,  but GDP relates to the trade balance and absorption.

Wait a second,  you might be wondering. Earlier in our two-island example,  didn’t we treat the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] as if they were the same thing as an island’s trade balance? We did. We were allowed to do so initially because Robinson and Friday were meeting for the ﬁrst time. They never had any past trade relationships,  let alone any past trade imbalances,  so they started their relationship with no obligations to each other. Their foreign wealth position is zero at the outset,  $W\,      =\,      0$ . In this case,  any [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance is exactly equal to the trade balance $C A=T B$ because there are no international capital incomes yet.

Does all this detail matter,  you might ask? Yes and no. To ﬁgure out whether a country can sustain its foreign debt position in the long term,  and meet its international ﬁnancial obligations,  even a small difference between the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and the trade balance is all that matters,  as you will see in Chapter 17,  when we come to the possibility that countries exist for many generations and future generations can keep paying interest on old debt. In a long-lasting world,  it will be crucial that a country at least pay the interest on its internatio bt obligations $r^{*}\cdot W$ out of net exports in the long term. So,  we must watch the small number $r^{*}\cdot W$ · carefully to assess the sustainability of a country’s international debt.

Statistically,  the difference between GNI and GDP is often minor,  and we can quite safely assume that GDP equals GNI for many other purposes. Countries like Ireland,  Luxembourg and Kuwait,  which have large differences between their GDPs and GNIs,  are rare. In most countries,  GDP and GNI differ little. For example,  important international creditors (with a positive $W$ ) such as Germany and Japan have GNIs that have exceeded their GDPs by between only 0.7 and 2.4 percent on average since 2000. For the United States,  the world’s largest debtor (with a negative $W$ ),  GDP and GNI has differed by only 1.1 on average percent since 2000. For Australia and Spain,  other large foreign debtors (with a negative $W$ ),  GNI is lower than GDP by only 3.5 and 1.6 percent on average since 2000. For many empirical assessments we can therefore pretend that GDP and GNI are roughly equal. Depending on comparative advantage,  that is whether a country’s resources now or in the future are relatively more abundant,  a country will realize gains from being a borrower or a lender. Robinson just had a bumper harvest,  so his comparative advantage is in resources today and he should become a lender. Friday consequently has a comparative advantage in resources tomorrow and should become a borrower. As you will see,  both gain from borrowing and lending. There is no economic rationale to suggest that it is better for a country to be a lender or a borrower. Bumper harvests happen,  and so do bad crops. Comparative advantage only means that it is good to use net exports and net imports at different times to alleviate the vicissitudes of domestic economic production shocks and make one’s own consumption over time less bumpy than the harvests.

For the most part the trade balance of a country and its [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] differ little,  so let’s revisit the trade balances in Table 14.1 and reconsider the numbers with a credit interpretation. When it comes to capital ﬂows,  an alternative reading of the numbers is as follows. The Americas and Europe are regions with major [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits. These regions receive credit from abroad. Asia and the Middle East supply the international capital by running [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surpluses. Some economists refer to large [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surpluses and deﬁcits of countries as global imbalances .

Thinking back to the ﬁctitious politician from the beginning of the chapter,  we just found yet another way to reveal that his promises are contradictory. A positive [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance means that domestic residents are giving up some consumption,  investment,  or government expenditures,  which they could have used for their own good,  and are handing over national income to foreigners instead. A country’s positive trade balance increases the country’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and therefore results in a credit extended by domestic residents to foreigners,  which is a capital outﬂow. (In contrast,  a negative trade balance reduces a country’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] and results in credit received from foreigners and a capital inﬂow.) The politician cannot have it both ways: Your country can’t have both a positive trade balance and a net inﬂow of capital. It can only have one or the other.

# Balance of Payments Transactions

Two balance-of-payment entries can illustrate the link between net exports and net credit outﬂows. In the ﬁrst bookkeeping example,  we start with an export of goods from a country. If no matching imports of goods ﬂow back into the country,  it will end the year with an increase in net credit extended to foreigners (a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus). In the second bookkeeping example,  we start with a ﬁnancial investment outﬂow from the country. Once the ﬁnancial capital outﬂow results in an accompanying outﬂow of real goods,  the ﬁnancial investment becomes a real investment.

Suppose a Mexican farmer exports avocados worth 10,  000 Mexican Pesos (MXN) to a U.S. customer. The customer issues a check,  drawn on a U.S. bank for the equivalent of 10,  000 MXN. The check is denoted in USD but properly valued at the prevailing MXN/USD exchange rate (an exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another). The customer sends the check to the Mexican farmer. Now the Mexican national accountants get busy with the Mexico’s balance of payments. They receive a ﬁlled-out Mexican customs form stating that an amount of goods valued at MXN 10,  000 was exported to the United States and infer that a check or some other payment of equal value must have crossed the Mexican border in exchange. Because of the rules of double bookkeeping,  every transaction (every entry in the ledger) must result in both a credit in some account and in a debit in another account. The avocado export results in a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (CA) credit and a ﬁnancial account (FA) debit of MXN 10,  000. This entry is shown in the upper part of Table 14.2 as entry number $^{\prime\prime}1$ .”

Once the entry is in place,  the Mexican national accounts display a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus (credit with no matching debit) of MXN 10,  000 as it should be because Mexico now has a positive trade balance of MXN 10,  000 with the United States (there is no other transaction during the accounting period). The upper part of Table 14.2 shows the two according entries in the Mexican ledger with

Table 14.2: Mexico’s Balance of Payments After Avocado Exports to the United States

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1ec027a4bf834885a11c79144221feaf760f933088f8852cd5e4d5fe7713f28a.jpg)

transaction number “1.” On the other side of the border,  the U.S national accountants also get busy,  using the corresponding U.S. customs form for the avocado import. They book a CA debit valued at the U.S. dollar equivalent under the prevailing exchange rate,  resulting in a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit for the United States.

Typically,  banks in the export country won’t hold their claim on foreign banks in the form of checks. Rather they get a safer asset that also pays them a return. The most common internationally held asset is the U.S. Treasury bill. The U.S. government issues T-bills to raise short-term money for the federal government from private citizens or ﬁnancial institutions. The government pays the face value of the T-bill when it matures . Commonly T-bills have a maturity,  or payback time,  of 28 days,  91 days,  182 days,  and so forth. There is formally no interest on a T-bill but a T-bill is typically sold for less than the face value that the U.S. government will pay back at maturity. For instance,  a T-bill worth one U.S. dollar in 91 days may sell for just 97 cents when the United States government ﬁrst auctions it off today. The increase in value from 97 cents today to one dollar in 91 days is then the return on the T-bill for the investor.

Suppose the Mexican farmer’s bank buys a T-bill. It sends the original check over MXN 10,  000 back to a U.S. bank and acquires T-bills valued at MXN 10,  000. The Mexican national accountants receive the report of the ﬁnancial transaction and make another double entry. They ﬁrst cancel out the check by booking a ﬁnancial account (FA) credit of MXN 10,  000,  setting the FA balance to zero for a split moment. The accompanying debit is a new ﬁnancial account (FA) debit of MXN 10,  000 for holding the T-bill. Table 14.2 shows this second entry as number $^{\prime\prime}2^{\prime\prime}$ in the lower part.

Suppose this is all that happens between Mexico and the United States during the accounting period (a quarter or a year say). Where do the two countries stand? The Mexican national accountants touched the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (CA) only once (at the time the avocados were exported) so there is now a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus in Mexico. The ﬁnancial account (FA) balance is the mirror image of the net export in terms of the net credit Mexico has given the United States: At the end of the year there is a T-bill position on some Mexican bank’s balance sheet. Again,  our ﬁctitious politician must be wrong. A net exporter,  such as Mexico in our example,  gives its trading partner a net credit. A net export results in a capital outﬂow,  not a capital inﬂow.

Sometimes international transactions start on the ﬁnancial side. Suppose a U.S. resident invests in a Mexican avocado business by purchasing equity in it as a shareholder. Equity is a type of capital that comes with rights of ownership. Equity never matures in the sense that the Mexican farm never needs to repay the equity investments it receives. (But a shareholder can sell her shares to another

Table 14.3: The U.S. Balance of Payments After a U.S. Resident’s Investment in a Mexican Business

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/6f10e6fd038c8df474c46a11b76d49df3ae15d67ada071306fde911e89458c9e.jpg)

investor.) The proﬁts of the business are disbursed to the shareholders as dividends. Now suppose the national accountants in the United States receive a report stating that a U.S. resident has acquired shares worth USD 10,  000 in a Mexican farm. The accountants turn to the balance of payments and book this transaction as a ﬁnancial account (FA) credit for the check that the U.S. investor sends and,  by the rules of double-entry bookkeeping,  as a ﬁnancial account (FA) debit for the purchase of shares

 (a capital outﬂow from the United States). The upper part of Table 14.3 shows this entry as number

 $^{\prime\prime}1$ .” At this stage,  the ﬁnancial account (FA) balance is still zero (there is no other transaction during the accounting period yet). The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (CA) is also zero because it has not been touched yet. Why is there no real credit—that is,  a zero balance—showing in the current and in the ﬁnancial accounts of the United States? The reason is that,  at this stage,  Mexicans and U.S. citizens merely exchanged promises,  pieces of paper against pieces of paper. In exchange for a paper check,  the U.S. investor receives a paper document stating the equity stake she now owns. Financial paper balances do not show in the national accounts,  only real credits show.

However,  the balance changes as soon as the Mexican farmer turns around and acquires real equipment with the equity he raised from the U.S. investor. Suppose the farmer takes the check that he just got from the U.S. investor and uses it to acquire a tractor from a manufacturer in the United States. Now the U.S. national accountants get busy again. They receive a ﬁlled-out U.S. customs form showing a tractor worth USD 10,  000 exported,  and infer that a check,  or some other payment,  of equal value must have crossed the U.S. border in exchange. They book this transaction as a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (CA) credit of USD 10,  000 for the tractor export,  and they cancel the U.S. check from the balance of payments by booking a ﬁnancial account (FA) debit,  offsetting the initial FA credit for the check. The lower part of Table 14.3 shows that entry as number “2.” Now,  the U.S. [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (CA) shows a balance,  a surplus of USD 10,  000,  and the U.S. ﬁnancial account (FA) also shows a balance,  a net credit to foreigners of USD 10,  000. Once the Mexican recipient of U.S. ﬁnancial capital turns around to use it for a real investment,  then the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] (and the mirror ﬁnancial account) starts to show a real credit extended from the United States to Mexico. Again,  the ﬁctitious politician is proven wrong. A ﬁnancial investment abroad turns into a real investment only once it is accompanied by a net export. A net real capital outﬂow therefore is equivalent to a net export of goods.

# Savings,  Investment and the Current Account

There is yet another way to assess the ﬁctitious politician’s statement: We can simply do some math. In a closed economy,  savings equal investment. The avocados from Robinson’s pile that Robinson does not consume are his savings $S$ (savings is income less consumption spending). When the economy is closed,  there is only one use for these avocados. Robinson can dig the saved avocados into the ground as an investment $I$ for a larger harvest in the next period. Robinson does not have much of a [[Lecture 5- Dynamic Portfolio Choice|portfolio choice]] for his savings in a closed economy. There is only one asset: domestic capital $K$ . Investment is the amount of avocados used to form domestic capital. In other words,  the avocado seeds in the ground are the capital stock on Robinson’s island,  and we call the ﬂow of additional avocados that Robinson digs into the ground today’s investment.

Once the economy is open,  there are two assets in which Robinson can invest his savings. There is still domestic capital. The other asset is Friday’s handshakes. Robinson now has a [[Lecture 5- Dynamic Portfolio Choice|portfolio choice]] between the two assets. Friday shakes Robinson’s hand once per avocado shipped to her. The total number of handshakes Robinson receives that are not offset by any promises Robinson made to Friday,  are Robinson’s foreign wealth position $W$ . National accountants track the number of handshakes in a given accounting period (a quarter or a year say) in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]]. In other words,  the avocado claims in the form of handshakes increase Robinson’s foreign net wealth $W$ ,  and we call the ﬂow of additional avocados that Robinson hands over to Friday during a given accounting period the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance. The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance measures the amount of avocados used to build up foreign net wealth $W$ . Therefore,  in the open economy,  savings is equal to the sum of domestic investment,  which measures the newly formed domestic capital (the domestic asset),  and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance,  which measures the newly added foreign wealth (the foreign asset):

$$
{\boldsymbol{S}}={\boldsymbol{I}}+{\boldsymbol{C}}{\boldsymbol{A}}.
$$

For the mathematical proof of this statement,  let’s broaden our view and introduce government. Robinson’s government takes taxes $T$ out of Robinson’s income and uses the tax revenues $T$ to fund the government expenditures $G$ . Robinson’s savings are therefore all the avocados from his initial pile $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ after the government has taken away avocados as taxes $T$ and Robinson has taken his avocado consumption $C$ . This leaves private-sector savings:

$$
S^{P}=Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T-C.
$$

If the government raises more taxes than it needs for spending and runs a ﬁscal surplus,  then there is (public-sector) government savings:

$$
{\boldsymbol{S}}^{G}={\boldsymbol{T}}-{\boldsymbol{G}}.
$$

Conversely,  if the government takes in less taxes than it needs for spending and runs a ﬁscal deﬁcits,  then the public sector’s savings will be negative $(S^{G}=T-G<0)$ .

Regardless of their positive or negative signs,  we can add up private-sector and public-sector savings to arrive at the total savings of the economy: $S=S^{P}+\bar{S}^{G}$ . As we add up the two savings sources,  the tax transfer from Robinson to the government cancels out,  and we can replace national income $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ by its components $Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}=C+I+G+C A$ :

$$
S=S^{P}+S^{G}=\underbrace{Y^{\mathrm{GNI}}-T-C}_{=S^{P}}\underbrace{+T-G}_{=S^{G}}=\underbrace{C+I+G+C A}_{=Y^{\mathrm{GN}}}-C-G=I+C A.
$$

As we said before,  in an open economy $S=I+C A$ because savings can be invested in two assets: domestic capital formation with domestic investment $I$ and foreign wealth accumulation through $C A$ .

Figure 14.2: Sources of Current Account Financing

We can conclude that all the net shipments of domestic goods to foreigners,  as counted in the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]],  are domestic savings invested abroad. Net exports are net capital outﬂows. Foreign wealth,  the foreign asset,  is just a promise of future repayment,  however. Whether Friday digs the net imports of Robinson’s avocados into her ground or consumes them today is up to her. Investments in foreign net wealth are therefore inherently risky,  an issue to which we will return in upcoming chapters.

# Sources of Current Account Financing

There are a number of different assets used for international investments. One way to classify assets is by their maturity —the time it takes for borrower or the issuer of the asset to repay the principal and make the ﬁnal interest payment. You have already learned about the short-term asset most popular among international investors and central bankers: the U.S. T-bill. The T-bill with the shortest maturity is a 28-day T-bill. (The U.S. federal government,  as the borrower,  repays the principal within 28 days.) You have also learned about an extremely long-term asset used to make investments: equity. Its maturity is “inﬁnite.” It never needs to be repaid by the issuer. These and a number of other asset classes are tracked explicitly in the ﬁnancial account (FA) of a country’s balance of payments.

Entries in the ﬁnancial account (FA) show capital ﬂows by type. An economically important capital ﬂow is foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI is a parent ﬁrm’s investment in a new or existing afﬁliate ﬁrm it controls,  or intends to take control of,  in another country. FDI is the capital ﬂow through which a multinational ﬁrm (MNF) forms. The parent ﬁrm owns a signiﬁcant share of the afﬁliate’s equity,  so FDI implies that the parent ﬁrm controls or substantially inﬂuences on the foreign afﬁliate’s management.

Given its long-term nature,  FDI is less risky than other sources of international capital. In an economic downturn or crisis,  a foreign direct investment is less likely to be divested than other forms of capital,  which will tend to “ﬂee” to safer havens. FDI is typically more costly than other types of ﬁnancing,  though. For ﬁrms,  attracting foreign equity can be expensive. Countries trying to attract FDI must have stable institutions (transparent governments,  reliable courts,  and so on) to assure foreigners that their investments are safe there,  and that the proﬁts they earn can be repatriated (sent back to the parent company) and are taxed in a reliable and fair way. Since the parent ﬁrm is likely to transfer managerial expertise,  production knowledge and technologies to the afﬁliate,  economic policymakers believe foreign direct investments can greatly beneﬁt countries.

An investor who does not want to exert managerial control over a foreign company but hold equity in it so as to earn dividends can make a portfolio equity investment . A holding with less than ten percent voting power in a foreign company is typically not considered FDI but a portfolio equity investment. Some investors prefer to hold debt obligations rather than hold equity. These investors can make a portfolio debt investment by purchasing a foreign government’s bills or bonds or corporate debt securities ([[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]]) abroad.

Other capital ﬂows outside the private sector include government-to-government loans,  loans by international organizations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  and bank-to-government loans. These debt ﬂows have lost importance over the past decades,  as they shrank in numbers and magnitudes,  and the most recent IMF guidelines for the balance of payments do not even require they be shown separately. Finally,  central banks and monetary authorities around the world hold reserve assets . Reserves are assets such as gold or safe short-term securities denominated in a foreign currency—in practice mostly U.S. T-bills denominated in U.S. dollars and to some degree relatively safe German and French government bonds denominated in euros. Central bankers try to help manage the value of their home currencies by selling or purchasing reserve assets in the foreign exchange market. For example,  the Bank of Japan (BOJ),  Japan’s central bank,  quietly started to sell Yen and buy considerable amounts of dollar denominated assets in exchange throughout 2012. The Yen lost value against the U.S. dollar and other currencies,  and Japan’s exports and exporter earnings went up. The BOJ further accelerated its U.S. asset purchases under prime minister Shinz¯o Abe’s stimulus program called “Abenomics” in 2013 so aggressively that some foreign central bankers started to speak of a currency war. In Part IV of this book you will learn more about the effects of such currency interventions.

It is time to give our ﬁctitious politician a break. Perhaps he just misspoke. Maybe he wanted to say that,  in addition to making our economy a top net exporter,  “I will make sure that we attract foreign direct investment in excess of the equity investments that our residents make abroad. Large net equity inﬂows are what I mean by a top destination for investors.” Those two objectives are indeed feasible,  being a net exporter and being a net recipient of FDI inﬂows. China’s recent capital ﬂows are an example.

The left panel of Figure 14.2 shows how being a net exporter and a destination of net FDI inﬂows has been working for China over the past decade on a large scale. The bars stacked above the zero line show the types of capital ﬂowing out of China. The bars stacked below zero show the types of capital ﬂowing into China. The difference between the two ﬂows is the country’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance. The above-zero bars in the left panel of Figure 14.2 clearly exceed those below zero,  so China is running a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus. The surplus is in fact the largest net export balance in the world in several years. But among developing countries China is also one of the top destinations for FDI,  attracting more than $\mathrm{US}\S$ 100 billion of FDI per year over the past decade. How can both happen? How can China run a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus and still attract large equity inﬂows? The answer is a large-scale money recycling scheme. The Chinese monetary authorities intercept the capital inﬂows as the foreign checks come in,  pay their citizens and ﬁrms in Chinese Renminbi,  and acquire foreign reserves (mostly U.S. T-bills) with the checks,  so they don’t get much used for imports. Not only that,  the Chinese monetary authorities in fact acquire foreign reserves in excess of the amount of foreign capital inﬂows,  using Chinese Renminbi to buy additional T-bills,  so China ends up with a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus,  large reserves and a devalued Renminbi that is being sold to buy the foreign assets.

On the other side of the Chinese [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus sits the United States,  which is running a large-scale [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. The below-zero bars in the right panel of Figure 14.2 clearly exceeded the bars above zero,  on average,  between 2005 and 2011 by $\mathrm{US}\S~600$ billion. Except for the crisis year of 2009,  the United States receives capital inﬂows of more than $\mathrm{US}\S$ 600 billion per year,  and since 2007 net FDI ﬂows of more than $\mathrm{US}\S~100$ billion per year are moving out. The U.S. central bank group,  the Federal Reserve System,  does not actively manage the dollar exchange rate,  and the right panel of the ﬁgure shows that there is no relevant U.S. intervention in foreign reserves. Should the United States as a large-scale foreign borrower be worried?

# Think Twice about Convention: Mercantilism—Been There

Foreign borrowers tend to be worried,  historically and today. Ism ’s are fashionable again in the context of globalization. There are “liberalism,  ” “capitalism,  ” “colonialism,  ” and “imperialism” to name a few. And if those terms sound ancient,  just update them to “neo-liberalism,  ” “hypercapitalism,  ” and “ultra-imperialism.”

Perhaps the ﬁrst ism in international economic policy was mercantilism . Mercanti lists do not want to borrow any foreign capital. When the term “balance of trade” ﬁrst came into the vernacular early in 17 th-century England,  it appears that balance of trade meant equal values of exports and imports rather than today’s measure of the difference between export and import values.. The concept of net exports was known several centuries earlier than the term “balance of trade.” Price (1905,  p. 157) traces the concept back to 1381,  when an ofﬁcial of the mint was called before the English parliament and testiﬁed that money was ﬂowing out of “the kingdom” because of net imports. That was literally true at the time when international debt did not take the form of paper promises but was settled in gold or silver. Likewise,  ofﬁcials of the mint raised concerns in 1601 that England faced an “overbalancing of foreign commodities imported above home commodities vented” (Price 1905,  p. 162) along with precious metal outﬂows to pay for the net imports.

Mercanti lists believe their governments should control foreign trade to achieve a trade surplus. This economic doctrine dominated economic policy in Western Europe from the 16 th to the 18 th century,  and was prone to generating conﬂict. After all,  one country’s trade surplus is another country’s deﬁcit,  so it is impossible for all countries to maintain a trade surplus at all times. Nonetheless,  mercanti list governments imposed tariffs on imports and subsidized manufacturing exports,  both with the intention to raise net exports. France,  for example,  promoted the manufacturing and exporting of luxury textiles. As Jean-Baptiste Colbert,  the minister of ﬁnance under the French king Louis XIV famously remarked: “Fashion is to France what the gold mines of Peru are to Spain” (cited in Valerie Steele 1988,  p. 21).

What the minister perhaps did not realize was that running a surplus is not necessarily desirable because it means your residents must forego consumption and domestic investment. Piles of precious metals are neither edible nor productive,  so why hoard gold and silver rather than

Consume and invest? In our days and times,  when international credit does not result in precious metal ﬂows but rather in piles of paper or in computer ﬁles with virtual promises,  the virtue of running trade surpluses appears even less real. Moreover,  at least one country needs to volunteer and follow non-mercanti list trade policies so as to bear the trade deﬁcit that matches all of the other mercanti lists’ surpluses—unless we start trading with Martians and they run the trade deﬁcits.

# 14.3 The Fisher Model of International Capital Flows

If you look at international credit from a comparative advantage perspective,  there is little reason for borrowers to be concerned. The German poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe once remarked that when it comes to research,  everything has been thought of before. You simply need to think of it again. One approach to global investment and international capital markets is to rethink the capital ﬂows as if they were a special type of goods ﬂows. This idea leads to a clear view in favor of capitalmarket openness: The case made for free international capital markets is then the same as the case made for the free trade of goods “but for the labels.” Trade in this model is inter temporal trade . Inter temporal trade occurs when goods are traded today in exchange for the promise to receive a reverse goods ﬂow in the future. Robinson’s trading of avocados today for avocados later on is an example of inter temporal trade. Instead of labeling two goods as “avocados” and “motorcycles” as before,  we now label them “avocados today” and “avocados tomorrow.” We already know that there are gains from trade for both trading partners. There are also gains from inter temporal trade for both borrowers and lenders.

The remaining task for us is to carefully translate the variable deﬁnitions from the model of trade in goods to the new model of inter temporal trade. Irving Fisher (1930) was one of the ﬁrst to do so. Consequently,  the basic model used to make inter temporal savings and consumption decisions is named after him. We extend his idea to an international capital market here.

# Inter temporal Production Possibilities

The starting point is a pile of avocados that just fell from Friday’s avocado trees. These avocados are Friday’s GDP and national income today $Y_{t o d a y}^{\mathrm{GDP}}=Y_{t o d a y}^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ . There is no choice to be made about the size of the avocado pile today. Today’s avocado harvest is determined by Friday’s past planting decisions,  so we just denote it with $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}$ . Friday is about to meet Robinson for the ﬁrst time. Therefore Friday and Robinson do not yet have any debt obligation to each other,  and Friday’s GDP and national income are the same. Friday cares about two things (as does Robinson): consumption today and consumption tomorrow. Figure 14.3 depicts Friday’s resources today on the horizontal axis and her resources tomorrow on the vertical axis.

Suppose Friday knows exactly how many avocados her trees will yield tomorrow if she plants avocados in the ground today. (Of course,  avocado trees actually take years to grow and produce fruit. To keep the analysis simple,  we’ve shortened the timeframe and assumed away any risk.) Her avocado investment $I$ today will be transformed into future avocados with a given production function

$$
Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GDP}}=F\big (I_{t o d a y}\big).
$$

Figure 14.3: Inter temporal Production Possibilities,  Savings,  and Investment

The left panel of Figure 14.3 depicts this inter temporal production function,  labeled PPF. Now PPF stands for the inter temporal production possibility frontier . The inter temporal PPF shows the maximum output of future avocados for any given amount of invested avocados today. The slope of the inter temporal PPF is the opportunity cost of today’s avocados (resources on the horizontal axis) in terms of future avocados (resources on the vertical axis). Because any avocado planted in the ground is an avocado not consumed today,  investment $I_{t o d a y}$ increases as we move from right to left along the horizontal axis. The investment arrow shown in the left panel of Figure 14.3 starts at the level of Friday’s avocado pile today $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}$ . If she does not plant a single avocado,  there is no investment arrow,  so her avocado output tomorrow will be zero: $Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GDP}}=F (0)=0$ . The grey dot on the horizontal axis of the left panel Figure 14.3 shows this point. At the other extreme,  Friday can achieve the largest possible output tomorrow by planting the entire pile of avocados today. The point of maximal production tomorrow is shown with a grey dot on the vertical axis.

The PPF is not a straight line but is instead belly shaped. This means there are diminishing returns to the avocado investment. The bellyshaped PPF implies that planting more and more avocados today will yield a larger and larger harvest tomorrow,  but planting double the number of them will result in less than double the harvest. The avocado yield will also depend on the nutrients and minerals in the soil,  and those nutrients are limited so that more avocado seeds will result in a less-than-proportional increase in the harvest. Translated to modern banking and ﬁnance,  the additional investment by Friday will not yield proportionally higher returns because

# Fundamentals

- Key force : Different returns to investment (Different opportunity cost of resources over time)
 - Factors of production: 1 (resources today,  planted avocados used as capital)
 - Factor mobility: resources (capital) mobile across borders; invested resources today productive tomorrow
 - Sectors (goods): 1 (avocados).
 Resources tomorrow $Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GDP}}\,      =\,       F (I_{t o d a y})$ made from resources today (planted avocados)
 - Production stages: 1 single ﬁnal stage
Other production factors used to produce the avocados are limited.

Typically,  Friday will choose some consumption today and some consumption tomorrow. To be able to consume some avocados both today and tomorrow in autarky (when her economy is still closed) Friday must set aside a part of the avocado pile today for savings. The right panel of Figure 14.3 shows this scenario. The black dot is Friday’s inter temporal production choice and also her inter temporal consumption choice. In autarky,  the two choices are the same. The horizontal arrow pointing to the right shows Friday’s consumption today $C_{t o d a y}$ . The remainder of the

Initial avocado pile $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}-C_{t o d a y}$ is Friday’s savings: $S_{t o d a y}=\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}-C_{t o d a y}$ n a closed economy,  the only asset in which savings can be invested is domestic capital: $S_{t o d a y}\,      =\,       I_{t o d a y}$ . This investment is shown with the horizontal arrow that points from right to left.

# The Terms of Inter temporal Trade

Friday’s inter temporal PPF is steep,  starting at a relatively low base on the horizontal axis (the initial avocado pile) and reaching relatively high on the vertical axis. Suppose Friday’s PPF is steeper than Robinson’s. A bumper harvest today,  as in our example before,  will make Robinson’s PPF relatively wide in the horizontal dimension. In that case,  we can say Friday has a comparative advantage when it comes to producing resources in the future. Conversely,  Robinson has a comparative advantage when it comes to producing resources today. It is then to everyone’s beneﬁt if Robinson shares some of his relatively abundant resources today with Friday through lending,  and Friday repays him tomorrow when her avocado resources are relatively abundant. Friday’s comparative advantage in the production of future resources implies that she will become a borrower after globalization.

Let’s take this slowly. The relative price of resources today is the amount of resources required for repayment tomorrow. The repayment of one borrowed avocado tomorrow must include both the principal,  one avocado,  and the interest $r^{*}$ . The sum of the principal unit and the interest rate is called the interest factor $1+r^{*}$ . For any resource lent or borrowed today,  $1+r^{*}$ is the amount of resources required as repayment tomorrow. In other words,  $1+r^{*}$ is the relative price of resources today in terms of resources tomorrow. Similar to trade in goods,  we can call the relative price of resources the inter temporal terms of trade $1+r^{*}$ . This interest factor,  the inter temporal terms of trade after globalization,  must be lower than Friday’s autarky price of resources today if Friday is to become a borrower. Friday takes in extra resources from Robinson today only if they come at a lower price than she faces for today’s resources in autarky. As a consequence,  once both islands are open to capital ﬂows,  the relative price of resources today,  namely the interest factor $1+r^{*}$ ,  must be lower than Friday’s opportunity cost of resources today.

In an open international capital market,  Friday and Robinson will exchange resources today for resources tomorrow. We can bring an inter temporal trade line into our diagram. We know the slope of the international trade line: the (negative) interest factor $-(1+r^{*})$ ,  because $1+r^{*}$ is the relative price of the good on the horizontal axis (resources today) in terms of the good on the vertical axis (resources tomorrow). But we do not know the position of the international trade line. Where should Friday optimally place the inter temporal trade line? That is,  how many avocados should she optimally invest today for tomorrow’s production? She uses a ruler,  keeps it at an angle with exactly the slope of the international trade line,  and then slides the ruler towards the origin until it just touches her PPF. It is optimal for Friday to have the trade line touch the PPF. The reason is twofold. On the one hand,  Friday cannot keep the inter temporal trade line above her PPF because she cannot produce enough resources tomorrow to follow through on any trade on such a far-out trade line. A higher inter temporal trade line is simply not viable. On the other hand,  Friday would not want the inter temporal trade line to move any lower than the point of tangency because she would have to settle for combinations of consumption today and tomorrow that are smaller than necessary. A lower inter temporal trade line would be feasible but not optimal.

For these reasons,  Friday has the inter temporal trade line exactly touch her PPF. The point of tangency shows along the horizontal dimension the amount of investment Friday should optimally choose. The distance between the origin of the PPF on the horizontal line (the initial pile of avocados) and the horizontal coordinate of the tangency point is indicated by the investment arrow in the left panel of Figure 14.4. This investment is the number of avocados that Friday optimally plants. Her future avocado production is the vertical coordinate of the tangency point. The left panel of Figure 14.4 depicts the production choice with a black dot labeled $W$ for world equilibrium. As a point of reference,  the diagram also shows her ideal production and consumption in autarky,  which corresponds to point $A$ .

At any other production level than the one depicted at $W$ in the left panel of Figure 14.4,  Friday would lose out on returns that she could earn. At this stage,  it is not clear yet whether Friday will end up being borrower or lender. Friday only takes the perspective of the businesses in her economy,  making an investment decision between two assets: avocados invested as seeds for production at home versus avocados given to foreigners at the prospective return of $1+r^{*}$ If Friday invested less than at the point $W$ today,  the returns on the smaller domestic investment would exceed the returns from getting a foreign asset with return $1+r^{*}$ . The reason is that the slope of the PPF is steeper for lower investment levels than at $W$ ,  so additional investment in domestic production is worthwhile for her business sector at any point to the right of $W$ . Conversely,  if Friday invested more today than $W$ ,  then the returns to production would fall short of the returns to foreign assets because the slope of the PPF is ﬂatter to the left of $W$ . Less investment in domestic capital,  and more foreign assets at a return $1\!+\! R^{*}$ ,  would be preferable. Only at the point $W$ is Friday’s business sector in different between investing in domestic capital or investing in foreign assets,  so at $W$ in the left panel of Figure 14.4 her business sector’s choice is optimal. In other words,  the ﬁrst $W$ point shows the optimal investment and production decision.

How much should Friday save in total? An equivalent question is,  what is Friday’s optimal consumption choice? Friday will pick a consumption combination on the inter temporal trade line. She cannot do better because consumption combinations to the right and above the inter temporal trade line are not affordable to her. She would also not want to do worse and consume below the inter temporal trade line because she can raise consumption in at least one period by moving onto the inter temporal trade line.

For given inter temporal terms of trade,  the typical preference of a consumer sits on a ray from the origin,  such as the ray depicted with the dotted line in the right panel of Figure 14.4. Compared to the autarky point $A_{c}$ ,  resources today have become relatively cheaper for Friday at the new inter temporal terms of trade $1+r^{*}$ ,  its slope is ﬂatter than the slope of the PPF in autarky A . A relative price change like this typically means that a consumer will now want to spend a larger share of consumption on resources today. For example,  if a consumer used to spend 20 percent of her lifetime expenditures on

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/7521d98c1d02967efde5a9a0101dc65f5893dcc95eea6e4910eaca173f0c7d32.jpg)

Figure 14.4: Inter temporal Trade

Resources today when their opportunity cost was relatively high,  then she would now want to spend a larger share,  such as 30 percent,  on resources today. When the inter temporal terms of trade drop to a level $\boldsymbol{1}\!+\!\boldsymbol{r}^{*}$ below the opportunity cost (the relative price in autarky),  the ray of consumption choices from the origin turns downwards. The ray of consumption choices in the right panel of Figure 14.4 therefore runs below the autarky point $A$ .

Friday’s consumption point $W$ in world equilibrium sits at the intersection of the dotted consumption ray with the green inter temporal trade line. She now has more consumption both today and tomorrow. In the case shown in the right panel of Figure 14.4,  her avocado consumption today exceeds even her initial pile of avocados $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}$ . And there is more investment than in autarky. How is this large amount of consumption and investment today possible beyond even the initial pile of avocados? Friday runs a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit,  drawing in extra resources today from abroad.

We can ﬁgure out the size of her [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. Her savings are $S_{t o d a y}=\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}-C_{t o d a y},      $ and this is a negative number in the right panel of Figure 14.4 because her consumption today exceeds her initial level of resources (pile of avocados). The gap between the initial pile of avocados $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}$ and her consumption $C_{t o d a y}$ shows this negative savings,  which was brought about by her borrowing from abroad.

The full [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance is Friday’s savings less her investment $C A_{t o d a y}=S_{t o d a y}-I_{t o d a y}<0$ . The account balance is clearly a negative number because her savings is negative and her investment is positive as depicted. Friday’s total [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit today therefore equals the length of the investment arrow plus the gap between $\bar{Y}_{t o d a y}$ and $C_{t o d a y}$ . The horizontal red bar in the right panel of Figure 14.4 depicts the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit. Since Friday and Robinson start their trading relationship with no obligations to each other,  Friday’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit today is also her trade deﬁcit: $C A_{t o d a y}=T B_{t o d a y}<0$ .

Friday’s payback time is tomorrow. Even though she harvests $Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GDP}},      $ ,  she only gets to consume $C_{t o m o r r o w}$ . She must use the remaining avocados to pay back both the principal $C A_{t o d a y}$ and the interest $r^{*}\cdot C A_{t o d a y}$ : $T B_{t o d a y}=-(1+r^{*}) C A_{t o d a y}>0$ and in the process run a trade surplus tomorrow. The trade surplus tomorrow is indicated by the vertical red bar in the right panel of Figure 14.4.

The red triangle shows the inter temporal trade ﬂows between Friday and Robinson. Its end points are her two $W$ decision points in world equilibrium: The upper-left $W$ point depicts her production choice,  and the lower-right $W$ point shows her consumption choice. The horizontal side of the triangle shows the optimal amount of avocados Friday borrows today. She then repays the loan tomorrow with the corresponding amount of avocados represented by the vertical side of the red triangle.

# Change of Perspective: Imperialism—Done That

Aspects associated with international capital mobility have long been the source of discontent for people. An inﬂuential publication on the topic was John Atkinson Hobson’s (1902) Imperialism: A Study ,  published in 1902. Hobson,  an English economist and early socialist who had served in colonial wars in South Africa,  argued that corporate proﬁts,  concentrated in the hands of monopoly capitalists,  were largely saved,  not consumed. He believed this was bad because domestic investment opportunities for these savings in the monopolists’ home countries,  such as England,  were becoming limited and less proﬁtable. As a result,  the monopolists needed new places to invest. These wealthy investors,  in turn,  pressured their governments to colonize and rule foreign territories in order to open markets for new investments as well as safeguard the monopolists’ existing foreign investments. This helped protect the monopolists’ domestic markets from foreign competition at the same time. As Hobson,  p. 103 put it:

The economic root of Imperalism is the desire of strong organised industrial and ﬁ- nancial interests to secure and develop at the public expense and by the public force private markets for their surplus goods and their surplus capital. War,  militarism,  and “spirited foreign policy” are the necessary means to this end… . [P]rotection not only serves the purposes of imperial ﬁnance,  taxing the impotent and ignorant consumer for the imperial gains of the inﬂuential economic interests,  but it seems to furnish them a second gain by securing to them as producers their home market which is threatened by outside competition,  and enabling them to raise their prices to the home consumers and so reap a rise in proﬁts.

Even though he was a socialist,  some of Hobson’s arguments are similar to those free-market economists make about the ills of a lack of competition. In fact,  the founding father of economics Adam Smith (1776,  IV. 8.53 and IV. 8.54) wrote in his treatise An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations that it made little sense to support monopoly trading companies with the colonies “for the sole purpose of raising up a nation of customers who should be obliged to buy from the shops of our different producers all the goods with which these could supply them… . It cannot be very difﬁcult to determine who have been the contrivers of this whole mercantile

System; not the consumers,  we may believe,  whose interest has been entirely neglected; but the producers,  whose interest has been so carefully attended to.”

One of Hobson’s most prominent fans (as regards the subject) and critics (when it comes to speciﬁc arguments) was the Russian socialist Vladimir Ilyich Lenin,  who himself in 1917 published a book on the topic,  which is entitled Imperialism,  the Highest Stage of Capitalism . Ironically,  prior to the publication of Lenin’s book,  Hobson had started to distance himself from his earlier conclusions. As Hobson biographer Peter Cain (2002,  p. 239) observes,  between 1902 and 1914,  Hobson developed the view that imperialism was a transition ary phase in the development of the world economy and felt that,  if capitalism was purged of the problems of monopoly and inequality,  the spread of free international trade would lead to the emergence of a just system. The First World War,  however,  overturned that optimistic view,  as the war appeared to Hobson like Imperialism at its worst,  and led him back to his position from 1902.

# 14.4 Inter temporal Trade: Theory and Empirics

Opening a country to international capital markets allows the economy to separate the investment and production choices in the business sector from the savings and consumption choices by the households. Similar to trade in goods,  this separation of production from consumption is the profound source of gains from inter temporal trade. These conceptual gains from globalized capital markets depend on the decoupling of domestic investment from savings. Next,  we’ll look at the evidence how dissociated domestic investment has become from savings and whether tightly integrated international ﬁnancial markets have indeed helped us reap the full gains from inter temporal trade.

# The Gains from Inter temporal Trade

Friday beneﬁts from opening up her island to the international capital market. The potential gains from inter temporal trade are all the consumption choices on or below the green inter temporal trade line that are newly affordable to her but were not affordable in autarky. In autarky,  Friday could only consume on or below her PPF. The shaded green area of the left panel of Figure 14.5 depicts the potential gains. Friday’s realized gains are apparent from her chosen consumption point $W$ at the intersection of the consumption ray with the inter temporal trade line. She can now afford more consumption both today and tomorrow. Similar to the case of trade in goods,  two points $W$ characterize the world equilibrium for inter temporal trade: The investment decision behind the upper-left point $W$ is now separated from the savings decision behind the lower-right point $W$ . In contrast,  the investment decision in autarky was identical to the savings choice so that the autarky equilibrium resulted in a single point $A$ . The separation of investment and savings decisions is is what gives rise to the gains from inter temporal trade. Essentially,  a nation’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] “unchains” domestic investment from domestic savings.

A similar analysis shows that Robinson also receives gains from inter temporal trade,  but let’s defer the formal derivation of his gains to the next Chapter 15. To understand the source of Robinson’s gains,  we can think back to the difference between gross domestic production (GDP) and gross national income (GNI). After having lent avocados to Friday,  Robinson has a claim on Friday’s GDP tomorrow: Some of Friday’s GDP is actually Robinson’s income GNI now. To be precise,  the interest payment $r^{*}C A_{t o d a y}$ comes out of Friday’s avocado production,  but it is Robinson’s interest income,

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/bdd666a5621d324942bfd6848a147a4602d5046c084b2585030ef564d79c4f63.jpg)

Figure 14.5: The Gains from Inter temporal Trade

Which compensates him tomorrow for foregoing avocado consumption today. Conversely,  Friday’s national income tomorrow is less than her production tomorrow $Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GNI}}=Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GDP}}+r^{*}C A_{t o d a y},      $ ,  and her GNI is smaller than her GDP because her [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance today $C A_{t o d a y}$ is negative. The right panel of Figure 14.5 displays $Y_{t o m o r r o w}^{\mathrm{GNI}}$ on the vertical axis along with the repayment of the principal $C A_{t o m o r r o w}=-C A_{t o d a y}$ and the interest payment $r^{*}C A_{t o d a y}<0$ .

When Friday wakes up today,  she has zero foreign wealth: $W_{t o d a y}\;=\; 0$ . Friday then borrows avocados today. She uses her borrowed avocados for both investment in her own production and for consumption today. Friday’s net asset position with Robinson,  that is her foreign wealth position (the number handshakes she gave: one for each net avocado import),  $W_{t o m o r r o w}$ is negative at sunrise tomorrow. Today’s [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcit is counted against her foreign wealth position tomorrow: $W_{\mathrm{tomorrow}}\,      =\,       C A_{t o d a y}+W_{\mathrm{today}}\,      =\,       C A_{t o d a y}\,      <\,      0.$ . (From Robinson’s point of view,  resources (avocados) that ﬂow through his [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] build up his foreign wealth: $C A_{t o d a y}=W_{\mathrm{tomorrow}}-W_{\mathrm{today}}>0.$ ) Since the world ends after tomorrow,  Friday runs a [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surplus tomorrow that exactly pays back the principal $C A_{t o m o r r o w}\,      =\,      -C A_{t o d a y}\,      >\,       0$ . Therefore $W$ is zero again at sunset tomorrow. Friday’s trade balance tomorrow $T\! B_{t o m o r r o w}$ is the sum of her [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance and her interest payments,  a surplus as it should be:

$$
T B_{t o m o r o w}=C A_{t o m o r o w}-r^{*}C A_{t o d a y}=-C A_{t o d a y}-r^{*}C A_{t o d a y}=-(1+r^{*}) C A_{t o d a y}>0.
$$

In the Fisher model,  we treated consumption and investment all as private. But in reality,  there is government. A government can be part of those decisions,  using some government spending $G$ for consumption purposes and other spending for investment such as on infrastructure. A broader interpretation of the Fisher model is therefore that the consumption and investment choices are the result of both private-sector decisions and the government decisions.

Figure 14.6: Savings,  Investment and the Current Account Balance

# Intertemporal Trade in Practice

In the presence of an international capital market a country’s residents can choose investment and consumption independently. When an economy faces a present need of large investments but insufﬁ- cient savings rates,  it can fund its investments by borrowing abroad. When an economy experiences temporarily less-attractive investment opportunities at home,  it can lend abroad and enjoy higher returns.

Figure 14.6 shows savings,  investment and the [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance for Canada and Ireland over the past four decades. In any given year,  the difference between the savings and investment of the countries equals their [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balances. Whenever their savings exceed their investment,  the countries’ residents invest abroad. Whenever their savings are less than their investment,  foreign residents make up the difference and provide the required resources as a loan. As the two economies grow over time,  so do savings and investment. The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balance,  however—at least of these two countires—has ﬂuctuated around the zero level. Quite similar to our two-period model,  these two countries’ residents repay their [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] deﬁcits with later [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] surpluses,  and vice versa. For larger countries,  in contrast,  uc tu at ions around zero can be slower and reversals of [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|current account]] balances may take decades.

Now that we know the beneﬁts the international capital market should provide,  how well does it perform this function? In other words,  how truly integrated is the international capital market? In a famous test,  Martin Feldstein and Charles Horioka (1980) checked whether domestic savings are indeed fully decoupled from domestic investment decisions. If world ﬁnancial markets are fully integrated,  then the Fisher model of inter temporal trade implies that observed savings $S$ and domestic investment $I$ should be completely unrelated. The independence of savings from investment means for an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that in a regression of investment per GDP $I/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ on a constant and savings per GDP $S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ ,  the slope coefﬁcient on $S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ should be zero:

$$
I/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=c o n s t a n t+0\cdot S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}.
$$

Conversely,  in a completely closed economy,  savings per GDP $S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ equals investment per GDP

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/e9b8cf0b124c02d0ce332b2203a154a8c150fb06f4dfff89b29e1e837db8143a.jpg)

Source : World Development Indicators 2013. Notes : Fit left panel $I/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=. 096+. 521\cdot S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ ( . 004) ( . 018) (134 countries),  right $I/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}=. 117+. 313\cdot S/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ (139 countries).

$I/Y^{\mathrm{GDP}}$ ,  so that the slope coefﬁcient should be one. The slope coefﬁcient therefore offers a measure of capital market integration: If the slope coefﬁcient is close to zero,  then the international capital market is almost fully integrated. Conversely,  if the slope coefﬁcient is close to one,  then the international capital market is hardly integrated at all.

Figure 14.7 shows the association between a country’s investment share and savings share in GDP for the two most recent decades,  1991-2000 and 2001-2010. The samples include more than 130 developing and industrialized countries. One dot in the graph represents a country in a given year. Unlike the prediction of the Fisher model of inter temporal trade,  the graph shows that investment is clearly positively related to domestic savings. However,  the magnitude of the slope coefﬁcient has been dropping. It fell from roughly half in 1991-2000 to less than a third in 2001-2010. In other words,  the international ﬁnancial market is not yet fully integrated but it is getting more integrated over time. There appear to be more inter temporal gains from trade than the world’s ﬁnancial markets are currently realizing.

Why might there be a positive association between a country’s investment share in GDP and its savings share? The question besets international macro economists who named this the FeldsteinHorioka puzzle after the ﬁrst two economists who ran a regression like the ﬁtted lines in Figure 14.7. As with many regression results,  one explanation is that there is an omitted third variable that correlates both with the dependent variable and with the regressor in the regression. The third variable might be related to demographics or productivity. One example is a fast-growing population that tends to save for future generations and anticipates expanding its production in the future. Another example is an economy with fast productivity growth in which the working generation saves whereas the retired generation draws down its previous savings. In an economy such as this,  faster productivity growth encourages both more investment and more savings. If these or similar omitted shocks raise both a country’s investment rate and a country’s savings rate,  then the evidence does not necessarily refute the Fisher model of inter temporal trade,  it mainly suggests we need to complete the model. Another set of explanations has to do with so-called ﬁnancial frictions—contractual problems in international lending that impede international capital ﬂows. This is something we will look at in other chapters.

What explains the deeper integration in international ﬁnancial activity in recent years? What happens if we consider tomorrow’s returns to be risky? Will there be further gains? The answer will be yes. Will there be new problems? That answer will also be yes. How can policymakers mitigate problems related to international ﬁnancial activity without reducing the beneﬁts of capital mobility? We will examine these questions later as well.

# Summary and Outlook

The principle of comparative advantage explains why countries globalize ,  which is the ﬁrst theme of this book. When we consider international capital markets,  the principle of comparative advantage applies to the trade of resources over time: inter temporal trade . Comparative advantage is based on a double comparison. Not only do we need to compare two economies’ availability of resources,  we also need to look at the availability of resources presently and in the future within each economy. By the nature of this double comparison,  every economy must have a comparative advantage either in available resources today or in the future.

The Fisher model of inter temporal trade puts the principle of comparative advantage to work and predicts that a country with relatively scarce resources today will be a borrower in international capital markets. The country will use its relatively abundant resources in the future to repay its obligations to foreign investors. Conversely,  a country with relatively abundant resources today will be a lender. There are several types of international investment,  directed to different assets. Private capital ﬂows have overtaken ofﬁcial government lending in magnitude during recent decades. Among the least risky and potentially most beneﬁcial types of capital ﬂows is foreign direct investment,  by which the investing parent company acquires a controlling stake in the management of a foreign afﬁliate. Foreign direct investment brings managerial expertise and technical knowledge to the afﬁliate. But foreign direct investment can be costly to attract because it shies away from unreliable institutions. These are answers to the second theme of this book,  how countries globalize in international capital markets.

As to the third theme,  should countries globalize ? The principle of comparative advantage predicts that inter temporal trade makes both borrower and lender countries better off because each country’s inter temporal consumption possibilities after capital-market integration are always at least as large as their production possibilities when the countries were closed,  and generally larger (except for the unlikely case when production technologies and resource endowments are identical around the world). The fundamental source of the gains from inter temporal trade is the separation of the savings decisions of households from producers’ investment decisions. Empirical data suggest,  however,  that the separation of savings and investment decisions is not complete,  so further integration of the world’s ﬁnancial markets may yield additional gains.

The Fisher model of inter temporal trade is our baseline model for capital market analysis. Countries in need of large investments but in suf cie nt savings rates can fund their capital requirements for growth by borrowing abroad. Foreign borrowing brings additional imports to the economy and an open question for the upcoming chapter is how the trade deﬁcit affects the location of industries when there is more than just one good. Countries with temporarily less-attractive investment opportunities at home can lend abroad and enjoy higher return. Foreign lending is risky,  however,  because countries are sovereign,  so no court system can completely ensure lenders will get repaid.
