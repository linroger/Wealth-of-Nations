The Great Doubling of the Global Workforce

Some of the most consequential changes to the global economy don’t make big news. When you think about the striking images from your recent morning news show or podcast,  chances are that you recall pictures of an extreme weather event,  a major sports ﬁgure,  or stories on political breakthroughs or failures in the headlines. By contrast,  the Great Doubling of the global workforce never made it into the headlines,  even though it is arguably the most signiﬁcant economic change we have witnessed in decades. Its consequences are still playing out.

The globalized labor force in the world’s open economies in 1980 consisted of roughly 1 billion people. By 2000,  the population growth in those open economies had increased the number to about 1.5 billion workers. However,  during this same time period,  the Soviet Union collapsed,  and with it socialism in this country and its neighbors. Meanwhile,  China shifted to capitalism,  and India adopted open-market policies. As they globalized,  workforces in these economies contributed another 1.5 billion workers to the global labor pool—effectively doubling the size of the world’s nowconnected workforce to 3 billion people. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard University calls this expansion of the global labor pool the Great Doubling. How have production arrangements and trade responded? How have workers been affected? Which sectors expanded and will continue to expand? Which will not? Where will individual industries be located in this newly specializing world?

To answer those questions,  this chapter puts Ricardo’s ideas and the principle of comparative advantage to work: ﬁrst in a world with two sectors,  and then in a richer world with many industries. Similar to the preceding chapter,  the production possibility frontier (PPF) is a powerful graphical device to summarize comparative advantage when there are just two sectors. To study how globalization shifts the number of industries between countries,  we need to consider more than just two sectors. When there are many industries,  then a close relative of the PPF—the schedule of cross-country productivity gaps—proves to be an even more potent graphical tool. It teaches us the important business lesson that under globalization it is not enough to just watch competitors in your own industry,  you need to observe the comparative advantage of industries outside your own because those industries compete for the same local resources. A natural by-product of the Ricardian model with many industries is the empirically powerful gravity equation. Upcoming chapters will return to the Ricardian model with many industries to understand how globalization and economic growth relate,  and how the real exchange rate and international capital ﬂows affect the global location of industries.

# Learning Objectives

After reading this chapter you should be able to:

LO 1 Deﬁne the terms of trade and explain how they change in response to population growth and productivity changes. LO 2 Understand the differences between sectoral competitiveness,  economy-wide competitiveness and the principle of comparative advantage. LO 3 Apply the principle of comparative advantage to the case of many industries,  compare an industry’s cross-country productivity gap to the cross-county wage gap,  and explain how population growth and productivity changes alter the location of industries. LO 4 List components of the gravity equation of trade and describe how they relate to Ricardian trade theory.

# 3.1 Two Sectors,  the Terms of Trade and Productivity Changes

The Ricardian trade model equips us with the tools to analyze what consequences the Great Doubling may have for the world economy. The principle of comparative advantage predicts the direction of trade ﬂows and the pattern of specialization. Free markets provide the right price incentives to each country’s producers so that they will indeed specialize in the goods in which they have the lower opportunity cost of producing.

Once economies are open to free trade,  the relative world price of one good in terms of the other is going to lie between the opportunity costs of producing it in the countries. We now study this world price ratio carefully,  and give it a name of its own: the terms of trade .

The terms of trade (ToT) are a ratio of product prices on the world market. If there are only two sectors,  then the terms of trade are the price of a country’s exported good divided by the price of the country’s imported good on the world market:

$$
\mathrm{ToT}=P_{\mathrm{Expert\,    good}}/P_{\mathrm{Import\,    good}}.
$$ 

If there are only two economies,  then one economy’s terms of trade are the inverse of the other economy’s terms of trade. Take the example with California and Mexico as trading partners,  and avocados and motorcycles as the two sectors. California’s terms of trade are $P_{M}/P_{A}$ if it exports motorcycles,  and Mexico’s terms of trade are $P_{A}/P_{M}$ if Mexico exports avocados. With only two economies,  each one imports the other’s exports.

We can generalize this example. For convenience,  let’s label the two economies in our ex∗ ample “home” (we) and “foreign ” (the foreign economy includes the globalized countries in the rest of the world). The main economic sectors for global trade are agriculture (avocado growers in the example) and manufacturing (motorcycle makers). Figure 3.1 shows the production possibility frontiers (PPFs) of the home economy and ∗ the foreign economy (Foreign ),  and the two sectors,  agriculture and manufacturing. The PPF of each economy is a black line. The slope of the line equals the economy’s opportunity cost. If an economy is closed,  consumers can at most afford choices on the economy’s PPF as shown in panel (a) of Figure 3.1. When economists refer to a closed economy—that is,  one that does not engage in global trade—-they refer to the economy as being in a state of autarky . An economy in autarky relies on its own resources (that is literally what the Greek word autarky means).

# Fundamentals

- Key force : Differences in technology (constant labor productivity by local sector)
 - Factors of production: 1 (labor $L$ )
 - Factor mobility: Factor mobile between sectors,  immobile across borders
 - Sectors (goods): 2. Agriculture $Q_{A}$ and Manufacturing $Q_{M,    }$ ,  made with $L$ • Production stages: 1 single ﬁnal stage ∗
 - Countries: 2 (Home and Foreign )
 - Perfect competition,  transportation costs: 0
 - Constant returns to scale
 - Balanced trade
 - Contracts perfectly enforceable People have better consumption choices in an open economy than in autarky. To show this,  let’s begin by looking at panel (b) of Figure 3.1. The green international trade lines in the graph have a slope that equals the relative equilibrium price of the manufactured good and the agricultural good: $P_{M}/P_{A}$ . (The price of the manufactured good is in the numerator because the good is on the horizontal axis.) Therefore,  the slope of each green international trade line is equal to the terms of trade for the home economy. Consumers can afford any consumption choice on their economy’s green trade line,  and those are better than on the economy’s production possibility frontier.

The home economy specializes in the manufactured good. The rest of the world exports the agri∗ cultural good to the home economy,  so the terms of trade for the foreign economy are equal to the inverse of the slope of the international trade line $(P_{A}/P_{M})$ . In general,  the slope of the international trade line reﬂects the terms of trade if the horizontal-axis good is exported,  and shows the inverse of the terms of trade if the horizontal-axis good is imported. Under free trade,  the resulting exchange of goods forms two identical red triangles that connect the production point of each economy with its consumption choice. The horizontal side of the home economy’s red triangle measures the Home manufacturing exports (home production of manufactures exceeds home consumption of manufac∗ tures) and the equally large horizontal side of the foreign economy’s red triangle represents the ∗ foreign manufacturing imports (foreign consumption of manufactures exceeds foreign manufacturing output). Similarly,  the vertical sides of the red triangles measure the home agricultural imports ∗ and the equally large foreign agricultural exports. Trade is balanced under the prevailing terms of trade along the green international trade line: the value of a country’s exports equals the value of its imports.

 $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ Slopes of the Home PPF and the Foreign are the opportunity costs of the good on the horizontal axis in terms of the good on the vertical axis in both panels (a) and (b). Under free trade in panel (b),  each country’s green international trade line starts from the country’s production point (complete specialization). The relative price of each country’s export good exceeds that in autarky,  placing the international trade lines above PPF and $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ . Under free trade in (b),  each country’s possible consumption choices are anywhere on the country’s green international trade line (its consumption possibilities); an example is a green point on the ray from the origin. The exchange of goods forms two identical red triangles,  with Home manufacturing exports equal to Foreign manufacturing imports on the horizontal sides and Home agricultural imports equal to Foreign agricultural exports on the vertical side.

# The Great Doubling

Now suppose the Great Doubling gradually happens. Take the perspective of an already globalized home country. For such a home country the Great Doubling means that the rest of the world becomes more populous because more economies open their doors to trade. The rest of the world’s labor force now includes workers in the newly globalized countries. From the home economy’s point of view,  $L^{*}$ therefore increases and pushes the labor ratio $L^{*}/L$ between the two economies up,  while $L$ stays the same. To make matters clear and simple,  let’s consider a slight increase in $L^{*}$ as the Great Doubling gets under way.

Suppose the newly globalized countries use production technologies like the other economies abroad. What will the expansion in the global labor force do to the opportunity cost of producing the manufactured good in the rest of the world? Well,  nothing if the Great Doubling is just an expansion of the workforce with no productivity change. The opportunity cost are equal to the slope of the PPF,  and the PPF changes position but it does not change slope. The foreign economy’s PPF makes a parallel shift to the right. Figure 3.2 shows the move of the foreign PPF as it changes from the initial dotted line to the new solid line. In our Ricardian trade model differences in technology,  and therefore opportunity costs,  are given by a constant labor productivity (the inverse of the ﬁxed perunit labor requirements) in each economy,  regardless of the size of that economy’s workforce. If the per-unit labor requirements do not change,  then the slope of the PPF stays the same,  and therefore the opportunity costs remain the same.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/9653090f80aab4a43e4987c1529cd64437c436b868191920fb370f11b5bd5793.jpg)

All dotted lines are the same as the solid lines in Figure 3.1. Growth of the foreign population $L^{*}$ shifts the foreign $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ right (in parallel to the dotted before),  shown in panel (a). The Home PPF is unchanged in panel (b). Additional foreign supply of agricultural goods raises the relative world price $P_{M}/P_{A}$ and makes the international trade lines steeper (compared to the dotted international trade lines before) for both economies in panels (a) and (b). Relatively cheaper agricultural produce raises the ray of consumption choices (compared to the dotted ray before) because consumers demand relatively more agricultural produce. The exchange of goods forms two new but again identical red triangles,  and both countries’s residents can afford better consumption choices than before.

As a consequence,  when the foreign labor force expands while the home labor force remains the same,  the specialization pattern does not change in a world with two sectors: The home economy still completely specializes in manufacturing and the rest of the world in agriculture. The reason is that opportunity costs do not change. But the rest of the world now gets to supply a larger quantity of its exported good $Q_{A}$ on the world market. What will that do to world prices? In [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] markets,  relatively larger supplies of a good drive down the relative price of the good. In other words $P_{A}/P_{M}$ drops,  and the inverse price ratio $P_{M}/P_{A}$ rises. Figure 3.2 depicts the increase in $P_{M}/P_{A}$ with steeper ∗ green international trade lines for both economies,  Home and Foreign .

As the supply of the agricultural good expands and its relative price drops,  consumers around the world also demand relatively more of it. The ray of consumption choices shows consumers’ preferred combinations of the agricultural good relative to the manufactured good at a given relative price. Recall our convention from Chapter 2 that,  as consumers grow richer and richer,  they move along a given ray of consumption choices and demand combinations of the two products that lie further to the right and up in the graph. Consumers purchase ﬁxed proportions of the goods at any given relative price. For example,  consumers spend 30 percent of their expenditures on avocados at any level of income,  and 70 percent on motorcycles. If consumers demand 86 avocados and one motorcycle initially,  then they demand 172 avocados and two motorcycles after their budgets double,  and 344 avocados and 4 motorcycles after incomes double again—as long as relative prices stay the same. It is a different matter,  however,  when the relative prices change. Suppose the relative price of avocados falls. Then,  if consumers keep an expenditure share of 30 percent for avocados,  they will consume more avocados per motorcycle after the avocado price drops. As the relative price of avocados comes down,  consumers may in fact want to raise their expenditure share of avocados,  say to 40 percent. In that case they will consume even more avocados per motorcycle after the avocado price drops. Therefore,  the ray of consumption choices from the origin turns upwards.

Should residents in the home economy welcome the Great Doubling? The answer is a clear yes: The terms of trade are turning in the home economy’s favor. The home economy’s exports used to fetch a lower relative price $P_{M}/P_{A}$ in terms of its imports,  and these terms of trade are going up. The home economy’s residents can therefore afford consumption choices (on or below the new solid international trade line in green) that were not affordable before (above the old dotted international trade line in green). The home consumers switch their consumption point to the upper green dot in panel (b) of Figure 3.2. If a consumer switches choices,  and the choice set is larger than before,  we can infer that the consumer must be better off after the change. The consumer reveals a stronger preference for the new consumption choice. If the new choice were not better,  then the consumer would keep the old choice.

What about residents abroad,  who have been newly integrated into the global economy? Are they better off? The answer is also a clear yes. Had their economy abroad remained in autarky,  then they would be conﬁned to consumption along their $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ in panel (a) of Figure 3.2,  which lies inside the consumption possibilities on the green international trade line. The latecomers’ gains from trade may not be as large,  however,  as the gains for the early global iz ers. While the black PPF shifts out in parallel and in proportion to the size of the newly globalized workforce,  the green international trade line swings inward as the latecomers turn their own terms of trade against themselves (the foreigners’ terms of trade $P_{A}/P_{M}$ fall). Nonetheless,  all participating economies gain overall.

# Productivity Changes

[[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] can take many forms. We treated the Great Doubling above as an expansion of the rest of the world’s workforce and assumed that the newly globalized entrants into global trade have the same production technology as the previously globalized rest of the world. What if globalization is driven by productivity change abroad? Productivity growth reduces the unit labor requirements of output. Suppose the rest of the world experiences such productivity growth.

Once the world is globalized,  production and consumption are as depicted in panel (a) of Fig∗ ure 3.3 with the light dotted lines. A productivity increase in agriculture means that the foreign $a_{A}^{*}$ ∗ economy requires less labor input per agricultural output,  so falls. What happens to the foreign economy’s production possibilities as a result? The frontier turns. As $a_{A}^{*}$ falls,  the maximum amount of agricultural output $L^{*}/a_{A}^{*}$ the foreign economy can produce increases. For example,  if it now takes only 6 minutes of labor per avocado to produce one,  instead of 12 minutes of labor needed before,  then the total labor supply of $L^{*}=1,    800,    000$ worker hours in the foreign economy produce $L^{*}/a_{A}^{*}=1,    800,    000/0.\1=18,    000,    000$ avocados,  instead of only 9 million before. Figure 3.3 shows the resulting turn of the foreign economy’s PPF. In the new equilibrium,  the relative price of the agricultural product $P_{A}/P_{M}$ on the world mar

Ket must be lower than before. Why? In [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] markets,  producers do not get to pocket the proceeds from a productivity change as proﬁts. Instead the product’s price falls. Take Mexico’s avo

# Figure 3.3: Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/c452202ae24b575fb5b8755023e8b757712d654eef2cb2e0f45492350a86d321.jpg)

All dotted lines are the same as the solid lines in Figure 3.1. Growth of foreign agricultural productivity raises $L^{*}/a_{A}^{*}$ (because it lowers $a_{A}^{*}$ ) and turns the foreign $\mathrm{PPF^{*}}$ upwards as panel (a) shows. The Home PPF is unchanged. Additional foreign supply of agricultural goods raises the relative world price $P_{M}/P_{A}$ and makes the international trade lines steeper (compared to the dotted international trade lines before) for both economies. Relatively cheaper agricultural produce raises the ray of consumption choices in panel (b),  compared to the dotted ray before,  because consumers demand relatively more agricultural produce. The exchange of goods forms two new but again identical red triangles,  and both countries’s residents can afford better consumption choices than before.

cados as an example. If Mexican avocado growers become more productive,  the production cost per avocado falls. Suppose that initially no avocado grower lowers the price of avocados. Then there is a strong incentive for one avocado grower to cut the price of its avocados just a little. This will eat up some revenues. However,  the ﬁrst grower that does cut its price slightly will take over the entire avocado market because no consumer will purchase avocados from anyone else. Aware of this fact,  all avocado growers will try to prevent losing market share by lowering their prices. In [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] equilibrium,  only one price will prevail. At this price,  no undercutting is viable anymore: The price of an avocado exactly equals the cost of producing it $P_{A}=a_{A}^{*}w^{*}$ ,  where $w^{*}$ is the wage paid to Mexican workers.

∗ When the foreign economy’s agricultural productivity improves,  the home economy’s terms of trade rise and its welfare increases. With free trade an economy shares a part of its export productivity growth with the economies it trades with,  through changing terms of trade. Spec i call y,  the economy that improves its export sector’s productivity worsens the terms of trade for itself while improving the terms of trade for the economies to which it ships those exports.

This beneﬁt-sharing effect is not particular to globalization. Similar price changes occur inside of an economy between sectors,  too. Think of an economy with only two groups of inhabitants: barbers and bakers. Suppose that improved baking technologies make it possible for each baker to turn out two loaves of bread in an hour instead of only one loaf. Each barber,  however,  still takes an hour for a haircut. What will happen to the price of haircuts relative to loaves of bread? Haircuts will become more expensive because the additional supply of bread loaves depresses their price. If the relative price of haircuts compared to bread loaves doubles,  then the bakers will see no return at all on their additional output. The bakers will be just as well off as before,  whereas the barbers will reap all the beneﬁts from the baking productivity improvements.

We can also make this comparison in our Ricardian diagram and conclude that,  as an economy grows more productive in its export sector,  its terms of trade will worsen. Conversely,  its terms of trade will improve if instead the economies from which it buys goods become more productive in their export sectors. However,  no matter how badly the terms of trade turn against an exporting economy,  some gains from trade typically remain because its consumption possibilities are greater than they are in autarky.

An economy’s terms of trade measure how favorable world market conditions are for the exchange of its goods. If an economy commands a relatively high price for its exports,  then it can afford a relatively large quantity of imports per export. So an economy’s welfare and that of its consumers is naturally related to the terms of trade. The relationship is not a simple one,  however. As you have learned,  a country’s welfare can still improve while its terms of trade drop. That happens,  for example,  when a country’s productivity growth in the export sector beneﬁts its own residents but,  through dropping terms of trade,  also improves the well-being of residents abroad. Conversely,  a country’s terms of trade can increase while its welfare declines as a result of import tariffs,  a scenario we will look at in Chapter 7 on trade restrictions).

# Change of Perspective: [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]],  Really

To people and to scholars in the social sciences other than economics,  our notion of globalization based on comparative advantage is bound to appear narrow. Anthony Giddens (1990,  Ch. II,  ebook edition loc. 911 of 2506),  a sociologist and former director of the London School of Economics and Political Science,  deﬁned globalization as “the in tens i cation of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa.” Giddens views interactions between governments of nation states and the world military order as important separate forces of globalization,  in addition to the world capitalist economy and the global division of labor,  which this book explores. Manuel Castells (2010),  professor emeritus of sociology and urban planning at UC Berkeley,  views globalization as part of the emerging “network society.” To him,  globalization is the process by which human activity becomes organized in interactive networks that function on a planetary scale in real time.

In his critical introduction to globalization Jan Aart Scholte (2005),  a political scientist and scholar of international studies at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom,  discerns four main uses of the word globalization ,  but does not ﬁnd them broad enough to be helpful for a social scientist. First,  Scholte argues that the “the g-word” (globalization) is often just another word for internationalization ,  namely when the term globalization is used simply to describe the extent of today’s international trade and capital ﬂows. Second,  Scholte sees the term globalization as another word for market liberalization ,  which means that governments remove themselves from regulating or restricting movements across borders. Our hypothetical shift from autarky to free trade would be a case in point,  or more realistically the political changes that made the Great

Doubling happen. Third,  Scholte lists the use of the word globalization in the sense of what he calls universal iz ation —by which Scholte means the spread of objects such as cell phones or business suits around the world as well as the dissemination of experiences such as social media,  curry dinners or management practices across the globe. Upcoming chapters cover trade in tasks and services,  the ﬂow of ideas,  and the transfer of managerial expertise,  all issues that belong to universal iz ation.

Those three meanings of the word globalization reach as far as this textbook can take you. Scholte observes a fourth common meaning of globalization: globalization as “ westernization ”— broadly understood as the spread of cultural norms,  which are said to threaten existing cultures as if globalization were a form of colonization. Scholte considers each one of these four notions to be too narrow. Regarding globalization as “ westernization ” he writes that “it is by no means clear that globalization is intrinsically imperialist,  given that there are emancipator y global social movements as well as exploitative global processes” (Scholte 2005,  Ch. 2,  ebook edition p. 58 of 492). Instead,  Scholte (2005,  Ch. 2,  ebook edition p. 49 of 492) argues,  globalization only offers meaningful insight when understood in broad geographic and sociological terms at the same time. [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] to him means the spread of worldwide “connectivity … Across multiple areas of social life,  including communications,  travel,  production,  markets,  money,  ﬁnance,  organizations,  military,  ecology,  health,  law and consciousness.” Except for health (the spread of diseases and cures),  the military (the projection of power abroad) and consciousness,  this book offers much of that coverage. When it comes to consciousness,  Scholte analyzes how globalization fosters the formation of what he calls “non territorial identities.” In other words,  with the global spread of communication and social media,  people start to perceive themselves as a part of global communities beyond the past “national identities [that] involved attachment to a particular homeland” (Scholte 2005,  Ch. 7,  ebook edition p. 239 of 492). For example,  these people may relate more closely to their religion,  political convictions,  racial identities,  or professions.

An emerging ﬁeld of economics investigates the origins of cultural conventions and identities and how they relate to trade and technology. In a study of international trade across the Mediterranean Sea in medieval time,  for instance,  Avner Grief (1993) documents how the Maghribi merchants from North Africa differed from Genoese merchants in Italy. Both networks of merchants faced the severe problem that neither the handling of traded goods in foreign ports nor payments could be monitored,  and information took long to travel in letters on ships. The lack of oversight opened many opportunities for foreign traders to cheat. The Maghribi merchants built a code of conduct by which a misbehaving trader abroad would be sanctioned by all other merchants in the network,  whereas the Genoese merchants chose the convention that only the individual cheated merchant would discipline a misbehaving trader. Using game theory (a mathematical tool to model strategic behavior) Grief (1993) showed that both the Maghribi and the Genoese conventions were stable arrangements (so-called Nash equilibria). In turn,  Avner Grief (1994) argues that the different trade relations inﬂuenced societies,  resulting in a more collectivist culture among the Maghribi and a more individualist culture in Genoa.

Exploring the relation between technology and culture,  a recent study by Alberto F. Alesina,  Paola Giuliano and Nathan Nunn (2013) shows that societies today whose ancestors used to engage in plough agriculture in the past tend to have less participation of women in the workplace,  in management positions,  and in politics,  and are more likely to report attitudes that reﬂect the belief that men and women are less equal. The researchers’ argument is that the plough required

Upper-body strength that men could muster more easily,  so that comparative advantage conﬁned women more frequently to household work and this experience shaped lasting gender attitudes. Researchers in this ﬂedgling area of economics are ready to admit,  however,  that much research work lies ahead to understand the exact connections between economics,  culture and identity (Nathan Nunn 2012).

# 3.2 Measures of Competitiveness

Productivity is closely related to competitiveness . But both productivity and competitiveness are concerned with absolute advantage and therefore one step removed from comparative advantage. Competitiveness can still be a useful concept.

A commonly used term in the study of industries is the concept of sectoral competitiveness . We say a sector is highly [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] if it is highly productive compared to the same sector elsewhere. Similarly,  we can call an economy as a whole [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] if its sectors are productive on average.

# Sectoral Competitiveness

A sector’s labor productivity is the inverse of the sector’s per-unit labor requirement. We can use this measure to gauge the competitiveness of the same sector in different countries. Economists like to use labor productivity as a measure of competitiveness because it arguably relates to the average resident’s economic well-being. To see this idea at work,  consider Table 3.1,  which compares the labor productivity in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of various countries.

Mexico has suffered continually widening labor productivity gaps in both agriculture and manufacturing relative to the United States. India and South Korea,  in contrast,  have steadily narrowed their industries’ labor productivity gaps with the United States. South Korea exhibits the arguably most impressive change. The country’s manufacturing labor productivity was just one-quarter of that in the United States in 1975. By 2005,  it was two-thirds of that in the United States—a level of manufacturing competitiveness comparable to that in European countries. South Korea is now a member of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development),  a club of developed countries.

Single-industry comparisons document a sector’s absolute advantage. They do not help us predict trade ﬂows. When the United States,  Canada and Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994,  some people forecast that Mexico would become an exporter of agricultural products to the United States. Instead,  the United States has become a net exporter of agricultural products to Mexico. This should not be a surprise,  as an analysis of comparative advantage in Table 3.1 shows. The opportunity cost of manufactures in terms of agricultural goods was $12.3/26.1=0.47=a_{M}^{*}/a_{A}^{*}$ in Mexico in 1995,  which is far lower than the ratio of $1/1=a_{M}/a_{A}$ in the United States under the standardization. Mexico had a comparative advantage in manufacturing in 1995 compared to the United States.

# Economy-Wide Competitiveness

Many countries’ residents and governments place special emphasis on economy-wide competitiveness . Saudi Arabia,  for instance,  founded the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) at the turn of the century. SAGIA is responsible for improving the country’s competitiveness and generating employment for its growing young population. One of the agency’s goals is to improve the country’s business environment and attract foreign companies. How attractive a country is to foreign companies is viewed as a measure of its economic competitiveness. Many aspects can make an economy’s business environment promising: The economic and political stability of the country,  the education of the local labor force,  the presence of important suppliers or investors,  and the time it takes to set up a new business,  are among them. How can a country improve its economywide competitiveness? Good infrastructure typically results in low energy,  telecommunications,  and transportation costs,  and raises economy-wide labor productivity. The efﬁciency of ports and airports facilitates international trade. A reliable legislative and judicial environment enables business success,  as do the quality and transparency of the public administration. An effective justice system guarantees property rights and the enforcement of contracts,  on which business relationships build. A predictable public administration fosters long-term planning,  thus contributing to economy-wide labor productivity and competitiveness.

The World Economic Forum in Switzerland annually publishes a global competitiveness report that attempts to measure the competitiveness of 144 countries based on these and similar criteria. The World Bank compiles related data in its annual Doing Business report on 183 countries.

In our model,  a country’s economy-wide competitiveness is reﬂected in the size of its production possibilities and therefore the position of its PPF. When all sectors improve their labor productivity jointly,  the position of the PPF shifts outward with no change in its slope. The country’s residents see their well-being improve because they can afford larger consumption bundles. Comparative advantage,  in contrast,  is only determined by the slope of the PPF and independent of the frontier’s position. So much for the graphical representation of competitiveness and comparative advantage. Let’s compute some numbers.

One simple measure of economy-wide competitiveness is the average productivity of the economy’s sectors. To compute the average,  we need to sum up the various goods it produces (motorcycles and avocados in our example). A typical convention in economics is to use the relative prices of the goods as weights. That is how GDP is calculated. Lets determine Mexico’s competitiveness in autarky. One motorcycle is worth 300 avocados in autarky. So,  the labor productivity of Mexican avocado growers is $1/a_{A}=5$ avocados per hour. The labor productivity of Mexican motorcycle makers is $1/a_{M}=1/60$ motorcycles per hour. So under autarky prices,  $1/a_{M}=1/60$ motorcycles per hour $=5$ avocados per hour. In other words,  Mexico’s overall competitiveness in terms of avocados is 5 avocados per hour. Given its labor endowment of 1.8 million work hours,  if 5 avocados per hour can be produced,  that means Mexico’s corresponding GDP size is 9 million avocados (1.8 million hours times 5 avocados per hour).

# Cross-Country Wage Gaps and Competitiveness

A country’s economy-wide competitiveness matters for its residents’ prosperity. An alternative way to compare prosperity in a Ricardian trade model is to use the residents’ wages. Concretely,  we can ∗ deﬁne the cross-country wage ratio between the Home and Foreign economies as

$$
\omega=w/w^{*}.
$$ 

We call this variable the wage gap .

Figure 3.4 shows the manufacturing labor compensation in several countries relative to the United States,  as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS computes comparable manufacturing labor costs across countries and over time by including the worker’s wage as well as employer-paid taxes and employer-paid social-security contributions. Wage gaps around the world are substantial. Hourly manufacturing labor costs in Northern Europe,  including France and Germany,  exceed those in the United States both in 1997 and 2011. South Korea’s manufacturing labor costs are only half of those in the United States in 2011,  and Mexico’s are less than one-ﬁfth. The gaps remain remarkably stable over the period.

Using the Ricardian two-sector model,  we can express the wage gap as a function of labor productivity and the terms of trade:

$$
\omega=w/w^{*}=\frac{a_{A}^{*}}{a_{M}}\frac{P_{M}}{P_{A}}.
$$ 

We can express the wage gap this way because the price of a good equals its unit production cost under perfect competition so that $P_{A}=a_{A}^{*}w^{*}$ and $w^{*}=P_{A}/a_{A}^{*}$ (and similarly for the manufactured

good made at home). One interpretation of this gap is that for given terms of trade,  higher productivity in the home economy widens the wage gap $\omega$ . If you prefer a more formal statement: for given world prices $P_{A}$ and $P_{M},    $ a lower per-unit labor requirement in the home country’s export sector $a_{M}$ results in a higher cross-country wage ratio $\omega=w/w^{*}$ .

However,  as you have learned,  the terms of trade change with a productivity change. Under free trade,  a drop in Mexico’s per-unit labor requirement $a_{A}^{*}$ to produce an agricultural product (a labor productivity increase) usually results in a decline in Mexico’s terms of trade $P_{A}/P_{M}$ —that is,  the relative world price of the agricultural good on the world market drops. But suppose,  for example,  that the decline in the terms of trade is as strong as the drop in the per-unit labor requirement of the exported good $(P_{A}/P_{M}$ drops as much as $a_{A}^{*}$ drops). Then the relative well-being between Mexico and the foreign countries it is trading with will be unchanged?–at least as far as the wage gap goes. That is,  the wage gap $\omega=w/w^{*}$ remains the same because the product of $a_{A}^{*}$ with $P_{M}/P_{A}$ is unchanged when the individual changes offset each other.

Typically the decline in the terms of trade will not be as strong as the original drop in the per-unit labor requirement: $P_{A}/P_{M}$ usually drops a little when $a_{A}^{*}$ drops a lot. So,  the Mexican economy will close the wage gap with California despite a decline in its terms of trade: the wage gap $\omega\,    =\,    w/w^{*}$ falls.

The wage gap is larger the stronger a country’s economy-wide competitiveness is,  making its residents more prosperous on average.

# 3.3 Many Industries: The Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Model

Our analysis has been limited to just two sectors. It is time to consider more than two industries. What are a country’s most successful export goods?

Table 3.2 offers answers. It presents top export goods under two different rankings. One ranking considers a product’s share in a country’s overall exports (“top sales”) and the other ranking uses a measure of comparative advantage (“top RCA,  ” which stands for top revealed comparative advantage). Road vehicles and electric machinery are top products when it comes to their sales share in several countries’ overall exports. Vehicles take the top sales spot in the United Kingdom and Mexico,  for example. Exports in South Korea and the United States are strongly concentrated in electric machines. One reason for those sales concentrations is that clients worldwide demand a lot of cars and demand a lot of electric machines. As Table 3.2 shows,  road vehicles and electric machinery in fact have a global share of 7 and 8 percent of all worldwide exports—accounting together for more than one in seven exports worldwide. The share of car exports from the United Kingdom and the share of electric machinery exports from the United States are not much above those goods’ global shares in exports. This similarity suggests that those two industries are not really more successful in the United Kingdom and the United States than on world average. We should judge export success by a better measure. In what industries are exports concentrated beyond an industry’s “fair” worldwide share?

The Balassa measure of Revealed [[Chapter 2-The Principle Of Comparative Advantage|Comparative Advantage]] (RCA) is an index that relates a local industry’s sales share to the industry’s global fair share. Recall from Chapter 2 that the RCA measure is based on precisely such a double comparison. To compute the RCA index,  we ﬁrst ﬁnd the numerator: an industry’s local share in a single country’s exports (dividing the industry’s exports in a given country by the country’s total exports). We then ﬁnd the RCA denominator: the industry’s global fair share in worldwide exports (dividing the industry’s worldwide exports by the grand total of all exports in the world). The double comparison in the RCA index is complete after we divide the industry’s local export share in the numerator by the industry’s global fair share in the denominator. Table 3.2 shows that division,  too. For electric machinery exported from the United States,  the local export share is 8 percent,  while the global fair share is also 8 percent. The resulting revealed comparative advantage measure for electric machinery from the United States therefore equals 1. At that value,  the United States has neither a comparative advantage in electric machinery nor a comparative dis advantage. The RCA index exceeds 1 if the country’s industry exhibits a revealed comparative advantage. Iron ore from Brazil is an extreme example of comparative advantage: the local export share for iron ore from Brazil exceeds the global fair share by a factor of approximately 23. (The numbers in Table 3.2 are rounded,  so 22.6 is not exactly the same as 14 divided by 0.6.)

In most countries the most successful export good,  that is the good with the highest revealed comparative advantage,  is typically not the good with the most local export sales. Except for the case of iron ore in Brazil,  the top RCA goods are quite different from the top sales goods in Table 3.2. China’s top RCA good is silk (not computers). Even though silk sales do not account for a large share of China’s exports,  silk worldwide accounts for an even smaller share of global exports,  so China actually has a revealed comparative advantage in silk. Mexico’s strongest comparative advantage is in TV sets (not vehicles),  South Korea’s is in optical instruments (not electric machines). Britain’s strongest comparative advantage is in making alcoholic beverages (whiskey and not cars). The top U.S. comparative advantage good is unmilled maize (and not electric machinery). Under this comparative advantage perspective it may not be a surprise that Mexican corn farmers have a tough time competing against U.S. farmers under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But then U.S. TV manufacturers will have a tough time competing against Mexican TV makers.

As globalization progresses,  which production activities will remain in the home economy and which industries will shift abroad?

# A Three-Industry Model

Let’s start by comparing three industries: avocados,  motorcycles,  and computers. Suppose the perunit labor requirements in California and Mexico are:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/7f6ce067e6fd5d1c2496bba917a4184cd20fad84d57d036d514d7c0c9e8dae3a.jpg)

It takes 4.5 hours to produce a computer in California and 10 hours to make a computer in Mexico. It is still the case in this example that California has an absolute advantage in every activity. California’s

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/ccfe2f048358d0643c905bcc04abdfb0969c5644947333243a4a21d5c8a91a78.jpg)

Panel (a) plots the productivity gaps $a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}$ by industry $i$ in declining order so that Home has a stronger comparative advantage in industries to the left and more of a comparative dis advantage in industries to the right. Panel (b) introduces ∗ the wage gap between the two economies. If an industry’s production cost is lower at home than in the foreign economy $(a_{i}w<a_{i}^{*}w^{*})$ ) then the industry locates in the home economy. Equivalently $i$ locates at home if the industry’s productivity gap exceeds the cross-country wage gap $a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}>\omega$ . The condition is satisﬁed for computers and motorcycles.

# industries are more [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] than Mexico’s

How can we ﬁgure out comparative advantage? The principle of comparative advantage requires that we make a double comparison,  both between industries and between countries. Up to now,  we used to begin by computing opportunity costs between industries within a country. With three industries,  opportunity costs are ugly to compute because they are now the cost of one good in terms of the other two. We can make life simple by turning around the order of the two comparisons and start within every industry,  comparing between countries. The ﬁnal column of the table does just that: It computes the ratio between the per-unit labor requirement for making a good in Mexico and the per-unit labor requirement for making the same good in California. Industry by industry,  the cross-country labor requirement ratios in the ﬁnal column measure the relative resource use,  or productivity gaps ,  between the two economies. Then we need to perform the second part of the double comparison and compare between industries. In other words,  we need to rank the industries by their productivity gaps in the ﬁnal column. As you look across the rows from avocados to computers to motorcycles,  you will see that avocados have the lowest productivity gap of 10/9,  motorcycles rank second with a productivity gap of 30/9,  and computers rank highest with a productivity gap 50/9.

Trade and specialization at the extremes is quick to pin down. In which industry does California have the strongest comparative advantage? The answer is in the industry in which Mexico has the highest relative per-unit labor requirement: computers. The computer industry has the widest productivity gap between California and Mexico (the top labor requirement ratio) of 50/9. In which industry does Mexico have the strongest comparative advantage? The avocado industry,  which has the lowest productivity gap (10/9).

Every country needs to export at least one good under free global trade,  so we can directly infer that Mexico will still be an avocado exporter. California will now be a computer exporter. These two industries are at the extremes in the ranking. What can we say about the motorcycle industry,  which lies between the two extremes? Will Mexico or California be a motorcycle manufacturer? That depends on the cross-country wage ratio (the wage gap) $\omega=w/w^{*}$ .

Suppose global demand is such that the world trade equilibrium results in a wage gap of $\omega=3$ . Will Mexico put California’s motorcycle industry out of business,  or will it be the other way around? A motorcycle made in Mexico has a unit production cost of $a_{M}^{*}w^{*}\,    =\,    60w^{*},    $ ,  whereas a motorcycle made in California has a unit production cost $a_{M}w\,    =\,    18w$ . Motorcycle manufacturing is therefore less costly in California if

$$
a_{M}w=18w<60w^{*}=a_{M}^{*}w^{*}\qquad\mathrm{or~equivalently}\qquad\omega=\frac{w}{w^{*}}=3<\frac{30}{9}=\frac{a_{M}^{*}}{a_{M}}.
$$ 

The equivalence follows because we can divide both sides of the ﬁrst inequality by $w^{*}$ and by $a_{M}$ (two positive numbers). Under perfect global competition,  goods are produced where they are the cheapest to make. At a wage gap of $\omega=3$ ,  motorcycle manufacturing is indeed less costly in California. In general,  if the cross-country wage gap $\omega=w/w^{*}$ is smaller than the cross-country productivity gap $a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}$ in industry $i$ is,  then good $i$ will be produced at home under free trade.

Panel (a) of Figure 3.5 shows the productivity gaps by industry for avocados,  motorcycles,  and computers. Panel (b) also depicts the wage gap between the two economies. All industries with productivity gaps that exceed the wage gap locate in the home economy and go out of business abroad. All industries with productivity gaps narrower than the wage gap locate in the foreign economy and go out of business at home. The chain of comparative advantage is

$$
\frac{a_{C}^{*}}{a_{C}}>\frac{a_{M}^{*}}{a_{M}}>\omega>\frac{a_{A}^{*}}{a_{A}}.
$$ 

The wage gap breaks the chain between motorcycles and avocados in the sense that computers and motorcycles are made exclusively in California,  whereas avocados are exclusively grown in Mexico. There continues to be complete specialization in a Ricardian model with three industries: Every industry produces in only one location.

With several goods,  it is crucial to ﬁnd the dividing line between comparative advantage and disadvantage (the goods between which the

# Fundamentals

- Key force : Differences in technology (constant labor productivity by local industry)
 - Factors of production: 1 (labor $L$ )
 - Factor mobility: factor mobile between industries,  immobile across borders
 - Industries (goods): Many . Industry $i$ offers $Q_{i}$ units of its good,  made with $L$ • Production stages: 1 single ﬁnal stage
 - Countries: 2 (Home and rest of world ∗ Foreign )
 - Perfect competition,  transportation costs: 0
 - Constant returns to scale
 - Balanced trade
 - Contracts perfectly enforceable

Chain breaks). How can we know where to place the divide? Making that determination is actually easier when there are many industries rather than just a handful of them.

# A Many-Industry Model

We can generalize from three to many industries with little extra effort. The key is to use a convenient comparative advantage measure for many industries. As Rudiger Dornbusch,  Stanley Fischer and Paul A. Samuelson (1977) ﬁrst showed,  a helpful measure of comparative advantage is the productivity gap of every industry $i$ after the industry is ranked in terms of the productivity gap compared to all other industries in the home country. Since the productivity gap will be so important,  let’s deﬁne a new variable $A(i)$ and use it as a shorthand from now on:

$$
A(i)=\frac{a^{*}(i)}{a(i)}.
$$ 

When there are many industries,  the steps from one productivity gap to the next become so small that the staircase-like function from the three-industry case turns into a smooth downward slide. With many industries,  it is hard to give each of them a name. So,  let’s just label the industries with an index number $i$ that runs from zero to one. Panel (a) of Figure 3.6 shows the industries on the horizontal axis,  starting on the left with the ﬁrst industry,  which is named $i=0$ ,  and moving to the $i=1$ right to the last industry,  which is named . The names of the industries are just labels.

Let’s be more speciﬁc and also give industries with wide productivity gaps low-level labels— just as we did when we depicted the industry with the strongest comparative advantage ﬁrst in the three-industry case (Figure 3.5). Industry 0,  with $A(0)=a^{*}(0)/a(0),    $ ,  is the industry with the largest productivity gap. That is,  industry 0 is the industry with the strongest comparative advantage in the home economy. Silk might take the zero spot if China were the home economy,  and unmilled maize might occupy this zero spot in the United States as the home economy. Let’s give industries with narrow productivity gaps high-level labels. For example,  $A(1)\,    =\,    a^{*}(1)/a(1)$ is the narrowest productivity gap,  and so we label its industry 1. It is the industry with the weakest comparative advantage in the home economy. Using this labeling convention,  we can pick any two industries (the one at $s=0.\1,    $ ,  say,  and the one at . 762 ) and know that the one with the low-level label has a stronger comparative advantage in the home economy than the one with the high-level label.

# Cross-Country Productivity Gaps

Once we adopt this labeling convention,  we can call the ordered productivity gaps by what they measure: comparative advantage $A(i)=a^{*}(i)/a(i)$ . Productivity gaps alone show a single productivity comparison,  or absolute advantage,  for an industry between countries. However,  after we have ordered our industries with labels,  the ranking from the highest productivity gap to the lowest productivity gap allows us to make a second comparison across industries within a single economy. In short,  as we move from left to right in Figure 3.6,  we go from the industry with the strongest comparative advantage to the one with the weakest comparative advantage in the home economy. The $A(i)$ schedule gradually slopes downward. We do not really know the $A(i)$ curve’s exact shape,  there could be ﬂat parts,  there could be vertical downward drops,  but there cannot be any points where

# Figure 3.6: Many Industries

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/7d3a58ad79fc9e2c335ae7c727e4a5bca3a77bb88f410ee9ab3a9795660e41da.jpg)

Panel (a) plots the productivity gaps $A(i)\;=\;a^{*}(i)/a(i)$ by industry $i$ in declining order so that Home has a stronger comparative advantage in industries to the left and more of a comparative dis advantage in industries to the right. If an ∗ $a(i)w\;\leq\;a^{*}(i)w^{*}.$ industry’s production cost is lower at home than in the foreign economy,     then the industry locates in the home economy. Equivalently $i$ locates at home if the industry’s productivity gap exceeds the cross-country wage gap: $A(i)\,    \geq\,    \omega$ . The condition is satisﬁed at the cutoff industry $I$ and to its left. Panel (b) presents the wage gap curve $\omega\,    =\,    [i/(1-i)]L^{*}/L,    $ which follows from balanced trade and the fact that industries up to $i$ that locate at home bring a share $i$ of global consumption expenditures to the home economy in the form of labor income.

the $A(i)$ curve bends upwards. For simplicity,  we depict a smoothly downward sloping $A(i)$ curve in the ﬁgure.

Consider any good $i$ . The home country produces good $i$ if its unit production cost is lower than abroad. Otherwise the home country’s industry $i$ goes out of business,  and the foreign country produces good $i$ . Concretely,  the home country produces good $i$ if

$$
a(i)\cdot w\leq a^{*}(i)\cdot w^{*}\qquad\mathrm{or~equivalently}\qquad\omega=\frac{w}{w^{*}}\leq A(i).
$$ 

Because we labeled industries so that those with the strongest comparative have low labels,  starting at zero,  there is a range of goods between 0 and a cutoff industry $I$ getting produced at home. At the cutoff we have $\omega=A(I).$ ,  so the good $I$ could just be produced abroad or at home. This international division of labor,  and the location of industries,  is depicted in panel (a) of Figure 3.6. Industries between $I$ and 1 exclusively locate in the foreign ∗ economy.

The range of industries that locate at home depends on the cross-country wage gap $\omega=w/w^{*}$ . In the two-sector case,  it takes some work to ﬁnd $w/w^{*}$ (and we defer that work to Chapter 5 on classic trade theories). For the case with many industries,  it takes just three steps to derive the equilibrium wage gap $\omega$ from the fundamentals of our model,  as Dornbusch,  Fischer and Samuelson ﬁrst showed.

Step one. We want trade to be balanced across economies. As a consequence of balanced trade,  consumer expenditures on a country’s goods are the country’s revenues and must ultimately become labor income for the country’s residents. Let’s denote worldwide consumer expenditure with $Y_{W}$ . Suppose global consumers spend a fraction $i$ of expenditure $Y_{W}$ on industries in the home country,

$(1-i)$ ∗ and a fraction on industries in the foreign country. Then labor income in the home country must be equal to $i\,    Y_{W}$ and labor income in the foreign ∗ country must be $\left(1-i\right)Y_{W}$ .

Step two. Write down the insight from step one as a mathematical expression for each country’s labor incomes:

$$
w L=i\,    Y_{W}\qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad w^{*}L^{*}=(1-i)\,    Y_{W}.
$$ 

Then divide the former equation by the latter equation to ﬁnd

$$
{\frac{w L}{w^{*}L^{*}}}={\frac{i}{1-i}}\qquad{\mathrm{or~equivalently}}\qquad\omega={\frac{i}{1-i}}{\frac{L^{*}}{L}}.
$$ 

The solution states that,  under balanced trade,  the cross-country wage premium $w/w^{*}$ (the wage gap) that the home country’s workers command is large if there is a wide range of industries $i$ that are located at home. Why? When many industries locate at home,  they bring a large share of global consumption expenditures to the home economy and thus increase the home economy’s national income relative to the national income generated abroad. For example,  if 40 percent of the industries locate at home and 60 percent abroad,  then $i/(1-i)=0.40/0.60=2/3$ . As a consequence,  national income $w L$ at home relative to national income abroad $w^{*}L^{*}$ must also be split 2-to-3: $(w L)/(w^{*}L^{*})=$ $i/(1-i)=2/3,    $ and therefore $\omega=(2/3)(L^{*}/L)$ .

Step three. Plot the wage gap function under balanced trade $\omega\,    =\,    [i/(1-i)]L^{*}/L$ in the manyindustry diagram. We call the plotted function the wage gap curve . Remember that industries are conveniently labeled with an index number between zero and one,  so the fraction $i$ of world consumption that falls on home industries is the same $i$ as we used for labeling the industries and their productivity gaps. Panel (b) of Figure 3.6 depicts the wage curve together with the productivity gaps. The cutoff industry $I$ is where the productivity gap $A(I)$ equals the wage gap $\omega=[I/(1-I)]L^{*}/L$ . Under this wage gap,  all industries to the left of $I$ exclusively locate at home in equilibrium,  and all $I$ ∗ industries to the right of exclusively locate in the foreign economy. There continues to be complete specialization in a Ricardian model with many industries.

Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Trade. If there are many industries,  two countries,  and one factor that is mobile between industries but not countries,  and industries differ in productivity,  then each country will completely specialize in the industries with a comparative advantage (with productivity gaps that exceed the wage gap) and both countries gain from trade.

# The Great Doubling,  Revisited

With the equilibrium wage gap derived,  we are now prepared to return to the main question of this chapter. What happens to the location of industries and a globalized economy’s well-being under the Great Doubling? There is China’s shift to market capitalism since the 1980 s,  the collapse of the Soviet Union and socialist bloc countries in 1989,  India’s participation in global trade since the 1990 s,  and ﬁnally Russia’s membership in the WTO in 2012: Each of these changes resulted in an increase in the foreign workforce from $L^{*}$ to some new $L^{*\prime}$ . Each expansion of the globalized labor force

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1b710709869950cab138fb52f6fbf02b47972a08c9d3002ba988b1ce932a18fd.jpg)

Panel (a) depicts the location of industries among globalized economies before the Great Doubling. Panel (b) shows the effects of the Great Doubling. Foreign population growth to $L^{*\prime}\,    >\,     L^{*}$ turns the wage gap curve upwards. In the new $I^{\prime}<I$ global equilibrium,  the initially globalized economies host a narrower range of industries up to and command a higher wage gap $\omega^{\prime}>\omega$ .

Turned the wage gap curve $\omega\,    =\,    [i/(1-i)]L^{*}/L$ upwards. Why? At $i\,    =\,     0$ ,  the curve starts in the origin no matter how large $L^{*}$ is. But for any other $i,    $ a higher $L^{*/}$ scales the curve up to a new level $\omega=[i/(1-i)]L^{*}{}^{\prime}/L$ . For the many-industry diagram this means the wage gap curve turns upwards as panel (b) of Figure 3.7 shows.

With the Great Doubling,  the wage gap $\omega\,    =\,     w/w^{*}$ increases to $\omega^{\prime}\,    =\,     w^{\prime}/w^{*\prime},    $ ,  and the cutoff industry shifts left to $I^{\prime}$ . Industries relocate. With the relatively higher wage in the home economy,  the industries with the lowest comparative advantage among the industries that initially produced in the home economy can no longer outperform the same industries abroad. A relatively higher home wage raises production costs at home relative to the foreign economy,  while productivity is unchanged. As a consequence,  in the range between the new cutoff $I^{\prime}$ and the old cutoff $I$ industries that used to locate in the home country now relocate to the foreign country. What happens to the terms of trade? The home economy exports a narrower range of goods now,  but imports a wide range of foreign goods. It follows that the home country’s terms of trade must have improved because more foreign goods can only be affordable in exchange for fewer domestic goods if the relative price of the home made goods has gone up. What happens to workers at home? They move to employment in the industries that remain active at home after the Great Doubling. These remaining industries now produce more output than before,  and now employ the home country’s entire workforce.

What happens to the well-being of domestic workers following the Great Doubling? In economic terms,  the welfare of a country’s residents depends on how affordable the consumption goods are. How much consumption does a home resident’s wage $w$ afford given the goods prices $P_{i}$ ? The home wage now buys more consumption goods. Why? An intuitive way to look at the outcome is to compare the change in the wage gap to the change in the productivity gap. Productivity is unaltered at home and abroad,  but the wage gap widens between the countries. Because the home wage is relatively higher,  it allows domestic residents to buy more consumption goods overall. Home residents are better off from the Great Doubling abroad. This argument shows what happened to economies that were already globalized when the Great Doubling occurred,  such as the economies of Europe,  North and South America,  Oceania,  Japan,  and the open Southeast Asian economies. (The full derivation takes a little thought and we pursue that in Appendix 3. I if you are curious.)

What happened with China,  the Soviet Union,  and India when they ﬁrst globalized? For them,  we need to draw a graph similar to panel (b) of Figure 3.7 and depict the outcome after globalization. Prior to ﬁrst globalization,  in contrast,  these economies produced the entire range of goods themselves (autarky). The model predicts that China,  the Soviet Union and India lose a range of industries upon opening to global trade: The industries with a comparative disadvantage locate elsewhere and their goods are imported to China,  the Soviet Union and India after trade opening. Because the production cost of those goods is lower elsewhere,  importing those goods raises the local residents’ well-being. Moving from autarky to trade increases the well-being of an economy because there are gains to be made from trading.

# Population Change In An Open Economy

Note that a country that is already globalized and experiences slower population growth than its trading partners will see its real income per capita—that is the afford ability of goods per resident— increase (see Concept Check C 3.6,  which walks you through the derivation of this result). By contrast,  a globalized country with faster population growth than its trading partners will see its real income per capita decline. To offset the adverse effect that fast population growth has on the percapita consumption of the country’s residents,  the country will need to improve its economy-wide competitiveness. Then real income per capita can increase.

The link between population size and trade also helps explain why small open countries such as Luxembourg,  Singapore,  and Switzerland are among the countries with the highest incomes per capita in the world year after year,  typically ahead of the United States,  Japan,  Germany,  and other large industrialized countries and often even ahead of small open oil exporters such as Brunei,  Qatar $L$ $L^{*}/L$ or Norway. A country with a relatively small population faces a high ratio. As you can infer from panel (b) of Figure 3.7,  a country facing a high $L^{*}/L$ ratio will specialize in a narrow range of highly productive industries that generate high per-capita incomes for its residents. “Small is beautiful” advocates may have a point after all.

# Productivity Changes,  Revisited

The Ricardian model with many industries equips us with the tools to trace changes in competitiveness. Suppose a technology improvement increases the foreign economy’s labor productivity so that $a_{i}^{*}$ drops in all industries abroad by the same percentage. This is an improvement in economy-wide competitiveness abroad. As a consequence,  the productivity gaps $A (i)\,    =\,     a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}$ among all of these industries fall proportionally. Figure 3.8 shows the resulting proportional downward shift in the $A (i)$ schedule to $A^{\prime}(i)$ .

Because foreign industries are now more productive,  the wage gap $\omega=w/w^{*}$ falls to $\omega^{\prime}=w^{\prime}/w^{*\prime}$ $I^{\prime}$ and the cutoff industry shifts left to . Why? Foreign workers are now more productive,  so they receive a relatively higher wage that rewards them for their additional output,  and the cross-country wage ratio $w/w^{*}$ falls. Some industries relocate from the home economy to the foreign economy.

Panel (a) depicts the location of industries among globalized economies before foreign productivity growth. Panel (b) shows the effects of foreign productivity growth,  which lowers the productivity gaps for all industries to $A^{\prime}(i)\,    <\,    A(i)$ . $I^{\prime}\,    <\,    I$ In the new global equilibrium,  the initially globalized economies host a narrower range of industries up to and command a smaller wage gap $\omega^{\prime}>\omega$ than before.

The reason is that the foreign productivity increase is stronger than the resulting change in the crosscountry wage gap. Even though the foreign wage increase tends to raise relative labor costs for foreign industries,  their labor productivity change more than outweighs the labor cost change. In the wake of the foreign productivity improvement,  home industries near the old cutoff industry $I$ can no longer compete in the global market place and go out of business. Concretely,  in the range between the new cutoff $I^{\prime}$ and the old cutoff $I_{s}$ ,  industries that formerly operated in the home country now relocate to the foreign country.

The insight holds an important lesson for business. When it comes to deciding whether or not to relocate abroad,  the sectoral competitiveness of a local industry,  compared to industries abroad doesn’t matter. It does not matter how wide the productivity gap between them is. In other words,  it does not matter whether the $A (i)$ schedule sits at a high level or a low level in our diagram. The main thing that matters is where on the $A (i)$ schedule of ordered productivity gaps an industry ranks—that is how close to the cutoff $I$ an industry is compared to the other industries in its own country. In other words,  don’t look abroad to ﬁgure out whether global competition will force ﬁrms in your industry to relocate there; look at other industries in your own country. You are competing for the same main local resource,  labor,  with your domestic neighbors. Comparative advantage relative to the other activities in the home economy is the key to the viability of a business.

Of course,  raising a local industry’s labor productivity will tend to help the industry on both accounts: The industry will improve its productivity compared to its foreign competitors as well as become more productive relative to the other local industries and move up in the pecking order of comparative advantage along the $A (i)$ schedule.

What happens to the real income per capita earned by domestic workers after productivity abroad grows? The home wage now affords more consumption goods. Why? Compare the relative drop in the wage gap to the relative change in the productivity gap: The schedule of productivity gaps $A (i)$ shifts downwards more strongly than the drop in the wage gap. Figure 3.8 shows in panel (b) that the wage gap drop is smaller in size than the drop in the productivity gap because the new equilibrium must lie on the wage gap curve,  and the wage gap curve slopes gradually. It does not drop off vertically. The wage gap therefore narrows,  but it narrows by a smaller percentage than the productivity gap. So,  even though the home wage is lower,  the production costs of the consumption goods (and their prices) are lower yet. Consequently,  the new home wage buys more consumption goods. (The complete proof takes a little more effort and we present that in Appendix 3. II if you are curious.)

What happens to foreign residents’ well-being? Despite their worsening terms of trade,  foreigners’ welfare also improves with their productivity growth (see Concept Check C 3.7,  which walks you through the derivation of that result). The foreign residents share only a part of their beneﬁts from productivity growth with their trading partners in the home economy. Foreigners do not end up transferring all the beneﬁts of growth to the home country’s residents.

# De industrialization

There is much concern with de industrialization around the world. De industrialization is the loss of manufacturing employment in a country relative to its total employment or the loss of manufacturing value added relative to a country’s GDP. Interestingly,  the concern seems rampant in countries with widely differing per-capita incomes and development—countries ranging from Brazil and China to France,  Germany,  Japan,  South Korea,  and the United States. The ubiquity of the concern makes you wonder if a force other than globalization is driving de industrialization. If globalization were the driver,  then we should see industries relocate from one country to another like our Ricardian model with many industries showed. Industries would not go out of business everywhere at the same time,  but the widespread fear of de industrialization suggests that manufacturing activity is on a simultaneous decline across countries.

Perhaps de industrialization marks a shift from manufacturing activities to services activities that merely coincides with globalization. For the sake of the argument,  let’s suppose that globalization does contribute to de industrialization. Then our analysis of the Ricardian model suggests that a country’s well-being improves as industries relocate abroad. In other words,  Ricardian theory welcomes deindust ria liz ation as a favorable development.

Those who are concerned with adverse effects of de industrialization must therefore have in mind some unconventional losses from seeing manufacturing employment fall. Their presumed losses can have to do with what economists call negative external i ties. A negative external it y is an adverse effect one industry’s or person’s actions have on others when the adverse effect does not cause higher input prices or lower product prices,  so it is not corrected within the markets. In other words,  the adverse effect is “external” to the markets—hence the term “external it y.” Negative external i ties from de industrialization are the adverse effects that a relocating industry causes to the home economy because it does not face the full costs of its action for the home economy as a whole. For example,  there may be beneﬁts from learning by doing in manufacturing in the home economy,  so the workforce loses important skills when the manufacturer relocates abroad. Or there may be so-called spillover effects from manufacturing into other sectors of the home economy,  such as the provision of specialized products to local agriculture and services,  or the diffusion of knowledge and expertise from a manufacturing industry to other manufacturing industries or outside sectors.

# Evidence on Specialization After The Great Doubling

As you have seen,  Ricardian trade theory predicts that previously globalized economies will specialize in a narrower set of industries under the Great Doubling. Workers will move to the comparative advantage industries that stay at their location and expand. How do these prediction hold up?

To measure specialization,  we can use the share of employment in the four largest industries out of all. The top-four share is a measure of employment concentration. The more concentrated the employment is in few industries,  the more specialized is the country’s merchandize producing sector as a whole. Consistent data on 17 manufacturing industries,  as well as agriculture and mining,  are available for a group of OECD countries from 1985 to 2011. Table 3.3 reports industrial concentration for four previously globalized OECD countries—the United States,  Denmark,  France,  and South Korea—on the one hand,  and on the other hand for the Czech Republic,  a recent OECD member whose economy was part of the socialist bloc when it collapsed.

In the small open economies of Denmark and South Korea,  the share of their respective top four industries in manufacturing continuously increased since 1985 and has reached concentration levels of 58 and 62 percent in 2011 (in terms of employment in Denmark and value added in Korea). The larger economies of France and the United States are more diversiﬁed. They reduced their concentration prior to the Great Doubling (1985-1995) but grew more concentrated when most of the Great Doubling occurred,  arriving at concentrations of 44 and 53 percent of employment in the top-four industries. We can observe a similar evolution of concentration when agriculture and mining are included in the computation in panel (b) of Table 3.3.

In the process,  the textiles and apparel industry dropped out of the top four in the United States and France,  as production in this industry relocated elsewhere,  and furniture manufacturing was pushed out of the top four in Denmark and South Korea. In their place,  the machinery and equipment manufacturing industry entered the top-four list in the United States,  the chemical and pharmaceutical industry joined the top four in France and Denmark,  while the metal products industry made it to top-four status in South Korea. A common feature of these changes is that more labor intensive industries with relatively lower labor productivity drop from the leading industry list in these previously globalized economies. The economy of the Czech Republic became initially more diversiﬁed when it integrated into the global economy between 1995 and 2005. As it moved on to join the club of high-income OECD countries,  it lost the textiles industry from its top four industries while motor vehicle manufacturing moved into its top four list. As Ricardian theory predicts,  all ﬁve economies further concentrate employment in their top industries.

# Think Twice about Convention: The Good,  the Bad,  and the Ugly—or Trade,  Pollution,  and Sweatshops

The global economy depends on specialization and the division of labor across countries and industries. But not all industries,  ﬁrms,  and countries may end up specializing in desirable activities. What if the forces of globalization drive a country towards activities that tend to degrade its environment? What if a country ends up attracting sweatshops that show little regard for safety standards? The textiles industry in Bangladesh is often regarded to have particularly unsafe workplaces. In 2013,  Rana Plaza near the city of Dhaka in Bangladesh,  a multi story building that hosted ﬁve garment factories,  collapsed and killed more than 1,  100 workers. A Bangladeshi government panel found that the owners of the building had violated local building codes,  while authorities failed to enforce the regulations.

Governments sometimes choose not to pass or enforce safety and health regulations so as to avoid the departure of industries under free global trade. Does global trade make it harder to implement regulations? No. In fact,  the opposite is true. Free trade makes regulation easier. Why? Because via its terms of trade,  a more tightly regulated country gets to ofﬂoad onto its trading partners some of the losses from its declining productivity as a result of the regulations.

Regulations do indeed tend to raise the cost of doing business and hence reduce a country’s labor productivity and competitiveness. (If they didn’t,  then businesses would adopt them without the government requiring them to do so.) The productivity gaps between the country and the foreign economies it trades with therefore get narrower across all industries. The effect of regulation on the relocation of industries is similar to the effect foreign productivity growth has (see Figure 3.8): The wage gap $w/w^{*}$ drops,  and a range of domestic industries with relatively narrow productivity gaps relocate to the foreign economy. Of course,  due to the decline in labor productivity,  the home economy’s residents lose real income and have to forgo some consumption (Mathematical Appendix 3. IV has the derivation). However,  presumably the regulations were designed so that the beneﬁts from stricter environmental,  health,  and safety standards outweigh the foregone consumption. That is presumably why the regulations were adopted in the ﬁrst place.

And now to the surprise. The loss in consumption is smaller when the home economy is

Globalized than when it is closed. A decline in labor productivity at home improves the home country’s terms of trade and therefore worsens the foreign economy’s terms of trade. Consequently,  foreign residents also suffer a loss in real income (Mathematical Appendix 3. IV has those derivations too). In other words,  a globalized economy gets to “export” some of its consumption losses from stricter regulations to the economies it trades with.

By imposing tighter regulations,  the home country behaves like a monopolist when it comes to foreign consumers. The home country restricts the amount of its exports,  and therefore raises the price of the exports by making them scarcer on the world market. The home country’s terms of trade improve,  and foreign consumers get to “share” in the home country’s productivity decline by also foregoing consumption. This partly buffers the home residents’ consumption losses.

The skeptics of globalization fear that it causes a race to the bottom in terms of regulations. To attract industries,  they argue,  countries loosen their environmental,  health and safety standards. It’s true in the Ricardian model that some industries will move abroad to escape regulations. However,  the consumption losses from declining productivity under the regulations are smaller in a globalized economy than in a closed one.

Do tighter regulations in the home country push some dirty and unsafe industries to the foreign economy? That is indeed possible. However,  the foreign country can simply respond by imposing similarly tight regulations. If the foreign country’s copycat regulations make foreign labor productivity decline by the same percentage as the home country’s regulations depress its competitiveness,  then there will in fact be no adverse terms-of-trade effect on foreign residents. All residents around the world will forgo some consumption because of the regulations. In fact,  preventing adverse terms of trade changes may even give economies the incentive for a “race to the top.”

How does this implication of Ricardian trade theory hold up in practice? When it comes to pollutants,  countries that become more open do not raise,  and tend to slightly reduce,  emissions of gases such as nitrous oxide,  for which catalytic converters and ﬁlters exist. Countries that become more open tend to raise emissions of carbon dioxide,  however,  for which commercially viable ﬁlters do not exist so that regulations are arguably harder to implement.

# Productivity Gaps and the Balassa RCA Measure

How well does the productivity gap—the key feature of Ricardian trade theory—explain trade ﬂows? To assess the predictive power of the Ricardian model,  we can relate the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) of a country’s industries to their productivity gaps. Panel (a) of Figure 3.9 considers two sectors only: agriculture and manufacturing. The graph plots manufacturing RCA by country against the ratio of manufacturing-to-agricultural productivity for the OECD countries in Table 3.1. Each dot represents one country. Notice how countries that tend to specialize in manufacturing also have high productivity in the manufacturing sector. The line shows the best linear ﬁt. Splitting the world in just two sectors is crude,  however,  and the ﬁt of the line is not a close one.

It would be helpful to have data from multiple industries and multiple countries for the test. Unfortunately,  such data are hard to come by. Costinot,  Donaldson and Komunjer (2012) have used producer prices for this purpose. The ratios of producer prices across countries reﬂect productivity gaps in perfectly [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] markets. Panel (b) of Figure 3.9 plots these price-based measures of productivity gaps across industries and countries. The graph shows the RCA measure computed for

Labor productivity in panel (a) is from Table 3.1 for two sectors agriculture and manufacturing (2005); productivity in panel (b) is from Arnaud Costinot,  Dave Donaldson and Ivana Komunjer (2012) based on Groningen Growth and Development Centre producer price data for 13 manufacturing industries (1997) and 21 countries.

13 industries and relates the RCA to the productivity gaps for 20 OECD member countries,  relative to the United States. The line through the points shows that there is a positive relationship. A country that has an industry with high productivity relative to that industry in the United States tends to command a revealed comparative advantage in terms of its exports. The country-industry dots are quite scattered around the line,  however,  so more is going on in the data than in Ricardian trade theory. For example,  our theory hasn’t addressed any geographical,  natural,  or human-made barriers to trade that could be affecting the relationship between these factors.

# 3.4 The Gravity Equation and Predictions of Trade Flows

Trade happens in geographic space. Table 3.4 reports how export ﬂows from four source countries are distributed across ranges of geographic distances (for the same top goods as in Table 3.2). The distance to a country’s trading partner is measured as the typical distance between the main cities in the home economy and the trading partner’s main cities. Brazil and the United States have no foreign trading partner with an average city-to-city distance of less than 1,  000 miles. (In fact,  the main cities within the Brazilian and U.S. domestic economies are more than 1,  000 miles apart on average.) The United Kingdom,  in contrast,  has many European trading partners in close reach of less than 1,  000 miles. For Brazil,  96 percent of its top-selling product iron ore need to move more then 4,  000 miles because its main destination markets in the United States and Europe are that far away. For China,  one-quarter of its computer exports move more than 1,  000 miles away and two-thirds more than 4,  000 miles because a main destination market,  the United States,  is that far away,  while more than half of China’s silk exports go to Asian neighbors in the 2,  000-4,  000 mile range. In contrast,  more than half of Britain’s car exports and two-ﬁfth of the country’s alcoholic beverage exports go to European Distance up to 1,  000 miles Distance 1,  000 to 2,  000 miles Distance 2,  000 to 4,  000 miles Distance over 4,  000 miles

Distance up to 1,  000 miles Distance 1,  000 to 2,  000 miles Distance 2,  000 to 4,  000 miles Distance over 4,  000 miles

neighbors less than 1,  000 miles away. A quarter of U.S. top exports go to the neighboring NAFTA members,  but two-thirds to three-quarters of the exports have to cover a distance of more than 4,  000 miles.

If a statistician or national accountant were asked to come up with strong predictors of trade ﬂows,  which variables would she pick? What might attract a country’s exporters to a given economy? Proximity should matter because it is less costly for a producer to export a good to nearby countries than it is to those far away. The lower the transportation cost to the foreign market,  the easier it is to compete. The size of foreign markets should matter too. Larger demand in a foreign economy makes it more likely that products from the home country become successful exports. Finally,  home market size should help predict exports. Large producer countries should contribute considerable amounts of goods to global consumption.

In the early 1960 s,  Jan Tinbergen (1962) and Pentti P¨oyh¨onen (1963) tried to pinpoint such important predictors of trade ﬂows and came up with an equation similar to the law of gravity in physics. The equation is referred to as the gravity equation of international trade. Dealing with many countries and many industries is challenging when it comes to measuring trade ﬂows. The gravity equation offers a powerful and accurate shortcut by measuring how trade volumes depend on characteristics of the pair of countries that trade with one another. The gravity equation is:

$$
X_{S D i}=B_{i}\frac{\mathrm{GDP}_{S i}\cdot\mathrm{GDP}_{D i}}{d_{S D}}.
$$ 

The equation tells us a number of things:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1ea1543fb9dbfde7270320de20c5f8976cffb199958b3a276ff298f0dcfeca7d.jpg)

Sources : Feenstra et al. (2005,  Revision 2,  2011) bilateral trade data based on C OMTRADE for 207 countries (2005) and C EPII data for GDP and population weighted distance (Head,  Mayer and Ries 2010). Note : Axes drawn to logarithmic scale. Trade of manufactures.

- The export ﬂow $X_{S D i}$ from a source country $S$ (an exporting country) to a destination country $D$ (an importing country) will be large if the production value generated by industry $i$ in the source country $(\mathrm{GDP}_{S i})$ ) is big and pushes a sizeable amount of exports onto the world market. • The trade ﬂow to a destination country will be large if the destination country spends a considerable amount of its national income on goods from industry $i$ $(\mathrm{GDP}_{D i,    })$ ). • The trade ﬂow from $S$ to $D$ will be small if the two countries are far away from one another (if the distance $d_{S D}$ is large).
- The constant $B_{i}$ captures other aspects that affect the trade volume.

Empirical economists often include additional variables in the denominator of the equation to measure other natural barriers that restrict trade ﬂows,  such as whether a country is landlocked or has no common border with a trading partner. Still other variables measure the language,  legal,  and tariff differences between countries,  all of which make trading harder and tend to restrict trade ﬂows.

One way to see how well geographic distance in the gravity equation predicts trade ﬂows is by scaling the trade ﬂows down according to the sizes of the countries trading with one another. Divide $X_{S D i}$ by both $\mathrm{GDP_{S i}}$ and $\mathrm {{GDP}} _{D i},    $ and then plot these scaled ﬂows against the geographic distance between the countries. Panel (a) of Figure 3.10 plots 26 manufacturing industries and 207 countries that trade with each other. Notice how the distance between countries affects the trade ﬂows between them. Less trade occurs between countries far apart. Given what you have learned about the gravity equation,  it will probably not surprise you to see that almost one-quarter of world trade is between neighbors with a common border. Almost three-quarters of world trade is between countries whose residents live less than 4,  700 miles apart,  and 4,  700 miles is the average distance between countries’ populations on earth. More than one-ﬁfth of world trade is between countries with the same ofﬁcial language.

Another way we can use the gravity equation to predict trade ﬂows is by plotting trade ﬂows against the gravity-variable combination $\mathrm{GDP}_{S i}\cdot\mathrm{GDP}_{D i}/d_{S D}$ . Panel (b) of Figure 3.10 shows this plot. Notice how closely the points fall near the straight line drawn from them,  which means there is a clearly positive relationship between the ﬂows and the gravity-variable combination.

# Ricardian Trade Theory and the Gravity Equation

One problem with the gravity equation is that it does not answer the question why do countries globalize ,  which is one of the guiding themes of this textbook. The Ricardian trade model can help the gravity equation get some serious theoretical support. To see how,  we need to bring geographic trade barriers into our model. When an exporter prices her good for foreign customers,  she looks at the freight factor ,  which measures the proportional increase in the ﬁnal price of a delivered good due to transportation costs. If a good costs one dollar to make,  and freight adds ten percent,  then the goods ﬁnal price at delivery is one dollar and ten cents and the freight factor is 1.1. In terms of our pricing formula for good $i,    $ its producer price prior to leaving the source country $S$ (Home) is $P_{S i}=a_{i}w$ . The ﬁnal price at delivery to the destination country $D$ is $P_{D i}=d_{S D}P_{S i},    $ where

$$
D_{S D}=P_{D i}/P_{S i}
$$ 

Is the freight factor.

Perfect competition is a fundamental feature of the Ricardian model and results in complete specia liz ation . In the Ricardian model,  for any given consumer destination market $D_{s}$ ,  a good can only be from one single source country. For example,  Mexico consumes the avocados it grows,  and California imports avocados from Mexico. But Australia imports avocados from Chile because the freight factor for shipments from Mexico is too high to make Mexican avocados [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] in Australia. There are two source countries exporting avocados in this four-country example. But there is complete specialization in the sense that every consumer country receives avocados from a single source country,  and no avocado producer country ships to a destination market in which another avocado producer country also sells. There is still perfect competition because the individual producers in a source country compete and drive prices down to the production cost of the good. As a consequence,  all shipments of good $i$ to a country $D$ come from a unique source country $S$ . We can write the trade ﬂow as

$$
X_{S D i}=Y_{D i}/d_{S D}.
$$ 

We need to divide the destination country’s expenditures by the freight factor $d_{S D}$ because the expenditures are priced at $P_{D i},    $ whereas the source country’s expenditures are priced at the local price $P_{S i}$ .

The rest is mathematics. Under our standard consumer preferences,  the expenditure on good $i$ by consumers in destination country $D$ is

$$
Y_{D i}=\beta_{i}\cdot Y_{D},    
$$ 

Where $Y_{D}$ is the destination country $D^{\prime}$ ’s national income and $\beta_{i}$ is the share spent on good $i$ . For

# Fundamentals

- Key force : Differences in technology (constant labor productivity by local industry)
 - Factors of production: 1 (labor $L$ )
 - Factor mobility: Factor mobile between inexample,  if avocados have an expenditure share $\beta_{A}$ of twenty percent,  then an Australian household with one thousand dollars of income will spend 200 dollars on avocados (from Chile).
Now to step one of the math: A source country that ships good $i$ to several destinations will receive total revenues of

$$
\begin{array}{r}{Y_{S i}=\sum_{C}\beta_{i}\cdot Y_{C}=\beta_{i}\cdot\sum_{C}Y_{C}.}\end{array}
$$ 

The mathematical sym $\sum_{C}$ instructs us to sum up the variables Y $Y_{C}$ over all destination countries $C$ that get the shipment. For example,  if Mexican and U.S. households each earn 1,  000 dollars of income,  then each country’s households will spend 200 dollars on Mexican avocados. As a result,  the total revenue Mexican avocado growers will earn will be 400 dollars.

Finally to step two of the math: We can write $\begin{array}{r}{\beta_{i}\ =\ Y_{S i}/\sum_{C}Y_{C}}\end{array}$ and replace $\beta_{i}$ in the earlier expenditure equation $Y_{D i}=\beta_{i}\cdot Y_{D}$ . Then we just use those terms in the trade ﬂow $X_{S D i}=Y_{D i}/d_{S D}$ and ﬁnd the version of the gravity equation that comes with the Ricardian trade model:

$$
X_{S D i}=\frac{Y_{D i}}{d_{S D}}=\frac{\beta_{i}Y_{D}}{d_{S D}}=\frac{1}{\sum_{C}Y_{C}}\frac{Y_{S i}Y_{D}}{d_{S D}}.
$$ 

The Ricardian model wants the constant in the gravity equation to be $\begin{array}{r}{B=1/\sum_{C}Y_{C},    }\end{array}$ ,  the same for all industries,  and it wants total destination country expenditure $Y_{D}$ (the destination country’s national income),  also the same for all industries,  instead of individual expenditure on the single industry $Y_{D i}$ . Most important,  however,  the Ricardian model does deliver the gravity equation. That is good news. No model should contradict the gravity equation because the gravity equation is empirically so powerful.

There is perhaps one surprise. The pure source-country characteristic $Y_{S i}$ is equal to the demandside term $\beta_{i}\cdot\sum_{C}Y_{C}$ . The reason for this sim pli cation is that our demand side is crude. We have not allowed for goods to be differentiated: There are no differences between varieties of avocados and no differences between types of motorcycles in our theory. It takes sophisticated work to bring product varieties into a theory with perfect competition,  many goods,  and many countries. Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum (2012) explain how it can be done. However,  we know from our empirical assessment that the source-country characteristic $Y_{S i}$ is indeed closely related to the productivity gaps on the production side—the key feature of Ricardian trade theory.

# Summary

In Ricardian trade theory,  the cause for globalization stems from labor productivity differences across countries. Productivity gaps across the countries vary by sector,  or industry,  and give rise to comparative advantage. These productivity gaps explain why there is globalization ,  the ﬁrst theme of this textbook. A country will specialize in the industries in which its productivity gaps are more advantageous,  namely in the industries with productivity gaps that are wider than the wage gap between the domestic and foreign economy.

This chapter has investigated more closely how globalization progresses ,  the second theme of the book. Using the Ricardian model and two industries,  we showed that the previously globalized economies experienced an improvement in their terms of trade after the Great Doubling at the turn of the millennium. The relative price of their exported goods increased compared to the price of their imported goods. Using the Ricardian model and many industries,  we showed that the previously globalized economies lost a range of industries to the newly globalized economies but saw their relative wages increase as well as their terms of trade improve.

Should the previously globalized economies have welcomed the Great Doubling despite losing some industries? What about the economies that became globally integrated and gained those industries? Should they have welcomed the Great Doubling? These questions address the third theme of this book,  who gains from globalization ? As we explained,  the previously globalized economies clearly gained. The terms of trade turned in their favor. Some industries—those with the lowest comparative advantage—relocated to the newly globalized economies. However,  the residents who used to be employed in the industries went to work in the more productive industries that remained in their economies and expanded. The narrower focus on relatively more productive industries provided the residents in the previously globalized economies with higher real incomes—that is,  more consumption for their wages. The countries new to world trade gained too. As they became open economies,  they also lost industries,  but their consumption possibilities expanded because they specialized production in industries with a comparative advantage and gained from trade.

With Ricardian trade,  globalized economies share their economy-wide productivity gains by worsening their own terms of trade and improving the terms of trade for the economies they trade with. The reason is that,  in [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] markets,  producers do not get to pocket the proceeds from productivity change as proﬁts. Instead the prices of their products fall. Nonetheless,  the affordable consumption possibilities with trade exceed those in autarky no matter how badly the terms of trade turn against a country. This is an important insight: A country’s well-being can improve while its terms of trade drop. Worsening terms of trade are never a reason to abandon trade.

Note that a country that is already globalized and experiences faster population growth will see its real income per capita—that is the afford ability of goods per resident—decrease. Unless a country raises its economy-wide productivity,  or economy-wide competitiveness,  its population growth reduces its per-capita income. But any economy is still better off trading than not trading.

Transportation costs increase the price of a good at a foreign destination and affect trade ﬂows,  especially for trading partners located far away from one another. The Ricardian model can be used in conjunction with the gravity equation to account for geography when it comes to predicting trade ﬂows. Similar to the law of gravity in physics,  the gravity equation states that the ﬂow of exports from a source country to a destination country is proportional to the size (national income) of the source country,  the size (domestic product) of the destination country,  and is inversely related to the geographic distance between the two countries.

# Assessments

# Concept Checks

# Two Sectors,  the Terms of Trade and Productivity Changes

C 1.1. Assess the following statement: A country’s terms of trade worsen when growth is faster in its export sector. Consider a concrete example. China and its trading partners specialize in the production of goods in which they have a comparative advantage. China experiences productivity growth in its import sector. How do China’s terms of trade change? Why? Are China’s gains from trade larger or smaller after the productivity improvement? Why?

C 1.2. Consider an economy with two goods and the PPF (PPF) depicted in Figure 3.11 A. The three points refer to production when the economy is in autarky $(A)$ ,  and production $(P)$ and consumption $(C)$ after the economy globalizes. Label the three points accordingly. Which good is the country’s export good in the diagram? Suppose the country experiences fast productivity growth in sector $X$ but no productivity change in sector $Y$ . How do the PPF and the country’s terms of trade change? Label a possible new production point on the new PPF with $P^{\prime}$ in the diagram. Assess whether each of the following two statements is true or false,  and brieﬂy explain why: (i) a decline in its terms of trade necessarily makes a country worse off; (ii) productivity growth necessarily makes a country better off.

C 1.3. There are two countries (Home and Foreign) and two sectors: food production (F) and manufacturing (M). Wages differ between the Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk) country. Labor product iv i ties are constant but differ across sectors and across countries. The countries production possibilities are depicted in Figure 3.11 B. What are the opportunity costs of food goods in terms of manufactured goods for the home country,  and what are they for the foreign country? State the opportunity costs in numeric terms. Pick a relative world price ratio $P_{F}/P_{M}$ such that the two countries will trade but so that the home country will have no gains from trade. State the ratio in numeric terms. In Figure 3.11 B,  show a consumption bundle for the home country when it has no gains. Now change the relative world price ratio $P_{F}/P_{M}$ in the diagram so that the home country has strictly positive gains. As you change the relative world price,  what happens to the foreign country’s gains from trade?

C 1.4. Consider an economy with no production and an endowment of two ﬁnal goods: avocados $A$ and metals $M$ . The initial endowment is depicted in the diagram of Figure 3.11 D. The economy is open and trades. Draw a terms-of-trade line through the endowment point. Depict a consumption choice so that the economy exports metals $M$ and imports avocados $A$ . What are the

Economy’s terms of trade? Suppose the terms of trade worsen. Draw a new terms-of-trade line and show that the well-being of the country’s citizens unambiguously deteriorates following the change. Now imagine the economy has a production sector and the terms of trade worsen. Draw a PPF through the endowment point. Choose the same relative world price ratio as before,  after the terms of trade deterioration,  and show the change in the country’s production pattern after the terms of trade worsen. Is the welfare loss (the foregone well-being) larger or smaller than for the endowment economy before? Is an improvement in the economy’s welfare theoretically possible?

C 1.5. Show that the terms of trade can be expressed as the product of the wage gap and a particular ratio of per-unit labor requirements under perfect competition. What does the ratio of per-unit labor requirements show?

# Measures of Competitiveness

C 2.1. Deﬁne comparative advantage and competitiveness. Evaluate the appropriateness of the following four statements. (1) The higher the competitiveness of an economy as a whole is,  the higher the real per-capita income of its residents will be. (2) The higher the comparative advantage of a sector is,  the higher the real per-capita income of its workers will be. (3) The higher the competitiveness of a sector is,  the larger its export volume in general equilibrium will be. (4) In a two-country,  two-sector model with differences in technologies and a single factor (labor),  trade removes the gap in incomes between the two countries.

C 2.2. Consider the year 1995 in Table 3.1. Which country had the most [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] agricultural sector in that year? Which country had the most [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] manufacturing sector? Suppose there were only two sectors: agriculture and manufacturing (ignore mining). Based on Ricardian trade theory and Table 3.1,  which countries seem likely to be exporters of agricultural goods to the United States? Now consider the year 2005. Which countries seem likely to be exporters of agricultural goods to the United States now?

C 2.3. Suppose the United States is a net exporter of agricultural products to Mexico in 1995 and 2005,  and a net importer of manufactures products in both years. Use the Ricardian two-sector model for agriculture and manufacturing (suppose the United States makes almost no manufactures and Mexico almost no agricultural products). Does agricultural productivity in the United States increase or fall between 1995 and 2005? Does manufacturing productivity in Mexico increase or fall between 1995 and 2005? Under these changes,  what does the Ricardian twosector model predict for the terms of trade? Under these changes,  what does the Ricardian two-sector model predict for $\omega=w/w^{*}=(a_{A}^{*}/a_{M})(P_{M}/P_{A})?$

C 2.4. How do infrastructure and judicial institutions relate to the competitiveness of industries and an economy’s competitiveness? How does the infrastructure of an economy’s ports relate to the production cost of a product?

# Many Industries: The Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Model

C 3.1. Home and Foreign can produce computers,  almonds,  and textiles with the following per-unit labor requirements.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8600844dde0b5272916f23d019d5704557b4a76a4cfe6c7e34f9bf1092a359e6.jpg)

Home wages exceed foreign wages with $w~=~4$ to $w^{*}\ =\ 1$ . In which good does the home economy have the strongest comparative advantage versus the foreign economy? Do the ratios $a_{L i}/a_{L i}^{*}$ for individual goods $i$ indicate opportunity costs? Why are the ratios $a_{L i}/a_{L i}^{*}$ for individual goods $i$ appropriate for determining the pattern of production? Given the wage ratio $w/w^{*}\,    =\,     4,    $ ,  which good (s) will the home economy produce and not produce? What does this tell you about the pattern of trade? Suppose wages equalize to $\boldsymbol{w}=\boldsymbol{w}^{*}=4$ so that $w/w^{*}=1$ . Which good (s) will the home economy produce and not produce? What does this tell you about the pattern of trade? Are there gains from trade when wages are equal?

C 3.2. The home and foreign economies can produce apples,  bananas,  cherries,  dates,  and eggplants. The following are the per-unit labor requirements for each good in each economy.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/8075ed3ca7b1674f6bf8e6968118965fb2a3138cbd83b8e85f4a8e4f143a330b.jpg)

The wages in the home economy exceed the wages in the foreign economy with $w=2$ to $w^{*}=1$ . In which good (s) does the home economy have the strongest comparative advantage relative to the foreign economy? Do the ratios $a_{L i}/a_{L i}^{*}$ for individual goods $i$ indicate opportunity costs? Are the ratios $a_{L i}/a_{L i}^{*}$ appropriate for determining the pattern of production? Given the wage ratio $w/w^{*}\,    =\,     2,    $ ,  which good (s) will the home economy produce and not produce? What does this tell you about the pattern of trade? What is the pattern of trade when wages are equal,  $w/w^{*}=1?$ Explain brieﬂy what a Ricardian model of trade predicts regarding wage equalization.

C 3.3. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). There is one factor of production,  labor,  and both countries have equally large labor forces of $L\,    =\,     L^{*}$ . There are ﬁve sectors and their constant per-unit labor requirements are as followings.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/670b8542e2c8f5597f8b84f7e00999574b2b523b98328f1f0ab30b9905bc6171.jpg)

In which sector does the home country have the strongest comparative advantage? In which sector does the home country have the weakest comparative advantage? Order all of the sectors

In the home economy from strongest to weakest. Suppose relative wages are such under free trade that both countries produce services. What is the wage ratio $w/w^{*}$ in free-trade equilibrium? Which products will the home country export under free trade? Which products will the foreign country export under free trade? Which products might be exported by either country? Now suppose population growth changes the wage ratio $w/w^{*}$ so that under free trade both countries produce commodities. Which good (s) will the home country produce and export now? In which country must the labor force have grown?

C 3.4. Consider the diagram of the Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson model in Figure 3.11 E. Suppose labor productivity abroad grows so that all foreign per-unit labor requirements $a^{*}(i)$ drop by 10 percent. What happens to the ordered productivity gap schedule $A (i);$ ? How does the crosscountry wage gap $\omega$ change at the depicted initial equilibrium? How does the range of industries $I$ producing in the home economy change at the depicted initial equilibrium? What do the changes mean for real incomes at home and abroad? What do the changes mean for the terms of trade?

C 3.5. Consider the diagram of the Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson model in Figure 3.11 F. Suppose the population abroad $L^{*}$ grows. What happens to the ordered productivity gap schedule $A (i)$ ? What happens to the wage gap curve $\bar{\omega}\;=\; [i/(1\,    -\,    i)](L^{*}/\bar{L});$ ? How does the cross-country wage gap $\omega$ change at the depicted initial equilibrium? How does the range of industries $I$ producing in the home economy change at the initial equilibrium? What do the changes mean for real incomes at home and abroad? What do the changes mean for the terms of trade?

∗ C 3.6. Suppose the foreign economy is fully open to free trade,  and its population grows faster than the population in the home country. The ratio $L^{*}/L$ increases. Figure 3.7 depicts this case. We know from the analysis in the text that real per-capita income in the home country increases (the new home wage $w^{\prime}$ affords more goods than the old wage $w$ ). This concept check asks you ∗ to follow similar steps to derive the result that real per-capita income in the foreign economy falls when the ratio $L^{*}/L$ increases. In the upper range from $i=I$ to $i=1$ goods are produced in the foreign economy both before and after population growth. Show that the wage-price ratio of a good in the upper range is equal to the good’s foreign productivity before and after the population change. Does the afford ability of these goods change? In the middle range between $I^{\prime}$ and $I_{,    }$ ,  industries switch their production locations from the home to the foreign economy with foreign population growth. For the goods in the middle range,  show that the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is lower than the wage-price ratio before. (Hint: Show that the wage-price ratio for foreigners before the population change was ${w^{*}}/{P_{i}}={1}/{\left ( {{a_{i}} \omega}\right)}$ for goods in this range and now is $w^{\ast\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}=1/a_{i}^{\ast}.$ .) How does the afford ability of these midrange goods change for foreigners? Finally,  in the lower range (between $i\,    =\,     0$ and $i~=~I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country both before and after the population change. For the low-range goods,  show that the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is lower than the wage-price ratio before. (Hint: Show that the wage-price ratio for foreigners used to be ${w^{*}/P_{i}=1/(a_{i}\omega)}$ but now is $w^{\ast\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     1/\bigl (a_{i}\omega^{\prime}\bigr)$ after the population change.) How does the afford ability of these low-range goods change for foreigners? Overall,  what can you conclude about the change in the real per-capita income of foreigners?

∗ C 3.7. Suppose the foreign economy is fully open to free trade and its economy-wide competitiveness improves—that is,  the foreign per-unit labor requirements drop proportionally across all

industries (both active and inactive industries). What happens to the schedule of ordered productivity gaps $A (i)^{\prime}$ ? We know from the analysis of Figure 3.8 in the text that real per-capita income in the home economy increases (the new home wage $w^{\prime}$ affords more goods than the old wage $w$ ). This concept check asks you to follow similar steps to derive the result that the ∗ real per-capita income in the foreign economy also increases when the foreign economy improves its economy-wide competitiveness. In the upper range (from $i=I$ to $i=1$ ) goods are produced in the foreign economy both before and after the productivity growth. Show that the wage-price ratio of a good in the upper range is equal to the good’s foreign productivity before and after the growth. Explain why this means that goods in the upper range become more affordable to domestic residents. In the middle range (between $I^{\prime}$ and $I$ ) industries switch their production locations from the home to the foreign economy when there is foreign productivity growth. For the goods in the middle range,  show that the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is higher than the wage-price ratio before. (Hint: Show that the wage-price ratio for foreigners before the productivity change was ${w^{*}}/{P_{i}}={1}/{\left ( {{a_{i}} \omega}\right)}$ for goods $i$ in this range and now is $w^{*\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     1/a_{i}^{*\bar{\prime}};$ ; and note that $\omega\,    >\,     A^{\prime}(i)$ for the foreign produced goods.) How does the afford ability of these mid-range goods change for foreigners? Finally,  in the lower range (between $i\,    =\,     0$ and $i\,    =\,     I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country both before and after the productivity change abroad. For the low-range goods,  show that the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is also higher than the wage-price before. (Hint: Show that the wage-price ratio for foreigners used to be $w^{*}/P_{i}\,    =\,     1/(a_{i}\omega)$ but now is $w^{\ast\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     1/\bigl (a_{i}\omega^{\prime}\bigr)$ after productivity change and $\omega$ falls to $\omega^{\prime}\,    <\,    \omega,    $ .) How does the affordability of these low-range goods change for foreigners? Overall,  what can you conclude about the change in real per-capita income of foreigners?

# The Gravity Equation and Predictions of Trade Flows

C 4.1. Consider the gravity equation for an industry $i^{\prime}\mathbf{s}$ trade ﬂows between source country $S$ and destination country $D$ : $X_{S D i}\,    =\,     B_{i}\mathrm{GDP}_{S i}\mathrm{GDP}_{D i}/d_{S D}$ . If only the destination country’s GDP double,  what happens to the trade ﬂow? If both the destination country’s GDP and the source’s country’s GDP double,  what happen to the trade ﬂow? If both country grow by 10 percent,  by how many percent does the trade ﬂow grow? The crude historic ﬁgures are that trade has grown by 6 percent per year over the past three decades among OECD countries but GDP by only 3 percent per year over the same time period. Are these ﬁgures consistent with the above gravity equation?

C 4.2. Consider the version of the gravity equation that is consistent with the Ricardian trade model $X_{S D i}=B Y_{S i}Y_{D}/d_{S D},    $ where the Ricardian model wants the constant in the gravity equation to be $\begin{array}{r}{B=1/\sum_{C}Y_{C}}\end{array}$ and wants us to use the destination country’s national income $Y_{D}$ . Explain why $Y_{S i},    \; Y_{D}$ and $d_{S D}$ enter the gravity equation the way they do in the Ricardian interpretation. Explain how the freight factor relates to the price of the same good in the source and destination countries: $P_{D i}$ and $P_{S i}$ . Explain why a source country that ships its good $i$ to several destinations will receive total revenues of $\begin{array}{r}{Y_{S i}=\sum_{C}\beta_{i}\cdot Y_{C}=\beta_{i}\cdot\sum_{C}Y_{C}}\end{array}$ P .

C 4.3. Be warned,  this is a mathematical question. Consider the generalized gravity equation $X_{S D i}=$ $B_{i}(\mathrm{GDP}_{S i})^{b_{i}}(\mathrm{GDP}_{i})^{b_{D i}}/(d_{S D})^{b_{d i}},    $ ,  where $B_{i},    \,     b_{i},    \,     b_{i}$ and $b_{d i}$ are parameters and the variables are trade ﬂows $X_{S D i}$ of an industry $i$ between source country $S$ and destination country $D$ ,  the production value of the source country industry ${\mathrm{GDP}}_{S i},    $ the consumption expenditure on the

Industry at the destination $\mathrm{GDP}_{D i}$ and the geographic distance (or freight factor) $d_{S D}$ . Take the natural logarithm of both sides of the generalized gravity equation above and restate the equation. For the remainder of this question you may suppose that $b_{i}=\,     b_{d i}$ . The slope of the ﬁtted line in panel (b) of Figure 3.10 is 0.869. Note the axes in the ﬁgure are logarithmic. What does the slope of the ﬁtted line imply about the parameters of the gravity equation? In panel (a) of Figure 3.10,  the slope of the ﬁtted line of is -1.22. What does that slope imply about the parameter $b_{i}$ of the gravity equation?

# Questions

Q0.\1. Home and Foreign can produce cheese,  wine,  and tools with the following per-unit labor requirements.

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/5ad98d1dcb5cb7b2922efa473995fb344112e261746f1d7f89f47f98fbf2381c.jpg)

Suppose that wages are the same in Home and Foreign in world trade equilibrium,  $\boldsymbol{w}\,    =\,    \boldsymbol{w}^{*}$ . What good (s) will Home produce? What good (s) will Foreign produce? Population growth in Foreign makes the relative Home wage double to $w=2 w^{*}$ . What good (s) will Home produce now? What good (s) will Foreign produce? Suppose $w=2 w^{*}$ and evaluate the following statement: “Trade with Foreign hurts the Home economy because Home has to compete against cheap labor.” Does Ricardian trade theory support this statement? Explain.

Q0.\1. Suppose Chile and Brazil both excel in the production of copper and beef. Both countries have a total labor supply of 5,  000,  000 hours of labor. Their per-unit labor requirements are as follows. Chile: 4 hrs per lb. Of beef,  4 hours per lb. Of copper. Brazil: 8 hours per lb. Of beef,  10 hours per lb. Of copper. Which country has an absolute advantage in beef production (Chile,  Brazil,  neither,  or both)? Which country has an absolute advantage in copper mining? Which country has a comparative advantage in beef production? Which country has a comparative advantage in copper mining? Under free trade,  which country will specialize in which good?

Q0.\1. There are two countries and three sectors: agriculture (A),  manufacturing (M) and services (S). Wages differ by a factor of $w/w^{*}=3/2$ between the two countries. Product iv i ties in the three sectors in Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk) are given by the following constant per-unit labor requirements:

State the order of the three sectors from strongest to weakest comparative advantage for the Foreign economy. Which sectors locate at Home? Which sectors locate in the Foreign country?

Is any good not traded? Suppose productivity increases in the Home economy so that all Home sectors produce with half the per-unit labor requirements from before. So now $a_{L S}\;=\; 1/2,    $ ,  $a_{L M}=1,    $ ,  $a_{L A}=2$ . At the same world prices,  do sectors change location from one economy to the other economy? If so,  which sectors relocate for sure,  which might relocate?

Q0.\1. There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). Both countries have equally large labor forces $L=L^{*}$ . Initially,  there are two sectors: agriculture (A) and mining (M). Product iv i ties in the two sectors are given by the following constant per-unit labor requirements:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/1767c115e3a46ce4a6510543d0d04fc6883e9ed0cad75ba4f3522f4f73e3f3d8.jpg)

The two countries open to free trade. Is the pattern of trade determinate? Why? Compute the relative incomes between the two countries,  $w/w^{*}$ . Both countries collaborate on research in industrial production. As a result,  there is now a third sector that could potentially produce in both countries:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/0675686e6ea206e7e55c713b989be4e650811c4109b81ace55bd4d7e0b0c0c8a.jpg)

What is the pattern of production in the Foreign country under free trade if $w/w^{*}=1.5?$ What is the pattern of trade in the Foreign country under free trade if $w/w^{*}=1.5?$

Q0.\1. Home and Foreign invent different technologies to produce tools,  beyond their production of cheese and wine. The table of per-unit labor requirements is:

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/fd50103c8166e66d989f5578365dab66317f683c758f15513bd32eae2f2f2a14.jpg)

(1) Comparative advantage . In which good does Home have the strongest comparative advantage? In which good does Home have the least comparative advantage? (2) Trade and wages . If the relative wage rate $\begin{array}{r}{w/w^{*}=1,    }\end{array}$ ,  in what goods will Home specialize? ( Hint : You may neglect the relative size of the labor forces for your answer.) (3) Gains from trade . Do both countries beneﬁt from trade? Present an educated verbal argument. (4) Transportation costs (transfer question). If transportation costs add 50 percent to the price of a good that is shipped from one country to another,  what is the pattern of production and what is the pattern of trade? Will all goods be traded? ( Hint : Calculate the total cost of each foreign good to a home consumer and compare it the cost of the same good when produced at home; then calculate the total cost of a home good to a foreign consumer and compare it the cost of the same good when produced abroad.)

Q0.\1. Many industries $i$ can produce in two countries,  Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). There is one mobile factor of production,  labor $L$ . The ordered productivity gap schedule $A (i)$ in Figure 3.11 E depicts relative unit labor requirements $a^{*}(i)/a (i)$ by industry,  the other schedule depicts the condition for balanced trade. Suppose the population abroad $L^{*}$ grows slower than

$L$ at home. How does the labor supply ratio $L^{*}/L$ change? What happens to the ordered productivity gap schedule $A (i)^{\prime}$ ? What happens to the wage gap curve $\omega= [i/(1-i)](L^{*}/L)?$ How does the cross-country wage gap $\omega\,    =\,     w/w^{*}$ change at the depicted initial equilibrium? Suppose the difference in population growth is (almost negligibly) small. How does the range of industries $I$ producing in the home economy change at the initial equilibrium? Will real incomes at home fall or increase? Why? Given current demographic changes,  what prediction does the theory provide for the outcomes of trade between the United States on the one hand,  and Europe and Japan on the other hand?

Q0.\1. Consider a Ricardian trade model with two sectors: cheese $C$ and wine $W$ . There are two countries: Home (no asterisk) and Foreign (asterisk). The diagram in Figure 3.11 C shows the initial Home and Foreign PPFs. Depict the world terms-of-trade lines for each country and the production pattern for each country under complete specialization. The home country experiences productivity growth in its exports sector,  cutting its per-unit labor requirements for the exports good in half (but leaving all other per-unit labor requirements unchanged). Depict the changes to the relevant PPF (s). ( Hint : Extend the diagram if necessary or draw only a part of the new PPF (s).) Suppose the Home terms of trade worsen with productivity growth in its exports sector. Depict the new world terms-of-trade lines for each country and the production pattern for each country under complete specialization. Show a consumption bundle for the home country before productivity change (on the old terms-of-trade line) so that productivity change makes Home better off. Show another home consumption bundle before productivity change (on the old terms-of-trade line) so that Home is worse off with growth. This phenomenon is called im miser i zing growth ,  and we will return to it in more detail in Chapter 8 on growth and trade.

# Mathematical Appendix 3. I: Home Welfare Change when the Foreign Population Grows in the Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Model

There are three ranges of goods to look at when considering how affordable the goods are to the home economy’s residents before and after foreign population growth. Panel (b) of Figure 3.7 shows those three ranges. In the lower range,  from $i=0$ to $i=I^{\prime}$ ,  goods are produced in the home economy both before and after the Great Doubling. In this range,  the new wage in the home economy $w^{\prime}$ after the Great Doubling affords as much consumption as before because the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices remains the same as the wage-price ratio before the Great Doubling:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=0\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=I^{\prime}.
$$ 

The wage-price ratio of a good $i$ is equal to the good’s productivity because perfect competition guarantees $P_{i}=a_{i}w$ .

In the middle range,  between $I^{\prime}$ and $I_{s}$ ,  industries switch their production locations from the home economy to the foreign economy. The ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is higher than before the Great Doubling. To see this,  note that the new price is equal to $P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}$ under perfect competition,  so the new wage-price ratio can be expressed as $w^{\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}=\omega^{\prime}/a_{i}^{*},    $ ,  and that is larger than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}}}>{\frac{1}{a_{i}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~between~}}i=I^{\prime}{\mathrm{~and~}}i=I
$$ 

Because the wage gap exceeds the productivity gap $\omega^{\prime}\,    >\,     A (i)$ for goods that are foreign made. In other words,  in this range goods have become more affordable for home residents with the Great Doubling.

In the upper range from $i=I$ to $i=1,    $ ,  goods are produced in the foreign country and imported by the home economy for consumption both before and after the Great Doubling. In that range,  too,  the ratio between the new wage and these goods’ new prices is higher than before the Great Doubling:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}}}>{\frac{\omega}{a_{i}^{*}}}={\frac{w}{a_{i}w^{*}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=I\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=1
$$ 

Because $\omega^{\prime}>\omega$ in the new equilibrium after the Great Doubling.

In summary,  in two out of three ranges the goods have become more affordable for home residents with the Great Doubling and in one range the goods stayed as affordable as before. Overall,  the increase in the foreign labor supply under the Great Doubling increased the home economy’s wellbeing. As a result,  the home country’s residents are better off even though a range of industries in the economy relocated abroad. The international division of labor raises the home residents’ welfare.

# Mathematical Appendix 3. II: Home Welfare Change when Foreign Productivity Grows in the Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Model

There are three ranges of goods to look at when considering how affordable the goods are for home residents before and after foreign productivity grows. Panel (b) of Figure 3.8 shows the three ranges. In the lower range (between $i\,    =\,     0$ to $i=I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home economy both before and after the improvement in foreign productivity. In this range,  the new wage $w^{\prime}$ affords as much consumption as before because domestic productivity does not change,  and the new wage-price ratio remains the same as the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=0\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=I^{\prime}.
$$ 

In the middle range (between $I^{\prime}$ and $I$ ) industries move from home to foreign ∗ ,  and the new wage-price ratio is higher than before. To see this,  note that the new price is equal to $P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     a_{i}^{{*}\prime}w^{{*}\prime}$ under perfect competition,  so the new wage-price ratio can be expressed as $w^{\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}=\omega^{\prime}/a_{i}^{*\prime},    $ ,  and that is larger than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*i}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*i}}}>{\frac{1}{a_{i}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~between~}}i=I^{\prime}{\mathrm{~and~}}i=I
$$ 

Because the wage gap exceeds the productivity gap $\omega^{\prime}\,    >\,     A^{\prime}(i)\,    =\,     a_{i}^{*\prime}/a_{i}$ for goods that are foreign made. In other words,  in this range,  goods have become more affordable for home residents with foreign productivity growth.

In the upper range (from $i=I$ to $i=1$ ) goods are produced in the foreign country and imported for consumption at home both before and after the foreign productivity growth. In that range,  too,  the new wage-price ratio is higher than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*i}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*\prime}}}>{\frac{\omega}{a_{i}^{*}}}={\frac{w}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=I\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=1
$$ 

Because the wage gap drops less than proportionally compared to the drop in foreign per-unit labor requirements (at $I$ the vertical displacement of the $A (i)$ schedule to $A^{\prime}(i)$ is larger than the drop of $\omega$ to $\omega^{\prime}$ at $I$ ),  so that $\omega^{\prime}/\omega>a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}^{*\prime}=A^{\prime}(i)/A (i)$ after foreign productivity growth.

In summary,  in two out of three ranges,  the goods have become more affordable for home residents,  and in one range the goods remained as affordable as before. Overall,  foreign productivity growth therefore increases the well-being of the home economy’s resident. They are better off even though they lost a range of industries that relocated to the foreign economy. What is the mechanism? As you saw before in the two-sector case,  the home economy’s terms of trade improve. Free markets make the foreign economy share a part of its productivity gains with the home country.

The following Mathematical Appendix 3. III proves that the home economy’s terms of trade improve.

# Mathematical Appendix 3. III: Changes to the Terms of Trade in the Dornbusch– Fischer–Samuelson Model

There are many industries now,  so we need to broaden the deﬁnition of the terms of trade.

The terms of trade (ToT) are a ratio of product prices on the world market. If there are more than two goods,  then the terms of trade are the average price of a country’s exported (EX) goods divided by the average price of the country’s imported (IM) goods on the world market:

$$
\mathrm{ToT}={\frac{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{ExX\,     goods}\,     x}\,     P_{x}}{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{IM\,     goods}\,     m}\,     P_{m}}}.
$$ 

The expression $\operatorname{Avg}_{\operatorname{ex}}$ $x$ means that we are referring only to the average of the exported goods. Goods Similarly,  $\operatorname{Avg}_{\operatorname{IM}\,    \operatorname{goods}\,     m}$ means that we are averaging only the imported goods. The price of an exported good from the home economy is $P_{x}=w\,     a_{x},    $ and the price of an imported good to that economy is $P_{i}=w^{\ast}a_{i}^{\ast}$ so

$$
{\mathsf{z}}_{\mathrm{EX\,     goods}\,     x}\,     P_{x}=w\cdot{\mathsf{A v g}}_{\mathrm{EX\,     goods}\,     x}\,     a_{x}\qquad{\mathrm{and}}\qquad{\mathsf{A v g}}_{\mathrm{IM\,     goods}\,     m}\,     P_{m}=w^{*}\cdot{\mathsf{A v g}}_{\mathrm{IM\,     goods}\,     m}
$$ 

And

$$
\mathrm{ToT}=\omega\cdot{\frac{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{Ex}\,    \mathrm{goods}\,     x}\,     a_{x}}{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{IM}\,    \mathrm{goods}\,     m}\,     a_{m}}}.
$$ 

In most cases,  economists are less interested in the level of the ToT at any moment in time,  and more interested in changes of the ToT in response to globalization shocks or policy measures. Figuring out the response to population growth is straightforward: The ToT move in lock step with the wage gap $\omega$ because the ratio of average per-unit labor requirements only depends on productivity,  and productivity does not change. The Great Doubling raises $\omega$ in the home country (see Figure 3.7),  so the home country’s terms of trade improve.

The analysis takes more thought for a change in economy-wide competitiveness abroad. Productivity growth in the Foreign ∗ economy reduces $\omega$ (see Figure 3.8). However,  the growth simultaneously raises the ratio of the average per-unit labor requirements because the per-unit labor requirements abroad drop.

We need to discern three ranges of goods again. In the lower range (from $i=0$ to $i=I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country and exported both before and after foreign productivity growth. These goods enter the ToT numerator. In the upper range (from $i=I$ to $i=1$ ) goods are produced in the foreign country and imported for consumption at home both before and after foreign productivity growth. These goods enter the ToT denominator. Let’s ﬁrst check how the ToT respond if there were no middle range of goods (no industries relocate). Take a look back at Figure 3.8. Note that,  at $I$ ,  the vertical displacement of the $A (i)$ schedule to $A^{\prime}(i)$ is larger than the drop of $\omega$ to $\omega^{\prime}$ at $I$ . In other words,  if no industry relocates abroad after the growth in foreign productivity,  the wage gap drops less than proportionally compared to the percentage drop in the foreign per-unit labor requirements for all foreign goods so that $\omega^{\prime}/\omega>A^{\prime}(i)/A (i)=a_{i}^{*}/a_{i}^{*\prime}$ . This implies that the home country’s terms of trade improve $\mathrm{(ToT^{\prime}/T o T>1)}$ ) when no industries relocate abroad.

Now let’s see how the ToT respond due to changes that originate in the middle range of industries (from $i~=~I^{\prime}$ to $\textit{i}=\textit{I}$ ). Only industries with relatively small productivity gaps $a_{x}^{*}/a_{x}$ compared to the remaining domestic industries will leave the home economy. These industries have smaller productivity gaps than the industries that don’t leave the home economy. Similarly,  industries with relatively large productivity gaps $a_{m}^{*}/a_{m}$ compared to the existing foreign industries relocate abroad. ∗ These industries have larger productivity gaps than the existing industries in the Foreign economy.

Industry switching in the middle range therefore has a clear effect on the ratio of the average per-unit labor requirements: The ratio increases. The reason is that the foreign productivity growth pushes up the ToT denominator because the industries that remain at home have relatively larger productivity gaps than the industries that leave,  so the average productivity gap is now larger. Conversely,  the foreign productivity growth pushes down the ToT numerator because a broader range of industries including some with relatively smaller productivity gaps is being averaged. Taking the effects from all three ranges of goods together,  foreign productivity growth raises the home country’s terms of trade.

# Mathematical Appendix 3. IV: Real Income in the Dornbusch–Fischer–Samuelson Model

In this appendix we will derive the change in real income per capita for residents of the home country after the productivity declines at home. We will look at three ranges of goods to analyze the affordability of goods for home residents before and after. In the lower range (from $i=0$ to $i=I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country both before and after the home productivity decline. In this range,  the new wage $w^{\prime}$ affords less consumption than before because domestic labor productivity falls and the new wage-price ratio drops below the previous wage-price ratio:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}^{\prime}}}<{\frac{1}{a_{i}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from~}}i=0{\mathrm{~to~}}i=I^{\prime}.
$$ 

In the middle range (between $I^{\prime}$ and $I$ ) industries move from the home economy to the foreign economy. The new price is equal to $P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,     a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}$ under perfect competition,  so the new wage-price ratio for the home residents can be expressed as $w^{\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}\,    =\,    \omega^{\prime}/a_{i}^{*},    $ ,  which is less than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}}}<{\frac{1}{a_{i}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~between~}}i=I^{\prime}{\mathrm{~and~}}i=I
$$ 

Because the new wage gap $\omega^{\prime}$ is below the old ordered productivity gaps $A (i)$ that existed prior to the decline in productivity. The reason is that the new wage gap $\omega^{\prime}$ must be below the new productivity gaps $A^{\prime}(i)$ for all of the goods that the home country produces,  and the new productivity gaps $A^{\prime}(i)$ are below the old productivity gaps $A (i)$ .

Goods in the upper range (from $i=I$ to $i=1$ ) are produced in the foreign country and imported for consumption at home both before and after the productivity decline in the home country. In that range,  too,  the new wage-price ratio is lower than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}}}={\frac{\omega^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}}}<{\frac{\omega}{a_{i}^{*}}}={\frac{w}{a_{i}w^{*}}}={\frac{w}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=I\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=1
$$ 

Because the wage gap drops with the domestic productivity decline $(\omega^{\prime}<\omega)$ ).

Taken together,  home residents are worse off in terms of their consumption of goods in all three ranges when the labor productivity of their economy falls. However,  the real income loss is less than what it would be if the economy were in autarky. First,  the relocation of the home industries with the narrowest productivity gaps allows these goods to be produced more efﬁciently abroad. Such a welfare improving relocation would not be possible if the economy were in autarky. Second,  the home country’s terms of trade improve.

The home country’s terms of trade are

$$
\mathrm{ToT}={\frac{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{Ex}\,    \mathrm{goods}\,     x}\,     P_{x}}{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{IM\,     goods}\,     m}\,     P_{m}}}=\omega\cdot{\frac{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{Ex}\,    \mathrm{goods}\,     x}\,     a_{x}}{\mathrm{Avg}_{\mathrm{IM\,     goods}\,     m}\,     a_{m}}}.
$$ 

A productivity decline in the home economy reduces $\omega$ (see Figure 3.8),  but it simultaneously raises the ratio of the average per-unit labor requirements because the per-unit labor requirements at home rise. We need to discern three ranges of goods also for the terms of trade.

In the lower range (from $i=0$ to $i=I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country and exported,  both before and after the productivity decline there. These goods enter the ToT numerator. In the upper range (from $\textit{i}=\textit{I}$ to $\textit{i}=1$ ) goods are produced in the foreign country and imported for consumption at home both before and after the productivity decline. These goods enter the ToT denominator. Let’s ﬁrst check how the ToT respond if there were no middle range of goods (no industries relocate abroad). From Figure 3.8 we see that at $I^{\prime}$ ,  the vertical displacement of the $A (i)$ schedule to $A^{\prime}(i)$ is larger than the drop of $\omega$ to $\omega^{\prime}$ at $I^{\prime}$ . In other words,  if no industries relocate abroad,  the wage gap drops less than proportionally compared to the increase in the per-unit labor requirements in the home economy so that $\omega/\omega^{\prime}<\bar{A}(i)/\bar{A}^{\prime}(i)=a_{i}/a_{i}^{\prime}$ after the productivity decline at home. This implies that the home country’s terms of trade improve $\mathrm{(Tot^{\prime}/T o T>1)}$ ) if no industries move abroad.

Now let’s see how the ToT respond due to changes that originate in the middle range of industries. Only industries with relatively small productivity gaps $a_{x}^{*}/a_{x}$ for the home economy relocate abroad. These industries have smaller productivity gaps than the industries that remain at home. Similarly,  industries with relatively large productivity gaps $a_{m}^{*}/a_{m}$ for the foreign economy move abroad. These industries have larger productivity gaps than the existing industries in the foreign economy. Industry switches in the middle range therefore have a clear effect on the ratio of the average per-unit labor requirements: The ratio increases. The reason is that the productivity decline in the home economy pushes up the country’s ToT denominator because industries with relatively smaller productivity gaps that remained in the country are being averaged. Conversely,  the decline pushes down the ToT numerator because a broader range of industries,  including some with relatively larger productivity gaps,  is being averaged.

When all three ranges of goods are considered,  a productivity decline in the home country improves its terms of trade.

To derive the change in real income per capita for foreign residents after a decline in the productivity of the home country,  there are also three ranges of goods to analyze. In the lower range (from $i\,    =\,     0$ to $i\,    =\,     I^{\prime}$ ) goods are produced in the home country and exported,  both before and after the $w^{\ast\prime}$ home productivity decline. In this range,  the new wage affords home residents less consumption than before:

$$
{\frac{w^{*}{}^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{*}{}^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{\prime}w^{\prime}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}^{\prime}\omega^{\prime}}}<{\frac{1}{a_{i}\omega}}={\frac{w^{*}}{a_{i}w}}={\frac{w^{*}}{P_{i}}}\qquad\mathrm{in~the~range~from~}i=0\mathrm{~to~}i=I^{\prime}
$$ 

Because the vertical displacement of the $A (i)$ schedule to $A^{\prime}(i)$ is larger than the drop of $\omega$ to $\omega^{\prime}$ at $I$ and all industries below $i,    $ as panel (b) of Figure 3.8 shows. Consequently,  $\omega^{\prime}/\omega>A^{\prime}(i)/A (i)=a_{i}^{\prime}/a_{i}$ after the productivity decline.

In the middle range (between $I^{\prime}$ and $I$ ) industries relocate abroad. The new price is $\begin{array}{r}{P_{i}^{\prime}=a_{i}^{*}w^{*\prime}=,    }\end{array}$ so the new wage-price ratio for foreign residents can be expressed as $w^{\ast\prime}/P_{i}^{\prime}=1/a_{i}^{\ast},    $ ,  and that is less than the wage-price ratio before:

$$
{\frac{w^{*}{}^{\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{*}{}^{\prime}}{a_{i}^{*}w^{*}{}^{\prime}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}^{*}}}<{\frac{1}{a_{i}\omega}}={\frac{w^{*}}{P_{i}}}={\frac{w^{*}}{P_{i}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~between~}}i=I^{\prime}{\mathrm{~and~}}i=I
$$ 

Because $\omega$ used to be below the old productivity gaps $(\omega<A (i))$ when the home country still produced that middle range of goods.

Goods in the upper range (from $i=I$ to $i=1$ ) are produced in the foreign country,  both before and after the home productivity decline. In that range,  the new wage-price ratio is the same as before:

$$
{\frac{w^{*\prime}}{P_{i}^{\prime}}}={\frac{w^{*}}{P_{i}}}={\frac{1}{a_{i}^{*}}}\qquad{\mathrm{in~the~range~from}}\; i=I\;{\mathrm{to}}\; i=1
$$ 

Because there is no productivity change in the foreign economy.

Taken together,  foreign residents are also worse off when their trading partner,  the home country,  experiences a productivity decline.

# Statistical Online Supplement 3. S 1: Gravity-based [[Chapter 2-The Principle Of Comparative Advantage|Comparative Advantage]]

The gravity equation allows us to isolate the comparative advantage component from the trade ﬂows. After we estimate the gravity equation,  we can statistically remove from the trade ﬂows the components that are best explained by geography or the market characteristics of the destinations to which the products were exported—that is characteristics over which a source economy’s industry has no control. That way we can truly look at how [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage,   Competitiveness,   and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] the industries in the source country are. The Balassa measure of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) is quick to compute but imprecise because it does not accomplish this isolation of the source economy’s industrial competitiveness.

Let’s call the part of a bilateral trade ﬂow that is best explained by the destination-market characteristics $Y_{D i}$ and the part that is best explained by the source-country characteristics $Y_{S i}$ . We can then 13 rewrite the gravity equation as

$$
X_{S D i}=B_{i}\frac{Y_{S i}\cdot Y_{D i}}{d_{S D}}.
$$ 

We can extract $Y_{S i}$ from the estimated gravity equation for all countries and now base a new measure of comparative advantage solely on the exporting-country component $Y_{S i}$ . We deﬁne the gravity-based comparative advantage measure (GCA) as

$$
G C A_{i}^{\mathrm{Coutry}\; S}\equiv\frac{Y_{S i}/\sum_{k}Y_{S k}}{\sum_{C}Y_{C i}/\sum_{C}\sum_{k}Y_{C k}}.
$$ 

The mathemati l sign $\textstyle\sum_{k}$ denotes the summation over all $k$ industries,  and $\sum_{C}$ denotes the summation over all C countries. Like with the Balassa RCA measure,  we make a double comparison. The difference is that we now use the gravity-based trade ﬂow component $Y_{S i}$ instead of the trade ﬂow itself.

The order of the double comparison doesn’t matter. Neither does the order of the divisions matter in a ratio. We compare the country-industry $S i$ to all other countries $C$ in that industry (dividing $Y_{S i}$ by $\sum_{C}Y_{C i})$ ) and compare country $S$ to all other countries (dividing $\sum{_k\,     Y_{S k}}$ by $\textstyle\sum_{C}\sum_{k}Y_{C k})$ ). The GCA measure is also a measure of revealed comparative advantage in the sense that GCA is silent about the origins of the international trade ﬂows. By using the gravity component $Y_{S i},    $ the GCA measure removes from the source country’s trade ﬂows the otherwise confounding effects of the destination-market characteristics $Y_{D i}$ and physical distance $d_{D S,    }$ ,  so we get a pure source-countryindustry measure of comparative advantage.

How does GCA relate to the productivity gap,  which is the key feature of Ricardian trade theory? For comparison,  panel (a) of Figure 3.12 shows the Balassa RCA measure and the productivity gaps (the same as in Figure 3.9). Panel (b) of Figure 3.12 shows the GCA measure and the productivity gaps. The association between GCA and the productivity gaps is considerably more pronounced and signiﬁcant than the association between the RCA and the productivity gaps is. The GCA data points are closer to the straight line drawn through them than the RCA data points are. Because the GCA measure removes the effect that the distance between countries and destination markets have,

It more clearly measures the productivity behind an industry’s export success in a source country. In other words,  the GCA removes the “lucky” effects industries experience by being nearby attractive destination markets.

# Statistical Online Supplement 3. S 2: Gravity Estimation

There are many uses of the gravity equation. Two of the most common ones are (i) to assess the relevance of speciﬁc country characteristics and speciﬁc types of barriers to trade in select industries; and (ii) to estimate the pure source-country component of trade ﬂows not related to destinationmarket characteristics and trade barriers.

# The Relevance of Country Characteristics and Trade Barriers

The gravity spec i cation by Tinbergen (1962) and P¨oyh¨onen (1963) is an example of the ﬁrst gravity application used to assess country characteristics and trade barriers and their impact on bilateral trade. We want to estimate

$$
X_{S D i}=B_{i}\frac{(\mathrm{GDP}_{S i})^{b_{S i}}(\mathrm{GDP}_{D i})^{b_{D i}}}{(d_{S D})^{b_{d i}}},    
$$ 

where $B_{i},    \,     b_{S i},    \,     b_{D i}$ and $b_{d i}$ are estimation coe f ci ents and the variables in the bilateral data are trade ﬂows $X_{S D i},    $ the production value of the source country industry $\mathrm {{GDP}} _{S i},    $ the consumption expenditure on the industry at the destination $\mathrm{GDP}_{D i},    $ and the geographic distance (or freight factor) $d_{S D}$ . For each industry $i,    $ an observation (a row in the data set) is for a country pair $S–D$ . To estimate a gravity equation at the level of country pairs,  not industries,  you can sum the trade variables up to the country level and sum up the production value and consumption expenditure data per industry to ﬁnd GDP of the countries.

A convenient step is to take the natural logarithm $(\log)$ of all of the variables $X_{S D i},    \mathrm{GDP}_{S i},    \mathrm{GDP}_{D i}$ and $d_{S D}$ . Then the estimation equation becomes 15

$$
\ln X_{S D i}=b_{i}+b_{S i}\ln\mathrm{GDP}_{S i}+b_{D i}\ln\mathrm{GDP}_{D i}-b_{d i}\ln d_{S D}+e_{S D i},    
$$ 

Where the new constant $b_{i}=\ln B_{i},    $ and $e_{S D i}$ is an error term with a mean of zero (and the error term is assumed to be independent of any of the regressors). This equation is linear in the logs of the variables and can be estimated with an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression,  industry by industry.

The linear spec i cation also makes it easy to include more variables in the gravity equation. Empirical economists often add variables such as the population of a country in addition to its GDP,  geographic barriers to trade besides distance including indicators for landlocked countries or for country pairs with no common border,  and human barriers to trade such as common language between the two countries or legal differences and tariffs between the two countries. After estimating an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression,  one can then test,  industry by industry,  which trade barriers or country characteristics matter (because their coe f ci ents are statistically sign i cant ly different than zero) or which are the strongest predictors.

# Estimation of the Pure Source-Country Component in Trade Flows

Suppose you want to assess the export success of an industry in a country that is not explained by favorable destination-market conditions or geographic circumstances. For this purpose,  you can estimate

$$
X_{S D i}=B_{i}\frac{Y_{S i}Y_{D i}}{(d_{S D})^{b_{d i}}},    
$$ 

Where $B_{i}$ and $b_{d i}$ are estimation coe f ci ents,  $Y_{S i}$ is an estimation coefﬁcient that summarizes the source-country’s industry characteristics,  $Y_{D i}$ is an estimation coefﬁcient that summarizes the charact eris tics of the destination market,  and $d_{S D}$ is the only variable (the geographic distance or freight factor).

A convenient step is again to take the log of all of the components. Then the estimation equation becomes

$$
\ln X_{S D i}=b_{i}+y_{S i}+y_{D i}-b_{d i}\ln d_{S D}+e_{S D i},    
$$ 

Where the new constant $b_{i}=\ln B_{i},    $ and $e_{S D i}$ is an error term with a mean of zero (and the error term is assumed to be independent of any of the regressors). The new logarithmic estimation coe f ci ents $y_{ Ḋ }S i Ḍ$ and $y_{ Ḋ }D i Ḍ$ are $y_{C i}=\ln{Y_{C i}}$ for country $C$ . This equation is linear in the coe f ci ents and the log of the distance variable and can be estimated industry by industry using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

The spec i cation with both $y_{S i}$ and $y_{D i}$ requires that we include in the regression a full set of indicator (dummy) variables for source countries $S$ ,  less one source country (the United States for example) to prevent multi-col linearity,  and a full set of dummy variables for destination countries $D$ ,  but no constant. The regression coe f ci ents on the dummy variables are then the estimates for $y_{S i}$ and $y_{D i}$ . Using $Y_{S i}=\exp\{y_{S i}\},    $ you can recover the full set of pure country industry characteristics,  except for the omitted reference country (the United States). Note that you cannot include variables that are speciﬁc to the source country or speciﬁc to the destination country in such a regression because the dummy variables for the countries would be multi-collinear with those variables. You can only include variables that are speciﬁc to a source-destination pair.

When there are many dummy variables,  such as in our case with 200 countries in each industry regression,  econometrics and statistics textbooks recommend you run a ﬁxed effects (OLS-FE) regression instead. Most statistical software packages include ﬁxed effects regression programs. The programs often use the following insight: if you ﬁrst perform a ﬁxed effects transformation by subtracting the group averages from the left-hand side variable and all right-hand side variables of the regression equation (you “demean the data”),  then the dummies need not be included in the regression,  and the coefﬁcient estimates are identical (the standard errors are corrected for the degrees of freedom that went away with demeaning). However,  there is an important caveat when two full sets of dummies are used,  such as for the gravity equation estimation. It is wrong to perform two subsequent “demeaning exercises” for the two sets of ﬁxed effects. Instead,  you can only demean the data for one set of dummies.

We are interested in coefﬁcient estimates for the source country component $y_{S i}$ . Here is how you can proceed. First take the logarithms of the left-hand side trade ﬂow variable and all right-hand side variables that vary at the country-pair level (such as distance). Then specify the destination country $D$ identiﬁer as the “panel variable” for the ﬁxed effects. This ensures the software package applies the ﬁxed effects transformation to all of the other variables,  including the full set of source country dummies (less the United States say). Then specify the regression

$$
\overline {{{\ln X}} }_{S D i}^{D}=b_{i}+\overline {{{y}} }_{S i}^{D}-b_{d i}\overline {{{\ln d}} }_{S D}^{D}+e_{S D i}^{D},    
$$ 

Where the bars and $D$ superscript denote “demeaned” variables with respect to the destination country $D$ . The regression coe f ci ents for the source country dummies are then the estimates for $y_{S i}$ . If you also wish to recover the estimates for $y_{D i},    $ obtain the predicted residuals $e_{S D i}^{D}$ from your regression,  and take the averages of the residuals destination country by destination country. Those destination country averages of the residuals are equal to $y_{ Ḋ }D i Ḍ$ by the properties of a linear regression.

You can now use $Y_{S i}=\exp\{y_{S i}\}$ to construct the GCA measure. Or,  you can run a regression of $Y_{S i}$ on other source country characteristics you think matter for the success of an industry’s exports. Be careful,  however. If you use $Y_{S i}$ or a function of $Y_{S i}$ such as GCA as a left-hand side variable in a new regression,  you face the so-called generated regressor problem. Since $Y_{S i}$ is an estimate,  the standard errors in any regression that uses $Y_{S i}$ on the left-hand side are incorrect.
