# Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization

[[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]]

Imagine you arrive from outer space to visit planet Earth for the ﬁrst time. You wish to study how the residents of Earth live with one another. You start by beaming yourself around the planet and meet a random sample of four people: Issa from rural India,  Julia from Rio de Janeiro,  Chao from Shanghai,  and Mike from rural California. These people do not know each other,  but they are connected.

Issa knows of the United States because her family can,  for the ﬁrst time,  afford a mud hut. The small and tough guar bean her family grows in the Indian desert has become a crucial component for oil and gas extraction equipment used in the United States to perform a process called fracking . But Issa is worried that the Monsoon rains might be meager this year,  and farmers elsewhere on the globe could become successful growers of guar beans too. Julia rents out apartments to shortterm visitors in Rio de Janeiro. She wonders about her fellow Brazilians whose families became rich growing coffee. Instead of drinking traditional cafezinho cups of coffee,  they now slurp foreign brands of espresso or latte. Meanwhile,  her relatives ship soybeans to China for animal feed.

Chao is an older man and still wonders how in less than a generation he,  his wife,  and son have escaped poverty and come to live in an urban apartment in Shanghai,  eating meals his family could never have afforded when he was a child. But Chao worries that his employer in the garment industry is running into difﬁcult times,  and wonders why his country purchases passenger airplanes from Brazil rather than manufacturing them. Mike works from home as a software developer for a Californian technology company. Together with a small team in India,  he programs electronic components that are produced in China and Brazil. His cell phone runs on these components,  and he worries that it does not take many programmers to make smart phones. Mike is also concerned with the environmental consequences of the new fracking technology being used in the neighborhood of his rural town.

What drives the global division of labor? Would these four people and their economies be better to-do if they were not connected to one another? If you could sever all their ties and undo the global division of labor,  would these people be better or worse off? Would their incomes be more equal to one another and to those of other people in their own countries?

These questions are what $i f,  $ or counter factual,  questions,  which are some of the toughest ones in the social sciences to answer. There are hardly any answers without a theory. We cannot even assess evidence without ﬁrst having a theory. Nancy D. Cartwright (1989,  p. 39),  a leading scholar who studies scientiﬁc methods,  puts it this way: “No causes in,  no causes out.” Economists develop models to provide explanations for the evidence they are assessing. They hypothesize what drives the observed behavior,  what helps industries thrive or shrink,  what induces ﬁrms to enter markets,  and what makes international investments shape the global economy. Economists then revisit the evidence to check their theories. That is also how this textbook will proceed. And it is how you and I should proceed when answering economic questions.

# 1.1 Globalization

The recent mix and spread of economic activity across national economies has brought the world back to a degree of economic integration not seen for over a century—and perhaps ever before in history. The ﬂow of ideas,  people,  goods,  services,  and capital today differs from earlier periods of international economic integration,  both in nature and degree. Hence the new term globalization .

[[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] is the dispersion and connection of social and economic activity across national economies. A new body of economic research into globalization has accompanied the global change. This textbook will make you familiar with the classic and new economic insights into globalization. [[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] has many aspects. There is international trade in goods,  there are international investment ﬂows in the global capital market,  there is labor migration across countries,  and there is the international diffusion of ideas. The world economy is more integrated today in these four aspects than it has been for a century. But globalization evolves in waves.

By many measures,  about a decade or two ago the world returned to a level of globalization it had ﬁrst attained a hundred years earlier under the Gold Standard. The Gold Standard lasted from the 19 th century up to the First World War. Under the Gold Standard,  a large number of countries ﬁxed their currencies to gold and consequently their exchange rates with each other. During the same period,  transport technologies such as the steamship and the railroad took off and sharply reduced freight factors,  which measure transport costs as a percentage of a good’s price. Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O’Rourke (2007,  Table 7.2) document freight factors for numerous goods and many global shipping routes during the Gold Standard. For example,  the freight factor of wheat from Chicago to the United Kingdom fell from 33 percent to 7 percent between 1870 and 1910,  the freight factor of rice from Rangoon to Europe dropped from 74 percent in 1880 to 18 percent in 1910,  and that of coffee from Brazil to Europe came down to just 1 percent in 1910 from 5 percent in 1860. It was a period of fast economic growth with relatively open ﬂows of goods and capital,  and relatively free migration. In today’s economy,  air transport,  mobile telephony and internet communication hold costs of global logistics down even further.

International trade in goods regained its importance in global production around the 1970 s,  when exports as a percentage of the world’s production returned to a level they had previously reached under the Gold Standard. Figure 1.1 shows the share of exports in world gross domestic product (GDP) over the period 1820 to 2010. Annual GDP measures the value of all goods and services that the economy generates in a year. By the end of the ﬁrst global period in around 1913,  the share of exports in world production was 9 percent. It took the world six decades to reach a level of just over 10 percent again. But since the Second World War,  the world has globalized at a faster pace than during the preceding century and a half,  and even faster than during the prosperous time under the Gold Standard.

The historic statistics in the ﬁgure are from Angus Maddison’s (2001) book on two millennia of economic history,  a culmination of evidence from a lifetime of his economic research. Maddison also documents that,  hidden behind the world total,  are large differences between the globalization paths of individual countries. The United States and China,  for instance,  had relatively closed economies in 1870. Their trade with other countries was minor. Exports comprised only 2.5 percent of U.S production,  and only 0.7 percent of China’s GDP. Today the two countries have relatively open economies.

Note : The graph is based on a consistent sample of 56 countries (accounting for 93 percent of world output and 87 percent of world exports on average,  see Angus Maddison 1995),  except in 1820,  when the sample consisted of 8 countries. The comparison over time is based on international (Geary-Khamis) dollar prices for 1990.

Figure 1.1: Share of Exports in World GDP,  1820-2010

In 2010,  China’s exports were 29.5 percent of its production,  and the exports of the United States comprised 12.7 percent of its GDP. Brazil has taken a different path. In 1870,  Brazil’s economy used to be relatively open,  and its exports-to-GDP ratio was fairly high at 12.2 percent. However,  by 1998 Brazil’s economy had become quite closed with an exports-to-GDP ratio of just 5.4 percent. In 2010 Brazil’s exports were back up to 10.9 percent of production,  around the country’s historic peak.

Not only has the volume of foreign trade changed,  its nature has changed too. Rather than shipping mainly ﬁnal goods as for much of history,  companies now trade intermediate goods and halfﬁnished products across production stages. Some economists call this the international fragmentation of production,  but one might just as well call the same phenomenon the international integration of production. French economists call the same process delocalization ,  and a common English term for foreign trade across production stages is [[Chapter 6-Intermediate Input Trade and Offshoring|offshoring]] . Until a ﬁnal product is ready today,  its parts and intermediate components may have crossed country borders many times. Even more stunningly,  the parts and components may not have left the ownership and control of a single,  multinational ﬁrm during that time. Multinational ﬁrms dominate today’s trade.

International capital markets today are arguably as integrated as never before. But only since the beginning of this century may the world have returned to the degree of capital integration it achieved during the Gold Standard. There are many measures of capital-market integration,  including the stock of capital invested across borders,  measures of similarity between interest rates and capital returns around the world,  and investment ﬂows per world GDP. Having worked with objective statistics like these for many years,  Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor (2004) proposed the summary measure of capital mobility illustrated in Figure 1.2. Their measure shows that the integration level of global capital markets over the centuries and across ﬁnancial systems has had a bumpy ride. Only by about the end of the last century did the level return to what it had been in 1914.

The emergence of the multinational ﬁrm has changed the nature of international capital ﬂows

Substantially. Until about the 1980 s,  much of the international lending from rich to poor countries consisted of government-to-government loans or private bank-to-government loans. Foreign direct investment ﬂows now dominate. Foreign direct investment is the capital ﬂow from the headquarters of a multinational ﬁrm to its foreign afﬁliates. Foreign direct investments have risen even faster than trade ﬂows since the 1970 s.

Like the other ﬂows we have looked at,  the international migration of people around the world is far from being a new phenomenon or historically high today. Table 1.1 shows the share of foreignborn residents in the total population of select countries. The so-called “new world” countries such as Argentina,  Australia,  and New Zealand host a much smaller share of foreign-born residents today than in the early 20 th century,  and the United States and Canada are no more open to migrants than they were back then. In this sense,  the world has de-globalized. Asian economies,  including the large countries of India and China,  didn’t host a signiﬁcant number of foreign residents,  nor do they today. There is one noteworthy novelty of today’s global migration,  though. Countries in the “old world” of Europe have turned into destinations for migrants,  rather than sending migrants to other countries as they have in the past. It is probably a fair guess that the stock of migrants relative to world population is not much different today than it was a century ago. Compared to foreign trade and international capital ﬂows,  migration is probably the least advanced aspect of globalization. This textbook will therefore place its emphasis on foreign trade and international capital ﬂows.

# 1.2 Waves of Globalization

Humankind achieved most of its living standard just over the last two centuries. Maddison (2001) estimates that per capita GDP in the world economy was the same in the year 1000 as it was in the year 1. By 1820,  income per person was only a little more than 50 per cent higher than what it used to be in 1000. But around 1820 or so,  global income growth started to take off. The global economy showed its best performance yet in the two to three decades just after the Second World War. By 2000,  world per capita GDP had risen to more than 8.5 times (850 percent) its level in 1820.

Jeffrey G. Williamson (2005) has traced globalization,  and its winners and losers,  over the course of the past two centuries and found three waves of changing international integration. By his account,  and that of several other students of global economic history,  the ﬁrst global century starts around 1820 and ends with the First World War. However,  globalization took a huge step backward during the interwar period (1914 to 1945). The second global century ,  the second boom period of globalization,  began after the Second World War and persists today.

Prior to the ﬁrst wave of globalization,  which began around 1820,  the world was mired in mercantilism. Proponents of mercantilism believed it was best for a country to export more than import,  which would result in inﬂows of gold or other precious metals as payment for the surplus exports. The thinking went that piling up reserves of precious metals at the expense of rival powers was a sign of prosperity. From today’s point of view,  mercanti list aspirations may have as much economic merit as becoming Donald Duck’s gold-hoarding uncle Scrooge McDuck. Adhering to mercanti list thought,  many governments would not allow manufacturing activity in colony settlements,  which were also sometimes called the periphery. Instead,  manufacturing and major trading functions that could have been carried out in the colonies around the world were handled through monopolies in the so-called core countries (the colonizers). No ”free trade” type of globalization was integrating markets and large disparities in product prices around the world prevailed. If markets were integrated,  products would sell for similar prices everywhere. Large differences in incomes persisted as well.

The ﬁrst wave of globalization set in under the Pax Britannica ,  or peace under Britain’s hegemony after the Napoleonic wars. Product prices converged,  especially between Western Europe and regions of North and South America bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Larger price differences persisted between Europe and Asia or Africa on the other side of the world. Remnants of mercantilism were dismantled,  and global labor and capital markets experienced an unprecedented level of integration until 1913. Migration ﬂows soared,  although some migration quotas started to be imposed in the “new world” at the end of the 19 th century. Capital markets experienced levels of integration that would remain unparalleled until the late 20 th century. Trade costs persistently declined.

Then came the anti-global movement,  or retreat,  which occurred between about 1913 and 1950. To varying degrees countries started to impose barriers on both immigration and the trade of merchandise since the First World War. During the Great Depression,  which started around the time of the collapse of U.S. stock market prices on October 29,  1929,  governments raised trade barriers and devalued their currencies to stimulate their exports at the expense of their neighbors production. In some sense,  mercantilism was back. However,  one can only ”beggar thy neighbor” with trade restrictions and currency devaluations if the neighbor does not retaliate with a devaluation and trade restrictions of its own. And that’s what countries routinely did around the world—they imposed their own trade barriers in response to those of other countries. What followed was a global collapse in trade and capital ﬂows. Gaps in the prices of goods around the world returned to levels of the 1870 s (Peter H. Lindert and Jeffrey G. Williamson 2003). The share of foreign capital ﬂows relative to the world’s GDP contracted by a factor of three (Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor 1998). In the United States,  one of the major destinations for migrants during the ﬁrst period of globalization,  the share of foreign-born residents fell markedly. In 1913,  the share was 14.7 percent. By 1929,  it had dropped to less than half of that,  just 6.9 percent.

After the Second World War,  the world underwent a second global period. The beginnings were tightly controlled by governments. Especially capital ﬂows were closely managed from around 1950 until the early 1970 s to avert large trade imbalances and foster the exchange of goods and services under relatively stable currencies. Currencies were ﬁxed to the U.S. dollar,  which in turn was tied to gold. In the early 1970 s,  various market developments led countries to abandon the management of capital ﬂows and the ﬁxed exchange-rate regime. Today,  most currencies freely ﬂoat in value relative to one another,  depending on market forces.

By the early 1970 s,  world exports had recovered to their levels during the ﬁrst wave of globalization. By the late 20 th century,  capital ﬂows had too. However,  the level of migration hasn’t changed much and may have declined.

# 1.3 Global Income Disparity

The global distribution of incomes has also shifted over the past two centuries. It is a hard empirical task to relate the changes in income dispersion to globalization. Open economies clearly gain from globalization. Their residents have access to a broader range of [[Chapter 3-Comparative Advantage, Competitiveness, and the Terms of Trade|competitive]] products,  industries are allowed to specialize in the activities that offer the highest returns,  and producers have greater access to ﬁnancing for innovative projects. But there are winners and losers from globalization,  just as there are both costs and opportunities associated with any other economic change—be it technical progress,  innovation,  or the perpetual shifts in people’s tastes and demands. Over the course of history,  different political systems have devised different responses to protect or compensate the losers. Countries have imposed restrictions on trade,  capital ﬂows and immigration,  or strengthened their social safety nets.

Much of the discontent with globalization and ardent arguments in favor of globalization relate to the disparity of incomes between countries and the distribution of incomes within them. The impact of,  and backlashes to,  prior waves of globalization coincide with concerns about inequality. Does globalization foster convergence between poor and rich regions or cause divergence? Does globalization hurt or beneﬁt low-skilled workers,  the middle class,  or capital owners? Do these effects differ between economies? Economic thought,  and empirical evidence,  on these issues is far from conclusive. Before we can turn to the deeper explanations,  it is important to know the facts.

Similar to our opening example with four people from around the globe,  imagine that you want to measure the dispersion of incomes between countries. You also want to measure income inequality among residents within countries. You will need country-by-country household data to do so. For the two centuries since 1820,  Francois Bourguignon and Christian Morrisson (2002) collected global household data,  and Christian Morrisson and Fabrice Murtin (2011) updated the data recently . Then you need a good summary measure of worldwide income inequality. A convenient such inequality measure is the Theil index. Without going into its details,  the Theil index is larger when inequality is more extreme. The index also offers the nice feature that you can add together the inequality within countries and between countries to get total global inequality.

Figure 1.3 displays the results. Incomes between countries did not differ much in 1820. However,  as world income growth picked up,  led ﬁrst by the United Kingdom and then by the United States,  income gaps widened. Since 1820,  the inequality between countries steadily rose until 1992. At the beginning of this century the United States was more than 100 times richer than the world’s poorest country. In contrast,  income inequality within countries remained relatively constant from 1820 until the First World War and then dropped markedly until 1960. Within-country inequalty rose only slightly from 1960 to 1992. Put together,  over the course of 150 years the contribution of withincountry inequality to total inequality dropped from nearly 90 per cent in 1820 to just 40 per cent in 1992.

Things changed sharply in 1992,  after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Russian Federation and other formerly socialist economies once again became part of the global economy. Large emerging economies such as China,  India,  Brazil,  and South Africa stepped up their integration while they saw their per-capita incomes increase. From its historic peak in the late 20 th century,  between-country inequality has dropped considerably over the past two decades—to a level not seen since the period of the Gold Standard. Overall,  after almost 200 years of unparalleled growth and rising inequality,  global inequality appears to have stabilized,  albeit at a higher level than before.

Global inequality has widened in periods with and without globalization. During the ﬁrst global century,  worldwide inequality increased sharply. In contrast,  during the past two decades of the

 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/9fa627c3f09298274e2736ea6244f52794639e71742585b3aedac614ba5367dd.jpg)

Second global century,  worldwide inequality has dropped. During the anti-globalization period between the two World Wars,  global inequality remained largely unchanged because widening betweencountry inequality was just about offset by a drop in within-country inequality. Between-country inequality is relevant. For the last two decades,  the between-country component explains between one-half and 60 per cent of overall world inequality.

The facts suggest that the relationship between globalization,  growth,  and income dispersion is probably an intricate one. This textbook will explore the nexus between trade,  capital market integration and incomes from several perspectives. It may come as no surprise to you that the theories’ predictions can be as ambiguous as the evidence. Whether openness increases growth,  or faster growth induces countries to globalize,  is a largely unsettled question. There is little dispute,  however,  that a country’s deeper global integration and faster growth typically go hand in hand.

# 1.4 The Economics of Globalization

[[Chapter 1-Introduction to Globalization|Globalization]] is a long-term phenomenon. This book therefore ﬁrst emphasizes the basic principles behind the exchange of goods or services and behind the global allocation of capital. The classic theory of trade plays the opening act in the ﬁrst part of the book. To capture important features of the most recent wave of globalization,  theoretical extensions then account for trade along the global supply chain and the elusive nexus between trade and growth. In the second part of the book,  individual ﬁrms and workers differ in their capabilities and respond to globalization in varying ways. As we have explained,  multinational ﬁrms in particular are the dominant intermediaries of international trade. The third part of the book attempts to explain the long-term determinants of capital ﬂows,  their implication for economic growth,  and their recurring imbalances. Much international economic policy is concerned with shorter time horizons,  however,  and often monetary issues. This book deals with those issues in the ﬁnal fourth part,  using a representation of open-economy macroeconomics that emphasizes the anchoring function of purchasing power parity in the long run.

Three themes have guided this introduction,  and will continue to guide the exposition for the remainder of the book: Why do countries globalize ? How do they globalize ? And should they globalize ? The principle of comparative advantage,  in its various forms and guises,  helps answer all three of these questions.

First,  why is there globalization? The same economic forces that give rise to comparative advantage explain why the international division of labor arises in open markets. The basic principles underlying each chapter appear in a box at the beginning of the chapter. That way,  you can apply the principles to evaluate and explain how economies and industries differ in terms of their globalization. Second,  how does and will globalization progress? This book will show you how to predict the patterns of global trade and international investment. The comparative advantage across industries and countries determines the global division of labor. Third,  will an economy beneﬁt from global integration? The principle of comparative advantage leaves no doubt that free trade and free capital ﬂows can unlock gains for every open economy. But different residents within the economy will win or lose from globalization as it progresses. Thus,  they will have different opinions about it. However,  the country as a whole can be expected to gain from globalization,  which should mean that there will be enough additional resources to make the adversely affected residents no worse off and still let the winners gain from globalization.

Each of the three themes is also subject to empirical scrutiny: Are the assumptions behind the ﬁrst theme,  the reasons for globalization,  empirically plausible? Are the predictions under the second theme,  the pattern of trade and investment,  borne out in the real world? Did we fail to capture important aspects of the evidence? For the third theme,  are the actual effects on the income distribution as predicted? As you will see over and over again,  the answers to all these questions are intricately linked to the principle of comparative advantage. The principle is our starting point in the next chapter.
