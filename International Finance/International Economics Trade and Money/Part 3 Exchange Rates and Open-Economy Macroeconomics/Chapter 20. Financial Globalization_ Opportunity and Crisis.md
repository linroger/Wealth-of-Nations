# CHAPTER 20  

# Financial Globalization: Opportunity and Crisis  

f a financier named Rip van Winkle had gone to sleep in the 1960s and awakI ened today, he would have been shocked by changes in both the nature and the scale of international financial activity. In the early 1960s, for example, most banking business was purely domestic, involving the currency and customers of the bank’s home country. Five decades later, many banks were deriving a large share of their profits from international activities. To his surprise, Rip would have found that he could locate branches of Citibank in São Paulo, Brazil, and branches of Britain’s Barclays Bank in New York. He would also have discovered that it had long since become routine for a branch of an American bank located in London to accept a deposit denominated in Japanese yen from a Swedish corporation or to lend Swiss francs to a Dutch manufacturer. Finally, he would have noticed much greater participation by nonbank financial institutions in international markets and a huge expansion in the sheer volume of global transactions.  

The market in which residents of different countries trade assets is called the international capital market. The international capital market is not really a single market; it is instead a group of closely interconnected markets in which asset exchanges with some international dimension take place. International currency trades take place in the foreign exchange market, which is an important part of the international capital market. The main actors in the international capital market are the same as those in the foreign exchange market (Chapter 14): commercial banks, large corporations, nonbank financial institutions, central banks, and other government agencies. And, like the foreign exchange market, the international capital market’s activities take place in a network of world financial centers linked by sophisticated communications systems. The assets traded in the international capital market, however, include different countries’ stocks and bonds in addition to bank deposits denominated in their currencies.  

This chapter discusses four main questions about the international capital market. First, how can this well-oiled global financial network enhance countries’ gains from international trade? Second, what has caused the rapid growth in international financial activity since the early 1960s? Third, what dangers are posed by an integrated world capital market straddling national borders? And fourth, how can policy makers minimize problems raised by the global capital market without sharply reducing the benefits it provides?

# The International Capital Market and the Gains from Trade  

In earlier chapters, the discussion of gains from international trade concentrated on exchanges involving goods and services. By providing a worldwide payments system that lowers transaction costs, banks active in the international capital market enlarge the trade gains that result from such exchanges. Furthermore, the international capital market brings borrowers and lenders in different countries together in order to finance the global pattern of current account imbalances. But most deals that take place in the international capital market are exchanges of assets between residents of different countries, for example, the exchange of a share of IBM stock for some British government bonds. Although such asset trades are sometimes derided as unproductive “speculation,” they do, in fact, lead to gains from trade that can make consumers everywhere better off.  

# Three Types of Gain from Trade  

All transactions between the residents of different countries fall into one of three categories: trades of goods or services for goods or services, trades of goods or services for assets, and trades of assets for assets. At any moment, a country is generally carrying out trades in each of these categories. Figure 20-1 (which assumes that there are two countries, Home and Foreign) illustrates the three types of international transaction, each of which involves a different set of possible gains from trade.  

So far in this book we have discussed two types of trade gain. Chapters 3 through 8 showed that countries can gain by concentrating on the production activities in which they are most efficient and by using some of their output to pay for imports of other products from abroad. This type of trade gain involves the exchange of goods or services for other goods or services. The top horizontal arrow in Figure 20-1 shows exchanges of goods and services between Home and Foreign.  

# FIGURE 20-1  

# The Three Types of International Transaction  

Residents of different countries can trade goods and services for other goods and services, goods and services for assets (that is, for future goods and services), and assets for other assets. All three types of exchange lead to gains from trade.  

![](images/5ae8f3fd766afdc4572245d6d75c3ba9efd349fa89dbb0152addd4f20e14695d.jpg)  

A second set of trade gains results from intertemporal trade, which is the exchange of goods and services for claims to future goods and services, that is, for assets (Chapters 6 and 19). When a developing country borrows abroad (that is, sells a bond to foreigners) so that it can import materials for a domestic investment project, it is engaging in intertemporal trade—trade that would not be possible without an international capital market. The diagonal arrows in Figure 20-1 indicate trades of goods and services for assets. If Home has a current account deficit with Foreign, for example, it is a net exporter of assets to Foreign and a net importer of goods and services from Foreign.  

The bottom horizontal arrow in Figure 20-1 represents the last category of international transaction, trades of assets for assets, such as the exchange of real estate located in France for U.S. Treasury bonds. Looking at Table 13-2 (in Chapter 13’s section on “The Balance of Payments Accounts”), you will see in the 2019 U.S. balance of payments financial account both a $\$440.75$ billion net purchase of foreign assets by U.S. residents and a $\$797.96$ billion net purchase of U.S. assets by foreign residents. (These numbers do not include derivatives; the BEA reports only net trade in derivatives.) So while the United States could have financed its current account deficit simply by selling assets to foreigners and not buying any from them, U.S. and foreign residents also engaged in pure asset swapping.1 Such a large volume of trade in assets between countries occurs in part because international asset trades, like trades involving goods and services, can yield benefits to all the countries involved.  

While the preceding distinctions may appear clear-cut in theory, be aware that in the real world, different types of trade may occur together because they are complementary. For example, importers may need to buy foreign goods on the basis of credit from sellers and repay after they have sold the goods to domestic consumers. In this case, the importers’ ability to obtain goods today in return for a promise to repay soon after—a form of intertemporal trade—is vital to promoting international exchange of goods and services. As a second example, exporters may need to hedge future foreign exchange receipts in forward exchange markets. In this case, a trade of assets for assets—future foreign currency against future domestic currency—lowers exporters’ costs of carrying out goods and services exchanges.  

# Risk Aversion  

When individuals select assets, an important factor in their decisions is the riskiness of each asset’s return (Chapter 14). Other things equal, people dislike risk. Economists call this property of people’s preferences risk aversion. Chapter 18 showed that risk-averse investors in foreign currency assets base their demand for a particular asset on its riskiness (as measured by a risk premium) in addition to its expected return.  

An example will make the meaning of risk aversion clearer. Suppose you are offered a gamble in which you win $\$1,000$ half the time but lose $\$1,000$ half the time. Since you are as likely to win as to lose the $\$1,000$ , the average payoff on this gamble—its expected value—is $\begin{array}{r}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times(\mathbb{S}1,000)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times(-\mathbb{S}1,000)\stackrel{-}{=}\hat{0}.}\end{array}$ If you are risk averse, you will not take the gamble because, for you, the possibility of losing $\$1,000$ outweighs the possibility that you will win, even though both outcomes are equally likely. Although some people (called risk lovers) enjoy taking risks and would take the gamble, there is much evidence that risk-averse behavior is the norm. For example, risk aversion helps explain the profitability of insurance companies, which sell policies that allow people to protect themselves or their families from the financial risks of theft, illness, and other mishaps.  

If people are risk averse, they value a collection (or portfolio) of assets not only on the basis of its expected return but also on the basis of the riskiness of that return. Under risk aversion, for example, people may be willing to hold bonds denominated in several different currencies, even if the interest rates they offer are not linked by the interest parity condition, if the resulting portfolio of assets offers a desirable combination of return and risk. In general, a portfolio whose return fluctuates wildly from year to year is less desirable than one that offers the same average return with only mild year-to-year fluctuations. This observation is basic to understanding why countries exchange assets.  

# Portfolio Diversification as a Motive for International Asset Trade  

International trade in assets can make both parties to the trade better off by allowing them to reduce the riskiness of the return on their wealth. Trade accomplishes this reduction in risk by allowing both parties to diversify their portfolios—to divide their wealth among a wide spectrum of assets and thus reduce the amount of money they have riding on each individual asset. The late economist James Tobin of Yale University, an originator of the theory of portfolio choice with risk aversion, once described the idea of portfolio diversification as “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.” When an economy is opened to the international capital market, it can reduce the riskiness of its wealth by placing some of its “eggs” in additional foreign “baskets.” This reduction in risk is the basic motive for asset trade.  

A simple two-country example illustrates how countries are made better off by trade in assets. Imagine there are two countries, Home and Foreign, and residents of each own only one asset, domestic land yielding an annual harvest of kiwifruit.  

The yield of the land is uncertain, however. Half of the time, Home’s land yields a harvest of 100 tons of kiwifruit at the same time as Foreign’s land yields a harvest of 50 tons. The other half of the time, the outcomes are reversed: The Foreign harvest is 100 tons, but the Home harvest is only 50. On average, then, each country has a harvest of $\begin{array}{r}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times(100)+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times(50)=75}\end{array}$ tons of kiwifruit, but its inhabitants never know whether the next year will bring feast or famine.  

Now suppose the two countries can trade shares in the ownership of their respective assets. A Home owner of a 10 percent share in Foreign land, for example, receives 10 percent of the annual Foreign kiwifruit harvest, and a Foreign owner of a 10 percent share in Home land is similarly entitled to 10 percent of the Home harvest. What happens if there is international trade in these two assets? Home residents will buy a 50 percent share of Foreign land, and they will pay for it by giving Foreign residents a 50 percent share in Home land.  

To understand why this is the outcome, think about the returns to the Home and Foreign portfolios when both are equally divided between titles to Home and Foreign land. When times are good in Home (and therefore bad in Foreign), each country earns the same return on its portfolio: half of the Home harvest (100 tons of kiwifruit) plus half of the Foreign harvest (50 tons of kiwifruit), or 75 tons of fruit. In the opposite case—bad times in Home, good times in Foreign—each country still earns 75 tons of fruit. If the countries hold portfolios equally divided between the two assets, therefore, each country earns a certain return of 75 tons of fruit—the same as the average or expected harvest each faced before international asset trade was possible.  

Since the two available assets—Home and Foreign land—have the same return on average, any portfolio consisting of those assets yields an expected (or average) return of 75 tons of fruit. People everywhere are risk averse, however, so all prefer to hold the fifty-fifty portfolio, which gives a sure return of 75 tons of fruit every year. After trade opens, therefore, residents of the two countries will swap titles to land until they reach the fifty-fifty outcome. Because this trade eliminates the risk faced by both countries without changing average returns, both countries are clearly better off owing to asset trade.  

Our example oversimplifies because countries can never really eliminate all risk through international asset trade. (Unlike the model’s world, the real world is a risky place even in the aggregate!) The example does demonstrate that countries can nonetheless reduce the riskiness of their wealth by diversifying their asset portfolios internationally. A major function of the international capital market is to make this diversification possible.2  

# The Menu of International Assets: Debt versus Equity  

International asset trades can be exchanges of many different types of assets. Among the many assets traded in the international capital market are bonds and deposits denominated in different currencies, shares of stock, and more complicated financial instruments such as stock or currency options. A purchase of foreign real estate and the direct acquisition of a factory in another country are other ways of diversifying abroad.  

In thinking about asset trades, it is frequently useful to make a distinction between debt instruments and equity instruments. Bonds and bank deposits are debt instruments, since they specify that the issuer of the instrument must repay a fixed value (the sum of principal plus interest) regardless of economic circumstances. In contrast, a share of stock is an equity instrument: It is a claim to a firm’s profits, rather than to a fixed payment, and its payoff will vary according to circumstances. Similarly, the kiwifruit shares traded in our example are equity instruments. By choosing how to divide their portfolios between debt and equity instruments, individuals and nations can arrange to stay close to desired consumption and investment levels despite the different eventualities that could occur.  

The dividing line between debt and equity is not a neat one in practice. Even if an instrument’s money payout is the same in different states of the world, its real payout in a particular state will depend on national price levels and exchange rates. In addition, the payments that a given instrument promises to make may not occur in cases of bankruptcy, government seizure of foreign-owned assets, and so on. Assets like low-grade corporate bonds, which superficially appear to be debt, may in reality be like equity in offering payoffs that depend on the doubtful financial fortunes of the issuer. The same has turned out to be true of the debt of many developing countries, as we will see in Chapter 22.  

# International Banking and the International Capital Market  

The earlier Home–Foreign kiwifruit example portrayed an imaginary world with only two assets. Since the number of assets available in the real world is enormous, specialized institutions have sprung up to bring together buyers and sellers of assets located in different countries.  

# The Structure of the International Capital Market  

As we have noted, the main actors in the international capital market include commercial banks, corporations, nonbank financial institutions (such as insurance companies, money market funds, hedge funds, and pension funds), central banks, and other government agencies.  

1.	 Commercial banks. Commercial banks are at the center of the international capital market, not only because they run the international payments mechanism but also because of the broad range of financial activities they undertake. Bank liabilities consist chiefly of deposits of various maturities, as well as debt and short-term borrowing from other financial institutions, while their assets consist largely of loans (to corporations and governments), deposits at other banks (interbank deposits), and various securities including bonds. Multinational banks are also heavily involved in other types of asset transaction. For example, banks may underwrite issues of corporate stocks and bonds by agreeing, for a fee, to find buyers for those securities at a guaranteed price. One of the key facts about international banking is that banks are often free to pursue activities abroad that they could not legally pursue in their home countries. This type of regulatory asymmetry has spurred the growth of international banking over the past 50 years.  

2.	 Corporations. Corporations—particularly those with multinational operations such as Coca-Cola, IBM, Toyota, and Nike—routinely finance their investments by drawing on foreign sources of funds. To obtain these funds, corporations may sell shares of stock, which give owners an equity claim to the corporation’s assets, or they may use debt finance. Debt finance often takes the form of borrowing from and through international banks or other institutional lenders; firms also sell shortterm commercial paper and corporate debt instruments in the international capital market. Corporations frequently denominate their bonds in the currency of the financial center in which the bonds are for sale. Increasingly, however, corporations have been pursuing novel denomination strategies that make their bonds attractive to a wider spectrum of potential buyers.  

3.	 Nonbank financial institutions. Nonbank institutions such as insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds have become important players in the international capital market as they have moved into foreign assets to diversify their portfolios. Of particular importance are investment banks, which are not banks at all but specialize in underwriting sales of stocks and bonds by corporations and (in some cases) governments, providing advice on mergers and acquisitions, and facilitating transactions for clients, among other functions. Investment banks may be freestanding but in most cases belong to large financial conglomerates that also include commercial banks. Prominent examples include Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, and Barclays Capital.  

4.	 Central banks and other government agencies. Central banks are routinely involved in the international financial markets through foreign exchange intervention. In addition, other government agencies frequently borrow abroad. Developingcountry governments and state-owned enterprises have borrowed substantially from foreign commercial banks, and regularly sell bonds abroad.  

On any measure, the scale of transactions in the international capital market has grown much more quickly than world GDP since the early 1970s. One major factor in this development is that, starting with the industrial world, countries have progressively dismantled barriers to private capital flows across their borders.  

An important reason for that development relates to exchange rate systems. According to the monetary trilemma of Chapter 19, the widespread adoption of flexible exchange rates since the early 1970s has allowed countries to reconcile open capital markets with domestic monetary autonomy. The individual member countries of the European economic and monetary union (Chapter 21) have followed a different route with respect to their mutual exchange rates. However, the euro floats against foreign currencies and the euro zone as a unit orients its monetary policy toward internal macro­economic goals while permitting freedom of cross-border payments.  

# Offshore Banking and Offshore Currency Trading  

One of the most pervasive features of today’s commercial banking industry is that banking activities have become globalized as banks have branched out from their home countries into foreign financial centers. In 1960, only eight American banks had branches in foreign countries, but now hundreds have such branches. Similarly, the number of foreign bank offices in the United States has risen steadily. In Europe, Switzerland has been an attractive host country for foreign banks since World War II. In 1960, 48 foreign banks were active in Switzerland, and this number has surpassed 100 around the year 1980. In contrast, Swiss banks had only 12 branches in foreign countries in the year 1960, though this number has been steadily increasing since then as well.3  

We use the term offshore banking to describe the business that banks’ foreign offices conduct outside their home countries. Banks may conduct foreign business through any of three types of institutions:  

1.	 An agency office located abroad, which arranges loans and transfers funds but does not accept deposits.   
2.	 A subsidiary bank located abroad. A subsidiary of a foreign bank differs from a local bank only in that a foreign bank is the controlling owner. Subsidiaries are subject to the same regulations as local banks but are not subject to the regulations of the parent bank’s country.   
3.	 A foreign branch, which is simply an office of the home bank in another country. Branches carry out the same business as local banks and are usually subject to local and home banking regulations. Often, however, branches can take advantage of cross-border regulatory differences.  

The growth of offshore currency trading has gone hand in hand with that of offshore banking. An offshore deposit is simply a bank deposit denominated in a currency other than that of the country in which the bank resides—for example, yen deposits in a London bank or dollar deposits in Zurich. Many of the deposits traded in the foreign exchange market are offshore deposits. Offshore currency deposits are usually referred to as Eurocurrencies, which is something of a misnomer since much Eurocurrency trading occurs in such non-European centers as Singapore and Hong Kong. We call dollar deposits located outside the United States Eurodollars. Banks that accept deposits denominated in Eurocurrencies (including Eurodollars) are known as Eurobanks. The advent of the new European currency, the euro, has made this terminology even more confusing!  

One motivation for the rapid growth of offshore banking and currency trading has been the growth of international trade and the increasingly multinational nature of corporate activity. American firms engaged in international trade, for example, require overseas financial services, and American banks have naturally expanded their domestic business with these firms into foreign areas. By offering more rapid clearing of payments and the flexibility and trust established in previous dealings, American banks compete with the foreign banks that could also serve American customers. Eurocurrency trading is another natural outgrowth of expanding world trade in goods and services. British importers of American goods frequently need to hold dollar deposits, for example, and it is natural for banks based in London to woo these importers’ business.  

World trade growth alone, however, cannot explain the growth of international banking since the 1960s. Another factor is the banks’ desire to escape domestic government regulations on financial activity (and sometimes taxes) by shifting some of their operations abroad and into foreign currencies. A further factor is in part political: the desire by some depositors to hold currencies outside the jurisdictions of the countries that issue them. In recent years, the tendency for countries to open their financial markets to foreigners has allowed international banks to compete globally for new business.  

Another factor behind the profitability of Eurocurrency trading has been regulatory: In formulating bank regulations, governments in the main Eurocurrency centers have discriminated between deposits denominated in the home currency and those denominated in others, between transactions with domestic customers and those with foreign customers, and between activities of foreign-owned and domestic banks. Domestic currency deposits, for example, often were more heavily regulated as a way of maintaining control over the domestic money supply, while banks were given more freedom in their dealings in foreign currencies.  

Regulatory asymmetries explain why those financial centers whose governments historically imposed the fewest restrictions on foreign currency banking became the main Eurocurrency centers. London is the leader in this respect, but it has been followed by  

Luxembourg, Bahrain, Hong Kong, and other countries that have competed for international banking business by lowering restrictions and taxes on foreign bank operations within their borders.  

# The Shadow Banking System  

In recent decades, a major regulatory asymmetry has arisen between banks and what is often referred to as the shadow banking system. Nowadays, numerous financial institutions provide payment and credit services similar to those that banks provide. U.S. money market mutual funds, for example, provide check-writing services to customers and also are major players in providing credit to firms (through commercial paper markets) and in lending dollars to banks outside the United States. Investment banks also have provided credit to other entities while offering payment services. The shadow banking system even has included investment conduits sponsored by banks but supposedly independent of the banks’ own balance sheets. However, shadow banks have usually been minimally regulated compared to banks.  

Why has this been the case? Historically, monetary policy makers have viewed banks as the prime focus of concern because of their centrality to the payments system, to the flow of credit to firms and household borrowers, and to the implementation of monetary policy. But the shadow banking system has grown dramatically and taken up many of the same functions as traditional banking. Total shadow banking sector assets are difficult to measure precisely, but in the United States today, they are probably comparable to the assets of the traditional banking sector.  

Moreover, shadow banks are closely intertwined with banks as both creditors and borrowers. As a result, the stability of the shadow banking network cannot easily be divorced from that of the banks: If a shadow bank gets into trouble, so may the banks that have loaned it money. This became painfully clear during the 2007–2009 global financial crisis, as we shall see later in this chapter. We now turn to a discussion of banking regulation, but readers should be aware that banks are only one category of player in the international financial markets and that banks’ fortunes are likely to depend on those of other players. Most of what we will say regarding “banks” also applies to shadow banks.  

# Banking and Financial Fragility  

Many observers believe that the freewheeling nature of global banking activity up until now left the world financial system vulnerable to bank failure on a massive scale. The financial crisis of 2007–2009, which we will soon discuss, supports that belief. To understand what went wrong with financial globalization, we need first to review the inherent fragility of banking activity, even when undertaken in a hypothetical closed economy, and the safeguards national governments have put in place to prevent bank failures.  

# The Problem of Bank Failure  

A bank fails when it is unable to meet its obligations to its depositors and other creditors. Banks use borrowed funds to make loans and to purchase other assets, but some of a bank’s borrowers may find themselves unable to repay their loans, or the bank’s assets may decline in value for some other reason. When this happens, the bank might be unable to repay its short-term liabilities, including demand deposits, which are largely repayable immediately, without notice.  

A peculiar feature of banking is that a bank’s financial health depends on depositors’ (and other creditors’) confidence in the value of its assets. If depositors, for example, come to believe that many of the bank’s assets have declined in value, each has an incentive to withdraw his or her funds and place them in a different bank. A bank faced with a large and sudden loss of deposits—a bank run—is likely to close its doors, even if the asset side of its balance sheet is fundamentally sound. The reason is that many bank assets are illiquid and cannot be sold quickly to meet deposit obligations without substantial loss to the bank. If an atmosphere of financial panic develops, therefore, bank failure may not be limited to banks that have mismanaged their assets. It is in the interest of each depositor to withdraw his or her money from a bank if all other depositors are doing the same, even when the bank’s assets, if only they could be held until maturity, would suffice to repay fully the bank’s liabilities.  

Unfortunately, once a single bank gets into trouble, suspicion may fall on other banks that have lent it money: If they lose enough on the loans, they may be unable to meet their own obligations. When banks are highly interconnected through mutual loans and derivative contracts, bank runs therefore can be highly contagious. Unless policy makers can quickly quarantine the panic, the domino effects of a single bank’s troubles can result in a generalized, or systemic, banking crisis.  

It is easiest to understand a bank’s vulnerability by looking at its balance sheet. The stylized balance sheet below shows the relationship between the bank’s assets, its liabilities, and their difference, the bank’s capital (its non-borrowed resources, supplied by the bank’s owners, who hold the bank’s stock):  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">BankBalanceSheet</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td>Liabilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Loans</td><td>$1,950</td><td>Demand deposits</td><td>$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Marketable securities</td><td>$1,950</td><td>Time deposits and long debt</td><td>$1,400</td></tr><tr><td>Reserves at central bank</td><td>$75</td><td>Short-term wholesale liabilities</td><td>$1,400</td></tr><tr><td>Cash on hand</td><td>$25</td><td>Capital</td><td>$ 200</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In this example, the bank’s total assets (listed on the Assets side of its balance sheet) are $\$4,000$ . They consist of a small amount of cash (\$25) and reserves (\$75, the latter being deposits at the home central bank), as well as potentially less liquid loans to businesses and households (\$1,950) and other securities (such as government or corporate bonds, totaling \$1,950). Cash in the bank’s vaults obviously can be used any time to meet depositors’ withdrawals, as can its central bank deposits, but loans (for example, mortgage loans) cannot be called in at will, and thus are usually highly illiquid. Marketable securities, in contrast, can be sold off, but if market conditions happen to be unfavorable, the bank might have to sell at a loss if forced to do so on short notice. In a financial panic, for example, other banks might simultaneously be trying to unload similar securities, driving down their market prices.  

The bank makes its profits by accepting the risk that its assets may fall in value, while at the same time promising depositors and other short-term creditors that they can get their money back whenever they want it. The Liabilities side of its balance sheet reflects the bank’s provision of liquidity to its creditors. Banks’ time deposits and long-term debt (\$1,400) are sources of funding that cannot flee at the whim of the lenders, and the bank accordingly pays a higher rate of interest on these liabilities than on its two sources of short-term funding, (retail) demand deposits (\$1,000) and short-term wholesale liabilities (\$1,400). The latter might take various forms, including overnight loans from other banks (including the central bank) or a collateralized repurchase agreement (known as “repo”), in which the bank pledges an asset to the lender for cash, promising to buy the asset back later (often the next day) at a slightly higher price. If all wholesale lenders refuse to renew their short-term loans to the bank, however, it will have to scramble for cash by trying to sell off assets, just as in the case of a retail depositor bank run. In general, banks’ balance sheets are characterized by maturity mismatch—they have more liabilities payable on short notice than they hold of such assets—and this is what makes them vulnerable to runs.  

Bank capital (here, $\$200$ ) is the difference between assets and liabilities and is the amount the bank could lose on its assets before it becomes insolvent, that is, unable to pay off its debts by selling its assets. Without the buffer of bank capital, the bank would have no margin for error and creditors would never believe in the bank’s ability always to repay. In that case, the bank could not conduct its business of exploiting the interest difference or “carry” between its liquid liabilities and less liquid assets. Because a bank depends on the confidence of its creditors, even the suspicion that it could be insolvent may lead creditors to demand instant repayment, forcing it to liquidate assets at a loss and making it insolvent in fact. This scenario is most likely in the case of a systemic financial crisis, in which the prices of marketable assets that the bank normally could sell easily are depressed due to distress selling by numerous financial institutions.4  

The lower a bank’s capital, the higher the chance that it becomes insolvent due to losses in asset values, whether these are due to external events in the economy or due to a run by its creditors. It may therefore surprise you that large, globally active banks have tended to operate in the past with fairly slim margins of capital. In our example, which is not unrealistic, the ratio of capital to total bank assets is only $\$200/84,000=5$ percent, implying that the bank can tolerate at most a 5 percent loss on assets before it fails. Many large global banks have operated with even lower capital levels! Although banks usually avoid big positions in highly risky assets such as stock shares, and they also avoid unhedged or “open” positions in foreign currencies, numerous banks throughout the world still got into trouble during the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. Because of that experience, international policy makers are attempting to ensure that banks throughout the world maintain higher capital levels, as we explain later in this chapter.  

Bank failures obviously inflict serious financial harm on individual depositors who lose their money. But beyond these individual losses, bank failure can harm the economy’s macroeconomic stability. One bank’s problems may easily spread to sounder banks if people suspect them of having lent to the bank that is in trouble. Such a general loss of confidence in banks undermines the credit and payments system on which the economy runs. A rash of bank failures can bring a drastic reduction in the banking system’s ability to finance investment, consumer-durable expenditure, and home purchases, thus reducing aggregate demand and throwing the economy into a slump. There is strong evidence that the string of U.S. bank closings in the early 1930s helped start and worsen the Great Depression, and financial panic certainly worsened the severe worldwide recession that began in 2007.5  

# Government Safeguards against Financial Instability  

Because the potential consequences of a banking collapse are so harmful, governments attempt to prevent bank failures through extensive regulation of their domestic banking systems. Well-managed banks themselves take precautions against failure even in the absence of regulation, but the costs of failure extend far beyond the bank’s owners. Thus, some banks, taking into account their own self-interest but ignoring the costs of bank failure for society, might be led to shoulder a level of risk greater than what is socially optimal. In addition, even banks with cautious investment strategies may fail if rumors of financial trouble begin circulating. Many of the precautionary bank regulation measures taken by governments today are a direct result of their countries’ experiences during the Great Depression.  

In most countries, an extensive “safety net” has been set up to reduce the risk of bank failure. The main safeguards are:  

1.	 Deposit insurance. One legacy of the Great Depression of the 1930s is deposit insurance. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures bank depositors against losses of up to a current limit of $\$250,000$ . Banks are required to contribute to the FDIC to cover the cost of this insurance. FDIC insurance discourages runs on banks by small depositors who know that their losses will be covered by the government: They no longer have an incentive to withdraw their money just because others are doing so. Since 1989, the FDIC has also provided insurance for deposits with savings and loan (S&L) associations.6 The absence of government insurance is one reason policy makers sometimes give for the comparatively light regulation of banks’ offshore operations as well as of the shadow banking system. Also, in European countries, deposit insurance schemes were installed since the 1930s, albeit on a lower scale than in the U.S. ­Different national schemes existed in parallel until 1994, when the member countries of the European Community defined the common minimum requirement of guaranteeing at least 90 percent of the deposited amount, up to at least €20,000 per person. By the end of 2010, this common minimum requirement increased to €100,000, which is guaranteed for 100 percent in all countries.7   
2.	 Reserve requirements. Reserve requirements are one possible tool of monetary policy, influencing the relation between the monetary base and monetary aggregates. At the same time, reserve requirements force the bank to hold a portion of its assets in a liquid form that is easy to mobilize to meet sudden deposit outflows. In the United States, banks tend to hold reserves in excess of required reserves, so reserve requirements are not important. In our preceding balance-sheet example, the bank’s total liquid reserves (including cash) are $\$100$ , only 2.5 percent of its total assets. The reserve requirement for banks in the euro zone was 2 percent between 1999 and 2012, after which it got reduced to 1 percent. Like in the U.S., banks tended to hold excess reserves during and after the 2007–2009 crisis.8  

3.	 Capital requirements and asset restrictions. U.S. and foreign bank regulators set minimum required levels of bank capital to reduce the system’s vulnerability to failure. Other rules prevent banks from holding assets that are “too risky,” such as common stocks, whose prices tend to be volatile. Banks must also deal with rules against lending too large a fraction of their assets to a single private customer or to a single foreign government borrower. On the global level, a framework for voluntary capital requirements has been defined by the Basel Committee (discussed later in this chapter). The member states of the EU have already transposed the latest version of this framework, called Basel III, into binding EU law in 2013.9  

4.	 Bank examination. Government supervisors have the right to examine a bank’s books to ensure compliance with bank capital standards and other regulations. Banks may be forced to sell assets that the examiner deems too risky or to adjust their balance sheets by writing off loans the examiner thinks will not be repaid. In some countries, the central bank is the main bank supervisor, while in others a separate financial supervision authority handles that job. In the EU, the European Banking Authority was established in 2011 as a response to the 2007–2009 crisis. Its EU-wide examinations of large banks are commonly known as “stress tests”, as their aim is to quantify the resilience of banks against various crisis-like scenarios.   
5.	 Lender of last resort facilities. Banks can borrow from the central bank’s discount window or from other facilities the central bank may make available (generally after they post assets of comparable or greater value as collateral). While lending to banks is a tool of monetary management, the central bank can also use discounting to prevent or quarantine bank panics. Since a central bank has the ability to create currency, it can lend to banks facing massive deposit outflows as much as they need to satisfy their depositors’ claims. When the central bank acts in this way, it is acting as a lender of last resort (LLR) to the bank. Indeed, the United States set up the Federal Reserve in 1913 precisely as a safeguard against financial panic. When depositors know the central bank is standing by as the LLR, they have more confidence in a private bank’s ability to withstand a panic and are therefore less likely to run if financial trouble looms. The administration of LLR facilities is complex, however. If banks think the central bank will always bail them out, they will take excessive risks. So the central bank must make access to its LLR services conditional on sound management. To decide when banks in trouble have not brought it on themselves through unwise risk taking, the LLR should ideally be closely involved in the bank examination process. A similar mechanism is in place for the euro zone countries, where national central banks may offer Emergency Liquidity Assistance to illiquid but solvent banks in their countries. During the 2007–2009 crisis, banks in several eurozone members made use of this mechanism, including banks in Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland and Cyprus.  

6.	 Government-organized restructuring and bailouts. The central bank’s LLR role aims to tide over banks suffering temporary liquidity problems due to jittery creditors. Hopefully, the bank will be solvent if the central bank can give it enough time to dispose of assets at favorable prices; and if so, the central bank will not lose money as a result of its intervention. Often, however, creditors are jittery for a good reason and big losses on assets are unavoidable. In this case, the national fiscal authorities, along with taxpayer money, enter the picture. The central bank and fiscal authorities may organize the purchase of a failing bank by healthier institutions, sometimes throwing their own money into the deal as a sweetener. The fiscal authorities may also recapitalize the bank with public monies, in effect making the government a full or part owner of the bank until the bank is back on its feet and the public shares can be sold to private buyers. In these cases, bankruptcy can be avoided thanks to the government’s intervention as a crisis manager, but perhaps at public expense. The government may alternatively choose to protect taxpayers by imposing losses—sometimes called haircuts—on the claims of unsecured bondholders or uninsured depositors.10  

How successful have safeguards such as these been? Figure 20-2 shows the frequency of ongoing national banking crises—systemic crises that have affected large portions of countries’ banking systems—between 1976 and 2017.11 Banking crises in the poorer developing and emerging market economies are shown in the solid peaks, while crises in industrial economies including the United States are shown in the hatched peaks. Obviously, such systemic crises have not been rare events! As we will discuss in Chapter 22, through much of recent history poorer countries have regulated their banks much less effectively than richer countries, implying a much greater frequency of financial instability in the developing world. However, that changed in 2007–2009 as many more prosperous economies’ banks required extensive government support in order to survive. The 2007–2009 crisis thus revealed serious gaps in the banking safety net, gaps that we will soon analyze.

The U.S. commercial bank safety net worked reasonably well until the late 1980s, but as a result of deregulation, the 1990–1991 recession, and a sharp fall in commercial property values, bank closings rose dramatically and the FDIC insurance fund was depleted. Like the United States, other countries that deregulated domestic banking in the 1980s—including Japan, the Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland—faced serious problems a decade later. Many overhauled their systems of banking safeguards as a result, but as we shall see, those safeguards were not nearly sufficient to prevent the massive financial crisis of 2007–2009.  

# Moral Hazard and the Problem of “Too Big to Fail”  

The listed banking safeguards fall into two categories: facilities for emergency financial support to banks or their customers and curbs on unwise risk taking by banks.  

It is important to realize that these two types of safeguard are complements, not substitutes. An expectation of LLR support or a government-organized bailout package in case of problems may cause banks to extend excessively risky loans and to provision inadequately for investment losses. Deposit insurance will reassure depositors that they need not monitor the bank management’s decisions; and without the threat of a bank run to discipline them, bank managers will pursue riskier strategies on the margin, including maintaining an inadequate capital cushion and holding insufficient cash.  

The possibility that someone who is insured against an accident will take less care to prevent it is called moral hazard. Domestic bank supervision and balance-sheet restrictions are necessary to limit the moral hazard resulting from deposit insurance and access to the lender of last resort, which otherwise would lead banks to make excessively risky loans and inadequate provision for their possible failure.  

# DOES THE IMF CREATE MORAL HAZARD?  

A s seen in chapter 19, the IMF was created to ensure the stability of the international monetary system. A crucial responsibility of the IMF is to extend loans to member countries that are experiencing or may experience balance of payments problems.  

Over the years, the IMF has customized the kind of loans it provides, based on the actual or potential crisis it is responding to. These include Stand-By Arrangement, Extended Fund Facility, Flexible Credit Line, and Rapid Credit Line. At the end of 2016, around 40 countries had received a loan from one of these categories.  

Though IMF loans are a helpful tool in times of crises, they also raise the issue of moral hazard. These loans may be perceived by countries as the assurance of safety nets and lead to risky or unbalanced policies.  

What can prevent the IMF from becoming an insurer? First, the IMF has put a conditionality agreement in place. This means that it intervenes only if the country requesting a loan commits to adopting a relevant recovery program. To create this program, the IMF focuses on the policies on subsidies and public sector among other things. That may be causing economic malfunction. The result is a tough negotiation, which has even led some Latin American governments to protest against the IMF.  

Second, like World Bank loans, IMF loans are never included in any rescheduling agreements as part of the recovery plan. This means these loans must always be fully repaid. Thus, a country cannot treat the IMF’s aid as a windfall gain. Finally, the call to the IMF is stigmatizing in the eyes of the international community: a country asking for help from the IMF signals that its situation is critical. This leads to a drop in confidence in the country’s economy and discourages foreigners to continue to lend and to invest in it.  

The FDIC limit of $\$250,000$ on the size of insured deposits is meant to limit moral hazard by encouraging big depositors, and other bank creditors including interbank lenders, to monitor the actions of bank managers. In principle, those big depositors could take their business elsewhere if their bank appears to be taking unwise risks. The problem is that some banks have become so big in global markets and so interconnected with other banks and shadow banks that their failure might set off a chain reaction that throws the entire financial system into crisis.  

When rumors began circulating in May 1984 that the Continental Illinois National Bank had made a large number of bad loans, the bank began rapidly to lose its large, uninsured deposits. At the time, the bank was the seventh biggest in the United States and many of its deposits were owned by foreign banks, so its failure could have set off a much bigger global banking crisis. As part of its rescue effort, the FDIC extended its insurance coverage to all of Continental Illinois’s deposits, regardless of size. This and later episodes have convinced people that the U.S. government was following a “too-big-to-fail” policy of fully protecting all creditors of the largest banks. Even more far-reaching policies were implemented in several Northern European countries in the early 1990s, when their banking and financial sectors were on the brink of a systemic collapse. In Sweden, for example, the government had to rescue three of the four largest banks from insolvency either by providing large loans (in case of Första Sparbanken) or by nationalization (in the cases of Nordbanken and Gota Bank). Moreover, the Swedish government declared an unlimited guarantee for all forms of debt of all Swedish banks, thereby effectively reducing the probability of additional insolvencies. The policy of maintaining the peg of Swedish krona to the ECU, however, turned out to be less successful. When international financial investors anticipated a devaluation of the krona in late 1992, the resulting outflow of capital and foreign reserves could not be stopped even by raising the overnight interest rate to the extremely high level of 500 percent (expressed at an annual rate). The fixed exchange rate was abandoned eventually, allowing the krona to freely float against other currencies ever since. During the course of the year 1993, financial markets calmed down and the Swedish government was able to sell off most of its bank holdings thereafter. All in all, this decisive combination of temporary nationalization, creation of “bad banks” for nonperforming assets, and unlimited guarantees for creditors (but not for shareholders) became a general benchmark for countries in financial crises.  

At the same time in the U.K., the financial crisis primarily affected small banks who were not by themselves systematically important. More specifically, the group of banks whose solvency was threatened accounted for less than 1 percent of the stock of U.K. lending to the non-financial private sector. Although 25 banks failed over the course of four years (i.e., much more than in Sweden at the same time), their combined assets amounted to just 0.2 percent of GDP. Due to the high degree of interconnectedness of financial institutions, however, the Bank of England (i.e., the central bank) became increasingly worried about the possibility of contagion to larger, systemically important banks. Eventually, it decided to intervene by arranging financial support to three small banks and by providing close supervisory review to further 40 small banks.12  

When a financial institution is systemically important—that is, “too big to fail” or “too interconnected to fail”—its managers and creditors expect that the government will have no choice but to support it in case it gets into trouble. The resulting moral hazard sets off a vicious circle: Because people perceive that the institution is under the umbrella of government support, it can borrow cheaply and engage in risky strategies that (while times are good) yield high returns. The resulting profits allow the institution to become even bigger and more interconnected, leading to more profits, more growth, and more moral hazard. The entire financial system becomes less stable as a result.  

For this reason, economists are increasingly in favor of curbs on the size of financial firms despite the possible sacrifice of scale efficiencies. As former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan put it, “If they’re too big to fail, they’re too big.” Many economists also favor forcing large complex banks and shadow banks to draw up “living wills” allowing them to be closed and wound down, in case of insolvency, with minimal disruption and minimal cost to taxpayers. The credible threat of bank closure is necessary for limiting moral hazard—bank managers need to know they can be put out of business if they misbehave—but devising concrete procedures is not easy, especially in an international context.  

As we shall see, the problem of moral hazard is central to understanding both the 2007–2009 global financial crisis and the measures that were taken to avoid future crises. Another important element in that crisis and its international transmission, however, was the globalized nature of banking.  

# The Challenge of Regulating International Banking  

In this section, we will learn how the internationalization of banking (and financial institutions more generally) weakens purely national safeguards against banking collapse. At the same time, however, global financial interdependence has made the need for effective safeguards more urgent. The result is a second trilemma for international policy makers.13  

# The Financial Trilemma  

Offshore banking involves a tremendous volume of interbank deposits—roughly 80 percent of all Eurocurrency deposits, for example, are owned by private banks. A high level of interbank depositing implies that problems affecting a single bank can be highly contagious and spread quickly to banks with which people believe it does business. Through this domino effect, a localized disturbance can set off a banking panic on a global scale, as in the 2007–2009 crisis.  

Despite these very high stakes, banking regulations of the type used in the United States and other countries become even less effective in an international environment where banks can shift their business among different regulatory jurisdictions. A good way to see why an international banking system is harder to regulate than a national system is to look at how the effectiveness of the U.S. safeguards that we described in the last section is reduced owing to offshore banking activities.  

1.	 Deposit insurance is essentially absent in international banking. National deposit insurance systems may protect domestic and foreign depositors alike, but the amount of insurance available is invariably too small to cover the size of the deposits that are usual in international banking. In particular, interbank deposits and other wholesale funding sources are unprotected.  

2.	 The absence of overseas reserve requirements was historically a major factor in the growth of Eurocurrency trading. While Eurobanks derived a competitive advantage from escaping the required reserve tax, there was a social cost in terms of the reduced stability of the banking system. No country could solve the problem single-handedly by imposing reserve requirements on its own banks’ overseas branches. Concerted international action was blocked, however, by the political and technical difficulty of agreeing on an internationally uniform set of regulations and by the reluctance of some countries to drive banking business away by tightening regulations. Nowadays, reserve requirements are less important in many countries. In part this is because governments simply realized the requirements’ futility in a world of globalized banking.  

3.	 and  4. Bank examination to enforce capital requirements and asset restrictions becomes more difficult in an international setting. National bank regulators usually monitor the balance sheets of domestic banks and their foreign branches on a consolidated basis. But they are less strict in keeping track of banks’ foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which are in theory more tenuously tied to the parent bank but whose financial fortunes may well affect the parent’s solvency. Banks have often been able to take advantage of this laxity by shifting risky business that home regulators might question to regulatory jurisdictions where fewer questions are asked. This process is known as regulatory arbitrage. Further, it is often unclear which group of regulators would ideally be responsible for monitoring a given bank’s assets. Suppose the London subsidiary of an Italian bank deals primarily in Eurodollars. Should the subsidiary’s assets be the concern of British, Italian, or American regulators?  

5.	 There is uncertainty over which central bank, if any, is responsible for providing LLR assistance in international banking. The problem is similar to the one that arises in allocating responsibility for bank supervision. Let’s return to the example of the London subsidiary of an Italian bank. Should the Fed bear responsibility for saving the subsidiary from a sudden drain of dollar deposits? Should the Bank of England step in? Or should the European Central Bank bear the ultimate responsibility? When central banks provide LLR assistance, they increase their domestic money supplies and may compromise domestic macroeconomic objectives. In an international setting, a central bank may also be providing resources to a bank located abroad whose behavior it is not equipped to monitor. Central banks are therefore reluctant to extend the coverage of their LLR responsibilities.   
6.	 When a bank has assets and liabilities in many countries, several governments may have to share operational and financial responsibility for a rescue or reorganization. The resulting uncertainties can slow down or even impede the operation. Big, complex, highly interconnected global banks know how hard it would be for governments to shut them down and reorganize them rather than simply bailing them out, and this can encourage excessive risk taking.  

The preceding difficulties in regulating international financial institutions show that a financial trilemma constrains what policy makers in an open economy can achieve. At most two goals from the following list of three are simultaneously feasible:  

1.	 Financial stability.   
2.	 National control over financial safeguard policy.   
3.	 Freedom of international capital movements.  

For example, a country that closes itself financially from the outside world can regulate its banks strictly without worrying about regulatory arbitrage across borders, thereby promoting domestic financial stability regardless of what foreign regulators do. On the other hand, if countries were to delegate the design and implementation of financial safeguards to a global regulatory body immune to national political pressures, they could enjoy greater financial stability and financial openness at the same time.14  

The utopian goal of an omniscient global financial authority is remote, of course. In its absence, however, national regulators for four decades have been trying to reconcile growing financial integration with financial stability through a process of ever-increasing international cooperation. It is no accident that this process began precisely when the new system of floating exchange rates allowed countries to move to a new edge of the monetary trilemma (Chapter 19) by liberalizing international capital movements.  

# International Regulatory Cooperation through 2007  

In the early 1970s, the new regime of floating exchange rates presented a new source of disturbance: a large, unexpected exchange rate change that might wipe out the capital of an exposed bank.  

In response to this threat, central bank heads from 11 industrialized countries in 1974 set up a group called the Basel Committee, whose job is to “strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability,” per the Basel Committee Charter. (The group got its name from Basel, Switzerland, the home of the central bankers’ meeting place, the Bank for International Settlements, or BIS.) The Basel Committee remains the major forum for cooperation among bank regulators from different countries.  

In 1975, the Basel Committee reached an agreement, called the Concordat, which allocates responsibility for supervising multinational banking establishments between parent and host countries. In addition, the Concordat calls for the sharing of information about banks by parent and host regulators and for “the granting of permission for inspections by or on behalf of parent authorities on the territory of the host authority.”15 In 1988, the Basel Committee suggested a minimally prudent level of bank capital (generally speaking, 8 percent of assets) and a system for measuring capital. These guidelines, widely adopted throughout the world, have become known as Basel I. The committee revised the Basel I framework in 2004, issuing a new set of rules for bank capital known as Basel II.  

A major change in international financial relations has been the rapidly growing importance of new emerging markets as sources and destinations for private capital flows. Emerging markets are the capital markets of industrializing countries that have liberalized their financial systems to allow at least some private asset trade with foreigners. Countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and Thailand were all major recipients of private capital inflows from the industrial world after 1990.  

Emerging market financial institutions have proven in the past, however, to be weak. This vulnerability contributed to the emerging markets’ severe financial crisis of 1997–1999 (Chapter 22). Among other problems, developing countries tended to lack experience in bank regulation, had looser prudential and accounting standards than developed countries, and had been prone to moral hazard by offering domestic banks implicit guarantees that they will be bailed out if they get into trouble.  

Thus, the need to extend internationally accepted “best practice” regulatory standards to emerging market countries became a priority for the Basel Committee. In September 1997, the Committee issued its Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, worked out in cooperation with representatives from many developing countries (and revised in 2006). That document set out 25 principles deemed to describe the minimum necessary requirements for effective bank supervision, covering licensing of banks, supervision methods, reporting requirements for banks, and cross-border banking. The Basel Committee and the IMF were monitoring the international implementation of the revised Core Principles and Basel II when the global financial crisis erupted in August 2007. The crisis revealed weaknesses in Basel II that led the Basel Committee to agree on a new framework, Basel III, which we will describe further in due course. The international activities of nonbank financial institutions are another potential trouble spot. The failure of a major actor in the shadow banking system, like the failure of a bank, could seriously disrupt national payments and credit networks. Increasing securitization (in which bank assets are repackaged in readily marketable forms and sold off) and trade in options and other derivative securities have made it harder for regulators to get an accurate picture of global financial flows by examining bank balance sheets alone. Indeed, as we shall see, securitization and derivatives were at the heart of the 2007–2009 crisis, which is the subject of the following Case Study.  

# CASE STUDY  

# The Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2009  

The global financial and economic meltdown of 2007–2009 was the worst since the Great Depression. Banks throughout the world failed or required extensive government support to survive; the global financial system froze; and the entire world economy was thrown into recession. Unlike some recessions, this one originated in a shock to financial markets, and the shock was transmitted from country to country by financial markets, at lightning speed.  

The crisis had a seemingly unlikely source: the U.S. mortgage market.16 Over the course of the mid-2000s, with U.S. interest rates very low and U.S. home prices bubbling upward (recall Chapter 19), mortgage lenders had extended loans to borrowers with shaky credit. In many cases, the borrowers planned to hold the homes only for brief periods, selling them later for a profit. Many people borrowed at low, temporary “teaser” rates of interest, when in fact they lacked the financial means to meet mortgage payments if interest rates were to rise. And then U.S. interest rates started moving up as the Federal Reserve gradually tightened monetary policy to ward off inflation. U.S. housing prices started to decline in 2006.  

The total amount of shaky, “subprime” U.S. mortgage loans was not very big compared to total U.S. financial wealth. However, the subprime loans were securitized quickly and sold off by the original lenders, often bundled with other assets.  

This factor made it very hard to know exactly which investors were exposed to the risk that subprime mortgage loans would not be repaid. In addition, banks throughout the world, but especially in the United States and Europe, were avid buyers of securitized subprime-related assets, in some cases setting up—outside the reach of regulators—opaque, off-balance-sheet vehicles for that purpose. A major motivation was regulatory arbitrage. Banks were eager to exploit loopholes in prudential rules, including the Basel II guidelines, in order to minimize the amount of capital they were required to hold against assets and thereby maximize the amount they could borrow to buy securitized credit products. Funding for these banks’ securitized asset purchases came from U.S. lenders, including money market mutual funds.17 Much of the European banks’ demand was for U.S. products, but as we noted in Chapter 19, the housing boom of the 2000s was a global phenomenon, and European banks were also heavily exposed to downturns in highly priced housing markets outside the United States. Home prices in those markets would soon follow U.S. prices downward. (In Chapter 21, we will see how the problems of Europe’s banks led to a crisis in the euro zone.)  

As subprime borrowers increasingly missed their payments during 2007, lenders became more aware of the risks they faced and pulled back from markets. No one could tell who was exposed to subprime risk or how vulnerable he or she was. Borrowing costs rose, and many participants in financial markets had no choice but to sell assets to get cash. A number of the derivative assets being offered for sale were so poorly understood by the markets that potential buyers could not value them.  

During the week of August 9, 2007, central banks provided markets with the most extensive liquidity support since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. On August 9, a major French bank, BNP Paribas, disclosed that three of its investment funds faced potential trouble due to subprime-related investments. Credit markets went into panic, with interbank interest rates rising above central bank target rates around the world. Banks feared that other banks would go under and be unable to repay, and fearing an inability to obtain interbank funding themselves, they all hoarded cash. The European Central Bank stepped in as lender of last resort to the European interbank market, and the Fed followed suit in the United States, announcing that it would accept mortgage-backed securities as collateral for loans to banks. Stock markets fell everywhere. The U.S. economy slipped into recession late in 2007, pushed by the disappearance of credit and a collapsing housing market.  

![](images/908425f0505d90ca4ce8cf3138c42b450de82cf5b3810b7d4ef6baf1e147d2b0.jpg)  

More trouble lay ahead. In March 2008, institutional lenders refused to roll over their short-term credits to the fifth largest investment bank, Bear Stearns, which had extensive subprime-related investments. Even though Bear Stearns was not a bank, it effectively suffered a run by its lenders. In a hastily organized rescue, the Fed bought $\$30$ billion of Bear’s “toxic” assets in order to persuade the bank J.P.  Morgan Chase to buy Bear at a fire-sale price. The Fed was criticized for not wiping out Bear’s shareholders (to deter moral hazard) and for putting taxpayer money at risk.  

Even after this bailout, however, financial stability did not return. Foreclosures on delinquent U.S. mortgages  

were mounting, home prices were still heading downward and yet banks and shadow banks retained on their books toxic assets that were difficult to value or sell. Against this background, the U.S. government took control of the two giant privately owned but government-sponsored mortgage intermediaries, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  

Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, after frantic but unsuccessful efforts by the U.S. Treasury and the Fed to find a buyer. There is still controversy about the legal standing of the U.S. authorities to have prevented the collapse; surely they were still smarting from the criticism over Bear and hoping that the Lehman fallout could be contained. Instead, the situation quickly spun out of control. A day after Lehman’s filing, the giant insurance firm American International Group (AIG, with over $\$1$ trillion in assets) suffered a run. Apparently without the approval of senior management, traders for the firm had issued more than $\$400$ billion in derivatives called credit default swaps (CDS), which are insurance policies against nonrepayment of loans (including loans made to Lehman as well as mortgage-backed securities). With the world financial system in a state of meltdown, those CDS looked increasingly likely to be triggered, yet AIG lacked the funds to cover them. The Fed stepped in immediately with an $\$85$ billion loan, and ultimately the U.S. government loaned AIG billions more.  

The same month saw several other dramatic events. American money market mutual funds (some with claims on Lehman) suffered a run and had their liabilities guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Washington Mutual Bank (the sixth largest in the United States) failed. Ailing Wachovia (the fourth largest bank) and investment bank Merrill Lynch were bought by Wells Fargo Bank and Bank of America, respectively. The last two independent U.S. investment banks, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, became bank-holding companies subject to Fed supervision but with essential access to the Fed’s lending facilities. Interbank lending spreads over Treasury bill rates reached historic levels. Finally, amid all this turmoil, world stock markets swooned. The U.S. Congress, after much debate, passed a bill allocating $\$700$ billion to buy troubled assets from banks, in hopes that this would allow them to resume normal lending—but the funds were not, in the end, used for that purpose. The post-Lehman turmoil spread to Europe, where a number of financial institutions failed and EU governments issued blanket deposit guarantees to head off bank runs. In addition, a number of countries guaranteed interbank loans. But by this time, the economic downturn had gone global, with devastating effects on output and employment throughout the world.  

Limited space prevents a detailed review of the many financial, fiscal, and unconventional monetary policies that central banks and governments undertook to end the global economy’s seeming free fall in late 2008 and the first part of 2009.18 (The box on foreign exchange instability explores one aspect of the policy response that is especially relevant to international monetary economics.) With housing markets depressed in the industrial countries, however, recovery of financial and household-sector balance sheets was slow, as was the recovery in aggregate demand. When the COVID-19 crisis erupted in March 2020, many of the same policy tools were deployed again, but even more extensively. In that case, the underlying trigger for the crisis was a global pandemic, and financial fragility was a consequence, not a cause.  

# FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTABILITY AND CENTRAL BANK SWAP LINES  

liquidity in its own currency, which it can print freely. The crisis of 2007–2009 made clear, however, that in the modern world of globalized finance, banks may need liquidity in currencies other than that of their home central bank. One area in which central banks innovated during the crisis was in making such support readily available to foreign central banks. In effect, the Federal Reserve, which pioneered this approach, became a global LLR for U.S. dollars.  

Why was this necessary? The need was a spillover effect of the disruption in U.S. credit markets, particularly interbank markets. As we have pointed out, in the years leading up to the crisis, European banks had invested heavily in U.S. mortgagebacked securities and other similar securitized assets. The European banks did not wish, however, to bear the currency risk of holding these dollardenominated claims. Lacking an ability to obtain dollars through retail deposits, they borrowed short-term dollars in wholesale markets (from U.S. banks and money market funds) to finance their purchases of U.S. asset-backed securities.  

Then the crisis hit and interbank credit markets stopped functioning. European banks did not want to sell their now-toxic U.S. assets at a loss (even if they had been able to), so they needed to borrow dollars to repay their short-term loans and maintain their hedged positions in dollars. Even though the banks’ dollar liabilities were on paper balanced with dollar assets, the liquidity mismatch between the assets and liabilities created a currency mismatch once the assets could no longer be sold quickly at face value. Where could these banks get dollars loans quickly now that private dollar credit markets were frozen? Some, but not all, were able to borrow from the Fed through U.S. affiliates. Other European banks lacked collateral acceptable to the Fed. To make matters worse, the Fed was closed during European morning trading.  

The ECB could print euros and lend them to banks, but it could not print U.S. dollars. European banks thus tried to swap the borrowed euros into dollars (selling them in the spot market for dollars and buying them back with forward dollars in the forward market). Under covered interest parity (CIP), this complicated operation has the same cost as a straight loan of dollars (recall Chapter 14’s section on “Forward Exchange Rates and Covered Interest Parity”). But CIP was breaking down because banks did not want to lend dollars to each other. Swaps of euros into dollars thus yielded too few spot dollars and too few forward euros. In particular, the dollar shortage led to a tendency for the dollar to strengthen sharply in the spot market. This episode marked the start of the persisting breakdown of CIP that we discussed in Chapter 14, which we will return to later in this chapter. Figure 14-8 shows how deviations from CIP were especially large during the 2007–2009 crisis period.  

The Fed’s swap lines, initially extended to the ECB and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in December 2007, were intended to remedy the shortage and prevent disorderly conditions in foreign exchange markets. The lines allowed the ECB and SNB to borrow dollars directly from the Fed and lend them to domestic banks in need.  

But the dollar shortage became much more severe after the Lehman collapse in September 2008. The Fed extended the swaps to a wider set of central banks, including four in emerging countries (Brazil, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore), and made the swap lines unlimited for several industrial-country central banks (including the ECB and SNB), thus fully outsourcing its LLR

function. Ultimately, the Fed lent hundreds of billions of dollars in this way.19  

Central banks other than the Fed (notably the ECB) likewise extended swap lines in their currencies, though typically these were more limited in scope than the Fed’s. The Federal Reserve’s role as the global LLR in U.S. dollars has been so critical because the dollar, alongside its starring roles as the world’s dominant vehicle, reserve, and invoice currency, is the world’s premier funding currency, that is, the most common currency for denominating loans. The accompanying figure shows the volumes of cross-border dollar claims and liabilities by international banks, illustrating how dollardenominated positions far outstrip those for the number two funding currency, the euro.  

The Fed wound down its swap lines in February 2010 but reactivated some when the European debt crisis erupted shortly afterward and interbank markets again became jittery (Chapter 21). Recent experience clearly shows the need for global lenders of last resort in different currencies, and as a result, six major central banks—the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the Swiss National Bank—made their mutual swap lines permanent late in 2013. This agreement among industrial-country central banks leaves out the emerging markets, which typically can borrow from the IMF, but only through a process that is generally less automatic than a central bank swap. And while the IMF saw its lending resources ­triple as world governments responded to the crisis, those resources remain limited, in contrast to the unlimited currency a central bank can provide simply by printing it. As the COVID-19 ­pandemic emerged early in 2020 and financial markets reeled, use of central bank swap lines ballooned and the Federal Reserve again extended them to selected emerging market countries.  

# International Regulatory Initiatives after the Global Financial Crisis  

The severity and breadth of the 2007–2009 crisis have led to initiatives to reform both national financial systems and the international system. We now describe some of these measures, which have sought to fill gaps in existing regulatory frameworks while also paying more attention to the macroeconomic causes and consequences of banking problems.  

Basel III  The financial crisis made obvious the inadequacies of the Basel II regulatory framework, so in 2010, the Basel Committee proposed a tougher set of capital standards and regulatory safeguards for international banks, Basel III. Regarding capital, the new Basel framework makes it harder for banks to get around capital requirements. For example, Basel III takes a broader view of the risks banks are running, including through off-balance sheet entities, and to that end, it requires banks to maintain at least a 3 percent leverage ratio of capital to total risk exposures, including off-balance exposures that importantly include forward foreign exchange contracts. The framework also requires banks to guard against more pessimistic scenarios than previously. But like  

Basel II, Basel III still attaches risk weights to different assets, with assets deemed less risky leading to lower required capital. Basel III also mandates a Liquidity Coverage Ratio, under which banks must hold enough cash or highly liquid bonds to cover 30 days of cash outflow in specified crisis conditions. A Net Stable Funding Ratio seeks to limit banks’ reliance on short-term wholesale funding (in contrast to retail deposits).20  

The Financial Stability Board  In 1999, policy makers from a handful of industrialized countries established the Financial Stability Forum, housed (like the Basel Committee) in the BIS. The goal, however, was to promote international coordination over a broader set of financial stability issues (including, but going beyond, bank regulation), and among a potentially broader group of macroeconomic policy makers. In April 2009, at the height of the global crisis, the Financial Stability Forum became the Financial Stability Board (FSB), with a broader membership (including a number of emerging market economies) and a larger permanent staff. The FSB’s job is to monitor the global financial system and make recommendations for global policy coordination and reform, sometimes in cooperation with other international agencies such as the IMF.  

National Reforms  Individual countries have not limited themselves to implementing the Basel III recommendations. In a number of cases, including the euro zone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, countries have embarked on far-reaching reforms of their domestic financial systems. In 2010, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank act, which, among other things, empowers the government to regulate nonbank financial institutions deemed “systemically important” (such as Lehman or AIG) and also allows the government to take over those firms in much the same way that the FDIC takes over and resolves failing banks.21 A major goal of Dodd-Frank was to eliminate the problem of “too big to fail,” although critics contend it has not succeeded.  

The Macroprudential Perspective  An important lesson of the global financial crisis is that it is not enough for financial regulators to ensure that each individual financial institution is sound. This in itself will not ensure that the financial system as a whole is sound, and in fact, measures that would make an individual institution more resilient, given that the broader financial system is healthy, could put the broader system into jeopardy if implemented simultaneously by all institutions. The macroprudential perspective on financial regulation seeks to avoid such fallacies of composition at the aggregate level.22  

As an example, consider the Basel capital standards, which apply different risk weights to different assets to determine the amount of capital banks need to hold. If there are two assets, A and B, with similar returns, but asset B has the lower Basel risk weight, all banks will wish to hold asset B rather than asset A. But in this case, the system as a whole will be more vulnerable to a fall in asset B’s price than if banks were more diversified between the two assets. This is exactly what happened in 2007 when U.S. and European banks were all so heavily invested in securities tied to the U.S. housing market, and therefore all vulnerable to the U.S. housing downturn. A major concern about the new Basel rules is that they do not do enough to correct this system-level problem.  

However, in other respects the Basel III proposals recognize the macroprudential problem. For example, the Basel Committee has proposed that banks increase their capital ratios during lending booms in order to make the system more resilient during downturns, at which time capital requirements would be loosened. Why is this plan for “countercyclical capital buffers” helpful? If instead all banks simultaneously sell assets to increase their capital buffers in a financial crisis—which is what a micro prudential approach might suggest that they do—the result would be an asset “fire sale” that depresses securities prices and therefore endangers the solvency of the system as a whole.  

In the United States, the Dodd-Frank act set up a Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which includes the Fed chair and the Treasury Secretary, to monitor macroeconomic aspects of financial stability, including risks from the shadow banking system. The FSOC has the power to designate individual financial institutions as systemically important and subject them to enhanced supervision. It can also recommend breaking up institutions that are so big or interconnected as to pose a threat to the economy. However, the biggest financial institutions are, if anything, even bigger after the financial crisis, and many observers remain concerned that the United States and other countries have done too little to solve the “too big to fail” problem and reduce moral hazard in financial markets. After seeing the effects of the Lehman failure, policy makers still may remain too fearful of contagion to allow a major international bank to fail.  

National Sovereignty and the Limits of Globalization  National financial regulators often face fierce lobbying from their home financial institutions, which argue that stricter rules would put them at a disadvantage relative to foreign rivals (while also being ineffective due to the foreign competition). The Basel multilateral process, like multilateral trade liberalization under the GATT and the WTO, plays an essential role in allowing governments to overcome domestic political pressures against adequate oversight and control of the financial sector. The process partially addresses the financial trilemma by facilitating some limited delegation of national sovereignty over financial policy. The constraints of the trilemma are still important, however. For example, a country wishing to control a domestic housing boom may forbid its banks from lending too much to prospective homebuyers, but may be unable to prevent foreign banks from lending. In this case, there is a trade-off between financial stability and financial integration; and countries may be tempted to react through capital controls or other measures that segregate domestic financial markets. Unless governments can successfully contain the risks posed by financial markets, it seems unlikely that financial globalization can continue to proceed as it has over recent decades.  

# Metrics for International Capital Market Performance  

The present structure of the international capital market involves risks of financial instability that can be reduced only through the close cooperation of bank and financial supervisors in many countries. But the same profit motive that leads multinational financial institutions to innovate their way around national regulations can also provide important gains for consumers. As we have seen, the international capital market allows residents of different countries to diversify their portfolios by trading risky assets. Further, by ensuring a rapid international flow of information about investment opportunities around the world, the market can help allocate the world’s savings to their most productive uses. How well has the international capital market performed in these respects?  

# The Extent of International Portfolio Equity Diversification  

Since accurate data on the overall portfolio positions of a country’s residents are sometimes impossible to assemble, it can be difficult to gauge the extent of international portfolio diversification in stock markets by direct observation. Nonetheless, as far as we can tell, investors display a significant home bias: They much prefer to invest in domestic stocks rather than diversifying abroad.  

What makes the apparently incomplete extent of international equity portfolio diversification so puzzling is the presumption most economists would make that the potential gains from diversification are large. An influential study by the French financial economist Bruno Solnik, for example, estimated that a U.S. investor holding only American stocks could more than halve the riskiness of her portfolio by further diversification into stocks from European countries.23 Thus, the observed home bias in equity holdings is hard to understand.  

We have certainly observed an explosion of gross international assets and liabilities since the early 1990s. But most of these external assets and liabilities are debt instruments, including bank debts, in some cases driven by regulatory or tax arbitrage. (Recall the box in Chapter 13 on how global tax avoidance has inflated Ireland’s measured GDP.) It is also likely that international debt positions include systemically risky borrowing, as when a bank in the United Kingdom borrows short-term funds to invest in less liquid securities abroad. Thus, even though the data show that the volume of international asset transactions has increased enormously over the past decades, they also remind us that there is no foolproof measure of the socially optimal extent of foreign investment.24  

# The Extent of Intertemporal Trade  

An alternative way of evaluating the performance of the world capital market was suggested by economists Martin Feldstein and Charles Horioka. Feldstein and Horioka pointed out that a smoothly working international capital market allows countries’ domestic investment rates to diverge widely from their saving rates. In such an idealized world, saving seeks out its most productive uses worldwide, regardless of their location; at the same time, domestic investment is not limited by national saving because a global pool of funds is available to finance it.  

For many countries, however, differences between national saving and domestic investment rates (that is, current account balances) have not been large since World War II: Countries with high saving rates over long periods also have usually had high investment rates, as Figure 20-3 illustrates. Feldstein and Horioka concluded from this evidence that cross-border capital mobility is low, in the sense that most of any sustained increase in national saving will lead to increased capital accumulation at home. The

# Saving and Investment Rates for 24 Countries, 1990–2019 Averages  

OECD countries’ saving and investment ratios to output tend to be positively related. The straight regression line in the graph represents a statistician’s best guess of the level of the investment ratio, conditional on the saving ratio, in this country sample.

world capital market, according to this view, does not do a good job of helping countries reap the long-run gains of intertemporal trade.25  

The main problem with the Feldstein-Horioka argument is that it is impossible to gauge if the extent of intertemporal trade is deficient without knowing if there are unexploited trade gains, and knowing this requires more knowledge about actual economies than we generally have. For example, a country’s saving and investment may usually move together simply because the factors that generate a high saving rate (such as rapid economic growth) also generate a high investment rate. In such cases, the country’s gain from intertemporal trade may simply be small. An alternative explanation of high saving–investment correlations is that governments have tried to manage macro­ economic policy to avoid large current account imbalances. In any case, events appear to be overtaking this particular debate. For industrialized countries, the empirical regularity noted by Feldstein and Horioka has weakened considerably in the face of the high external imbalances of the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and some of the euro zone countries. At the time of the original Feldstein-Horioka estimates, which used data through the middle 1970s, the slope in Figure 20-3 was close to 1; now it is around 0.4.  

# The Efficiency of International Asset-Price Arbitrage  

A quite different barometer of the international capital market’s performance is the relationship between onshore and offshore interest rates on similar assets denominated in the same currency. If the world capital market is doing its job of communicating information about global investment opportunities, these interest rates should move closely together and not differ too greatly. Large interest rate differences would be strong evidence of unrealized gains from trade. A similar conclusion might apply to deviations from covered interest parity (CIP), which entail very low risk in normal circumstances. How should we interpret the evidence?  

Figure 20-4 shows data since the end of 1990 on the interest rate difference between two comparable debt liabilities, dollar deposits in London and money market instruments issued in the United States. These data are imperfect because the interest rates compared are not measured at precisely the same moment. Nonetheless, they provide no indication of any large unexploited gains in normal times. The pattern of onshoreoffshore interest differences is similar for other industrial countries.  

The London–U.S. differential did begin to creep up with the outbreak of global financial turbulence in August 2007, and it reached a peak in October 2008, the month after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Evidently, investors perceived that U.S. money market instruments, including the dollar deposits of U.S. banks, would be backstopped by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve but that dollar deposits in London might not receive the same protection. This problem may not have receded completely in recent years, as the differential has remained elevated and somewhat volatile.  

A different set of factors could be contributing, however, and these factors also lie behind deviations from CIP. Chapter 14 explained that the prevailing CIP differences mean it is in principle profitable to borrow U.S. dollars and invest them in euro or yen deposits, which are then covered through forward purchases of dollars. However, these transactions are most clearly profitable for large international banks with the best credit ratings; lower-rated banks might have to pay higher rates for dollar borrowing, eliminating potential CIP profits. CIP arbitrage should also be profitable for U.S. money market mutual funds, which manage large pools of dollars and could buy foreign deposits outright, without borrowing. Why don’t these large players arbitrage away CIP differentials?  

A leading hypothesis is that the reluctance to arbitrage CIP deviations fully is due to financial regulations put in place after the 2007–2009 financial crisis. We offer two examples. A 2016 U.S. reform of prime money market mutual funds, which generally hold assets that are riskier than U.S. government securities, made it clear that deposits could fluctuate in value and might not be available on demand. The resulting migration of deposits to safer borrowers made it more expensive for prime funds to arbitrage CIP differentials. As for large creditworthy banks, the Basel III leverage ratio likely played a key role. CIP arbitrage involves an exceedingly low probability of loss in normal times, but under Basel III, even a CIP trade requires a bank to put aside capital if it is to meet the leverage ratio. The bank will thus require some positive return on the trade

(a non-negligible CIP difference) to compensate it for the opportunity cost of not deploying that capital to support other profitable business.26  

Asset-pricing anomalies due to regulatory restrictions are not necessarily an indictment of market efficiency, however. The intention behind financial regulation (especially macroprudential regulation) is to force market actors to internalize the social costs of potential financial instability when they calculate profitability. Whether current regulations do so accurately, excessively, or insufficiently remains the topic of study and debate.  

# The Efficiency of the Foreign Exchange Market  

The foreign exchange market is a central component of the international capital market, and the exchange rates it sets help determine the profitability of international transactions of all types. Exchange rates therefore communicate important economic signals to households and firms engaged in international trade and investment. If these signals do not reflect all available information about market opportunities, a misallocation of resources will result. Studies of the foreign exchange market’s use of available information are therefore potentially important in judging whether the international capital market is sending the right signals to markets. We examine three types of tests: tests based on interest parity, tests based on modeling risk premiums, and tests for excessive exchange rate volatility.  

Studies Based on Interest Parity  The uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition that was the basis of the discussion of exchange rate determination in Chapter 14 has also been used to study whether market exchange rates incorporate all available information. Recall that interest parity holds when the interest difference between deposits denominated in two different currencies is the market’s forecast of the percentage by which the exchange rate between those currencies will change. More formally, if $R_{t}$ is the date $t$ interest rate on home currency deposits, $\boldsymbol{R}_{t}^{*}$ is the interest rate on foreign currency deposits, $E_{t}$ is the exchange rate (defined as the home currency price of foreign currency), and $E_{t+1}^{e}$ is the exchange rate that market participants expect when the deposits paying interest $R_{t}$ and $\boldsymbol{R}_{t}^{*}$ mature, UIP states that:  

$$
R_{t}-R_{t}^{*}=(E_{t+1}^{e}-E_{t})/E_{t}.
$$  

Equation (20-1) implies a simple way to test whether the foreign exchange market is doing a good job of using current information to forecast exchange rates. Since the interest difference, $R_{t}-\bar{R}_{t}^{*}$ , is the market’s forecast, a comparison of this predicted exchange rate change with the actual exchange rate change that subsequently occurs indicates the market’s skill in forecasting.27  

Statistical studies of the relationship between interest rate differences and later depreciation rates show that the interest difference has been a very bad predictor, in the sense that it has failed to catch any of the large swings in exchange rates. We noted this failure in Chapter 14’s discussion of the carry trade. Even worse, as we noted there, the interest difference has, on average, failed to predict correctly the direction in which the spot exchange rate would change. If the interest rate difference were a poor but unbiased predictor, we could argue that the market is setting the exchange rate according to interest parity and doing the best job possible in a rapidly changing world where prediction is inherently difficult. The finding of bias, however, seems at odds with that interpretation of the data.  

UIP also furnishes a test of a second implication of the hypothesis that the market uses all available information in setting exchange rates. Suppose that $E_{t+1}$ is the actual future exchange rate people are trying to guess; then the forecast error they make in predicting future depreciation, $u_{t+1}$ , can be expressed as actual minus expected depreciation:  

$$
\boldsymbol{u}_{t+1}=(E_{t+1}-E_{t})/E_{t}-(E_{t+1}^{e}-E_{t})/E_{t}.
$$  

If the market is making use of all available information, its forecast error, $u_{t+1}$ , should be statistically unrelated to data known to the market on date $t$ , when expectations formed. In other words, there should be no opportunity for the market to exploit known data to reduce its later forecast errors.  

Under UIP, we can test this hypothesis by writing $u_{t+1}$ as actual currency depreciation less the international interest difference:  

$$
\boldsymbol{u}_{t+1}=(E_{t+1}-E_{t})/E_{t}-(\boldsymbol{R_{t}}-\boldsymbol{R}_{t}^{*}).
$$  

Statistical methods can be used to examine whether $u_{t+1}$ is predictable, on average, based on past information. A number of researchers have found that forecast errors, when defined as in equation (20-3), can be predicted. For example, past forecast errors, which are widely known, are useful in predicting future errors.28  

The Role of Risk Premiums  One explanation of the research results we have described is that the foreign exchange market simply ignores easily available information in setting exchange rates. Such a finding would throw doubt on the international capital market’s ability to communicate appropriate price signals. Before jumping to this conclusion, however, recall that when people are risk averse, the interest parity condition may not be a complete account of how exchange rates are determined. If, instead, bonds denominated in different currencies are imperfect substitutes for investors, the international interest rate difference equals expected currency depreciation plus a risk premium, $\rho_{t}$ :  

$$
R_{t}-R_{t}^{*}=(E_{t+1}^{e}-E_{t})/E_{t}+\rho_{t}
$$  

(see Chapter 18). In this case, the interest difference is not necessarily the market’s forecast of future depreciation. Thus, under imperfect asset substitutability, the empirical results just discussed cannot be used to draw inferences about the foreign exchange market’s efficiency in processing information.  

Because people’s expectations are inherently unobservable, there is no simple way to decide between equation (20-4) and the interest parity condition, which is the special case that occurs when $\rho_{t}$ is always zero. Several econometric studies have attempted to explain departures from interest parity on the basis of particular theories of the risk premium, but none has been entirely successful.29  

Tests for Excessive Volatility  One of the most worrisome findings is that statistical forecasting models of exchange rates based on standard “fundamental” variables like money supplies, government deficits, and output perform badly—even when actual (rather than predicted) values of future fundamentals are used to form exchange rate forecasts! Indeed, in a famous study, Richard A. Meese of Barclays Global Investors and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University showed that a naive, “random walk” model, which simply takes today’s exchange rate as the best guess of tomorrow’s, performs better. Some have viewed this finding as evidence that exchange rates have a life of their own, unrelated to the macroeconomic determinants we have emphasized in our models. More recent research has confirmed, however, that while the random walk outperforms more sophisticated models for forecasts up to a year away, the models seem to do better at horizons longer than a year and have explanatory power for long-run exchange rate movements.30  

An additional line of research on the foreign exchange market examines whether exchange rates have been excessively volatile, perhaps because the foreign exchange market “overreacts” to events. A finding of excessive volatility would prove that the foreign exchange market is sending confusing signals to traders and investors who base their decisions on exchange rates. But how volatile must an exchange rate be before its volatility becomes excessive? As we saw in Chapter 14, exchange rates should be volatile because to send the correct price signals, they must move swiftly in response to economic news. Exchange rates are generally less volatile than stock prices. It is still possible, though, that exchange rates are substantially more volatile than the underlying factors that move them—such as money supplies, national outputs, and fiscal variables. Attempts to compare exchange rates’ volatility with those of their underlying determinants have, however, produced inconclusive results. A basic problem underlying tests for excessive volatility is the impossibility of quantifying exactly all the variables that convey relevant news about the economic future. For example, how does one attach a number to a political assassination attempt, a major bank failure, or a terrorist attack?  

A more recent but closely related area of study focuses on the exchange rate disconnect puzzle, originally described as the challenge of understanding “the remarkably weak short-term feedback links between the exchange rate and the rest of the economy.”31 The problem, once again, is that exchange rates are so much more volatile than measurable macroeconomic aggregates. Moreover, they often seem to bear little relation to the behavior of those aggregates. Economists are making some progress in rationalizing the exchange rate disconnect within comprehensive economic models of the global economy, but any explanation seems likely to rely on substantial and persistent deviations from UIP.32 Such deviations certainly exist, as we have seen, but since we do not have a good grasp of what causes them, it may be an excessive leap of faith to pin our confidence in our theories on such “dark matter.”  

The Bottom Line    The ambiguous evidence on the foreign exchange market’s performance warrants an open-minded view. A judgment that the market is doing its job well would support a laissez-faire attitude by governments and a continuation of the present trend toward increased cross-border financial integration in the industrial world. A judgment of market failure, on the other hand, might imply a need for increased foreign exchange intervention by central banks and a reversal of the global trend toward external financial liberalization. The stakes are high, and we need more research and experience before reaching a firm conclusion.  

When people are risk averse, countries can gain through the exchange of risky assets. The gains from trade take the form of a reduction in the riskiness of each country’s consumption. International portfolio diversification can be accomplished through the exchange of debt instruments or equity instruments.  

■ The international capital market is the market in which residents of different countries trade assets. One of its important components is the foreign exchange market. Banks are at the center of the international capital market, and many operate offshore, that is, outside the countries where their head offices reside.   
■ Regulatory and political factors have encouraged offshore banking. The same factors have encouraged offshore currency trading, that is, trade in bank deposits denominated in currencies of countries other than the one in which the bank is located. Such Eurocurrency trading received a major stimulus from the absence of reserve requirements on deposits in Eurobanks.   
■■ Creation of a Eurocurrency deposit does not occur because that currency leaves its country of origin; rather, all that is required is that a Eurobank accept a deposit liability denominated in the currency. Eurocurrencies therefore pose no threat to central banks’ control over their domestic monetary bases, and fears that Eurodollars, for example, will some day come “flooding into” the United States are misplaced.   
■■ Offshore banking is largely unprotected by the safeguards that national governments have imposed to prevent domestic bank failures. In addition, the opportunity that banks have to shift operations offshore, thereby profiting from regulatory arbitrage, has undermined the effectiveness of national bank supervision. These problems create a financial trilemma that international policy makers have tried to mitigate through increasingly ambitious cross-border collaboration. Since 1974, the Basel Committee of industrial-country bank supervisors has worked to enhance global regulatory cooperation, including international standards for bank capital. A third generation of proposed prudential regulations (Basel III) was released in 2010 and is in process of implementation by national regulators. There is still uncertainty, however, about a central bank’s obligations as an international lender of last resort. That uncertainty may reflect an attempt by international authorities to reduce moral hazard. The trend toward securitization has increased the need for international cooperation in monitoring and regulating nonbank financial institutions. So has the rise of emerging markets and of large shadow banking systems. Gaps in the global financial safety net became evident during the global financial crisis of 2007–2009. A key lesson of the crisis is that governments should adopt a macroprudential perspective in evaluating financial risks, rather than worrying only about the soundness of individual institutions.   
■■ The losses caused by financial crises must be evaluated against the gains that interna  

tional capital markets potentially offer. The international capital market has contributed to an increase in international portfolio diversification since 1970, but the extent of diversification still appears incomplete compared with what economic theory would predict. Similarly, some observers have claimed that the extent of intertemporal trade, as measured by countries’ current account balances, has been too small. Such claims are hard to evaluate without more detailed information about the functioning of the world economy than is yet available. Less ambiguous evidence comes from international interest rate comparisons, and this evidence points to a well-functioning market (apart from rare periods of international financial crisis). Rates of return on similar deposits issued in the major financial centers are normally quite close.  

■■ International equity diversification seems too limited to explain by simple models of global diversification. At the same time, the foreign exchange market’s record in communicating appropriate price signals to international traders and investors is mixed. Tests of excessive exchange rate volatility, for example, yield a mixed verdict on the foreign exchange market’s performance. In addition, the exchange rate disconnect puzzle challenges our understanding of the short-term links between exchange rate changes and the broader economy. Together with the recent history of financial crises, these gaps in our knowledge argue for caution rather than a pure laissez-faire approach to financial globalization.

4.	 After the global financial crisis, the central banks that fall within the framework of the Bank of International Settlement (BIS) set up the “Basel III” agreement in 2010. This new agreement includes more rigorous requirements for banks’ management and introduces some new ratios. One of the notable ratios is the LCR (liquidity coverage ratio), which requires a sufficient stock of unencumbered high quality liquid assets (HQLA). These assets should be easily and quickly convertible into cash in private markets to allow banks to meet their liquidity requirements in a 30 calendar-days liquidity stress scenario. Explain why such a ratio has been introduced. What is its rationale?   
5.	 In their article (and the book) “This Time is Different,” Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff asserted the view that both countries and creditors do learn from their mistakes, and due to better-informed macroeconomic policies and more discriminating lending practices, it is argued that the world may not see  

any major defaults again. What elements can you find in chapter 20 to support this assertion?  

6.	 The reforms introduced in the banking system after the financial crisis of 2007–2009 have sometimes been criticized by federation of bankers, who warned that requiring banks to hold more capital and reduce risk-taking will increase the lending cost and restrain investments and economy activity. In its last report on the “Implementation and Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms,” the Financial Stability Board (August 2016) stated on the contrary that “The improvement in bank resilience has been achieved while maintaining the overall provision of credit to the real economy . . . Overall, banks have met the higher capital requirements . . . following a sharp decline after the crisis, both total and bank lending growth have resumed in all regions, albeit at different paces.” Comment on this debate.   
7.	 Why might growing securitization make it harder for bank supervisors to keep track of risks to the financial system?   
8.	 Take the example of two countries that produce random amounts of rice and can trade claims on that product. Suppose the two countries also develop fisheries but cannot export the fishes because of a heath regulation. How do you think this development of fisheries would affect the ratio of international asset trade to GNP for Home and Foreign?   
9.	 Sometimes it is claimed that the international equality of real interest rates is the most accurate barometer of international financial integration. Do you agree? Why or why not?   
10.	 Several multilateral or regional development banks have been created since World War II. The last born is the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) created effectively in January 2016. It counts 50 members, mostly all the Asian countries plus some western and emerging economies. Apart from the political reasons which have been prevailing in the creation of this bank, do you think that its creation is a sign of a wrong functioning of the international financing market?   
11.	 In interpreting ratios such as those in Table 20-1, one must be cautious about drawing the conclusion that diversification is rising as rapidly as the reported numbers rise. Suppose a Brazilian buys a Japanese international equity fund, which places its client’s money in Brazil’s stock market. What happens to Brazilian and Japan gross foreign assets and liabilities? What happens to Brazilian and Japan international diversification?   
12.	 Banks are not happy when regulators force them to raise the ratio of capital to total assets: They argue that this reduces their potential profits. When a bank borrows more in order to purchase more risky assets, however, the interest rate it must pay on the borrowing should be high enough to compensate the lenders for the risk that the bank cannot repay in full—and the higher interest rate reduces bank profits. In light of this observation, is it obvious to you that it is more profitable for the bank to finance its asset purchase by borrowing, rather than by issuing additional shares of stock (and thereby increasing rather than reducing its ratio of capital to total assets)?   
13.	 How would your answer to problem 12 change if the bank’s creditors expect the government sometimes to step in with a bailout that prevents losses on the bank’s debt liabilities?   
14.	 If you return to Figure 20-4, you will notice that London Eurodollar interest rates tend to exceed U.S. certificate of deposit rates after the global financial crisis, but not before. Why do you think this is the case? (Be sure to return to this question after you read Chapter 21!)
