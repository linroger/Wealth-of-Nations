As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, however, world economic growth suddenly turned sharply negative, with many economies shrinking by amounts unprecedented since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Unemployment rose sharply everywhere, including in the United States, but some countries (such as several in East Asia) suffered much less compared with others. Can economic analysis help us to understand the behavior of the global economy and the reasons why individual countries’ fortunes often differ?  

Previous chapters have been concerned primarily with the problem of making the best use of the world’s scarce productive resources at a single point in time. The branch of economics called microeconomics studies this problem from the perspective of individual firms and consumers. Microeconomics works “from the bottom $\boldsymbol{\mathsf{u p}^{\prime\prime}}$ to show how individual economic actors, by pursuing their own interests, collectively determine how resources are used. In our study of international microeconomics, we have learned how individual production and consumption decisions produce patterns of international trade and specialization. We have also seen that while free trade usually encourages efficient resource use, government intervention or market failures can cause waste even when all factors of production are fully employed.  

With this chapter, we shift our focus and ask: How can economic policy ensure that factors of production are fully employed? And what determines how an economy’s capacity to produce goods and services changes over time? To answer these questions, we must understand macroeconomics, the branch of economics that studies how economies’ overall levels of employment, production, and growth are determined. Like microeconomics, macroeconomics is concerned with the effective use of scarce resources. But while microeconomics focuses on the economic decisions of individuals, macroeconomics analyzes the behavior of an economy as a whole. In our study of international macroeconomics, we will learn how the interactions of national economies influence the worldwide pattern of macroeconomic activity.  

Macroeconomic analysis emphasizes four aspects of economic life that, until now, we have usually kept in the background to simplify our discussion of international economics:  

1.	 Unemployment. We know that in the real world, workers may be unemployed and factories may be idle. Macroeconomics studies the factors that cause unemployment and the steps governments can take to prevent it. A main concern of international macroeconomics is the problem of ensuring full employment in economies open to international trade.   
2.	 Saving. In earlier chapters, we usually assumed that every country consumes an amount exactly equal to its income—no more and no less. In reality, though, households can put aside part of their income to provide for the future, or they can borrow temporarily to spend more than they earn. A country’s saving or borrowing behavior affects domestic employment and future levels of national wealth. From the standpoint of the international economy as a whole, the world saving rate determines how quickly the world stock of productive capital can grow.   
3.	 Trade imbalances. As we saw in earlier chapters, the value of a country’s imports equals the value of its exports when spending equals income. Actual economies seldom attain this state of balanced trade, however. In the ­following chapters, trade imbalances play a large role because they redistribute wealth among countries and are a main channel through which one country’s macroeconomic policies affect its trading partners. It should be no surprise, therefore, that trade imbalances, particularly when they are large and persistent, quickly can become a source of international discord.   
4.	 Money and the price level. The trade theory you have studied so far is a barter theory, one in which goods are exchanged directly for other goods based on their relative prices. In practice, it is more convenient to use money—a widely acceptable medium of exchange—in transactions and to quote prices in terms of money. Because money changes hands in virtually every transaction that takes place in a modern economy, fluctuations in the supply of money or in the demand for it can affect both output and employment. International macro­ economics takes into account that every country uses a currency and that a monetary change (for example, a change in money supply) in one country can have effects that spill across its borders to other countries. Stability in money price levels is an important goal of international macroeconomic policy.  

This chapter takes the first step in our study of international macroeconomics by explaining the accounting concepts economists use to describe a country’s level of production and its international transactions. To get a complete picture of the macroeconomic linkages among economies that engage in international trade, we have to master two related and essential tools. The first of these tools, national income accounting, records all the expenditures that contribute to a country’s income and output. The second tool, balance of payments accounting, helps us keep track of both changes in a country’s indebtedness to foreigners and the fortunes of its export- and import-competing industries. The balance of payments accounts also show the connection between foreign transactions and national money supplies.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

Discuss the concept of the current account balance.   
Use the current account balance to extend national income accounting to open economies.   
Apply national income accounting to the interaction of saving, investment, and net exports.   
Describe the balance of payments accounts and explain their relationship to the current account balance.   
Relate the current account to changes in a country’s net foreign wealth.  

# The National Income Accounts  

Of central concern to macroeconomic analysis is a country’s gross national product (GNP), the value of all final goods and services produced by the country’s factors of production and sold on the market in a given time period. GNP, which is the basic measure of a country’s output studied by macroeconomists, is calculated by adding up the market value of all expenditures on final output. GNP therefore includes the value of goods like bread sold in a supermarket and textbooks sold in a bookstore as well as the value of services provided by stockbrokers and plumbers. Because output requires factor inputs for its production, the expenditures that make up GNP connect intimately with the employment of labor, capital, and other factors of production.  

To distinguish among the different types of expenditure that make up a country’s GNP, government economists and statisticians who compile national income accounts divide GNP among the four possible uses for which a country’s final output is purchased: consumption (the amount consumed by private domestic residents), investment (the amount put aside by private firms to build new plant and equipment for future production), government purchases (the amount used by the government), and the current account balance (the amount of net exports of goods and services to foreigners). The term national income accounts, rather than national output accounts, is used to describe this fourfold classification because a country’s income in fact equals its output. Thus, we can think of the national income accounts as classifying each transaction that contributes to national income according to the type of expenditure that gives rise to it. Figure 13-1 shows how U.S. GNP was divided among its four components in the first quarter (January–March) of 2020.1

Why is it useful to divide GNP into consumption, investment, government purchases, and the current account? One major reason is that we cannot hope to understand the cause of a particular recession or boom without knowing how the main categories of spending have changed. And without such an understanding, we cannot recommend a sound policy response. In addition, the national income accounts provide information essential for studying why some countries are rich—that is, have a high level of GNP relative to population size—while some are poor.  

# National Product and National Income  

Our first task in understanding how economists analyze GNP is to explain in greater detail why the GNP a country generates over some time period must equal its national income, the income earned in that period by its factors of production.  

The reason for this equality is that every dollar used to purchase goods or services automatically ends up in somebody’s pocket. A visit to the doctor provides a simple example of how an increase in national output raises national income by the same amount. The $\$75$ you pay the doctor represents the market value of the services he or she provides for you, so your visit raises GNP by $\$75$ . But the $\$75$ you pay the doctor also raises his or her income. So national income rises by $\$75$ .  

The principle that output and income are the same also applies to goods, even goods produced with the help of many factors of production. Consider the example of an economics textbook. When you purchase a new book from the publisher, the value of your purchase enters GNP. But your payment enters the income of the productive factors that cooperated in producing the book because the publisher must pay for their services with the proceeds of sales. First, there are the authors, editors, artists, and compositors who provide the labor inputs necessary for the book’s production. Second, there are the publishing company’s shareholders, who receive dividends for having financed acquisition of the capital used in production. Finally, there are the suppliers of paper and ink, who provide the intermediate materials used in producing the book.  

The paper and ink purchased by the publishing house to produce the book are not counted separately in GNP because their contribution to the value of national output is already included in the book’s price. It is to avoid such double counting that we allow only the sale of final goods and services to enter into the definition of GNP. Sales of intermediate goods, such as paper and ink purchased by a publisher, are not counted. Notice also that the sale of a used textbook does not enter GNP. Our definition counts only final goods and services that are produced, and a used textbook does not qualify: It was counted in GNP at the time it was first sold. Equivalently, the sale of a used textbook does not generate income for any factor of production.  

# Capital Depreciation and International Transfers  

Because we have defined GNP and national income so that they are necessarily equal, their equality is really an identity. Two adjustments to the definition of GNP are required, however, before the identification of GNP and national income is entirely correct in practice.  

1.	 GNP does not take into account the economic loss due to the tendency of machinery and structures to wear out as they are used. This loss, called depreciation, reduces the income of capital owners. To calculate national income over a given period, we must therefore subtract from GNP the depreciation of capital over the period. GNP less depreciation is called net national product (NNP).   
2.	 A country’s income may include unrequited gifts from residents of foreign countries, as well as taxes paid to or subsidies received from foreign governments. We call such increments to current income unilateral transfers. Examples of unilateral transfers of income are pension payments to retired citizens living abroad, reparation payments, and foreign aid such as relief funds donated to drought-stricken nations. For the United States in 2019, the balance of such payments amounted to around $-\$140$ billion, representing a 0.65 percent of GNP net transfer to foreigners. Net unilateral transfers are part of a country’s income but are not part of its product, and they must be added to NNP in ­calculations of national income.  

National income equals GNP less depreciation plus net unilateral transfers. The difference between GNP and national income is by no means an insignificant amount, but macroeconomics has little to say about it, and it is of little importance for macroeconomic analysis. Therefore, for the purposes of this text, we usually use the terms GNP and national income interchangeably, emphasizing the distinction between the two only when it is essential.2 Many countries emphasize the accounting concept of Gross National Income (GNI), which is equal to national income without an adjustment for depreciation. For most countries in most years, GNP and GNI do not differ greatly.  

# Gross Domestic Product  

Most countries other than the United States have long reported gross domestic product (GDP) rather than GNP as their primary measure of national economic activity. In 1991, the United States began to follow this practice as well. GDP is supposed to measure the volume of production within a country’s borders, whereas GNP equals GDP plus net receipts of factor income from the rest of the world. For the United States, these net receipts are primarily the income domestic residents earn on wealth they hold in other countries less the payments domestic residents make to foreign owners of wealth that is located in the domestic country.  

GDP does not correct, as GNP does, for the portion of countries’ production carried out using services provided by foreign-owned capital and labor. Consider an example: The profits of a Spanish factory with British owners are counted in Spain’s GDP but are part of Britain’s GNP. The services British capital provides in Spain are a service export from Britain; therefore, they are added to British GDP in calculating British GNP. At the same time, to figure Spain’s GNP, we must subtract from its GDP the corresponding service import from Britain.  

As a practical matter, movements in GDP and GNP usually do not differ greatly. We will focus on GNP in this text, however, because GNP tracks national income more closely than GDP does and national welfare depends more directly on national income than on domestic product.  

# National Income Accounting for an Open Economy  

In this section, we extend to the case of an open economy, the closed-economy national income accounting framework you may have seen in earlier economics courses. We begin with a discussion of the national income accounts because they highlight the key role of international trade in open-economy macroeconomic theory. Since a closed economy’s residents cannot purchase foreign output or sell their own to foreigners, all of national income must be allocated to domestic consumption, investment, or government purchases. In an economy open to international trade, however, the closed-economy version of national income accounting must be modified because some domestic output is exported to foreigners while some domestic income is spent on imported foreign products.  

The main lesson of this section concerns the relationship among national saving, investment, and trade imbalances. We will see that in open economies, saving and investment are not necessarily equal, as they are in a closed economy. This occurs because countries can save in the form of foreign wealth by exporting more than they import, and they can dissave—that is, reduce their foreign wealth—by exporting less than they import.  

# Consumption  

The portion of GNP purchased by private households to fulfill current wants is called consumption. Purchases of movie tickets, food, dental work, and washing machines all fall into this category. Consumption expenditure is the largest component of GNP in most economies. In the United States, for example, the fraction of GNP devoted to consumption has fluctuated in a range from about 62 to 70 percent over the past 70 years.  

# Investment  

The part of output used by private firms to produce future output is called investment. Investment spending may be viewed as the portion of GNP used to increase the nation’s stock of capital. Steel and bricks used to build a factory are part of investment spending, as are services provided by a technician who helps build business computers. Firms’ purchases of inventories are also counted in investment spending because carrying inventories is just another way for firms to transfer output from current use to future use.  

Investment is usually more variable than consumption. In the United States, (gross) investment has fluctuated between roughly 11 and 22 percent of GNP in recent years. We often use the word investment to describe individual households’ purchases of stocks, bonds, or real estate, but you should be careful not to confuse this everyday meaning of the word with the economic definition of investment as a part of GNP. When you buy a share of Microsoft stock, you are buying neither a good nor a service, so your purchase does not show up in GNP.  

# Government Purchases  

Any goods and services purchased by federal, state, or local governments appear under government purchases in the national income accounts. Included in government purchases are federal military spending, government support of cancer research, and government funds spent on highway repair and education. Government purchases include investment as well as consumption purchases. Government transfer payments such as social security and unemployment benefits do not require the recipient to give the government any goods or services in return. Thus, transfer payments are not included in government purchases.  

Government purchases currently take up about 18 percent of U.S. GNP, and this share has fallen somewhat since the late 1950s. (The corresponding figure for 1959, for example, was around 22 percent.) In 1929, however, government purchases accounted for only 8.5 percent of U.S. GNP.  

# The National Income Identity for an Open Economy  

In a closed economy, any final good or service not purchased by households or the government must be used by firms to produce new plant, equipment, and inventories. If consumption goods are not sold immediately to consumers or the government, firms (perhaps reluctantly) add them to existing inventories, thereby increasing their investment.  

This information leads to a fundamental identity for closed economies. Let $Y$ stand for GNP, $C$ for consumption, $I$ for investment, and $G$ for government purchases. Since all of a closed economy’s output must be consumed, invested, or bought by the government, we can write  

$$
Y=C+I+G.
$$  

We derived the national income identity for a closed economy by assuming all output is consumed or invested by the country’s citizens or purchased by its government. When foreign trade is possible, however, some output is purchased by foreigners while some domestic spending goes to purchase goods and services produced abroad. The GNP identity for open economies shows how the national income a country earns by selling its goods and services is divided between sales to domestic residents and sales to foreign residents.  

Since residents of an open economy may spend some of their income on imports, that is, goods and services purchased from abroad, only the portion of their spending not devoted to imports is part of domestic GNP. The value of imports, denoted by $I M_{;}$ , must be subtracted from total domestic spending, $C+I+G$ , to find the portion of domestic spending that generates domestic national income. Imports from abroad add to foreign countries’ GNPs but do not add directly to domestic GNP.  

Similarly, the goods and services sold to foreigners make up a country’s exports. Exports, denoted by $E X.$ , are the amount foreign residents’ purchases add to the national income of the domestic economy.  

The national income of an open economy is therefore the sum of domestic and foreign expenditures on the goods and services produced by domestic factors of production. Thus, the national income identity for an open economy is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{Y=C+I+G+E X-I M.}\end{array}
$$  

# An Imaginary Open Economy  

To make identity (13-1) concrete, let’s consider an imaginary closed economy, Agraria, whose only output is wheat. Each citizen of Agraria is a consumer of wheat, but each is also a farmer and therefore can be viewed as a firm. Farmers invest by putting aside a portion of each year’s crop as seed for the next year’s planting. There is also a government that appropriates part of the crop to feed the Agrarian army. Agraria’s total annual crop is 100 bushels of wheat. Agraria can import milk from the rest of the world in exchange for exports of wheat. We cannot draw up the Agrarian national income accounts without knowing the price of milk in terms of wheat because all the components in the GNP identity (13-1) must be measured in the same units. If we assume the price of milk is 0.5 bushel of wheat per gallon, and that at this price, Agrarians want to consume 40 gallons of milk, then Agraria’s imports are equal in value to 20 bushels of wheat.  

In Table 13-1, we see that Agraria’s total output is 100 bushels of wheat. ­Consumption is divided between wheat and milk, with 55 bushels of wheat and 40  ­gallons of milk (equal in value to 20 bushels of wheat) consumed over the year. The value of ­consumption in terms of wheat is $55+(0.5\times40)=55+20=75$ .  

The 100 bushels of wheat produced by Agraria are used as follows: 55 are consumed by domestic residents, 25 are invested, 10 are purchased by the government, and 10 are exported abroad. National income ( $Y=100_{,}$ ) equals domestic spending $\mathit{\Pi}_{C}+I+G=110,$ ) plus exports $E X=10$ ) less imports $I M=20$ ).  

# The Current Account and Foreign Indebtedness  

In reality, a country’s foreign trade is exactly balanced only rarely. The difference between exports of goods and services and imports of goods and services is known as the current account balance (or current account). If we denote the current account by $C A$ , we can express this definition in symbols as  

$$
C A=E X-I M.
$$  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE13-1 National Income Accounts for Agraria, an Open Economy (bushels of wheat)</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">GNP (total = Consumption + Investment + Government output)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">purchases 100 = 75a 十 25 + 10 +</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">10 20b a55 bushels of wheat + (0.5 bushel per gallon) × (40 gallons of milk). b0.5 bushel per gallon × 40 gallons of milk.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

When a country’s imports exceed its exports, we say the country has a current account deficit. A country has a current account surplus when its exports exceed its imports.3  

The GNP identity, equation (13-1), shows one reason why the current account is important in international macroeconomics. Since the right-hand side of (13-1) gives total expenditures on domestic output, changes in the current account can be associated with changes in output and, thus, employment.  

The current account is also important because it measures the size and direction of international borrowing. When a country imports more than it exports, it is buying more from foreigners than it sells to them and must somehow finance this current account deficit. How does it pay for additional imports once it has spent its export earnings? Since the country as a whole can import more than it exports only if it can borrow the difference from foreigners, a country with a current account deficit must be increasing its net foreign debts by the amount of the deficit. This is currently the position of the United States, which has a significant current account deficit (and borrowed a sum equal to roughly 2.3 percent of its GNP in 2019).4  

Similarly, a country with a current account surplus is earning more from its exports than it spends on imports. This country finances the current account deficit of its trading partners by lending to them. The foreign wealth of a surplus country rises because foreigners pay for any imports not covered by their exports by issuing IOUs that they will eventually have to redeem. The preceding reasoning shows that a country’s current account balance equals the change in its net foreign wealth.5  

We have defined the current account as the difference between exports and imports. Equation (13-1) says that the current account is also equal to the difference between national income and domestic residents’ total spending $C+I+G$ :  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{Y-(C+I+G)=C A.}\end{array}
$$  

It is only by borrowing abroad that a country can have a current account deficit and use more output than it is currently producing. If it uses less than its output, it has a current account surplus and is lending the surplus to foreigners.6 International borrowing and lending were identified with intertemporal trade in Chapter 6. A country with a current account deficit is importing present consumption and exporting future consumption. A country with a current account surplus is exporting present consumption and importing future consumption.  

As an example, consider again the imaginary economy of Agraria described in Table 13-1. The total value of its consumption, investment, and government purchases, at 110 bushels of wheat, is greater than its output of 100 bushels. This inequality would be impossible in a closed economy; it is possible in this open economy because Agraria now imports 40 gallons of milk, worth 20 bushels of wheat, but exports only 10 bushels of wheat. The current account deficit of 10 bushels is the value of Agraria’s borrowing from foreigners, which the country will have to repay in the future.  

Figure 13-2 gives a vivid illustration of how a string of current account deficits can add up to a large foreign debt. The figure plots the U.S. current account balance since the late 1970s along with a measure of the nation’s stock of net foreign wealth, its net international investment position (or $I I P$ ), the difference between its claims on foreigners and its liabilities to them. As you can see, the United States had accumulated a positive stock of foreign wealth by the early 1980s, after which a sustained current account deficit of proportions unprecedented in the 20th century opened up. In 1989, the country became a net debtor to foreigners for the first time since World War I. That foreign debt has continued to grow, and at the start of 2020, it stood at about 50 percent of GNP.

# Saving and the Current Account  

Simple as it is, the GNP identity has many illuminating implications. To explain the most important of these implications, we define the concept of national saving, that is, the portion of output, $Y_{\pm}$ , that is not devoted to household consumption, $C$ , or government purchases, $G$ .7 In a closed economy, national saving always equals investment. This tells us that the closed economy as a whole can increase its wealth only by accumulating new capital.  

Let $S$ stand for national saving. Our definition of $S$ tells us that  

$$
S=\ Y-\ C-\ G.
$$  

Since the closed-economy GNP identity, $Y=C+I+G$ , may also be written as $I=Y-C-G $ , then  

$$
S=I,
$$  

and national saving must equal investment in a closed economy.  

Whereas in a closed economy, saving and investment must always be equal, in an open economy they can differ. Remembering that national saving, $S$ , equals $Y-C-G$ and that $C A=E X-I M$ , we can rewrite the GNP identity (13-1) as  

$$
S=I+C A.
$$  

The equation highlights an important difference between open and closed economies: An open economy can save either by building up its capital stock or by acquiring foreign wealth, but a closed economy can save only by building up its capital stock.  

Unlike a closed economy, an open economy with profitable investment opportunities does not have to increase its saving in order to exploit them. The preceding equation shows that it is possible simultaneously to raise investment and foreign borrowing without changing saving. For example, if New Zealand decides to build a new hydroelectric plant, it can import the materials it needs from the United States and borrow American funds to pay for them. This transaction raises New Zealand’s domestic investment because the imported materials contribute to expanding the country’s capital stock. The transaction also raises New Zealand’s current account deficit by an amount equal to the increase in investment. New Zealand’s saving does not have to change, even though investment rises. For this to be possible, however, U.S. residents must be willing to save more so that the resources needed to build the plant are freed for New Zealand’s use. The result is another example of intertemporal trade, in which New Zealand imports present output (when it borrows from the United States) and exports future output (when it pays off the loan).  

Because one country’s savings can be borrowed by a second country in order to increase the second country’s stock of capital, a country’s current account surplus is often referred to as its net foreign investment. Of course, when one country lends to another to finance investment, part of the income generated by the investment in future years must be used to pay back the lender. Domestic investment and foreign investment are two different ways in which a country can use current savings to increase its future income.  

# Private and Government Saving  

So far our discussion of saving has not stressed the distinction between saving decisions made by the private sector and saving decisions made by the government. Unlike private saving decisions, however, government saving decisions are often made with an eye toward their effect on output and employment. The national income identity can help us to analyze the channels through which government saving decisions influence domestic macroeconomic conditions. To use the national income identity in this way, we first have to divide national saving into its private and government components.  

Private saving is defined as the part of disposable income that is saved rather than consumed. Disposable income is national income, $Y_{i}$ , less the net taxes collected from households and firms by the government, $T$ .8 Private saving, denoted $S^{p}$ , can therefore be expressed as  

$$
S^{p}={\cal Y}-{\cal T}-{\cal C}.
$$  

Government saving is defined similarly to private saving. The government’s “income” is its net tax revenue, $T_{\cdot}$ , while its “consumption” is government purchases, $G.$ . If we let $S^{g}$ stand for government saving, then  

$$
S^{g}=T-G.
$$  

The two types of saving we have defined, private and government, add up to national saving. To see why, recall the definition of national saving, $S_{\l}$ , as $Y-C-G$ . Then  

$$
S=Y-C-G=(Y-T-C)+(T-G)=S^{p}+S^{g}.
$$  

We can use the definitions of private and government saving to rewrite the national income identity in a form that is useful for analyzing the effects of government saving decisions on open economies. Because $S=S^{p}+S^{g}=I+C A$ ,  

$$
S^{p}=I+C A-S^{g}=I+C A-(T-G)=I+C A+(G-T).
$$  

Equation (13-2) relates private saving to domestic investment, the current account surplus, and government saving. To interpret equation (13-2), we define the government budget deficit as $G\mathrm{~-~}T_{\mathrm{{i}}}$ , that is, as government saving preceded by a minus sign. The government budget deficit measures the extent to which the government is borrowing to finance its expenditures. Equation (13-2) then states that a country’s private saving can take three forms: investment in domestic capital $(I)$ , purchases of wealth from foreigners $(C A)$ , and purchases of the domestic government’s newly issued debt $(G-T)$ .9  

# THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING DEFICIT  

ecause each country’s exports are other counances must add up to zero. But they don’t. The accompanying figure shows the pattern in the data. In all but one year between 1980 and 2003, the sum of global current accounts was negative, implying either that surpluses were understated or that deficits were overstated. But in 2004, the “mystery of the missing surplus” became a “mystery of the missing deficit.” Since that year, the measured global current account has been positive.  

Given the inevitable errors in collecting detailed international payments data from many national agencies with differing accuracy and coverage, some discrepancy is unavoidable. What is puzzling is that the global discrepancy should be persistently positive or negative. That pattern suggests that something systematic is going on.  

When the global current account balance was negative, it was thought that a big contributing factor was incomplete reporting of international investment income. For example, banks report these to their home governments, but the recipients, some of whom wish to avoid taxes, may not report them at the receiving end.  

Not only have tax authorities become better at enforcing compliance, however, the general level of interest rates is now lower than it was in the  

1980s and 1990s. Better measurement of international investment income could be responsible for a shrinking negative world current account. But what could have made it turn positive?  

One possible culprit is growing international trade in services. For example, a big law firm is likely to report its service exports fairly accurately, but the purchases by many of its smaller customers may escape detection. In a detailed review of the question in 2011, however, The Economist magazine pointed out that errors in measuring merchandise trade have also risen dramatically, and it is less clear that these would create a systematic bias toward an apparent global surplus.10 The mystery remains a mystery. In 2019, it was worth $\$290$ billion, or about a third of a percent of world output.

# The Global Current Account Discrepancy since 1980

# The Balance of Payments Accounts  

In addition to national income accounts, government economists and statisticians also keep balance of payments accounts, a detailed record of the composition of the current account balance and of the many transactions that finance it.11 Balance of payments figures are of great interest to the general public, as indicated by the attention that various news media pay to them. But press reports sometimes confuse different measures of international payments flows. Should we be alarmed or cheered by a Wall Street Journal headline proclaiming, “U.S. Chalks Up Record Balance of Payments Deficit”? A thorough understanding of balance of payments accounting will help us evaluate the implications of a country’s international transactions.  

A country’s balance of payments accounts keep track of both its payments to and its receipts from foreigners. Any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners appears in the balance of payments accounts as a credit. Any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners appears as a debit. Three types of international transaction are recorded in the balance of payments:  

1.	 Transactions that arise from the export or import of goods or services and therefore enter directly into the current account. When a French consumer imports American blue jeans, for example, the transaction enters the U.S. balance of payments accounts as a credit on the current account. On the other hand, American imports of French cheese enter the U.S. balance of payments as a debit. A positive current account balance means that current account credits exceed debits and that a country’s residents are exporting more goods and services to foreign residents than they are importing from them.   
2.	 Transactions that arise from the purchase or sale of financial assets. An asset is any one of the forms in which people hold wealth, such as money, stocks, factories, or government debt. The financial account of the balance of payments records all international purchases and sales of financial assets. When an American company buys a French factory, the transaction enters the U.S. balance of payments as a debit. It enters as a debit because the transaction requires a payment from the United States to foreigners. Correspondingly, a U.S. sale of assets to foreigners enters the U.S. balance of payments as a credit. Balance of payments statistics present the financial account as debits less credits, that is, as the difference between a country’s purchases and sales of foreign assets. Balance of payments accountants sometimes refer to this financial account balance alternatively as net financial flows. It is positive when, on net, a country’s residents are accumulating claims on foreign residents, that is, buying more financial assets from foreign residents than are being sold to them.  

3.	 Certain other activities resulting in transfers of wealth between countries appear in the capital account. These international asset movements—which are generally very small for the United States—differ from those listed in the financial account.  

For the most part, they result from nonmarket activities or represent the acquisition or disposal of nonproduced, nonfinancial, and possibly intangible assets (such as copyrights and trademarks). For example, if the U.S. government forgives $\$1$ billion in debt owed to it by the government of Pakistan, U.S. wealth declines by $\$1$ billion and a $\$1$ billion debit is recorded in the U.S. capital account.  

You will find the complexities of the balance of payments accounts less confusing if you keep in mind the following simple rule of double-entry bookkeeping: Every international transaction automatically enters the balance of payments twice, once as a credit and once as a debit. This principle of balance of payments accounting holds true because every transaction has two sides: If you buy something from a foreigner, you must pay him in some way, and the foreigner must then somehow spend or store your payment.  

# Examples of Paired Transactions  

Some examples will show how the principle of double-entry bookkeeping operates in practice.  

1.	 Imagine you buy an ink-jet fax machine from the Italian company Olivetti and pay for your purchase with a $\$1,000$ check. Your payment to buy a good (the fax machine) from a foreign resident enters the U.S. current account as a debit. But where is the offsetting balance of payments credit? Olivetti’s U.S. salesperson must do something with your check—let’s say he deposits it in Olivetti’s account at Citibank in New York. In this case, Olivetti has purchased, and Citibank has sold, a U.S. asset—a bank deposit worth $\$1,000$ —and the transaction shows up as a $\$1,000$ credit in the U.S. financial account. The transaction creates the following two offsetting bookkeeping entries in the U.S. balance of payments:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Credit</td><td>Debit</td></tr><tr><td>Fax machine purchase (Current account, U.S. good import)</td><td></td><td>$1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Sale of bank deposit by Citibank (Financial account, U.S.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>asset sale)</td><td>$1,000</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

2.	 As another example, suppose that during your travels in France, you pay $\$200$ for a fine dinner at the Restaurant de l’Escargot d’Or. Lacking cash, you place the charge on your Visa credit card. Your payment, which is a tourist expenditure, counts as a service import for the United States and therefore as a current account debit. Where is the offsetting credit? Your signature on the Visa slip entitles the restaurant to receive $\$200$ (actually, its local currency equivalent) from First Card, the company that issued your Visa card. It is therefore an asset, a claim on a future payment from First Card. So when you pay for your meal abroad with your credit card, you are selling an asset to France and generating a $\$200$ credit in the U.S. financial account. The pattern of offsetting debits and credits in this case is:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Credit</td><td>Debit</td></tr><tr><td>Meal purchase (Current account, U.S. service import) Sale of claim on First Card (Financial account, U.S. asset sale)</td><td>$200</td><td>$200</td></tr></table></body></html>  

3.	 Imagine next that your Uncle Sid from Los Angeles buys a newly issued share of stock in the U.K. oil giant British Petroleum (BP). He places his order with his U.S. stockbroker, Go-for-Broke, Inc., paying $\$95$ with funds from his Go-for-Broke money market account. BP, in turn, deposits the $\$95$ Sid has paid into its own U.S. bank account at Second Bank of Chicago. Uncle Sid’s acquisition of the stock creates a $\$95$ debit in the U.S. financial account (he has purchased an asset from a foreign resident, BP), while BP’s $\$95$ deposit at its Chicago bank is the offsetting financial account credit (BP has expanded its U.S. asset holdings). The mirror-image effects on the U.S. balance of payments therefore both appear in the financial account:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Credit</td><td>Debit</td></tr><tr><td>Uncle Sid's purchase of a share of BP (Financial account, U.S. assetpurchase)</td><td></td><td>$95</td></tr><tr><td>BP's deposit of Uncle Sid's payment at Second Bank of</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chicago (Financial account, U.S. asset sale)</td><td>$95</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

4.	 Finally, let’s consider how the U.S. balance of payments accounts are affected when U.S. banks forgive (that is, announce that they will simply forget about) $\$5,000$ in debt owed to them by the government of the imaginary country of Bygonia. In this case, the United States makes a $\$5,000$ capital transfer to Bygonia, which appears as a $\$5,000$ debit entry in the capital account. The associated credit is in the financial account, in the form of a $\$5,000$ reduction in U.S. assets held abroad (a negative “acquisition” of foreign assets and therefore a balance of payments credit):  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Credit</td><td>Debit</td></tr><tr><td>U.S. banks' debt forgiveness (Capital account, U.S. transfer payment)</td><td></td><td>$5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Reduction in banks' claims on Bygonia (Financial account,</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>U.S. asset sale)</td><td>$5,000</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

These examples show that many circumstances can affect the way a transaction generates its offsetting balance of payments entry. We can never predict with certainty where the flip side of a particular transaction will show up, but we can be sure that it will show up somewhere.  

# The Fundamental Balance of Payments Identity  

Because any international transaction automatically gives rise to offsetting credit and debit entries in the balance of payments, the sum of the current account balance and the capital account balance automatically equals the financial account balance:  

Current account balance $^+$ capital account balance $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ Financial account balance  

In examples 1, 2, and 4 previously, current or capital account entries have offsetting counterparts in the financial account, while in example 3, two financial account entries offset each other. Double-entry bookkeeping tells us that a country’s total receipts from foreigners must match its total payments to them. Therefore, total balance of payments credits must equal total balance of payments debits. Equation (13-3) merely rearranges that identity by gathering current (and capital) credits less debits on the left-hand side and financial debits less credits on the right-hand side.  

You can understand this identity another way. Recall the relationship linking the current account to international lending and borrowing. Because the sum of the current and capital accounts is the total change in a country’s net foreign assets (including, through the capital account, nonmarket asset transfers), that sum necessarily equals the difference between a country’s purchases of assets from foreigners and its sales of assets to them—that is, the financial account balance.  

We now turn to a more detailed description of the balance of payments accounts, using as an example the U.S. accounts for 2019.  

# The Current Account, Once Again  

As you have learned, the current account balance measures a country’s net exports of goods and services. In practice, it also includes any net unilateral transfer payments it receives from abroad (an item we have largely ignored until now). Table 13-2 shows that U.S. exports (on the credit side) were $\$3,805.94$ billion in 2019, while U.S. imports (on the debit side) were \$4,286.16 billion (inclusive of unilateral transfers).  

The balance of payments accounts divide exports and imports into three finer categories. The first is goods trade, that is, exports or imports of merchandise. The second category, services, includes items such as payments for legal assistance, tourists’ expenditures, and shipping fees. The final category, primary income, consists mostly of international interest and dividend payments and the earnings of domestically owned firms operating abroad. If you own a share of a German firm’s stock and receive a dividend payment of $\$5$ , then that payment shows up in the accounts as a U.S. investment income receipt of $\$5$ . Wages that workers earn from foreign employers can also enter as primary income.  

We include income on foreign investments in the current account because that income really is compensation for the services provided by foreign investments. This idea, as we saw earlier, is behind the distinction between GNP and GDP. When a U.S. corporation builds a plant in Canada, for instance, the productive services the plant generates are viewed as a service export from the United States to Canada equal in value to the profits the plant yields for its American owner. To be consistent, we must be sure to include these profits in American GNP and not in Canadian GNP. Remember, the definition of GNP refers to goods and services generated by a country’s factors of production, but it does not specify that those factors must work within the borders of the country that owns them. Before calculating the current account, we must also account for unilateral transfers, shown in the table as secondary income. In discussing the relationship between GNP and national income, we defined unilateral transfers between countries as international gifts, that is, payments that do not correspond to the purchase of any good, service, or asset. Net unilateral transfers are considered part of the current account as well as a part of national income, and the identity $\d{\b{Y}}=\b{C}+\b{I}+\b{G}+\b{C}\b{A}$ holds exactly if $Y$ is interpreted as GNP plus net transfers (equal to GNI). In 2019, the U.S. balance of unilateral transfers was $\$141.98$ billion - $\$281.69$ billion $=-\mathbb{S}139.71$ billion.  

The table shows a 2019 current account balance of $\$3,805.94$ billion - \$4,286.16 billion $=-\$480.22$ billion, a deficit. The negative sign means that current

payments to foreigners exceeded current receipts and that U.S. residents used more output than they produced. Since these current account transactions were paid for in some way, we know that this $\$480.22$ billion net debit entry must be offset by a net $\$480.22$ billion credit elsewhere in the balance of payments.  

# The Capital Account  

The capital account entry in Table 13-2 shows that in 2019, the United States paid foreign residents about $\$6$ billion in net capital transfers. The net balance of $-\$6.24$ billion is a balance of payments debit. After we add it to the payments deficit implied by the current account, we find that the United States’ need to cover its excess payments to foreigners is increased very slightly, from $\$480.22$ billion to $\$486.46$ billion.  

Because an excess of national spending over income must be covered by net borrowing from foreigners, this negative current plus capital account balance must be matched by an equal negative balance of net financial flows, representing the net liabilities the United States incurred to foreigners in 2019 in order to fund its deficit.  

# The Financial Account  

While the current account is the difference between sales of goods and services to foreigners and purchases of goods and services from them, the financial account measures the difference between acquisitions of assets from foreigners and the buildup of liabilities to them. When the United States borrows $\$1$ from foreigners, it is selling them an asset—a promise that they will be repaid $\$1$ , with interest, in the future. Likewise, when the United States lends abroad, it acquires an asset: the right to claim future repayment from foreigners. An excess of asset sales (foreign borrowing) over asset purchases is required to finance an excess of imports over exports.  

To cover its 2019 current plus capital account deficit of $\$486.46$ billion, the United States needed to borrow from foreigners (or otherwise sell assets to them) in the net amount of $\$486.46$ billion. We can look again at Table 13-2 to see exactly how this net sale of assets to foreigners came about.  

The table records separately net U.S. acquisitions of foreign financial assets (which are balance of payments debits because the United States must pay foreigners for those assets) and net increases in foreign claims on residents of the United States (which are balance of payments credits because the United States receives payments when it sells assets overseas).  

These data on increases in U.S. asset holdings abroad and foreign holdings of U.S. assets do not include holdings of financial derivatives, which are a class of assets that are more complicated than ordinary stocks and bonds, but have values that can depend on stock and bond values. (We will describe some specific derivative securities in the next chapter.) Starting in 2006, the U.S. Department of Commerce was able to assemble data on net cross-border derivative flows for the United States (U.S. net purchases of foreign-issued derivatives less foreign net purchases of U.S.-issued derivatives). ­Derivatives transactions enter the balance of payments accounts in the same way as other international asset transactions do.  

According to Table 13-2, U.S.-owned assets abroad (other than derivatives) increased (on a net basis) by $\$440.75$ billion in 2019. The figure is “on a net basis” because some U.S. residents bought foreign assets while others sold foreign assets they already owned, the difference between U.S. gross purchases and sales of foreign assets being $\$440.75$ billion. In the same year (again on a net basis), the United States incurred new liabilities to foreigners equal to $\$797.96$ billion. Some U.S. residents undoubtedly repaid prior foreign debts, but new borrowing from foreigners exceeded these repayments by $\$797.96$ billion. The balance of U.S. purchases and sales of financial derivatives was $-\$38.34$ billion. The United States acquired derivative claims on foreigners that were lower in value than the derivative claims on the U.S. that foreigners acquired. We calculate the balance on financial account (net financial flows) as $\$440.75$ billion - $\$797.96$ billion - $\$38.34$ billion $=-\mathbb{S}395.54$ billion (apart from rounding). The negative value for net financial flows means that in 2019, the United States increased its net liability to foreigners (liabilities minus assets) by $\$395.54$ billion.  

# Statistical Discrepancy  

We come out with net financial flows of $-\$395.54$ rather than the $-\mathbb{S}486.46$ billion that we would have expected as a result of adding up the current and capital account balances. According to our data on trade and financial flows, the United States incurred \$90.92 billion less in foreign debt than it actually needed to fund its current plus capital account deficit—because $\$486.46$ billion (measured required borrowing) less $\$395.54$ billion (measured actual borrowing) equals $\$90.92$ billion. If every balance of payments credit automatically generates an equal counterpart debit and vice versa, how is this difference possible? The reason is that information about the offsetting debit and credit items associated with a given transaction may come from different sources. For example, the import debit that a shipment of flat-screen TVs from Korea generates may come from a U.S. customs inspector’s report and the corresponding financial account credit from a report by the U.S. bank in which the check paying for the TVs is deposited. Because data from different sources may differ in coverage, accuracy, and timing, the balance of payments accounts seldom balance in practice as they must in theory. Account keepers force the two sides to balance by adding to the accounts a statistical discrepancy item. For 2019, unrecorded (or misrecorded) international transactions generated a balancing accounting credit of $\$90.92$ billion—the difference between the recorded net financial flows and the sum of the recorded current and capital accounts.  

We have no way of knowing exactly how to allocate this discrepancy among the current, capital, and financial accounts. (If we did, it wouldn’t be a discrepancy!) The financial account is the most likely culprit, since it is notoriously difficult to keep track of the complicated financial trades between residents of different countries. But we cannot conclude that net financial flows were $\$90.92$ billion lower than recorded because the current account is also highly suspect. Balance of payments accountants consider merchandise trade data relatively reliable, but data on services are not. Service transactions such as sales of financial advice and computer programming assistance may escape detection. Accurate measurement of international interest and dividend receipts can be particularly difficult.  

# MULTINATIONALS’ PROFIT SHIFTING AND IRELAND’S VOLATILE GDP  

On July 12, 2016, Ireland’s Central Statistics ment: Ireland’s real GDP had risen by a whopping 26.3 percent between 2014 and 2015, far above the previous estimate of 7.8 percent. The CSO offered a strikingly unilluminating comment: “The present release is based on more complete and up to date data than that which was available when the Q4 2015 estimates were published in March 2016.” The following chart showing the behavior of Irish GDP since 1999 makes clear what an outlier 2015 was. (The growth rate for the year was revised down to “only” 25.1 percent in light of further data.)  

What explains this remarkable spurt of growth? Was there a sudden upsurge in Ireland’s available supplies of factories, land, and labor? In fact, no massive increase in factors of production had occurred—for example, no correspondingly large employment effects appear in the data. Instead, the increase in GDP was in large part an accounting phenomenon reflecting tax avoidance strategies by large multinationals from other countries. The outsized effect on the small Irish economy illustrates both the way in which GDP is calculated and its shortcomings as a measure of economic welfare.  

Ireland has a statutory tax on corporate profits of 12.5 percent, and in practice some companies incorporated there may pay even lower rates. In comparison, the U.S. corporate tax rate (not including state taxes) has been 21 percent since its last reduction in December 2017. This discrepancy sets up an incentive for large multinationals, notably in fields such as high tech and pharma, to relocate their intellectual property (IP) assets to subsidiaries in Ireland (and other low-tax

# Real GDP Growth in Ireland since 1999  

The huge jump in Ireland’s 2015 real GDP was mostly an artifact of creative accounting.

havens including Luxembourg and Bermuda) so that global profits are booked and taxed there and not at home.  

Intellectual property is “intangible capital,” and therefore easy to move, but it is capital nonetheless, typically reflecting a history of investment in research and development. When a U.S. company transfers IP to an Irish subsidiary, for example, Ireland’s foreign liabilities rise by the value of the IP (however that is determined), its capital stock rises in value by the same amount, and the profits attributable to the IP capital immediately begin flowing into Irish rather than U.S. GDP. Such “foreign direct investment” in the Irish economy helped fuel its 2015 GDP surge. Of course, this type of inward investment may do little to raise production by Irish factories, farms, or workers, although it is likely to enhance the tax revenues of the Irish state while reducing (by far more) those of the United States.  

All advanced countries face the problem of multinational profit shifting, which distorts the burden of funding government services away from corporations and toward households. The problem seems particularly acute for the United States, however, given that it is home to IP intensive tech giants such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Recent estimates suggest that U.S. multinationals shift roughly 60 percent of their total annual profits to low-tax jurisdictions, whereas the global average profit share that multinationals shift from their home countries is about 40 percent.12 ­Governments can solve this problem only through substantial coordination of tax policies as well as detailed information sharing. Efforts to date had only limited success until 2021, when the United States (under President Joseph R. Biden, Jr.) and other large economies agreed to establish a common minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent. Although that agreement was a major breakthrough, implementation faces political as well as technical obstacles. As of this writing, it remains to be seen if they can be overcome.  

# Official Reserve Transactions  

Although there are many types of financial account transactions, one type is important enough to merit separate discussion. This type of transaction is the purchase or sale of official reserve assets by central banks.  

An economy’s central bank is the institution responsible for managing the supply of money. In the United States, the central bank is the Federal Reserve System. ­Official international reserves are foreign assets held by central banks as a cushion against national economic misfortune. At one time, official reserves consisted largely of gold, but today, central banks’ reserves include substantial foreign financial assets, particularly U.S. dollar assets such as Treasury bills. The Federal Reserve itself holds only a small level of official reserve assets other than gold; its own holdings of U.S. dollar assets are not considered international reserves.  

Central banks often buy or sell international reserves in private asset markets to affect macroeconomic conditions in their economies. Official transactions of this type are called official foreign exchange intervention. One reason why foreign exchange intervention can alter macroeconomic conditions is that it is a way for the central bank to inject money into the economy or withdraw it from circulation. We will have much more to say later about the causes and consequences of foreign exchange intervention.  

Government agencies other than central banks may hold foreign reserves and intervene officially in exchange markets. The U.S. Treasury, for example, operates an Exchange Stabilization Fund that at times has played an active role in market trading. Because the operations of such agencies usually have no noticeable impact on the money supply, however, we will simplify our discussion by speaking (when it is not too misleading) as if the central bank alone holds foreign reserves and intervenes.  

When a central bank purchases or sells a foreign asset, the transaction appears in its country’s financial account just as if the same transaction had been carried out by a private citizen. A transaction in which the central bank of Japan (the Bank of Japan) acquires dollar assets might occur as follows: A U.S. auto dealer imports a Nissan sedan from Japan and pays the auto company with a check for $\$20,000$ . Nissan does not want to invest the money in dollar assets, but it so happens that the Bank of Japan is willing to give ­Nissan Japanese money in exchange for the $\$20,000$ check. The Bank of Japan’s international reserves rise by $\$20,000$ as a result of the deal. Because the Bank of Japan’s dollar reserves are part of total Japanese assets held in the United States, the latter rise by $\$20,000$ . This transaction therefore results in a $\$20,000$ credit in the U.S. financial account, the other side of the $\$20,000$ debit in the U.S. current account due to the import of the car.13  

Table 13-2 shows that in 2019, U.S. official reserve assets rose by $\$4.66$ billion. As also shown in the table, foreign central banks bought $\$61.63$ billion in additional U.S. dollar reserves. The net increase in U.S. official reserves less the increase in foreign official reserve claims on the United States is the level of net central bank financial flows, which stood at $\$4.66$ billion $-\mathbb{S}61.63\mathrm{~billion=-\mathbb{S}56.97}$ billion in 2019.  

You can think of this $-\$56.97$ billion net central bank financial flow as measuring the degree to which monetary authorities in the United States and abroad generated additional net U.S. liabilities to foreigners—which help to finance the U.S. current account deficit when the number is negative, but increase the need for private foreign financing when it is positive. In our prior example the Bank of Japan, by acquiring a $\$20,000$ U.S. bank deposit, indirectly finances an American import of a $\$20,000$ Japanese car. The level of net central bank financial flows is called the official settlements balance or (in less formal usage) the balance of payments. This balance is the sum of the current account and capital account balances, less the nonreserve portion of the financial account balance, and it indicates the role of central banks’ official reserve transactions in offsetting the current account balance. Thus, the U.S. balance of payments in 2019 was $-\$56.97$ billion.  

The balance of payments played an important historical role as a measure of disequilibrium in international payments, and for many countries it still plays this role. A  negative balance of payments (a deficit) may signal a crisis, for it means that a country is running down its international reserve assets or incurring debts to foreign monetary authorities. If a country faces the risk of being suddenly cut off from foreign loans, it will want to maintain a “war chest” of international reserves as a precaution. Many developing countries, in particular, are in this position (see Chapter 22).  

Like any summary measure, however, the balance of payments must be interpreted with caution. To return to our running example, the Bank of Japan’s decision to expand its U.S. bank deposit holdings by $\$20,000$ swells the measured U.S. balance of payments deficit by the same amount. Suppose the Bank of Japan instead places its $\$20,000$ with Barclays Bank in London, which in turn deposits the money with Citibank in New York. The United States incurs an extra $\$20,000$ in liabilities to private foreigners in this case, and the U.S. balance of payments deficit does not rise. But this “improvement” in the balance of payments is of little economic importance: It makes no real difference to the United States whether it borrows the Bank of Japan’s money directly or through a London bank.  

# The Assets and Liabilities of the World’s Biggest Debtor  

We saw earlier that the current account balance measures the flow of new net claims on foreign wealth that a country acquires by exporting more goods and services than it imports. This flow is not, however, the only important factor that causes a country’s net foreign wealth to change. In addition, changes in the market price of wealth previously acquired can alter a country’s net foreign wealth. When Japan’s stock market lost three-quarters of its value over the 1990s, for example, American and European owners of Japanese shares saw the value of their claims on Japan plummet, and Japan’s net foreign wealth increased as a result. Exchange rate changes have a similar effect. When the dollar depreciates against foreign currencies, for example, foreigners who hold dollar assets see their wealth fall when measured in their home currencies.  

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the vast job of data collection behind the U.S. national income and balance of payments statistics, reports annual estimates of the net international investment position of the United States—the country’s foreign assets less its foreign liabilities. Because asset price and exchange rate changes alter the dollar values of foreign assets and liabilities alike, the BEA must adjust the values of existing claims to reflect such capital gains and losses in order to estimate U.S. net foreign wealth. These estimates show that at the end of 2019, the United States had a negative net foreign wealth position far greater than that of any other country.  

Until 1991, foreign direct investments such as foreign factories owned by U.S. corporations were valued at their historical, that is, original, purchase prices. Now the BEA uses two different methods to place current values on foreign direct investments: the current cost method, which values direct investments at the cost of buying them today, and the market value method, which is meant to measure the price at which the investments could be sold. These methods can lead to different valuations because the cost of replacing a particular direct investment and the price it would command if sold on the market may be hard to measure. (The net foreign wealth data graphed in Figure 13-2 are current cost estimates, which are believed to be more accurate.)  

Table 13-3 reproduces the BEA’s account of how it made its valuation adjustments to find the U.S. net IIP at the end of 2019. This “headline” estimate values direct investments at current cost. Starting with its estimate of 2018 net foreign wealth $(-\$9,674.4$ billion), the BEA added the amount of the $2019\mathsf{U}.S$ . net financial flow of $-\$395.5$ billion—recall the figure reported in Table 13-2. Then the BEA adjusted the values of previously held assets and liabilities for various changes in their dollar prices. As a result of these valuation changes, U.S. net foreign wealth fell by an amount greater than the $\$395.5$ billion in new net borrowing from foreigners—in fact, U.S. net foreign wealth declined by $\$1,376,1$ billion. The BEA’s 2019 estimate of U.S. net foreign wealth, therefore, was $-\$123,456,5$ billion, roughly half of U.S. GDP.  

Changes in exchange rates and securities prices have the potential to change the U.S. net foreign debt sharply, however, because the gross foreign assets and liabilities of the United States have become so large in recent years. Figure 13-3 illustrates this dramatic trend. In 1976, U.S. foreign assets stood at only 20 percent of U.S. GDP and liabilities at 15 percent (making the United States a net foreign creditor in the amount of roughly 5 percent of its GDP). In 2019, however, the country’s foreign assets amounted to roughly 137 percent of GDP and its liabilities to roughly 188 percent. The tremendous growth in these stocks of wealth reflects the rapid globalization of financial markets in the late 20th century, a phenomenon we will discuss further in Chapter 20.  

Think about how gross wealth positions of this magnitude amplify the effects of exchange rate changes, however. Suppose 70 percent of U.S. foreign assets are denominated in foreign currencies, but all U.S. liabilities to foreigners are denominated in dollars (these are approximately the correct numbers). Because in 2019

# Gross Foreign Assets and Liabilities, 1976–2019  

Since 1976, both the foreign assets and the liabilities of the United States have increased sharply. But liabilities have risen more quickly, leaving the United States with a substantial net foreign debt.  

Source: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis  

U.S. GDP was around $\$21.5$ trillion, a 10 percent depreciation of the dollar would leave U.S. liabilities unchanged but would increase U.S. assets (measured in dollars) by $10\times0.7\times1.37=9.6$ percent of GDP, or just over $\$2$ trillion. This number is 4.3 times the U.S. current account deficit of 2019! Indeed, due to sharp movements in exchange rates and stock prices, the U.S. economy lost about $\$800$ billion in this way between 2007 and 2008 and gained a comparable amount between 2008 and 2009 (see Figure 13-2). The corresponding redistribution of wealth between foreigners and the United States would have been much smaller back in 1976.  

Does this possibility mean that policy makers should ignore their countries’ ­current accounts and instead try to manipulate currency values to prevent large buildups of net foreign debt? That would be a perilous strategy because, as we will see in Chapter 14, expectations of future exchange rates are central to market participants behavior. ­Systematic government attempts to reduce foreign investors’ wealth through exchange rate changes would sharply reduce foreigners’ demand for domestic ­currency assets, thus decreasing or eliminating any wealth benefit from depreciating the home currency.  

■■ International macroeconomics is concerned with the full employment of scarce economic resources and price level stability throughout the world economy. Because they reflect national expenditure patterns and their international repercussions, the national income accounts and the balance of payments accounts are essential tools for studying the macroeconomics of open, interdependent economies.  

■■ A country’s gross national product (GNP) is equal to the income received by its factors of production. The national income accounts divide national income according to the types of spending that generate it: consumption, investment, government purchases, and the current account balance. Gross domestic product (GDP), equal to GNP less net receipts of factor income from abroad, measures the output produced within a country’s territorial borders.  

■■ In an economy closed to international trade, GNP must be consumed, invested, or purchased by the government. By using current output to build plant, equipment, and inventories, investment transforms present output into future output. For a closed economy, investment is the only way to save in the aggregate, so the sum of the saving carried out by the private and public sectors, national saving, must equal investment.  

■■ In an open economy, GNP equals the sum of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports of goods and services. Trade does not have to be balanced if the economy can borrow from and lend to the rest of the world. The difference between the economy’s exports and imports, the current account balance, equals the difference between the economy’s output and its total use of goods and services.  

■■ The current account also equals the country’s net lending to foreigners. Unlike a closed economy, an open economy can save through domestic and foreign investments. National saving therefore equals domestic investment plus the current account balance. The current account is closely related to the change in the net international investment position, though usually not equal to that change because of fluctuations in asset values not recorded in the national income and product accounts.  

■■ Balance of payments accounts provide a detailed picture of the composition and financing of the current account. All transactions between a country and the rest of the world are recorded in the country’s balance of payments accounts. The accounts obey the convention that any transaction resulting in a payment to foreigners is entered as a debit while any transaction resulting in a receipt from foreigners is entered as a credit.  

■■ Transactions involving goods and services appear in the current account of the balance of payments, while international sales or purchases of assets appear in the financial account. The capital account records mainly nonmarket asset transfers and tends to be small for the United States. The sum of the current and capital account balances must equal the financial account balance (net financial flows). This feature of the accounts reflects the fact that discrepancies between export earnings and import expenditures must be matched by a promise to repay the difference, usually with interest, in the future.  

■■ International asset transactions carried out by central banks are included in the financial account. Any central bank transaction in private markets for foreign currency assets is called official foreign exchange intervention. One reason intervention is important is that central banks use it as a way to change the amount of money in circulation. A country has a deficit in its balance of payments when it is running down its official international reserves or borrowing from foreign central banks; it has a surplus in the opposite case.

1.	 We stated in this chapter that GNP accounts avoid double counting by including only the value of final goods and services sold on the market. Should the measure of imports used in the GNP accounts therefore be defined to include only imports of final goods and services from abroad? What about exports?   
2.	 Equation (13-2) tells us that to reduce a current account deficit, a country must increase its private saving, reduce domestic investment, or cut its government budget deficit. Nowadays, some people recommend restrictions on imports from China (and other countries) to reduce the American current account deficit. How would higher U.S. barriers to imports affect its private saving, domestic investment, and government deficit? Do you agree that import restrictions would necessarily reduce a U.S. current account deficit?   
3.	 Explain how each of the following transactions generates two entries—a credit and a debit—in the Japanese balance of payments accounts, and describe how each entry would be classified: a.	 A Japanese investor buys a share of a stock company in Thailand, paying by writing a check on an account with a Singapore bank. b.	 A Japanese investor buys a share of a Thai stock company, paying the seller with a check on a Japanese bank. c.	 The Malaysian government carries out an official foreign exchange intervention in which it uses Yen held in a Japanese bank to buy ringgit (Malaysian currency) from its citizens. d.	 A tourist from Kyoto buys a meal at an expensive restaurant in Bangkok, ­paying with a traveler’s check. e.	  A saké brewery in Kobe contributes a case of saké bottles for a Paris ­wine tasting event. f.	 A Japanese-owned factory in Germany uses local earnings to buy additional machinery.  

4.	 A Mexican travels to Brazil to buy a gemstone which costs 3,000 Real (Brazilian currency). The Brazilian company that sells the gemstone then deposits the 3,000 Real in its account in a Panama bank. How would these transactions show up in the balance of payments accounts of Mexico and Brazil? What if the Mexican pays cash for the gemstone?  

5.	 The nation of Pecunia had a current account deficit of $\$1$ billion and a nonreserve financial account surplus of $\$500$ million in 2021.  

a.	 What was the balance of payments of Pecunia in that year? What happened to the country’s net foreign assets?   
b.	 Assume that foreign central banks neither buy nor sell Pecunian assets. How did the Pecunian central bank’s foreign reserves change in 2021? How would this official intervention show up in the balance of payments accounts of Pecunia?   
c.	 How would your answer to (b) change if you learned that foreign central banks had purchased $\$600$ million of Pecunian assets in 2021? How would these official purchases enter foreign balance of payments accounts?   
d.	 Draw up the Pecunian balance of payments accounts for 2021 under the assumption that the event described in (c) occurred in that year.   
6.	 Can you think of reasons why a government might be concerned about a large current account deficit or surplus? Why might a government be concerned about its official settlements balance (that is, its balance of payments)? 7.	 Do the data on the European Central Bank, which set up the official settlements balance for the Eurozone, give an accurate picture of the extent to which foreign central banks buy and sell euros in currency markets?   
8.	 Is it possible for a country to have a current account deficit at the same time it has a surplus in its balance of payments? Explain your answer, using hypothetical figures for the current and nonreserve financial accounts. Be sure to discuss the possible implications for official international reserve flows.   
9.	 Suppose the South Africa net foreign debt is 50 percent of its GDP and foreign assets and liabilities pay an interest rate of 6 percent per year. What would be the drain on SA GDP (as a percentage) from paying interest on the net foreign debt? Do you think this is a large number? What if the net foreign debt were 100 percent of GDP? At what point do you think a country’s government should become worried about the size of its foreign debt?   
10.	 In 2015, in the balance of payment of Switzerland, the labor income in the primary income balance shows a deficit of 21 billion CHF (Swiss Franc), which represents almost 30 percent of the net account surplus (71 Billion CHF). How can you explain the size of this deficit?   
11.	 Return to the example in this chapter’s final Case Study of how a 10 percent dollar depreciation affects U.S. net foreign wealth (“The Assets and Liabilities of the World’s Biggest Debtor”). Show the size of the effect on foreigners’ net foreign claims on the United States measured in dollars (as a percent of U.S. GDP).   
12.	 We mentioned in the chapter that capital gains and losses on a country’s net foreign assets are not included in the national income measure of the current account. How would economic statisticians have to modify the national income identity [­equation (13-1)] if they wish to include such gains and losses as part of the definition of the current account? In your opinion, would this make sense? Why do you think this is not done in practice?   
13.	 Go to the BEA website at http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid $=62$ &step $\c=$ 1&isuri $\c=$ 1#reqid $=62$ &step $\c=$ 6&isur $\c=$ 1&6210 $=$ 5& $6200=143$ and download annual data starting in 1976 on the U.S. end-of-year international investment position (IIP data). For the same time period, download annual data on U.S. nominal GDP from the Interactive Data at http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp. Then compute the annual ratio of the IIP to nominal GDP starting in 1976, and graph the data. The United States has run current account deficits in almost every year  

since the mid-1980s. Do the data you have graphed therefore surprise you? (Hint: To answer this question, you will need to compare the current account deficit, as a percent of nominal GDP, with the growth rate of nominal GDP, so you will also need to examine the annual current account data from the BEA website. You may wish to return to this problem after reading Chapter 19.)
