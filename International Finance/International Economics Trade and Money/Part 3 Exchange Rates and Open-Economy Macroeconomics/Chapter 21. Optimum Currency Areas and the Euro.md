# CHAPTER 21  

# Optimum Currency Areas and the Euro  

Oan Jcaonmuamryon1 c1u9rr9e9n,c1y1, tmhemebuerro.coThuentyrihesavoef tshinecEeurboepenajnoiUneidonb(yEeUi)gahdt omptoerde EU members. Europe’s bold experiment in economic and monetary union (EMU), which many had viewed as a visionary fantasy only a few years earlier, created a currency area with more than 340 million consumers—roughly 4.5 percent more populous than the United States. If the countries of Eastern Europe were all eventually to enter the euro zone, it would comprise more than 25 countries and stretch from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Black Sea in the east. Figure 21-1 shows the extent of the euro zone as of 2021.  

The birth of the euro resulted in fixed exchange rates between all EMU member countries. In deciding to form a monetary union, however, EMU countries sacrificed even more sovereignty over their monetary policies than a fixed exchange rate regime normally requires. They agreed to give up national currencies entirely and to hand over control of their monetary policies to a shared European Central Bank (ECB). The euro project thus represents an extreme solution to the monetary policy trilemma of Chapter 19: absolute exchange rate stability, absolute openness to financial trade, but no monetary autonomy whatsoever.  

The European experience raises a host of important questions. How and why did Europe set up its single currency? What benefits has the euro delivered for the economies of its members, and why have they found themselves in a protracted crisis? How does the euro affect countries outside the EMU, notably the United States? And what lessons does the European experience carry for other potential currency blocs, such as the Mercosur trading group in South America?  

This chapter focuses on Europe’s experience of monetary unification to illustrate the economic benefits and costs of fixed exchange rate agreements and more comprehensive currency unification schemes. As we see in Europe’s experience, the effects of joining a fixed exchange rate agreement are complex and depend crucially on microeconomic and macroeconomic factors. Our discussion of Europe will throw light not only on the forces promoting or obstructing greater unification of national economies but also on the forces that make a country think twice before giving up completely its control over monetary policy.

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

Discuss why Europeans have long sought to stabilize their mutual exchange rates while floating against the U.S. dollar.   
Describe how the European Union, through the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, placed itself on the road to having a single currency, the euro, issued and managed by a European Central Bank (ECB).   
Detail the structure of the ECB, the European System of Central Banks, and the European Union’s arrangements for coordinating member states’ economic policies.   
Articulate the main lessons of the theory of optimum currency areas. Recount how the 19 countries using the euro have fared so far in their ­currency union and the steps they have taken in response to prolonged series of economic crises.  

# How the European Single Currency Evolved  

Until its demise in 1973, the Bretton Woods system fixed every member country’s exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and as a result automatically fixed the exchange rate between every pair of nondollar currencies. EU countries allowed their currencies to float against the dollar after 1973 but have tried progressively to narrow the extent to which they let their currencies fluctuate against each other. These efforts culminated in the birth of the euro on January 1, 1999.  

# What Has Driven European Monetary Cooperation?  

What prompted the EU countries to seek closer coordination of monetary policies and greater mutual exchange rate stability? Two main motives inspired these moves and remained major reasons for the adoption of the euro:  

1.	 To enhance Europe’s role in the world monetary system. The events leading up to the collapse of the Bretton Woods system were accompanied by declining European confidence in the readiness of the United States to place its international monetary responsibilities ahead of its national interests (Chapter 19). By speaking with a single voice on monetary issues, EU countries hoped to defend more effectively their own economic interests in the face of an increasingly self-absorbed United States.   
2.	 To turn the European Union into a truly unified market. Even though the 1957 Treaty of Rome founding the EU had established a customs union, significant official barriers to the movements of goods and factors within Europe remained. A consistent goal of EU members has been to eliminate all such barriers and transform the EU into a huge unified market on the model of the United States, including the free movement of workers across internal borders. European officials believed, however, that exchange rate uncertainty, like official trade barriers, was a major factor reducing trade within Europe. They also feared that exchange rate swings causing large changes in intra-European relative prices would strengthen political forces hostile to free trade within Europe.  

The aspiration of a single European currency was first set out officially in 1970—and it was no coincidence that at the time, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates (which implied mutually fixed exchange rates among European countries) was fraying.1  

The key to understanding how Europe has come so far in both market and monetary unification lies in the continent’s war-torn history. After the end of World War II in 1945, many European leaders agreed that economic cooperation and integration among the former belligerents would be the best guarantee against a repetition of the 20th century’s two devastating wars. The result was a gradual ceding of national economic policy powers to centralized European Union governing bodies, such as the European Commission in Brussels, Belgium (the EU’s executive body), and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, Germany.  

Some Europeans argue that this governance structure became unwieldy and too distant from voters in member states, especially as the EU rapidly expanded eastward starting in 2004 to absorb nations of the former Soviet bloc. Mirroring these frustrations, and amid other EU tensions, British voters directed their government to negotiate the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU in a June 2016 referendum. The subsequent U.K. exit, referred to as “Brexit,” represents the first departure of a member country and a major setback for the European project.  

# BREXIT  

On June 23, 2016, British citizens voted on the Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?” To the surprise of many, nearly 52 percent of them voted “Leave.” After more than four decades of membership, Britain wanted a divorce—dubbed “Brexit”—from its Continental partners. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, stock markets across the world tumbled, and as you can see in the accompanying chart, the pound sterling plummeted.  

Not only did betting and financial markets, pundits, and economists alike mostly expect the “Remain” option to beat “Leave,” so did most businesses. Brexit therefore caught many of them by surprise. According to The Economist magazine, a pre-referendum survey by Germany’s industry federation found that 70 percent of firms didn’t have any contingency plans in the event of Brexit.2 As it turned out, neither did Her Majesty’s Government. In the months after the vote, Britain’s political leaders scrambled to figure out how to carry out the voters’ wishes.  

Perhaps this development should not have been quite so shocking. Britain’s relationship with the Continental European trade bloc has been ambivalent since its initial incarnation as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. For example, Britain did not join the euro, choosing instead to retain its own currency, a development that left the country feeling increasingly marginalized within the EU. Less than 30 months after its initial embrace of Europe in January 1973, the United Kingdom held a first referendum on leaving, with voters opting to remain by a two-to-one margin. Leaving decades later in 2020, after nearly five decades of deep integration between the British and Continental economies, would prove much more costly. Nonetheless, that is what British voters chose to do.

Why did British voters decide to leave? The reasons are complex, but a number of factors stand out. First and foremost was the desire to limit immigration from Eastern Europe and the benefits, such as medical care, the U.K. government must provide to immigrants under EU law. In the year ending March 2015, net migration into Britain was 330,000 (though not all migrants came from other EU countries). Many voters were angry owing to beliefs that immigrants were taking local jobs and crowding social services, although there is little evidence to back up such fears. (Indeed, regions that voted for Brexit tended to have far fewer immigrants than those voting to remain.) Another factor was the panoply of regulations from EU headquarters in Brussels, felt by many to be intrusive, overly detailed, and unnecessary to promote intra-EU trade. The very effective slogan of the campaign for the “Leave” position was “Take Back Control.”3  

Britain’s departure from the EU has required it to renegotiate its trade relationship not just with the remaining 27 EU countries but also with the rest of the world: While in the EU, its trade with non-EU partners was governed by agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of all its members. Another problem is the need to replace the body of EU regulations that, while arguably too detailed at times, were at least predictable. Sectors as diverse as airlines, universities, energy, pharmaceuticals, and ­telecommunications—even beekeepers—faced uncertainty regarding regulations, subsidies, and patents that could seriously hinder investment going forward. An extended and chaotic negotiation process between Britain and the EU27 finally led to ­Parliament approving a Withdrawal Agreement Bill in October 2019. Under the bill, Brexit took place on January 31, 2020, followed by an 11-month transition period during which Britain continued to follow EU rules and enjoy frictionless trade with other EU countries. The purpose of the transition period was to negotiate a permanent trading relationship.  

One key feature of the withdrawal agreement was a protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. The protocol set up a framework allowing the boundary between Northern Ireland (a part of the United Kingdom) and the Republic of Ireland to remain free of border controls—no matter what the eventual U.K.–EU trade relationship. A foundation of the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, which ended decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, was the full integration of economic activity on the Irish island, only possible because both parts belonged to the EU. Within the Good Friday framework, complete elimination of any physical border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland took on immense symbolic and practical significance. With the United Kingdom and the EU in separate customs and regulatory areas, however, how could they avoid some kind of border controls between the two parts of Ireland? The Irish protocol’s solution essentially moves the customs border off the island. It leaves Northern Ireland partially within the EU single market de facto, requiring administrative checks (essentially, a customs border) for trade between the island of Great Britain (encompassing England, Scotland, and Wales) and the island of Ireland. Without these checks, goods not subject to EU tariffs or health standards would be able to find their way into the EU market via Northern Ireland. For example, goods transiting from Great Britain to the  

Republic of Ireland via Northern Ireland are supposed to pay EU tariffs before they cross the Irish Sea. This requires some form of control procedures as goods reach the water’s edge. In short, the protocol avoids barriers on the Irish island itself, but at the cost of imposing them between ­Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.4  

The stringency of such barriers depends, of course, on the extent of trade frictions in the ultimate trade relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU. The United Kingdom’s negotiating goal has been to enjoy tariff- and quota-free trade with the EU. As 2020 passed, however, issues ranging from regulatory harmonization to dispute resolution to state aid to fishing rights remained in contention. As governments were swept up in their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis, it began to look increasingly likely that the year could end with only a very limited permanent trade agreement or with none at all. Under the latter outcome, Britain would simply trade with the EU under general World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, like most other non-EU countries. It would face tariffs and other trade barriers in its trade with the EU that would also disadvantage its financial sector, a large contributor to British GDP that enjoyed privileged access to other EU countries prior to Brexit. Britain’s integration into European supply chains, built up over nearly a half century, could have been undermined overnight.  

At virtually the last possible moment, around Christmas 2020, the United Kingdom and the EU finally reached an agreement on their permanent trading relationship. The British achieved tariffand quota-free trade, but with at least two hitches. First, tariffs and quotas were avoided on important components of manufacturing trade, thus giving some protection to European supply chains. British services, particularly financial services, are a very important element in exports to the EU, however, and these remained subject to regulatory barriers. Second, the agreement allows trade barriers to be imposed if U.K. and EU regulatory standards (for example, on the labor or environmental regulations that firms face) diverge too markedly, giving one partner an export-cost advantage. This feature of the agreement leaves costly uncertainty for exporters and importers.  

It is difficult to predict how costly the effects of Brexit will turn out to be under the new U.K.– EU trading relationship—especially because many features are left to be worked out over time. The lively pre-referendum debate over the economic costs of Brexit illustrated the difficulties of estimation. Early on after the Brexit referendum, the ­International Monetary Fund estimated that if the U.K. ended up trading under WTO rules, it would be 3.4 percent poorer in the long run than it would have been without Brexit. Perhaps ironically, a large share of these losses came from subtracting the contribution of immigrants to the British economy. The rest of the EU would have been 0.4 percent poorer under WTO rules, according to the IMF. Pro-Brexiters have accused the IMF of fear-mongering, but two years later, the British government itself estimated that the long-term losses to Britain from reverting to WTO rules would be 7.7 percent of GDP with no change in immigration policies, and 9.3 percent of GDP if inflows of European workers ceased. Keep in mind that these losses not only are large, they are permanent.5 The trade agreement reached at the end of 2020 will be far less costly than a “no-deal” outcome would have been, but will nonetheless leave the British economy considerably poorer than it would have been had it remained in the EU.  

# The European Monetary System, 1979–1998  

The immediate precursor to EMU on the road to European monetary unification was the European Monetary System (EMS). The eight original participants in the EMS’s exchange rate mechanism—France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands—began operating a formal network of mutually pegged exchange rates in March 1979. A complex set of EMS intervention arrangements worked to restrict the exchange rates of participating currencies within specified fluctuation margins.6  

The prospects for a successful fixed-rate area in Europe seemed bleak in early 1979, when recent yearly inflation rates ranged from Germany’s 2.7 percent to Italy’s 12.1 percent. Through a mixture of policy cooperation and realignment, however, the EMS fixed exchange rate club survived and even grew, adding Spain to its ranks in 1989, Britain in 1990, and Portugal early in 1992. Only in September 1992 did this growth suffer a sudden setback when Britain and Italy left the EMS exchange rate mechanism at the start of a protracted European currency crisis that forced the remaining members to retreat to very wide exchange rate margins.  

Several safety valves that initially helped reduce the frequency of such crises aided the EMS’s operation. Most exchange rates “fixed” by the EMS until August 1993 actually could fluctuate up or down by as much as 2.25 percent relative to an assigned par value. A few members were able to negotiate bands of $\pm6$ percent, making a greater sacrifice of exchange rate stability but gaining more room to choose their own monetary policies. In August 1993, EMS countries decided to widen nearly all of the bands to $\pm15$ percent under the pressure of speculative attacks.  

As another crucial safety valve, the EMS developed generous provisions for the extension of credit from strong- to weak-currency members. If the French franc (France’s former currency) depreciated too far against the deutsche mark (or DM, Germany’s former currency), Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, was expected to lend the Bank of France DM to sell for francs in the foreign exchange market.  

Finally, during the system’s initial years of operation several members (notably France and Italy) reduced the possibility of speculative attack by maintaining capital controls that directly limited domestic residents’ sales of home for foreign currencies.  

The EMS went through periodic currency realignments. In all, 11 realignments occurred between the start of the EMS in March 1979 and January 1987. Capital controls played the important role of shielding members’ reserves from speculators during these adjustments. Starting in 1987, however, a phased removal of capital controls by EMS countries increased the possibility of speculative attacks and thus reduced governments’ willingness openly to consider devaluing or revaluing. The removal of controls greatly reduced member countries’ monetary independence (a consequence of the monetary policy trilemma), but freedom of payments and capital movements within the EU had always been a key element of EU countries’ plan to turn Europe into a unified single market.  

For a period of five and a half years after January 1987, no adverse economic event was able to shake the EMS’s commitment to its fixed exchange rates. This state of affairs came to an end in 1992, however, as economic shocks caused by the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990 led to asymmetrical macroeconomic pressures in Germany and in its major EMS partners.  

The result of reunification was a boom in Germany and higher inflation, which Germany’s very inflation-averse central bank, the Bundesbank, resisted through sharply higher interest rates. (Germany’s very high inflation after both world wars left permanent scars.) Other EMS countries such as France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, however, were not simultaneously booming. By matching high German interest rates to hold their currencies fixed against Germany’s, they were unwillingly pushing their own economies into deep recession. The policy conflict between Germany and its partners led to a series of fierce speculative attacks on the EMS exchange parities starting in September 1992. By August 1993, as previously noted, the EMS was forced to retreat to very wide ( $\pm15$ percent) bands, which it kept in place until the introduction of the euro in 1999.  

# German Monetary Dominance and the Credibility Theory of the EMS  

Earlier, we identified two main reasons why the European Union sought to fix internal exchange rates: a desire to defend Europe’s economic interests more effectively on the world stage and the ambition to achieve greater internal economic unity.  

Europe’s experience of high inflation in the 1970s suggests an additional purpose that the EMS grew to fulfill. By fixing their exchange rates against the DM, the other EMS countries in effect imported the German Bundesbank’s credibility as an inflation fighter and thus discouraged the development of inflationary pressures at home— pressures they might otherwise have been tempted to accommodate through monetary expansion. This view, the credibility theory of the EMS, holds that the political costs of violating an international exchange rate agreement may be useful. They can restrain governments from depreciating their currencies to gain the short-term advantage of an economic boom at the long-term cost of higher inflation.  

Policy makers in inflation-prone EMS countries, such as Italy, clearly gained credibility by placing monetary policy decisions in the hands of the inflation-fearing  

German central bank. Devaluation was still possible, but only subject to EMS restrictions. Because politicians also feared that they would look incompetent to voters if they devalued, a government’s decision to peg to the DM reduced both its willingness and its ability to create domestic inflation.  

Added support for the credibility theory comes from the behavior of inflation rates relative to Germany’s, shown in Figure 21-2 for six of the other original EMS

members.8 As the figure shows, annual inflation rates gradually converged toward the low German levels.9  

# Market Integration Initiatives  

The EU countries have tried to achieve greater internal economic unity not only by fixing mutual exchange rates but also through direct measures to encourage the free flow of goods, services, and factors of production. Later in this chapter you will learn that the extent of product and factor market integration within Europe helps to determine how fixed exchange rates affect Europe’s macroeconomic stability. Europe’s efforts to raise microeconomic efficiency through direct market liberalization have also increased its preference for mutually fixed exchange rates on macroeconomic grounds.  

The process of market unification that began when the original EU members formed their customs union in 1957 was still incomplete 30 years later. In a number of industries, such as automobiles and telecommunications, trade within Europe was discouraged by government-imposed standards and registration requirements. Often government licensing or purchasing practices gave domestic producers virtual monopoly positions in their home markets. In the Single European Act of 1986 (which amended the founding Treaty of Rome), EU members took the crucial political steps to remove remaining internal barriers to trade, capital movements, and labor migration. Most important, they dropped the Treaty of Rome’s requirement of unanimous consent for measures related to market completion, so that one or two self-interested EU members could not block trade liberalization measures as in the past. Further moves toward market integration have followed. Financial capital, for example, now can move quite freely not only within the European Union but also between the European Union and outside jurisdictions.  

# European Economic and Monetary Union  

Countries can link their currencies together in many ways. We can imagine that the different modes of linkage form a spectrum, with the arrangements at one end requiring little sacrifice of monetary policy independence and those at the other end requiring giving up independence entirely.  

The early EMS, characterized by frequent currency realignments and widespread government control over capital movements, left some scope for national monetary policies. In 1989, a committee headed by Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, recommended a three-stage transition to a goal at the extreme end of the policy spectrum just described. That goal was an economic and monetary union (EMU), a European Union in which a single EU currency, managed by a sole central bank operating on behalf of all EU members, would replace national currencies.  

On December 10, 1991, the leaders of the EU countries met at the ancient Dutch city of Maastricht and agreed to propose for national ratification far-reaching amendments to the Treaty of Rome. These amendments were meant to place the EU squarely on the road to EMU. Included in the 250-page Maastricht Treaty was a provision calling for the introduction of a single European currency and a European Central Bank no later than January 1, 1999. By 1993, all 12 countries then belonging to the EU had ratified the Maastricht Treaty. The 16 countries that joined the EU afterward accepted the Treaty’s provisions upon joining (see Figure 21-1).10  

Why did the EU countries move away from the EMS and toward the much more ambitious goal of a single shared currency? There were four reasons:  

1.	 They believed a single EU currency would produce a greater degree of European market integration than fixed exchange rates by removing the threat of EMS currency realignments and eliminating the costs to traders of converting one EMS currency into another. The single currency was viewed as a necessary complement to plans for melding EU markets into a single, continent-wide market.   
2.	 Some EU leaders thought that Germany’s management of EMS monetary policy had placed a one-sided emphasis on German macroeconomic goals at the expense of its EMS partners’ interests. The European Central Bank that would replace the German Bundesbank under EMU would have to be more considerate of other countries’ problems, and it would automatically give those countries the same opportunity as Germany to participate in system-wide monetary policy decisions.   
3.	 Given the move to complete freedom of capital movements within the EU, there seemed to be little to gain, and much to lose, from keeping national currencies with fixed (but adjustable) parities rather than irrevocably locking parities through a single currency. Any system of fixed exchange rates among distinct national currencies would be subject to ferocious speculative attacks, as in 1992–1993. If Europeans wished to combine permanently fixed exchange rates with freedom of capital movements, a single currency was the best way to accomplish this.   
4.	 As previously noted, all of the EU countries’ leaders hoped the Maastricht Treaty’s provisions would guarantee the political stability of Europe. Beyond its purely economic functions, the single EU currency was intended as a potent symbol of Europe’s desire to place cooperation ahead of the national rivalries that often had led to war in the past. Under this scenario, the new currency would align the economic interests of individual European nations to create an overwhelming political constituency for peace on the continent.  

The Maastricht Treaty’s critics denied that EMU would have these positive effects and opposed the treaty’s provisions for vesting stronger governmental powers with the European Union. To these critics, EMU was symptomatic of a tendency for the European Union’s central institutions to ignore local needs, meddle in local affairs, and downgrade prized symbols of national identity (including, of course, national currencies). Germany’s citizens in particular, traumatized by memories of severe postwar inflations, feared that the new European Central Bank would not fight inflation as fiercely as their Bundesbank did.  

# The Euro and Economic Policy in the Euro Zone  

How were the initial members of EMU chosen, how are new members admitted, and what is the structure of the complex of financial and political institutions that govern economic policy in the euro zone? This section provides an overview.  

# The Maastricht Convergence Criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact  

The Maastricht Treaty requires EU countries to satisfy several macroeconomic convergence criteria prior to admission to EMU. Among these criteria are:  

1.	 The country’s inflation rate in the year before admission must be no more than 1.5 percent above the average rate of the three EU member states with the lowest inflation.   
2.	 The country must have maintained a stable exchange rate within the ERM without devaluing on its own initiative.   
3.	 The country must have a public-sector deficit no higher than 3 percent of its GDP (except in exceptional and temporary circumstances).   
4.	 The country must have a public debt that is below or approaching a reference level of 60 percent of its GDP.  

The treaty provides for the ongoing monitoring of criteria 3 and 4 mentioned previously by the European Commission even after admission to EMU, and for the levying of penalties on countries that violate these fiscal rules and do not correct situations of “excessive” deficits and debt. The surveillance and sanctions over high deficits and debts place national governments under constraints in the exercise of their national fiscal powers. For example, a highly indebted EMU country facing a national recession might be unable to use expansionary fiscal policy for fear of breaching the Maastricht limits—a possibly costly loss of policy autonomy, given the absence of a national monetary policy! In addition, a supplementary Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) negotiated by European leaders in 1997 tightened the fiscal straitjacket further. The SGP set out “the medium-term budgetary objective of positions close to balance or in surplus.” It also set a timetable for the imposition of financial penalties on countries that fail to correct situations of “excessive” deficits and debt promptly enough. What explains the macro­economic convergence criteria, the fear of high public debts, and the SGP? Before they would sign the Maastricht Treaty, low-inflation countries such as Germany wanted assurance that their EMU partners had learned to prefer an environment of low inflation and fiscal restraint. They feared that otherwise, the euro might be a weak currency, falling prey to the types of policies that have fueled French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and United Kingdom inflation at various points since the early 1970s. A highly indebted government that continues to borrow may find that the market demand for its bonds disappears—a nightmare scenario that finally came to pass for several European countries in the euro crisis starting in 2009. Another fear about EMU was that the new European Central Bank would face pressures to purchase government debt directly in such situations, thereby fueling money supply growth and inflation. Voters in traditionally low-inflation countries worried that prudent governments within EMU would be forced to pick up the tab for profligate governments that borrowed more than they could afford to repay. This was especially true in Germany, where taxpayers in the country’s western part were bearing the cost of absorbing the formerly Communist east. Consistent with this fear, the Maastricht Treaty also contained a “no bailout clause” prohibiting EU member countries from taking on other members’ debts.  

As EMU came closer in 1997, German public opinion therefore remained opposed to the euro. The German government demanded the SGP as a way of convincing domestic voters that the new European Central Bank would indeed produce low inflation and avoid bailouts. Ironically, because Germany (along with France) is one of the countries that was subsequently in violation of the Maastricht fiscal rules, the SGP was not enforced in practice during the euro’s first decade—even though later experience showed the concerns that motivated it to be valid, as we shall see.  

By May 1998, it was clear that 11 EU countries had satisfied the convergence criteria based on 1997 data and would be founding members of EMU: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece failed to qualify on any of the criteria in 1998, although it ultimately appeared to pass all of its tests and entered EMU on January 1, 2001. Since then, Slovenia (on January 1, 2007), Cyprus and Malta (both on January 1, 2008), the Slovak Republic (January 1, 2009), Estonia (January 1, 2011), Latvia (January 1, 2014), and Lithuania (January 1, 2015) also have joined the euro zone.  

# The European Central Bank and the Eurosystem  

The Eurosystem conducts monetary policy for the euro zone and consists of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt plus the 19 national central banks of the euro area, which now play roles analogous to those of the regional Federal Reserve banks in the United States. The Eurosystem makes decisions by votes of the governing council of the ECB, consisting of the six-member ECB executive board (including the president of the ECB) and the heads of the national central banks of the euro area. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) consists of the ECB plus all 28 EU central banks, including those of countries that do not use the euro. Like members of the Eurosystem, non-euro area central banks are committed to pursue domestic price stability as well as various forms of cooperation with the Eurosystem. Some countries chose to peg their currencies to the euro, most notably a group of 14 formerly French-ruled countries in West and Central Africa. In 1945, these countries have replaced the French franc with their own currencies, the West African CFA franc and the Central African CFA franc, because they did not want to follow the devaluation of the French franc at that time. Since then, they maintain a peg to the French franc (with a devaluation in 1994) and later to the Euro.11  

The authors of the Maastricht Treaty hoped to create an independent central bank free of the political influences that might lead to inflation.12 The treaty gives the ECB an overriding mandate to pursue price stability and includes many provisions intended to insulate monetary policy decisions from political influence. In addition, unlike any other central bank in the world, the ECB operates beyond the reach of any single national government. In the United States, for example, Congress could easily pass laws reducing the independence of the Federal Reserve. In contrast, while the ECB is required to brief the European Parliament regularly on its activities, the European Parliament has no power to alter the statute of the ECB and ESCB. That would require an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty approved by legislatures or voters in every member country of the EU. However, critics of the treaty argue that it goes too far in shielding the ECB from normal democratic processes.  

# The Revised Exchange Rate Mechanism  

For EU countries that are not yet members of EMU, a revised exchange rate mechanism— referred to as ERM 2—defines broad exchange rate zones against the euro ( $\pm15$ percent) and specifies reciprocal intervention arrangements to support these target zones. The EU viewed ERM 2 as necessary to discourage competitive devaluations against the euro by EU members outside the euro zone and to give would-be EMU entrants a way of satisfying the Maastricht Treaty’s exchange rate stability convergence criterion. Under ERM 2 rules, either the ECB or the national central bank of an EU member with its own currency can suspend euro intervention operations if they result in money supply changes that threaten to destabilize the domestic price level. In practice, ERM 2 is asymmetric, with peripheral countries pegging to the euro and adjusting passively to ECB decisions on interest rates.  

# The Theory of Optimum Currency Areas  

There is little doubt that the European monetary integration process has helped advance the political goals of its founders by giving the European Union a stronger position in international affairs. The survival and future development of the European monetary experiment depend more heavily, however, on its ability to help countries reach their economic goals. Here the picture is less clear because a country’s decision to fix its exchange rate can in principle lead to economic sacrifices as well as benefits.  

We saw in Chapter 19 that by changing its exchange rate, a country may succeed in cushioning the disruptive impact of various economic shocks. On the other hand, exchange rate flexibility can have potentially harmful effects, such as making relative prices less predictable or undermining the government’s resolve to keep inflation in check. To weigh the economic costs against the advantages of joining a group of countries with mutually fixed exchange rates, we need a framework for thinking systematically about the stabilization powers a country sacrifices and the gains in efficiency and credibility it may reap.  

In this section, we show that a country’s costs and benefits from joining a fixed exchange rate area such as the euro zone depend on how integrated its economy is with those of its potential partners. The analysis leading to this conclusion, which is known as the theory of optimum currency areas, predicts that fixed exchange rates are most appropriate for areas closely integrated through international trade and factor movements.13  

# Economic Integration and the Benefits of a Fixed Exchange Rate Area: The GG Schedule  

Consider how an individual country, for example, Norway, might approach the decision of whether to join an area of fixed exchange rates, for example, the euro zone. Our goal is to develop a simple diagram that clarifies Norway’s choice.  

We begin by deriving the first of two elements in the diagram, a schedule called $G G$ that shows how the potential gain to Norway from joining the euro zone depends on Norway’s trading links with that region. Let us assume that Norway is considering pegging its currency, the krone, to the euro.  

A major economic benefit of fixed exchange rates is that they simplify economic calculations and, compared to floating rates, provide a more predictable basis for decisions that involve international transactions. Imagine the time and resources American consumers and businesses would waste every day if each of the 50 United States had its own currency that fluctuated in value against the currencies of all the other states! Norway faces a similar disadvantage in its trade with the euro zone when it allows its krone to float against the euro. The monetary efficiency gain from joining the fixed exchange rate system equals the joiner’s savings from avoiding the uncertainty, confusion, and calculation and transaction costs that arise when exchange rates float.14 For example, the fixed exchange rate between the Euro and the CFA franc is said to facilitate trade between Europe and the 14 West and Central African countries that use the CFA franc.15  

In practice, it may be hard to attach a precise number to the total monetary efficiency gain Norway would enjoy if it pegged to the euro. We can be sure, however, that this gain will be higher if Norway trades a lot with euro zone countries. For example, if Norway’s trade with the euro zone amounts to 50 percent of its GNP while its trade with the United States amounts to only 5 percent of GNP, then, other things equal, a fixed krone/euro exchange rate clearly yields a greater monetary efficiency gain to Norwegian traders than a fixed krone/dollar rate. Similarly, the efficiency gain from a fixed krone/euro rate is greater when trade between Norway and the euro zone is extensive than when it is small.  

The monetary efficiency gain from pegging the krone to the euro will also be higher if factors of production can migrate freely between Norway and the euro area. Norwegians who invest in euro zone countries benefit when the returns on their investments are more predictable. Similarly, Norwegians who work in euro zone countries may benefit if a fixed exchange rate makes their wages more stable relative to Norway’s cost of living.  

Our conclusion is that a high degree of economic integration between a country and a fixed exchange rate area magnifies the monetary efficiency gain the country reaps when it fixes its exchange rate against the area’s currencies. The more extensive are crossborder trade and factor movements, the greater is the gain from a fixed cross-border exchange rate.  

The upward-sloping $_{G G}$ curve in Figure 21-3 shows the relation between a country’s degree of economic integration with a fixed exchange rate area and the monetary efficiency gain to the country from joining the area. The figure’s horizontal axis measures the extent to which Norway (the joining country in our example) is economically integrated into euro zone product and factor markets. The vertical axis measures the monetary efficiency gain to Norway from pegging to the euro. GG’s positive slope reflects the conclusion that the monetary efficiency gain a country gets by joining a fixed exchange rate area rises as its economic integration with the area increases.  

In our example, we have implicitly assumed that the larger exchange rate area, the euro zone, has a stable and predictable price level. If it does not, the greater variability in Norway’s price level that would follow a decision to join the exchange rate area would likely offset any monetary efficiency gain a fixed exchange rate might provide. A different problem arises if Norway’s commitment to fix the krone’s exchange rate is not fully believed by economic actors. In this situation, some exchange rate uncertainty would remain and Norway would therefore enjoy a smaller monetary efficiency gain. If the euro zone’s price level is stable and Norway’s exchange rate commitment is firm, however, the main conclusion follows: When Norway pegs to the euro, it gains from the stability of its currency against the euro, and this efficiency gain is greater the more closely tied are Norway’s markets with euro zone markets.  

# FIGURE 21-3 The GG Schedule

Earlier in this chapter, we learned that a country may wish to peg its exchange rate to an area of price stability to import the anti-inflationary resolve of the area’s monetary authorities. When the economy of the pegging country is well integrated with that of the low-inflation area, however, low domestic inflation is easier to achieve. The reason is that close economic integration leads to international price convergence and therefore lessens the scope for independent variation in the pegging country’s price level. This argument provides another reason why high economic integration with a fixed exchange rate area enhances a country’s gain from membership.  

# Economic Integration and the Costs of a Fixed Exchange Rate Area: The LL Schedule  

Membership in an exchange rate area may involve costs as well as benefits, even when the area has low inflation. These costs arise because a country that joins an exchange rate area gives up its ability to use the exchange rate and monetary policy for the purpose of stabilizing output and employment. This economic stability loss from joining, like the country’s monetary efficiency gain, is related to the country’s economic integration with its exchange rate partners. We can derive a second schedule, the $L L$ schedule, that shows the relationship graphically.  

In Chapter 19’s discussion of the relative merits of fixed and floating exchange rates, we concluded that when the economy is disturbed by a change in the output market (that is, by a shift in the $D D$ schedule), a floating exchange rate has an advantage over a fixed rate: It automatically cushions the economy’s output and employment by allowing an immediate change in the relative price of domestic and foreign goods. Furthermore, you will recall from Chapter 18 that when the exchange rate is fixed, purposeful stabilization is more difficult to achieve because monetary policy has no power at all to affect domestic output. Given these two conclusions, we would expect changes in the $D D$ schedule to have more severe effects on an economy in which the monetary authority is required to fix the exchange rate against a group of foreign currencies. The extra instability caused by the fixed exchange rate is the economic stability loss.16  

To derive the $L L$ schedule, we must understand how the extent of Norway’s economic integration with the euro zone will affect the size of this loss in economic stability. ­Imagine that Norway is pegging to the euro and that there is a fall in the aggregate demand for Norway’s output—a leftward shift of Norway’s $D D$ schedule. If the $D D$ schedules of the other euro zone countries happen simultaneously to shift to the left, the euro will simply depreciate against outside currencies, providing the automatic stabilization we studied in the previous chapter. Norway has a serious problem only when it alone faces a fall in demand—for example, if the world demand for oil, one of Norway’s main exports, drops.  

How will Norway adjust to this shock? Since nothing has happened to budge the euro, to which Norway is pegged, its krone will remain stable against all foreign currencies. Thus, full employment can return only after a period of costly slump during which the prices of Norwegian goods and the wages of Norwegian workers fall.  

How does the severity of this slump depend on the level of economic integration between the Norwegian economy and those of the EMU countries? The answer is that greater integration implies a shallower slump and therefore a less costly adjustment to the adverse shift in $D D.$ There are two reasons for this reduction in the cost of adjustment: First, if Norway has close trading links with the euro zone, a small reduction in its prices will lead to an increase in euro zone demand for Norwegian goods that is large relative to Norway’s output. Thus, full employment can be restored fairly quickly. Second, if Norway’s labor and capital markets are closely meshed with those of its euro zone neighbors, unemployed workers can easily move abroad to find work, and domestic capital can be shifted to more profitable uses in other countries. The ability of factors to migrate abroad thus reduces the severity of unemployment in Norway and the fall in the rate of return available to investors.17  

Notice that our conclusions also apply to a situation in which Norway experiences an increase in demand for its output (a rightward shift of $D D$ ). If Norway is tightly integrated with euro zone economies, a small increase in Norway’s price level, combined with some movement of foreign capital and labor into Norway, quickly eliminates the excess demand for Norwegian products.18  

Closer trade links between Norway and countries outside the euro zone will also aid the country’s adjustment to Norwegian $_{D D}$ shifts that are not simultaneously experienced by the euro zone. However, greater trade integration with countries outside the euro zone is a double-edged sword, with negative as well as positive implications for macroeconomic stability. The reason is that when Norway pegs the krone to the euro, euro zone disturbances that change the euro’s exchange rate will have more powerful effects on Norway’s economy when its trading links with noneuro countries are more extensive. The effects would be analogous to an increase in the size of movements in Norway’s $D D$ curve and would raise Norway’s economic stability loss from pegging to the euro. In any case, these arguments do not change our earlier conclusion that Norway’s stability loss from fixing the krone/euro exchange rate falls as the extent of its economic integration with the euro zone rises.  

An additional consideration that we have not yet discussed strengthens the argument that the economic stability loss to Norway from pegging to the euro is lower when Norway and the euro zone engage in a large volume of trade. Since imports from the euro zone make up a large fraction of Norwegian workers’ consumption in this case, changes in the krone/euro exchange rate may quickly affect nominal Norwegian wages, reducing any impact on employment. A depreciation of the krone against the euro, for example, causes a sharp fall in Norwegians’ living standards when imports from the euro zone are substantial; workers are thus likely to demand higher nominal wages from their employers to compensate for the loss. In this situation, the additional macroeconomic stability Norway gets from a floating exchange rate is small, so the country has little to lose by fixing the krone/euro exchange rate.  

We conclude that a high degree of economic integration between a country and the fixed exchange rate area that it joins reduces the resulting economic stability loss due to output market disturbances.  

The $L L$ schedule shown in Figure 21-4 summarizes this conclusion. The figure’s horizontal axis measures the joining country’s economic integration with the fixed exchange rate area; the vertical axis, the country’s economic stability loss. As we have seen, $L L$ has a negative slope because the economic stability loss from pegging to the area’s currencies falls as the degree of economic interdependence rises.  

# The Decision to Join a Currency Area: Putting the GG and LL Schedules Together  

Figure 21-5 combines the $G G$ and $L L$ schedules to show how Norway should decide whether to fix the krone’s exchange rate against the euro. The figure implies that Norway should do so if the degree of economic integration between Norwegian markets and those of the euro zone is at least equal to $\theta_{1}$ , the integration level determined by the intersection of $G G$ and $L L$ at point 1.  

Let’s see why Norway should peg to the euro if its degree of economic integration with euro zone markets is at least $\theta_{1}$ . Figure 21-5 shows that for levels of economic integration below $\theta_{1}$ , the $G G$ schedule lies below the $L L$ schedule. Thus, the loss Norway would suffer from greater output and employment instability after joining exceeds the monetary efficiency gain, and the country would do better to stay out.  

# FIGURE 21-4  

# The LL Schedule  

The downward-sloping LL schedule shows that a country’s economic stability loss from joining a fixed exchange rate area falls as the country’s economic integration with the area rises.

# FIGURE 21-5  

# Deciding When to Peg the Exchange Rate  

The intersection of GG and $L L$ at point 1 determines a critical level of economic integration, $\theta_{1},$ between a fixed exchange rate area and a country considering whether to join. At any level of integration above $\theta_{1},$ the decision to join yields positive net economic benefits to the joining country.  

![](images/39eebdcb60350bf3f47a6d4d6827e2065b7a993d46a782740431d2e9a1e0dcca.jpg)  

Degree of economic integration between the joining country and the exchange rate area  

When the degree of integration is $\theta_{1}$ or higher, however, the monetary efficiency gain measured by $G G$ is greater than the stability sacrifice measured by $L L$ , and pegging the krone’s exchange rate against the euro results in a net gain for Norway. Thus the intersection of $G G$ and $L L$ determines the minimum integration level (here, $\partial_{1,}$ ) at which Norway will desire to peg its currency to the euro.  

The $G G\mathrm{-}L L$ framework has important implications about how changes in a country’s economic environment affect its willingness to peg its currency to an outside currency area. Consider, for example, an increase in the size and frequency of sudden shifts in the demand for the country’s exports. As shown in Figure 21-6, such a change pushes $L L^{1}$ upward to $L L^{2}$ . At any level of economic integration with the currency area, the  

# FIGURE 21-6  

# An Increase in Output Market Variability  

A rise in the size and frequency of country-specific disturbances to the joining country’s product markets shifts the $L L$ schedule upward from $L L^{1}$ to $L L^{2}$ because for a given level of economic integration with the fixed exchange rate area, the country’s economic stability loss from pegging its exchange rate rises. The shift in $L L$ raises the critical level of economic integration at which the exchange rate area is joined to $\theta_{2}$ .  

![](images/f46da55f8f728506f5d631680a5f7a4d040edef9c27b8ff819fdecd8e0fad1f6.jpg)  

Degree of economic integration between the joining country and the exchange rate area  

extra output and unemployment instability the country suffers by fixing its exchange rate is now greater. As a result, the level of economic integration at which it becomes worthwhile to join the currency area rises to $\theta_{2}$ (determined by the intersection of $G G$ and $L L^{2}$ at point 2). Other things equal, increased variability in their product markets makes countries less willing to enter fixed exchange rate areas—a prediction that helps explain why the oil price shocks after 1973 made countries unwilling to revive the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates (Chapter 19).  

# What Is an Optimum Currency Area?  

The GG-LL model we have developed suggests a theory of the optimum currency area. Optimum currency areas are groups of regions with economies closely linked by trade in goods and services and by factor mobility. This result follows from our finding that a fixed exchange rate area will best serve the economic interests of each of its members if the degree of output and factor trade among the included economies is high.  

This perspective helps us understand, for example, why it may make sense for the United States, Japan, and Europe to allow their mutual exchange rates to float. Even though these regions trade with each other, the extent of that trade is modest compared with regional GNPs, and interregional labor mobility is low.  

# Other Important Considerations  

While the GG-LL model is useful for organizing our thinking about optimum currency areas, it is not the whole story. At least three other elements affect our evaluation of the euro currency area’s past and prospective performances.  

Similarity of Economic Structure  The GG-LL model tells us that extensive trade with the rest of the currency area makes it easier for a member to adjust to product market disturbances that affect it and its currency partners differently. But it does not tell us what factors will reduce the frequency and size of member-specific product market shocks.  

A key element in minimizing such disturbances is similarity in economic structure, especially in the types of products produced. Euro zone countries, for example, are not entirely dissimilar in manufacturing structure, as evidenced by the very high volume of intra-industry trade—trade in similar products—within Europe (see Chapter 8). There are also important differences, however. The countries of northern Europe are better endowed with capital and skilled labor than the countries in Europe’s south, and EU products that make intensive use of low-skill labor thus are likely to come from Portugal, Spain, Greece, or southern Italy. The different export patterns of northern and southern European countries create more opportunities for asymmetric shocks.  

We can view greater structural dissimilarity between a country and its potential currency union partners as shifting the $L L$ schedule upward, raising the degree of economic integration required before membership in the currency union becomes a good idea.  

Fiscal Federalism  Another consideration in evaluating a currency area is its ability to transfer economic resources from members with healthy economies to those suffering economic setbacks. In the United States, for example, states faring poorly relative to the rest of the nation automatically receive support from Washington in the form of welfare benefits and other federal transfer payments that ultimately come out of the taxes other states pay. In addition, the federal tax revenues sent back to Washington automatically decline when the local economy suffers. Such fiscal federalism can help offset the economic stability loss due to fixed exchange rates, as it does in the United States. More fiscal federalism shifts the $L L$ curve downward.19 When the euro was launched, it was hoped that closer fiscal cooperation between the euro zone countries will follow soon. The current scale of fiscal transfers within the euro zone, however, is by far not sufficient to overcome the radical economic imbalances between its members. For further discussion on the current shortcomings of the Euro, see Case Study “Is Europe an Optimum Currency Area?”.  

Banking Union  Suppose that countries in an area of mutually fixed exchange rates maintain national control over banking regulation, supervision, and resolution but at the same time allow freedom of financial transactions across borders, including for banks (and other financial institutions). As we saw in Chapter 20, the financial trilemma implies that their financial systems will be less stable than with centralized, supra-national control over financial regulatory policy.  

The problem is even worse than usual in an area of fixed exchange rates, however. If member countries print money in large quantities while acting as lenders of last resort, for example, they may run out of international reserves and find themselves in a currency crisis (Chapter 18). Each central bank will therefore be reluctant to act as LLR for its domestic banks, and public perceptions of this reluctance could, in itself, encourage bank runs and thereby raise the risk of financial instability and currency crises. In terms of our GG-LL framework, less area-wide unification of banking policy raises the $L L$ schedule. As we shall see, this problem has been central to the recent crisis in the euro area, although the preceding example based on the central bank’s LLR function works in the EMU context in a more complex fashion.  

As the financial trilemma suggests, one way to maintain fixed exchange rates, while retaining national control over financial policy, is to prohibit cross-border capital movements. This is not an option within a currency union such as EMU, with a single shared central bank, because the central bank’s interest rate policy could not be transmitted to all the member states if they prevented cross-border borrowing and lending.  

# Is Europe an Optimum Currency Area?  

The critical question for judging the economic success of EMU is whether Europe itself makes up an optimum currency area. A nation’s gains and losses from pegging its currency to an exchange rate area are hard to measure numerically, but by combining our theory with information on actual economic performance, we can evaluate the claim that Europe, most of which is likely to adopt or peg to the euro, is an optimum currency area.  

![](images/a1841a1596ccb04c55976cb0ac19853a12532da245c45c644bfda1308dab9a7a.jpg)  

# THE EXTENT OF INTRA-EUROPEAN TRADE  

Our earlier discussion suggested that a country is more likely to benefit from joining a currency area if the area’s economy is closely integrated with the country’s. We can judge the overall degree of economic integration by looking at the integration of product markets, that is, the extent of trade between the joining country and the currency area, and at the integration of factor markets, that is, the ease with which labor and capital can migrate between the joining country and the currency area.  

In January 1999, at the time of the euro’s launch, most EU members exported from 10 to 20 percent of their output to other EU members. That number is far larger than the extent of EU-U.S. trade. While the average volume of intra-EU trade has increased somewhat since the late 1990s, however, it remains below the level of trade between regions of the United States. If we take trade relative to GNP as a measure of goods-market integration, the GG-LL model of the last section suggests that a joint float of Europe’s currencies against those of the rest of the world is a better strategy for EU members than a fixed dollar/euro exchange rate would be. The extent of intra-European trade, however, is not large enough to convey an overwhelming reason for believing that the European Union itself is an optimum currency area.  

When the euro arrived, supporters entertained high hopes that it would promote trade substantially within the currency union. These hopes were bolstered by an influential econometric study by Andrew K. Rose, of the National University of Singapore, who suggested that on average, members of currency unions trade three times more with each other than with nonmember countries—even after one controls for other determinants of trade flows. A more recent study of EU trade data by Richard Baldwin, of Geneva’s Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, greatly scaled back these expectations as they applied to the euro zone’s early experience.20 Baldwin estimated that by the mid-2000s, the euro had increased the mutual trade levels of its users only by about 9 percent, with most of the effect taking place in the euro’s first year, 1999. But he also concluded that Britain, Denmark, and Sweden, which did not adopt the euro, saw their trade with euro zone countries increase by about 7 percent at the same time. These EU countries therefore would gain little more if they adopted the euro.  

EU measures aimed at promoting market integration following the Single European Act of 1986 probably have helped to bolster intra-EU trade. For some goods (such as consumer electronics), there has been considerable price convergence across EU countries, but for others, among them cars, similar items still can sell for widely differing prices in different European locations. One hypothesis about the persistence of price differentials that is favored by euro enthusiasts is that multiple currencies made big price discrepancies possible, but these were bound to disappear under the single currency. Has the euro itself contributed to market integration? In a careful study of European price behavior since 1990, economists Charles Engel of the University of Wisconsin and John Rogers of the Federal Reserve find that intra-European price discrepancies indeed decreased over the 1990s. They find no evidence, however, of further price convergence after the euro’s introduction in 1999.21  

On balance, considering both the price and the quantity evidence to date, it seems unlikely that the combination of Single European Act reforms and the single currency has yet turned the euro zone into an optimum currency area.  

# HOW MOBILE IS EUROPE’S LABOR FORCE?  

The main barriers to labor mobility within Europe are no longer due to border controls. Differences in language and culture discourage labor movements between ­European countries to a greater extent than is true, for example, between regions of the United States. In a 1990 econometric study comparing unemployment patterns in U.S. regions with those in EU countries, Barry Eichengreen of the University of ­California–Berkeley found that differences in regional unemployment rates are smaller and less persistent in the United States than are the differences between national unemployment rates in the European Union.22 Figure 21-7 shows the evolution of selected EU unemployment rates since the early 1990s. In the next section, we will discuss how the evident divergence after the late 2000s relates to the concurrent crisis in the euro area.  

Even within European countries, labor mobility appears limited, partly because of government regulations. For example, the requirement in some countries that workers establish residence before receiving unemployment benefits makes it harder for unemployed workers to seek jobs in regions that are far from their current homes. Table 21-2 presents evidence on the frequency of regional labor movement in three of the largest EU countries, as compared with that in the United States. These data must be interpreted with caution because of their vintage and because the definition

of “region” differs from country to country. However, studies that are more recent also suggest that in a typical year, Americans remain more footloose than Europeans, and that labor mobility within Europe remains limited.23  

There is some evidence that the extreme unemployment divergences visible in Figure 21-7 promoted more labor mobility, as did the prospect of migrating toward higher living standards. But to some degree this is a mixed blessing. The workers who tend to be most mobile are younger and more productive, while those who remain are closer to retirement. This migration pattern can deprive governments of the tax base they need to fund pension and health benefits, thereby worsening fiscal deficits in countries already hit hard by deep recession. A case in point is the steady migration of young people from formerly Soviet countries like Poland to west European countries like Ireland and (until Brexit) the United Kingdom.24  

# OTHER CONSIDERATIONS  

Previously, we identified three additional considerations (alongside economic integration) that are relevant to the costs and benefits of forming a currency area: similarity of structure, fiscal federalism, and the unification of policy toward bank and financial market stability. On all three counts, the EU comes up short, reinforcing the hypothesis that the EU is not an optimum currency area.  

As we have noted, EU members have very different export mixes and therefore different vulnerabilities to identical economic disturbances. For example, Portugal competes with China in export markets, whereas China is a big destination market for German machine tools. Thus, higher Chinese growth has very different effects on the Portuguese and German economies.  

Regarding fiscal federalism, it is quite limited in the EU, which has no substantial centralized fiscal capacity. Therefore, inflows of budgetary resources from currency-union partners do not offset country-specific shocks. Finally, regarding financial stability policy, the Maastricht Treaty left virtually all powers at the national level, giving the Eurosystem no explicit authority to oversee financial markets. The story of the euro crisis, to which we turn next, is intimately related to these last two shortcomings in the architecture underlying the single currency— and has given rise to (so far limited) attempts to overcome them.  

# The Euro Crisis and the Future of EMU  

Like the rest of the world, the euro area suffered in the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 (described in Chapters 19 and 20). It was only toward the end of the acute phase of the global financial crisis, however—late in 2009—that the euro zone entered a new crisis so severe as to threaten its continuing existence. In this section we help you to understand the nature of the euro crisis, the ways in which it has been managed so far, and the implications for the future of EMU.  

# Origins of the Crisis  

The spark that ignited the crisis came from an unlikely source: Greece, which accounted for only 3 percent of the euro area’s output. However, the spark landed on a broad and deep pile of very dry tinder, assembled during the period of low interest rates, real estate speculation, and heightened financial-market growth that preceded the global financial crisis.  

The Tinder  The global assets of internationally active banks grew rapidly in the years leading up to the 2007–2009 crisis, but especially so for European banks, and especially banks in the euro zone. The asset sides of their balance sheets grew through purchases of U.S. credit-backed products but also through lending to other euro zone countries, including purchases of government debt and lending to finance consumption spending, housing investment, and mortgage lending. This lending helped to fuel, and in turn was fueled by, massive housing booms, especially in Ireland and Spain. An important factor promoting these developments, as you learned in Chapter 19, was an environment of very low global interest rates, which induced banks to take greater risks in search of profits.  

As a result of this credit expansion, bank assets grew to very large levels compared to the GDPs of the banks’ home countries. Table 21-3 illustrates the positions of some large euro area banks at the end of 2011; balance sheets were even larger relative to output in 2007. In a number of countries individual banks had become “too big to save” based on the resources the home government could raise from the home economy alone; and the government’s predicament would of course be much worse in a systemic crisis, with several banks in trouble at the same time. For example, if a failed bank’s assets are equal to GDP and the government must inject capital equal to 5 percent of assets to restore the bank to solvency, then the government would have to issue debt or raise taxes by 5 percent of GDP—a very big fraction—to keep the bank in operation. And what if several large banks all fail at the same time?  

With exchange-rate risk now eliminated between euro area countries, government bond yields moved closer to equality. In addition, markets seemed convinced that no European government would ever default on its debts—after all, no advanced country anywhere had done so since the late 1940s. (A default occurs when a debtor does not make the debt payments it has promised to creditors. The event is called a sovereign default when the debtor is a country’s government.) As a result, spreads between the governments judged most creditworthy by ratings agencies such as Moody’s (for example, Germany) and the least creditworthy (for example, Greece) became very small—often on the order of 25 basis points or below (see Figure 21-8). This development encouraged more spending and borrowing in countries including Greece, Portugal, and Spain.

# Nominal Government Borrowing Spreads over Germany  

Euro countries’ long-term government bond yields converged to Germany’s level as they prepared to join the euro. The yields began to diverge again with the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 and moved sharply apart after the euro crisis broke out late in 2009.

With higher spending, however, also came higher inflation relative to the German level. As a result, countries on the euro zone periphery—Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, and Greece—all saw their currencies appreciate in real terms, not only relative to Germany, but relative to all of their trading partners, both within and outside EMU. Figure 21-9, which reports European Commission indexes of real appreciation with respect to GDP deflators, shows how all of these countries lost competitiveness after the early 2000s, most notably the two countries with the most extreme housing booms, Ireland and Spain. With higher inflation than Germany’s, but essentially equal bond rates, these countries had lower real interest rates during the mid-2000s, a factor that spurred spending and inflation even further (see Figure 21-10 for real interest rates).25 As a result, while Germany had

growing current account surpluses, the peripheral countries had growing deficits, in some cases very large ones, as Table 21-4 shows. So external debts built up, raising the question of how these countries would ever generate the net export surpluses necessary to repay foreign creditors. The dilemma became more acute once growth slowed owing to the 2007–2009 global crisis. Because currency devaluation by individual euro area countries was not an option to spur net exports, it became increasingly likely that the adjustment to a more competitive real exchange rate would require a period of low inflation or even deflation, in all likelihood accompanied by significant unemployment due to the rigidity of labor and product markets. Among other negative effects, protracted recession would weaken banks.  

In these circumstances, countries with conventional fixed exchange rates might well have fallen victim to speculative currency attacks, forcing the government to devalue. In EMU, however, countries do not have their own currencies, so conventional attacks are not possible. Nonetheless, a different sort of speculation set in, working through bank runs and government debt markets. The effects were devastating.  

The Spark  The 2007–2009 crisis certainly caused headaches in the euro zone. Some banks were in trouble due to their exposure to U.S. real estate markets. Also troublesome

were exposures to European housing markets, which began to fall following the U.S. example (and with Ireland leading the way). But markets had few fears about the creditworthiness of euro zone governments until Greece’s intractable fiscal problems became apparent late in 2008. This was the spark that ignited the tinder of overextended banks and uncompetitive, indebted economies.  

The crisis began when a new Greek government was elected in October 2009. Very quickly, the new government announced some bad news: The Greek fiscal deficit stood at  

![](images/27150fd2def8bf45c3d642effa75a73a5fb53c2594045ff073bafc46fc65bfd5.jpg)  

12.7 percent of GDP, more than double the numbers announced by the previous government. Apparently the previous government had been misreporting its economic statistics for years, and the public debt actually amounted to more than 100 percent of GDP.  

Holders of Greek bonds, including many banks within the euro zone, began to worry about the Greek government’s ability to close its yawning deficit and repay its debts. In December 2009, the major rating agencies all downgraded Greek government debt. (As Figure 21-8 shows, the Greek government’s borrowing spread ver German bonds rose to levels much higher than those seen in late 2008 and early 2009, when global financial markets had been in turmoil over the fallout from the subprime crisis.) The Greek government announced harsh budget cuts and raised some taxes in the first months of 2010, but was soon faced with street protests and strikes. Further downgrades followed and Greek borrowing costs soared, making it even harder for the country to repay creditors. Investors began to worry that other deficit countries might face problems similar to those of Greece. The figure shows that borrowing costs for Portugal and Ireland, and even for two larger countries, Spain and Italy, came under pressure. World stock markets plunged as the prospect of a much wider financial crisis in Europe grew.  

How did the EU deal with the Greek crisis? A bailout of Greece by richer EU countries would have quelled the market turmoil, but that was exactly the outcome that countries like Germany had wished to avoid when they negotiated the Maastricht Treaty and the SGP. In mid-March 2010, euro zone finance ministers declared their intention to help Greece but provided no details of what they planned to do. With the EU unable to take concrete action, the crisis snowballed, and the value of the euro fell in the foreign exchange markets.  

Finally, in mid-April 2010, euro zone countries, working with the IMF, agreed on a €110 billion loan package for Greece. But by this time, the panic over government debt had spread, and the Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian governments (following what Ireland had already undertaken late in 2008) were proposing their own deficit-reduction measures in an effort to keep borrowing spreads from rising to Greek levels. Fearing a continental meltdown, the euro zone’s leaders embedded the Greek support within a broader European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), with funding of €750 billion provided by its own borrowing from markets, the European Commission, and the IMF. (The EFSF was explicitly temporary, but was replaced by a permanent European Stability Mechanism, or ESM, in October 2012.) The ECB then reversed a policy it had earlier announced and began to purchase the bonds of troubled euro zone debtor countries, sparking accusations that it was violating the spirit of the Maastricht Treaty by rewarding fiscal excesses. In fact, the ECB’s motivation was to avoid a banking panic by supporting the prices of assets widely held by European banks.  

Greek borrowing costs remained high, and soon Ireland’s market borrowing rates rose sharply as it became clear that the government’s cost of supporting shaky Irish banks would amount to a large fraction of GDP. Late in 2010, Ireland negotiated a €67.5 billion EFSF loan package with the troika consisting of the European Commission, ECB, and IMF. Portugal negotiated a €78 billion troika loan in May 2011.26 Both loans, like the Greek loan, came with conditions requiring the recipients to slash government budgets and institute structural economic reforms (such as labor-market deregulation). The troika was in charge of monitoring compliance.  

# Self-Fulfilling Government Default and the “Doom Loop”  

Why did market panic develop and spread so quickly? The contentious debate surrounding the initial Greek package made it clear that the northern European countries such as Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands had only a very limited willingness to underwrite the borrowing of countries like Greece facing unfavorable market conditions, either directly or indirectly through support for ECB bond purchases. Some politicians from northern Europe had spoken openly about default by Greece or even about the possibility that it would exit the euro. Thus, sovereign default on Greek debt, even though EU officials initially denied it as a possibility, appeared eminently possible, as did default by other countries (such as Portugal) with rapidly growing government debts.  

The fear of default was a particular problem of the euro area: The government of the United States can always print dollars to pay off its debts, and so is very unlikely to default, but countries using the euro cannot, since the decision to print euros rests with the ECB, not national governments. (This is why Greece, Portugal, and Ireland were in the anomalous position of borrowing euros—their own currency—from the IMF.) The possibility of default gives rise to a self-fulfilling dynamic that is analogous to a bank run (as discussed in Chapter 20) or a self-fulfilling currency crisis (as discussed in Chapter 18): If markets expect a default, they will charge the borrowing government very high interest rates, and if it is unable to raise taxes or cut spending sufficiently, it will be forced to miss debt repayments and therefore it will default. This is exactly what happened in the euro area.27  

Because bank balance sheets had become so big, the weakened state of the euro countries’ banks strongly reinforced the likelihood of government default. Countries needing to support their banking systems with infusions of public money had to borrow the money, leading to big increases in public debt levels and heightened market fears of default. ­Figure 21-11 shows the evolution of public debts (as a ratio to GDP) in the euro area. While Greece had by far the largest debt (reaching a staggering 180 percent of GDP by 2011), you can see that other countries’ debts were increasing rapidly, fueled partly, in several cases, by the need to bail out banks. Ireland provides the most dramatic example, with debt rising from only 24 percent of GDP in 2007 to almost 90 percent in 2010, driven not only by recession but by a bailout of the banks that had driven the Irish property boom.28  

To make matters worse, the perilous state of each government’s credit, in turn, weakened the solvency of domestic banks. For one thing, banks were heavily invested in their governments’ bonds, so when those bonds’ prices fell, bank assets and bank capital were reduced. In addition, banks’ lenders (including depositors) understood that if the government itself could not obtain cash, it might be unable to make good on promises to support banks, for example, through injections of public capital or deposit insurance.  

Economists call the two-way feedback from bank distress to government borrowing problems a doom loop by economists. Owing to the doom loop, private money fled from banks in countries where the government was having trouble borrowing. These countries experienced a sudden stop in private lending, and to keep their banks from collapsing, the ECB had to engage in lender of last resort operations on a massive scale. In effect, the euro zone’s financial market became segmented along national lines, with the creditworthiness of banks in the weaker countries judged by the creditworthiness of their governments. Firms and households in those countries faced higher interest rates, if they could borrow at all.  

Because of fiscal cutbacks and the credit squeeze, output plummeted and unemployment soared. Many observers questioned whether the austerity programs included in governments’ financial support packages, and being practiced more generally in the EU, were actually helping in reducing public debts, especially when implemented by several neighboring countries simultaneously.  

# A Broader Crisis and Policy Responses  

Even after its initial rescue package, Greece proved unable to put its public debt onto a sustainable path. European leaders began openly to discuss the need for mechanisms that would allow insolvent countries to restructure their debt in the future. With officially sanctioned default now on the table, Italy’s bond spreads rose sharply in the second half of 2011. Italy was much bigger than Greece, Ireland, or Portugal and its fiscal problems were too big to be addressed without a much bigger budgetary commitment from its euro zone partners. Borrowing costs for Spain, another large country, had also been edging up in view of its very big banking sector, which had been seriously weakened by the country’s housing collapse.  

In March 2012, Greece finally did restructure its government debt, imposing big losses on private bond holders. However, the country’s overall debt fell only slightly (Figure 21-11). By then, much of the debt was held officially (notably by the ECB). In June 2012, euro area finance ministers extended to Spain an ESM loan potentially as big as €100 billion to cover recapitalization of its ailing banks. Despite these developments, Greece and Spain remained in turmoil.

# Gross Public Debt to GDP Ratios in the Euro Area  

Public debts in the euro area grew rapidly after 2007, in part due to the need for governments to support their weak banks.

In the face of the ongoing turbulence, euro zone leaders launched two key initiatives, one regarding fiscal policy and one regarding banking policy unification. Germany sponsored a Fiscal Stability Treaty for EU countries, under which signatories commit themselves to amend domestic legislation in a way that produces government budgets that are more nearly in balance. The treaty, an updated and more stringent version of the SGP, was motivated by similar concerns and reflected the official German position that the main cause of the crisis was the fiscal misbehavior of national governments. It came into force for the 16 countries that had signed it at the start of 2013.  

Critics of the Fiscal Stability Treaty pointed out that countries such as Ireland and Spain had favorable fiscal indicators, with falling levels of debt relative to GDP, prior to the crisis (Figure 21-11). While the German diagnosis described Greece, other countries’ debts exploded because their banking systems melted down, and the German strategy did nothing to improve bank supervision, or to break the doom loop between banks and sovereign governments. As in our discussion of optimum currency areas, a closer banking union would be needed in order to stabilize the euro zone.  

This second direction also was pursued by EU leaders, who met in June 2012 and directed the European Commission to prepare a blueprint for a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) with powers to police banks throughout the euro zone. The leaders also recommended that once the SSM was in place, the ESM should have the power to recapitalize banks directly, with any resulting borrowing showing up as a liability of the ESM, that is, as a joint liability of the euro zone and not of any member government, regardless of where the recapitalized banks reside. This important recommendation was intended to reduce the force of the doom loop at the national level, but it made some governments uneasy at the prospect of being forced to bail out banks in other countries. In response to the summit directive, the Commission in September 2012 recommended a three-pronged approach to banking union, meant to centralize financial supervision, deposit insurance, and the resolution (that is, the reorganization or sale) of insolvent banks within the euro area. These measures, as just noted, were meant to deactivate the doom loop at the national level and enhance the quality and credibility of financial oversight for the currency union. Specifically, the Commission recommended the creation of an SSM, of a euro area-wide deposit insurance scheme, and of a Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), to be operated (like the SSM) at the level of the euro area. The SSM opened its doors on November 4, 2014. Although housed in the ECB with authority over the larger and more interconnected euro area banks, the SSM still gave home countries the primary say in regulating smaller banks. Starting January 1, 2016, the SRM became operational. Nevertheless, the idea of centralized euro area deposit insurance is strongly opposed by a group of countries led by Germany, and the resources for resolving insolvent banks remain largely national. Thus, the doom loop is still substantially in place, and it is hard to see how the ECB will be able to enforce its supervisory edicts if it does not actually have the clout and financial resources to close down and reorganize failing banks in the face of potential opposition from national politicians.  

Many observers have recommended that the euro area enhance fiscal federalism through a larger centralized budget, managed by a fiscal authority with the capability to tax, spend, and issue joint eurobonds. Some euro area countries have been vigorously opposed to any such move toward what they derisively call a “transfer union.” As we shall see, however, the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic nonetheless led the EU to take a limited first step in this direction.29  

# ECB Outright Monetary Transactions  

Despite the preceding reform efforts, markets for peripheral euro zone sovereign debts remained volatile through the summer of 2012, with investors speculating that Greece might even leave EMU. Such an outcome—known colloquially as a “Grexit”—would have destabilized other countries’ borrowing rates even more by setting the precedent that a government might abandon the euro and introduce a national currency in its place. On July 26, 2012, ECB President Mario Draghi made the dramatic statement: “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.” Six weeks later he unveiled a program called Outright Monetary ­Transactions (OMT) under which the ECB would do exactly that—purchase sovereign bonds, potentially without limit, to prevent their interest rates from rising too far. To qualify for OMT, countries would first have to agree to an ESM stabilization plan.  

Even though OMT had not actually been used, bond yields in the peripheral countries receded sharply, as Figure 21-8 shows, simply because of the expectation of what the ECB could do with its unlimited monetary firepower. (The 2015 spike in Greece’s borrowing rate reflects further troubles, but its bond yields also fell as the country undertook a new adjustment program, and European official creditors granted it additional debt relief in 2018.)  

# Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic  

EU countries went into lockdowns to halt the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in sharp falls in economic activity across the continent. National governments, even those that were already heavily indebted, took strong fiscal actions to support their economies. In addition, a strong joint policy response by EU institutions helped blunt the effects of the crisis. The ESM made loans available to euro area countries under the sole condition of a promise to use the funds exclusively for pandemic related health expenditures. A European Commission initiative supported EU members’ shorttime work programs in which businesses reduce workers’ hours rather than fire them, but continue to pay them normal or near-normal wages. The European Investment Bank (EIB) extended credit to hard-hit small- and medium-sized enterprises. Importantly, the ECB rolled out a Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP) worth €750 billion (more than 5 percent of 2019 euro area GDP) to purchase euro area assets. The ECB stated, “To the extent that some self-imposed limits might hamper action that the ECB is required to take in order to fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council will consider revising them to the extent necessary to make its action proportionate to the risks that we face. The ECB will not tolerate any risks to the smooth transmission of its monetary policy in all jurisdictions of the euro area.”30 The PEPP helped prevent a large spike in borrowing costs for heavily indebted euro area members (Figure 21-8). The ECB soon expanded the PEPP substantially beyond its original size.  

The EU took further action in July of 2020, agreeing to create a €750 billion recovery fund (called Next Generation EU) to support pandemic reconstruction by member states. More than half of the support is to be in the form of grants rather than loans, with the European Commission financing the program by issuing joint EU bonds— something never done before on any significant scale. This initiative represented an unprecedented extension of fiscal federalism, partially intended to preserve political support for the EU in the face of the pandemic’s asymmetric impact in different countries.  

# The Future of EMU  

Europe’s single currency experiment is the boldest attempt ever to reap the efficiency gains from using a single currency over a large and diverse group of sovereign states. If EMU succeeds, it will promote European political as well as economic integration, fostering peace and prosperity in a region that could someday include all of Eastern Europe and even Turkey. If the euro project fails, however, its driving force, the goal of European political unification, will be set back.  

EMU must overcome some difficult challenges, however, if it is to survive its current crisis and prosper:  

1.	 Europe is not an optimum currency area. Therefore, asymmetric economic developments within different countries of the euro zone—developments that might well call for different national interest rates under a regime of individual national currencies—will remain hard to handle through monetary policy. The singlecurrency project has taken the economic union to a level far beyond what the EU has so far been able (or willing) to do in the area of political union. Nonetheless, in response to the euro crisis, the EU is increasing the centralized control over economic policy beyond the initial ECB blueprint through the Fiscal Stability Treaty, enhanced powers for the Commission, and the euro zone banking union. Many Europeans hoped that economic union would lead to closer political union, but it is possible that continuing quarrels over economic policies will sabotage that aim. Enhanced governmental powers at the center of EMU require enhanced democratic accountability as well, but little has been done to fulfill this need. Brexit illustrates a broader trend of some voters throughout Europe viewing the EU superstructure, including those governing the euro, as being under the control of a distant and politically unaccountable group of technocrats who are unresponsive to people’s needs.  

2.	 In most EU countries, labor markets remain rigid and subject to employment taxes and regulations that impede labor mobility between industries and regions. The result has been persistently high levels of unemployment. Unless labor markets become much more flexible, as in the United States’ currency union, individual euro zone countries will have a difficult time adjusting toward full employment and competitive real exchange rates. Other structural problems abound.  

It remains to be seen if the euro zone will develop more elaborate institutions for carrying out fiscal transfers from country to country. At the least, some sort of centralized fiscal backstop for the planned banking union is essential to ensure its effectiveness. The euro crisis showed the need for enough of a centralized European fiscal capacity to deal rapidly with inherently contagious member-country financial instability. It also showed the strength of opposition in some countries to such an institutional change. The COVID-19 crisis again underscored the need for centralized fiscal tools. Some observers believe that the Next Generation EU initiative, strongly promoted by France and Germany, could represent a first step on the road to more ambitious fiscal federalism.  

The experience of the United States shows that a large monetary union composed of diverse economic regions can work quite well. For the euro zone to achieve comparable economic success, however, it will have to make progress in creating more flexible labor and product markets, in reforming its fiscal and financial regulatory systems, and in deepening its political union. European unification itself will be imperiled unless the euro project and its defining institution, the ECB, succeed in delivering prosperity as well as price stability.  

■ European Union countries have had two main reasons for favoring mutually fixed exchange rates: They believe monetary cooperation will give them a heavier weight in international economic negotiations, and they view fixed exchange rates as a complement to EU initiatives aimed at building a common European market.  

■■ The European Monetary System of fixed intra-EU exchange rates was inaugurated in March 1979 and originally included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Austria, Britain, Portugal, and Spain joined much later. Capital controls and frequent realignments were essential ingredients in maintaining the system until the mid-1980s, but since then, controls have been abolished as part of the European Union’s wider program of market unification.  

■■ In practice, all EMS currencies were pegged to Germany’s former currency, the deutsche mark (DM). As a result, Germany was able to set monetary policy for the EMS, just as the United States did in the Bretton Woods system. The credibility theory of the EMS holds that participating governments profited from the German Bundesbank’s reputation as an inflation fighter. In fact, inflation rates in EMS countries ultimately tended to converge around Germany’s generally low inflation rate.  

■■ On January 1, 1999, 11 EU countries initiated an economic and monetary union (EMU) by adopting a common currency, the euro, issued by a European Central Bank (ECB) headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. (The initial 11 members were joined by several other countries later on.) The Eurosystem consists of euro members’ national central banks and the ECB, whose governing council runs monetary policy in EMU. The transition process from the EMS’s fixed exchange rate system to EMU was spelled out in the Maastricht Treaty signed by European leaders in December 1991.  

■■ The Maastricht Treaty specified a set of macroeconomic convergence criteria that EU countries would need to satisfy in order to qualify for admission to EMU. A major purpose of the convergence criteria was to reassure voters in low-inflation countries such as Germany that the new, jointly managed European currency would be as resistant to inflation as the DM had been. A Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), devised by EU leaders in 1997 at Germany’s insistence, was intended to limit government deficits and debt at the national level.  

■■ The theory of optimum currency areas implies that countries will wish to join fixed exchange rate areas closely linked to their own economies through trade and factor mobility. A country’s decision to join an exchange rate area is determined by the difference between the monetary efficiency gain from joining and the economic stability loss from joining. The GG-LL diagram relates both of these factors to the degree of economic integration between the joining country and the larger, fixed exchange rate zone. Only when economic integration passes a critical level is it beneficial to join.  

■■ The European Union does not appear to satisfy all of the criteria for an optimum currency area. Although many barriers to market integration within the European Union have been removed since the 1980s and the euro appears to have promoted intra-EU trade, the level of trade still is not very extensive. In addition, labor mobility between and even within EU countries appears more limited than that within other large currency areas such as the United States. Finally, the level of fiscal federalism in the European Union is too small to cushion member countries from adverse economic events, and policies for banking sector stability are not adequately centralized.  

■■ The euro crisis was sparked by Greek fiscal problems revealed at the end of 2009, but the crisis spread so widely because euro area banks were overextended and some countries had suffered big real appreciations that they could not unwind through devaluation. The prospect that some governments might default on their debts hurt banks, and conversely, bank weakness forced governments into expensive bailouts, in a self-reinforcing doom loop. The results were soaring government borrowing rates and capital flight from fiscally stressed countries. The ECB offered massive lender of last resort support to peripheral banks as money fled; at the same time, their governments required loans from other EU members and the IMF, loans that came on condition of fiscal austerity and structural reforms. Austerity combined with tight credit in so many neighboring countries gave rise to deep recessions.  

■■ Responses to the crisis included revamped fiscal restrictions on euro area governments as well as helpful but incomplete progress toward a euro zone banking union. The most effective initiative in pushing government borrowing rates down, however, was the ECB’s promise of Outright Monetary Transactions. In recent years, the ECB has carried out large-scale purchases of sovereign bonds (among other assets) in order to reduce long-term interest rates and prevent deflation, and it extended these actions further to respond to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the fiscal side, the European Commission’s Next Generation EU pandemic recovery fund could be a promising step on the road to more fiscal federalism.

2.	 In the EMS before September 1992, the Italian lira/DM exchange rate could fluctuate by up to 2.25 percent up or down. Assume that the lira/DM central parity and band were set in this way and could not be changed.

What would have been the maximum possible difference between the interest rates on six-month lira and DM deposits? On three-month deposits? Do the answers surprise you? Give an intuitive explanation.

Use the GG-LL diagram to show how an increase in the size and frequency of unexpected shifts in a country’s money demand function affects the level of economic integration with a currency area at which the country will wish to join. 7.	 During the speculative pressure on the EMS exchange rate mechanism (ERM) shortly before Britain allowed the pound to float in September 1992, The ­Economist, a London weekly news magazine, opined as follows: The [British] government’s critics want lower interest rates, and think this would be possible if Britain devalued sterling, leaving the ERM if necessary. They are wrong. Quitting the ERM would soon lead to higher, not lower, interest rates, as British economic management lost the degree of credibility already won through ERM membership. Two years ago British government bonds yielded three percentage points more than German ones. Today the gap is half a point, reflecting investors’ belief that British inflation is on its way down—permanently. (See “Crisis? What Crisis?” The Economist, August 29, 1992, p. 51.) a.	 Why might the British government’s critics have thought it possible to lower interest rates after taking sterling out of the ERM? (Britain was in a deep recession at the time the article appeared.) b.	 Why did The Economist think the opposite would occur soon after Britain exited the ERM? c.	 In what way might ERM membership have gained credibility for British policy makers? (Britain entered the ERM in October 1990.) d.	 Why would a high level of British nominal interest rates relative to German rates have suggested an expectation of high future British inflation? Can you think of other explanations? e.	 Suggest two reasons why British interest rates might have been somewhat higher than German rates at the time of writing, despite the alleged “belief that British inflation is on its way down—permanently.”   
8.	 Imagine that the EMS had become a monetary union with a single currency but that it had created no European Central Bank to manage this currency. Imagine instead that the task had been left to the various national central banks, each of which was allowed to issue as much of the European currency as it liked and to conduct open-market operations. What problems can you see arising from such a scheme? 9.	 Why would the failure to create a unified EU labor market be particularly harmful to the prospects for a smoothly functioning EMU, if at the same time capital is completely free to move among EU countries?   
10.	 Before Brexit Britain was firmly within the EU, but it didn’t adopt the euro, and fierce debate raged over the issue. a.	 Find macro data on the British economy’s performance since 1998 (inflation, unemployment, real GDP growth) and compare these with euro zone data. b.	 What were nominal interest rates in Britain and the euro zone after 1998? How would Britain have fared if the ECB had been setting Britain’s nominal interest rate at the euro zone level and the pound sterling’s euro exchange rate had been fixed?   
11.	 Movements in the euro’s external exchange rate can be seen as goods-market  

shocks that have asymmetric effects on different euro zone members. When the euro appreciated against China’s currency in 2007, which country suffered the greater fall in aggregate demand, Finland, which does not compete directly with China in its export markets, or Spain, which does? What would have happened had Spain retained its old currency, the peseta?  

12.	 In the United States’ currency union, we seem never to worry if a state has a big current account deficit. Have you ever seen such data in the newspaper? Can you even find the data in any U.S. government statistical sources? For example, one would guess that the state of Louisiana ran large current account deficits after it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But Louisiana’s possible current account deficit was not deemed worthy of coverage by the financial press. We do know, however, that in 2008, Greece had a current account deficit of 14.6 percent of GDP, Portugal had a deficit of 12 percent of GDP, and Spain had a deficit of 9.8 percent of GDP (Table 21-4). Should the governments of these countries worry about such large deficits? (Hint: Relate your answer to the debate over the need for the SGP.)   
13.	 Go to the IMF website at www.imf.org and find the World Economic Outlook database; then download data on the current account balance (as a percent of GDP) for Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Ireland. What happens to the current accounts of these countries after 2009 during the euro crisis? Can you explain what you see?   
14.	 Suppose it is possible for a country to leave the euro zone and begin printing its own currency. Suppose also that there is some point at which the ECB (perhaps it is worried about financial losses) will stop lending to the country’s banks. What would happen if creditors suddenly begin to flee from the country’s banks?   
15.	 In the spring of 2013 Cyprus followed Greece, Ireland, and Portugal in agreeing to an emergency loan from the troika of the EU, ECB, and IMF. The cause was big losses in the Cypriot banking system. After imposing losses on some Cypriot bank deposits, the government, with EU approval, imposed capital controls to prevent residents from taking money abroad. Why do you think this step (which violated the EU’s single-market philosophy) was taken? (Greece was forced to follow a similar approach in mid-2015, as deposits fled the country fearing a possible exit from the euro. So far, however, Greece’s creditors have remained willing to extend enough credit to keep the country afloat.)   
16.	 Imagine that a single large country within the euro area, for example, Germany, carries out a fiscal expansion, in which its government purchases more of its own country’s output. What would be the effect on the other members of the euro area? a.	 Start by using the DD-AA model, considering the euro area to be a single economy with an exchange rate that floats against the rest of the world. Then consider the channels through which the German policy change could affect other currency union members if the change is permanent. What if it is temporary? b.	 Now imagine that the euro area is in a liquidity trap, with the ECB policy rate fixed at zero (recall Chapter 17). Referring to Figure 17-19, how do you think a temporary German fiscal expansion affects other currency union members? What about a permanent expansion?
