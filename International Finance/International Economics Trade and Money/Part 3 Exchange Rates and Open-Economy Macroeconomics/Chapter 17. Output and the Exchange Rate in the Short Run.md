# CHAPTER 17  

# Output and the Exchange Rate in the Short Run  

growth during 2009, a year of deep global recession. But while the U.S. dollar depreciated against foreign currencies by about 8 percent over the year, the ­Canadian dollar appreciated by roughly 16 percent. What explains these contrasting experiences? By completing the macroeconomic model built in ­Chapters 14 through 16, this chapter will sort out the complicated factors that cause output, exchange rates, and inflation to change. Chapters 15 and 16 presented the connections among exchange rates, interest rates, and price levels but always assumed that output levels were determined outside the model. Those chapters gave us only a partial picture of how macroeconomic changes affect an open economy because events that change exchange rates, interest rates, and price levels may also affect output. Now we complete the picture by examining how output and the exchange rate are determined in the short run.  

Our discussion combines what we have learned about asset markets and the long-run behavior of exchange rates with a new element, a theory of how the output market adjusts to demand changes when product prices in the economy are themselves slow to adjust. As we learned in Chapter 15, institutional factors like long-term nominal contracts can give rise to “sticky” or slowly adjusting output market prices. By combining a short-run model of the output market with our models of the foreign exchange and money markets (the asset markets), we build a model that explains the short-run behavior of all the important macroeconomic variables in an open economy. The long-run exchange rate model of the preceding chapter provides the framework that participants in the asset markets use to form their expectations about future exchange rates.  

Because output changes may push the economy away from full employment, the links among output and other macroeconomic variables, such as the trade balance and the current account, are of great concern to economic policy makers. In the last part of this chapter, we use our short-run model to examine how macroeconomic policy tools affect output and the current account and how those tools can be used to maintain full employment.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

Explain the role of the real exchange rate in determining the aggregate demand for a country’s output.   
See how an open economy’s short-run equilibrium can be analyzed as the intersection of an asset market equilibrium schedule (AA) and an output market equilibrium schedule (DD).   
Understand how monetary and fiscal policies affect the exchange rate and national output in the short run.   
Describe and interpret the long-run effects of permanent macroeconomic policy changes.   
Explain the relationship among macroeconomic policies, the current account balance, and the exchange rate.  

# Determinants of Aggregate Demand in an Open Economy  

To analyze how output is determined in the short run when product prices are sticky, we introduce the concept of aggregate demand for a country’s output. Aggregate demand is the amount of a country’s goods and services demanded by households, firms, and governments throughout the world. Just as the output of an individual good or service depends in part on the demand for it, a country’s overall short-run output level depends on the aggregate demand for its products. The economy is at full employment in the long run (by definition) because wages and the price level eventually adjust to ensure full employment. In the long run, domestic output therefore depends only on the available domestic supplies of factors of production such as labor and capital. As we will see, however, these productive factors can be over- or underemployed in the short run as a result of shifts in aggregate demand that have not yet had their full long-run effects on prices.  

In Chapter 13, we learned that an economy’s output is the sum of four types of expenditure that generate national income: consumption, investment, government purchases, and the current account. Correspondingly, aggregate demand for an open economy’s output is the sum of consumption demand $(C)$ , investment demand $(I)$ , government demand $(G)$ , and net export demand, that is, the current account $(C A)$ . Each of these components of aggregate demand depends on various factors. In this section, we examine the factors that determine consumption demand and the current account. We discuss government demand later in this chapter when we examine the effects of fiscal policy; for now, we assume that $G$ is given. To avoid complicating our model, we also assume investment demand is given. We incorporate the determinants of investment demand into the model in Appendix 3 to this chapter.  

# Determinants of Consumption Demand  

In this chapter, we view the amount a country’s residents wish to consume as depending on disposable income, $Y^{d}$ (that is, national income less taxes, $Y-T)$ ).1 $\varphi,Y,$ and $T$  

are all measured in terms of domestic output units.) With this assumption, a country’s desired consumption level can be written as a function of disposable income:  

$$
C=C({Y}^{d}).
$$  

Because each consumer naturally demands more goods and services as his or her real income rises, we expect consumption to increase as disposable income increases at the aggregate level, too. Thus, consumption demand and disposable income are positively related. However, when disposable income rises, consumption demand generally rises by less because part of the income increase is saved.  

# Determinants of the Current Account  

The current account balance, viewed as the demand for a country’s exports less that country’s own demand for imports, is determined by two main factors: the domestic currency’s real exchange rate against foreign currency (that is, the price of a typical foreign expenditure basket in terms of domestic expenditure baskets) and domestic disposable income. (In reality, a country’s current account depends on many other factors, such as the level of foreign expenditure, but for now we regard these other factors as being held constant.)2  

We express a country’s current account balance as a function of its currency’s real exchange rate, $q=\mathrm{EP^{*}}/P$ , and of domestic disposable income, $Y^{d}$ :  

$$
C A=C A(E P^{*}/P,Y^{d}).
$$  

As a reminder of the discussion in Chapter 16, note that the domestic currency prices of representative foreign and domestic expenditure baskets are, respectively, $E P^{*}$ and $P$ , where $E$ (the nominal exchange rate) is the price of foreign currency in terms of domestic currency, $P^{*}$ is the foreign price level, and $P$ is the home price level. The real exchange rate $q$ , defined as the price of the foreign basket in terms of the domestic one, is therefore $E P^{*}/P.$ If, for example, the representative basket of European goods and services costs $\epsilon40(P^{*})$ , the representative U.S. basket costs $\$50$ $(P)$ , and the dollar>euro exchange rate is $\$10$ per euro $(E)$ , then the price of the European basket in terms of U.S. baskets is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{E P^{*}/P=\frac{(1.10\S/\in)\times(40\in/\mathrm{European\basket})}{(50\S/\mathrm{U.S.\basket})}}\\ {=0.88\mathrm{U.S.\baskets/European\basket}.}\end{array}
$$  

Real exchange rate changes affect the current account because they reflect changes in the prices of domestic goods and services relative to foreign goods and services. ­Disposable income affects the current account through its effect on total spending by domestic consumers. To understand how these real exchange rate and disposable income effects work, it is helpful to look separately at the demand for a country’s exports, $E X_{\mathrm{{i}}}$ , and the demand for imports by the country’s residents, $I M.$ . As we saw in Chapter 13, the current account is related to exports and imports by the identity  

$$
C A=E X-I M,
$$  

when $C A,E X,$ and $_{I M}$ all are measured in terms of domestic output.  

# How Real Exchange Rate Changes Affect the Current Account  

You will recall that a representative domestic expenditure basket includes some imported products but places a relatively heavier weight on goods and services produced domestically. At the same time, the representative foreign basket is skewed toward goods and services produced in the foreign country. Thus, a rise in the price of the foreign basket in terms of domestic baskets, say, will be associated with a rise in the relative price of foreign output in general relative to domestic output.3  

To determine how such a change in the relative price of national outputs affects the current account, other things equal, we must ask how it affects both $E X$ and $_{I M}$ . When $E P^{*}/P$ rises, for example, foreign products have become more expensive relative to domestic products: Each unit of domestic output now purchases fewer units of foreign output. Foreign consumers will respond to this price shift (a real domestic currency depreciation) by demanding more of our exports. This response by foreigners will therefore raise $E X$ and improve the domestic country’s current account.  

The effect of the same real exchange rate increase on $_{I M}$ is more complicated. Domestic consumers respond to the price shift by purchasing fewer units of the more expensive foreign products. Their response does not imply, however, that $I M$ must fall because IM denotes the value of imports measured in terms of domestic output, not the volume of foreign products imported. Since a rise in $E P^{*}/P$ (a real depreciation of the domestic currency) tends to raise the value of each unit of imports in terms of domestic output units, imports measured in domestic output units may rise as a result of a rise in $E P^{*}/P$ even if imports decline when measured in foreign output units. $I M$ can therefore rise or fall when $E P^{*}/P$ rises, so the effect of a real exchange rate change on the current account $C A$ is ambiguous.  

Whether the current account improves or worsens depends on which effect of a real exchange rate change is dominant—the volume effect of consumer spending shifts on export and import quantities or the value effect, which changes the domestic output equivalent of a given volume of foreign imports. We assume for now that the volume effect of a real exchange rate change always outweighs the value effect, so that, other things equal, a real depreciation of the currency improves the current account and a real appreciation of the currency worsens the current account.4  

While we have couched our discussion of real exchange rates and the current account in terms of consumers’ responses, producers’ responses are just as important and work in much the same way. When a country’s currency depreciates in real terms, foreign firms will find that the country can supply intermediate production inputs more cheaply. These effects have become stronger as a result of the increasing tendency for multinational firms to locate different stages of their production processes in a variety of countries. For example, the German auto manufacturer BMW can shift production from Germany to its Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant if a dollar depreciation lowers the relative cost of producing in the United States. The production shift represents an increase in world demand for U.S. labor and output.

# How Disposable Income Changes Affect the Current Account  

The second factor influencing the current account is domestic disposable income. Since a rise in $Y^{d}$ causes domestic consumers to increase their spending on all goods, including imports from abroad, an increase in disposable income worsens the current account, other things equal. (An increase in $Y^{d}$ has no effect on export demand because we are holding foreign income constant and not allowing $Y^{d}$ to affect it.)  

Table 17-1 summarizes our discussion of how real exchange rate and disposable income changes influence the domestic current account.  

# The Equation of Aggregate Demand  

We now combine the four components of aggregate demand to get an expression for total aggregate demand, denoted $D$ :  

$$
D=C(Y-T)+I+G+C A(E P^{*}/P,Y-T),
$$  

where we have written disposable income $Y^{d}$ as output, $Y_{\pm}$ less taxes, $T.$ This equation shows that aggregate demand for home output can be written as a function of the real exchange rate, disposable income, investment demand, and government spending:  

$$
D=D(E P^{*}/P,\ Y-\ T,\ I,\ G).
$$  

We now want to see how aggregate demand depends on the real exchange rate and domestic GNP given the level of taxes, $T_{\ast}$ , investment demand, $I,$ , and government purchases, G.5  

# The Real Exchange Rate and Aggregate Demand  

A rise in $E P^{*}/P$ makes domestic goods and services cheaper relative to foreign goods and services and shifts both domestic and foreign spending from foreign goods to domestic goods. As a result, $C A$ rises (as assumed in the previous section) and aggregate demand, $D$ , therefore goes up. $A$ real depreciation of the home currency raises aggregate demand for home output, other things equal; a real appreciation lowers aggregate demand for home output.  

# Real Income and Aggregate Demand  

The effect of domestic real income on aggregate demand is slightly more complicated. If taxes are fixed at a given level, a rise in $Y$ represents an equal rise in disposable income $Y^{d}$ . While this rise in $Y^{d}$ raises consumption, it worsens the current account by raising home spending on foreign imports. The first of these effects raises aggregate demand, but the second lowers it. Since the increase in consumption is divided between higher spending on home products and higher spending on foreign imports, however, the first effect (the effect of disposable income on total consumption) is greater than the second (the effect of disposable income on import spending alone). Therefore, a rise in domestic real income raises aggregate demand for home output, other things equal, and a fall in domestic real income lowers aggregate demand for home output.  

Figure 17-1 shows the relation between aggregate demand and real income $Y$ for fixed values of the real exchange rate, taxes, investment demand, and government spending. As $Y$ rises, consumption rises by a fraction of the increase in income. Part of this increase in consumption, moreover, goes into import spending. The effect of an increase in $Y$ on the aggregate demand for home output is therefore smaller than the accompanying rise in consumption demand, which is smaller, in turn, than the increase in Y. We show this in Figure 17-1 by drawing the aggregate demand schedule with a slope less than 1. (The schedule intersects the vertical axis above the origin because investment, government, and foreign demand would make aggregate demand greater than zero, even in the hypothetical case of zero domestic output.)  

# FIGURE 17-1  

# Aggregate Demand as a Function of Output  

Aggregate demand is a ­function of the real exchange rate $(E P^{*}/P)$ , disposable income $(Y-T)$ , investment demand $(I),$ and government spending (G). If all other factors remain unchanged, a rise in output (real income), $Y,$ increases aggregate demand. Because the increase in aggregate demand is less than the increase in output, the slope of the aggregate demand function is less than 1 (as indicated by its position within the 45-degree angle).

# How Output Is Determined in the Short Run  

Having discussed the factors that influence the demand for an open economy’s output, we now study how output is determined in the short run. We show that the output market is in equilibrium when real domestic output, $Y,$ equals the aggregate demand for domestic output:  

$$
Y=D(E P^{*}/P,Y-T,I,G).
$$  

The equality of aggregate supply and demand therefore determines the short-run equilibrium output level.6  

Our analysis of real output determination applies to the short run because we assume that the money prices of goods and services are temporarily fixed. As we will see later in the chapter, the short-run real output changes that occur when prices are temporarily fixed eventually cause price level changes that move the economy to its long-run equilibrium. In long-run equilibrium, factors of production are fully employed, the level of real output is completely determined by factor supplies, and the real exchange rate has adjusted to equate long-run real output to aggregate demand.7  

The determination of national output in the short run is illustrated in Figure 17-2, where we again graph aggregate demand as a function of output for fixed levels of the real exchange rate, taxes, investment demand, and government spending. The intersection (at point 1) of the aggregate demand schedule and a 45-degree line drawn from the origin (the equation $D=Y$ ) gives us the unique output level $Y^{1}$ at which aggregate demand equals domestic output.  

Let’s use Figure 17-2 to see why output tends to settle at $Y^{1}$ in the short run. At an output level of $Y^{2}$ , aggregate demand (point 2) is higher than output. Firms therefore increase their production to meet this excess demand. (If they did not, they would have to meet the excess demand out of inventories, reducing investment below the desired level, $I.$ ) Thus, output expands until national income reaches $Y^{1}$ .  

At point 3, there is an excess supply of domestic output, and firms find themselves involuntarily accumulating inventories (and involuntarily raising their investment spending above its desired level). As inventories start to build up, firms cut back on production; only when output has fallen to $Y^{1}$ will firms be content with their level of production. Once again, output settles at point 1, the point at which output exactly equals aggregate demand. In this short-run equilibrium, consumers, firms, the government, and foreign buyers of domestic products are all able to realize their desired expenditures with no output left over.  

# FIGURE 17-2 The ­Determination of Output in the Short Run  

In the short run, ­output settles at Y 1 (point 1), where aggregate demand, $D^{1}$ , equals aggregate output, $Y^{1}$ .

# Output Market Equilibrium in the Short Run: The DD Schedule  

Now that we understand how output is determined for a given real exchange rate $E P^{*}/P$ , let’s look at how the exchange rate and output are simultaneously determined in the short run. To understand this process, we need two elements. The first element, developed in this section, is the relationship between output and the exchange rate (the $_{D D}$ schedule) that must hold when the output market is in equilibrium. The second element, developed in the next section, is the relationship between output and the exchange rate that must hold when the home money market and the foreign exchange market (the asset markets) are in equilibrium. Both elements are necessary because the economy as a whole is in equilibrium only when both the output market and the asset markets are in equilibrium.  

# Output, the Exchange Rate, and Output Market Equilibrium  

Figure 17-3 illustrates the relationship between the exchange rate and output implied by output market equilibrium. Specifically, the figure illustrates the effect of a depreciation of the domestic currency against foreign currency (that is, a rise in $E$ from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ ) for fixed values of the domestic price level, $P$ , and the foreign price level, $P^{*}$ . With fixed price levels at home and abroad, the rise in the nominal exchange rate makes foreign goods and services more expensive relative to domestic goods and services. This relative price change shifts the aggregate demand schedule upward.  

# FIGURE 17-3  

# Output Effect of a Currency Depreciation with Fixed Output Prices  

A rise in the exchange rate from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ (a currency depreciation) raises aggregate demand to Aggregate demand $\left(E^{2}\right)$ and output to $Y^{2}$ , all else equal.  

![](images/96b5de2f8d42970c30c71fb5110b4cc687fa56b618870eb1d232392a21f20b41.jpg)  

The fall in the relative price of domestic output shifts the aggregate demand schedule upward because at each level of domestic output, the demand for domestic products is higher. For example, foreign and American consumers of autos alike shift their demands toward American models when the dollar depreciates. Output expands from $Y^{1}$ to $Y^{2}$ as firms find themselves faced with excess demand at initial production levels.  

Although we have considered the effect of a change in $E$ with $P$ and $P^{*}$ held fixed, it is straightforward to analyze the effects of changes in $P$ or $P^{*}$ on output. Any rise in the real exchange rate $E P^{*}/P$ (whether due to a rise in $E_{:}$ , a rise in $P^{*}$ , or a fall in $P$ ) will cause an upward shift in the aggregate demand function and an expansion of output, all else equal. (A rise in $P^{*}$ , for example, has effects qualitatively identical to those of a rise in $E$ .) Similarly, any fall in $E P^{*}/P$ , regardless of its cause (a fall in $E_{:}$ , a fall in $P^{*}$ , or a rise in $P$ ), will cause output to contract, all else equal. (A rise in $P$ , with $E$ and $P^{*}$ held fixed, for example, makes domestic products more expensive relative to foreign products, reduces aggregate demand for domestic output, and causes output to fall.)  

# Deriving the DD Schedule  

If we assume $P$ and $P^{*}$ are fixed in the short run, a depreciation of the domestic currency (a rise in $E$ ) is associated with a rise in domestic output, Y, while an appreciation (a fall in $E$ ) is associated with a fall in $Y.$ This association provides us with one of the two relationships between $E$ and $Y$ needed to describe the short-run macroeconomic behavior of an open economy. We summarize this relationship by the $\pmb{D D}$ schedule, which shows all combinations of output and the exchange rate for which the output market is in short-run equilibrium (aggregated demand $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ aggregate output).  

# FIGURE 17-4 Deriving the DD Schedule  

The $D D$ schedule (shown in the lower panel) slopes upward because a rise in the exchange rate from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2},$ , all else equal, causes output to rise from $Y^{1}$ to $Y^{2}$ .  

![](images/021b92e37c6aebbcb8a68f14d9ee2a5798fe2f23edbe26a33580a249fb9be374.jpg)  
Figure 17-4 shows how to derive the $_{D D}$ schedule, which relates $E$ and $Y$ when $P$ and $P^{*}$ are fixed. The upper part of the figure reproduces the result of Figure 17-3. (A depreciation of the domestic currency shifts the aggregate demand function upward, causing output to rise.) The $D D$ schedule in the lower part graphs the resulting relationship between the exchange rate and output (given that $P$ and $P^{*}$ are held constant). Point 1 on the $_{D D}$ schedule gives the output level, $Y^{1}$ , at which aggregate demand equals aggregate supply when the exchange rate is $E^{1}$ . A depreciation of the currency to $E^{2}$ leads to the higher output level $Y^{2}$ according to the figure’s upper part, and this information allows us to locate point 2 on $D D$ .  

# Factors That Shift the DD Schedule  

A number of factors affect the position of the $_{D D}$ schedule: the levels of government demand, taxes, and investment; the domestic and foreign price levels; variations in domestic consumption behavior; and the foreign demand for home output.  

To understand the effects of shifts in each of these factors, we must study how the $D D$ schedule shifts when it changes. In the following discussions, we assume all other factors remain fixed.  

1.	 A change in $G$ Figure 17-5 shows the effect on $D D$ of a rise in government purchases from $G^{1}$ to $G^{2}$ , given a constant exchange rate of $E^{0}$ . An example would be the increase in U.S. military and security expenditures following the September 11, 2001, attacks. As shown in the upper part of the figure, the exchange rate $E^{0}$ leads to an equilibrium output level $Y^{1}$ at the initial level of government demand, so point 1 is one point on $D D^{1}$ .  

![](images/685279a9c98b5980bfd515aec53f2bdb59c4bc39d2dd70fe3e690fd9f77d9d92.jpg)  
FIGURE 17-5 Government Demand and the Position of the DD Schedule  

A rise in government demand from $C^{1}$ to $C^{2}$ raises output at every level of the exchange rate. The change therefore shifts $D D$ to the right.  

An increase in $G$ causes the aggregate demand schedule in the upper part of the figure to shift upward. Everything else remaining unchanged, output increases from $Y^{1}$ to $Y^{2}$ . Point 2 in the bottom part shows the higher level of output at which aggregate demand and supply are now equal, given an unchanged exchange rate of $E^{0}$ . Point 2 is on a new $D D$ curve, $D D^{2}$ .  

For any given exchange rate, the level of output equating aggregate demand and supply is higher after the increase in $G$ . This implies that an increase in $G$ causes $D D$ to shift to the right, as shown in Figure 17-5. Similarly, a decrease in $G$ causes $D D$ to shift to the left.  

The method and reasoning we have just used to study how an increase in $G$ shifts the $_{D D}$ curve can be applied to all the cases that follow. Here, we summarize the results. To test your understanding, use diagrams similar to Figure 17-5 to illustrate how the economic factors listed below change the curves.   
2.	 A change in $T.$ Taxes, $T_{\cdot}$ , affect aggregate demand by changing disposable income, and thus consumption, for any level of $Y.$ It follows that an increase in taxes causes the aggregate demand function of Figure 17-1 to shift downward given the exchange rate $E$ . Since this effect is the opposite of that of an increase in $G$ , an increase in $T$ must cause the $_{D D}$ schedule to shift leftward. Similarly, a fall in $T_{\cdot}$ , such as the tax cut enacted after 2001 by U.S. President George W. Bush, causes a rightward shift of $D D.$ .   
3.	 A change in $I.$ An increase in investment demand has the same effect as an increase in $G$ : The aggregate demand schedule shifts upward and $_{D D}$ shifts to the right. A fall in investment demand shifts $_{D D}$ to the left.   
4.	 A change in $P.$ Given $E$ and $P^{*}$ , an increase in $P$ makes domestic output more expensive relative to foreign output and lowers net export demand. The $D D$ schedule shifts to the left as aggregate demand falls. A fall in $P$ makes domestic goods cheaper and causes a rightward shift of $D D.$ .   
5.	 A change in $P^{*}$ . Given $E$ and $P$ , a rise in $P^{*}$ makes foreign goods and services relatively more expensive. Aggregate demand for domestic output therefore rises and $D D$ shifts to the right. Similarly, a fall in $P^{*}$ causes $D D$ to shift to the left.   
6.	 A change in the consumption function. Suppose residents of the home economy suddenly decide they want to consume more and save less at each level of disposable income. This could occur, for example, if home prices increase and homeowners borrow against their additional wealth. If the increase in consumption spending is not devoted entirely to imports from abroad, aggregate demand for domestic output rises and the aggregate demand schedule shifts upward for any given exchange rate $E$ . This implies a shift to the right of the $D D$ schedule. An autonomous fall in consumption (if it is not entirely due to a fall in import demand) shifts $D D$ to the left.   
7.	 A demand shift between foreign and domestic goods. Suppose there is no change in the domestic consumption function but domestic and foreign residents suddenly decide to devote more of their spending to goods and services produced in the home country. (For example, fears of mad cow disease abroad raise the demand for U.S. beef products.) If home disposable income and the real exchange rate remain the same, this shift in demand improves the current account by raising exports and lowering imports. The aggregate demand schedule shifts upward and $D D$ therefore shifts to the right. The same reasoning shows that a shift in world demand away from domestic products and toward foreign products causes $D D$ to shift to the left.  

You may have noticed that a simple rule allows you to predict the effect on $D D$ of any of the disturbances we have discussed: Any disturbance that raises aggregate demand for domestic output shifts the DD schedule to the right; any disturbance that lowers aggregate demand for domestic output shifts the DD schedule to the left.  

# Asset Market Equilibrium in the Short Run: The AA Schedule  

We have now derived the first element in our account of short-run exchange rate and income determination, the relation between the exchange rate and output that is consistent with the equality of aggregate demand and supply. That relation is summarized by the $_{D D}$ schedule, which shows all exchange rate and output levels at which the output market is in short-run equilibrium. As we noted at the beginning of the preceding section, however, equilibrium in the economy as a whole requires equilibrium in the asset markets as well as in the output market, and there is no reason in general why points on the $D D$ schedule should lead to asset market equilibrium.  

To complete the story of short-run equilibrium, we therefore introduce a second element to ensure that the exchange rate and output level consistent with output market equilibrium are also consistent with asset market equilibrium. The schedule of exchange rate and output combinations that are consistent with equilibrium in the domestic money market and the foreign exchange market is called the AA schedule.  

# Output, the Exchange Rate, and Asset Market Equilibrium  

In Chapter 14, we studied the interest parity condition, which states that the foreign exchange market is in equilibrium only when the expected rates of return on domestic and foreign currency deposits are equal. In Chapter 15, we learned how the interest rates that enter the interest parity relationship are determined by the equality of real money supply and real money demand in national money markets. Now we combine these asset market equilibrium conditions to see how the exchange rate and output must be related when all asset markets simultaneously clear. Because the focus for now is on the domestic economy, the foreign interest rate is taken as given.  

For a given expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , the interest parity condition describing foreign exchange market equilibrium is the analog of equation (14-2),  

$$
R=R^{*}+(E^{e}-E)/E,
$$  

where $R$ is the interest rate on domestic currency deposits and $R^{*}$ is the interest rate on foreign currency deposits. In Chapter 15, we saw that the domestic interest rate satisfying the interest parity condition must also equate the real domestic money supply, $M^{s}/P$ , to aggregate real money demand [see equation (15-4)]:  

$$
M^{s}/P=L(R,Y).
$$  

You will recall that aggregate real money demand, $L(R,Y)$ , rises when the interest rate falls because a fall in $R$ makes interest-bearing nonmoney assets less attractive to hold. (Conversely, a rise in the interest rate lowers real money demand.) A rise in real output, $Y_{\pm}$ increases real money demand by raising the volume of monetary transactions people must carry out (and a fall in real output reduces real money demand by reducing people’s transactions needs).  

We now use the diagrammatic tools developed in Chapter 15 to study the changes in the exchange rate that must accompany output changes so that asset markets remain in equilibrium. Figure 17-6 shows the equilibrium domestic interest rate and exchange rate associated with the output level $Y^{1}$ for a given nominal money supply, $M^{s}$ ; a given domestic price level, $P$ ; a given foreign interest rate, $R^{*}$ ; and a given value of the expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ . In the lower part of the figure, we see that with real output at $Y^{1}$ and the real money supply at $M^{s}/P$ , the interest rate $R^{1}$ clears the home money market (point 1), while the exchange rate $E^{1}$ clears the foreign exchange market (point $1^{\prime}$ ). The exchange rate $E^{1}$ clears the foreign exchange market because it equates the expected rate of return on foreign deposits, measured in terms of domestic currency, to $R^{\hat{1}}$ .  

A rise in output from $Y^{1}$ to $Y^{2}$ raises aggregate real money demand from $L(R,Y^{1})$ to $L(R,Y^{2})$ , shifting out the entire money demand schedule in the lower part of ­Figure 17-6. This shift, in turn, raises the equilibrium domestic interest rate to $R^{\bar{2}}\left(\operatorname{point}2\right)$ . With $E^{e}$ and $R^{*}$ fixed, the domestic currency must appreciate from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ to bring the foreign exchange market back into equilibrium at point $2^{\prime}$ . The domestic currency appreciates

# Output and the Exchange Rate in Asset Market Equilibrium  

For the asset (foreign exchange and money) markets to remain in equilibrium, a rise in ­output must be accompanied by an appreciation of the currency, all else equal.  

by just enough that the increase in the rate at which it is expected to ­depreciate in the future offsets the increased interest rate advantage of home currency deposits. For asset markets to remain in equilibrium, a rise in domestic output must be accompanied by an appreciation of the domestic currency, all else equal, and a fall in domestic output must be accompanied by a depreciation.  

# Deriving the AA Schedule  

While the $_{D D}$ schedule plots exchange rates and output levels at which the output market is in equilibrium, the $A A$ schedule relates exchange rates and output levels that keep the money and foreign exchange markets in equilibrium. Figure 17-7 shows the $\mathbf{\nabla}_{A A}$ schedule. From Figure 17-6, we see that for any output level Y, there is a unique exchange rate $E$ satisfying the interest parity condition (given the real money supply, the foreign interest rate, and the expected future exchange rate). Our previous reasoning tells us that other things equal, a rise in $Y^{1}$ to $Y^{2}$ will produce an appreciation of the domestic currency, that is, a fall in the exchange rate from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ . The $A A$ schedule therefore has a negative slope, as shown in Figure 17-7.  

# Factors That Shift the AA Schedule  

Five factors cause the $_{A A}$ schedule to shift: changes in the domestic money supply, $M^{s}$ ; changes in the domestic price level, $P$ ; changes in the expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ ; changes in the foreign interest rate, $R^{*}$ ; and shifts in the aggregate real money demand schedule.  

1.	 A change in $M^{s}$ . For a fixed level of output, an increase in $M^{s}$ causes the domestic currency to depreciate in the foreign exchange market, all else equal (that is, $E$ rises). Since for each level of output the exchange rate, $E$ , is higher after the rise in $M^{s}$ , the rise in $M^{s}$ causes $_{A A}$ to shift upward. Similarly, a fall in $M^{s}$ causes $A A$ to shift downward.  

# FIGURE 17-7 The AA Schedule  

The asset market equilibrium schedule (AA) slopes downward because a rise in output from $\gamma^{1}$ to $Y^{2},$ , all else equal, causes a rise in the home interest rate and a domestic currency appreciation from E1 to $E^{2}$ .  

![](images/c59c181caa027009fa4eef8c3bfe7f2771561dd65f688be0cc0ba9cc7648b1b6.jpg)  

2.	 A change in $P.$ An increase in $P$ reduces the real money supply and drives the interest rate upward. Other things (including $Y$ ) equal, this rise in the interest rate causes $E$ to fall. The effect of a rise in $P$ is therefore a downward shift of $A A$ . A fall in $P$ results in an upward shift of $A A$ .   
3.	 A change in $E^{e}$ . Suppose participants in the foreign exchange market suddenly revise their expectations about the exchange rate’s future value so that $E^{e}$ rises. Such a change shifts the curve in the top part of Figure 17-6 (which measures the expected domestic currency return on foreign currency deposits) to the right. The rise in $E^{e}$ therefore causes the domestic currency to depreciate, other things equal. Because the exchange rate producing equilibrium in the foreign exchange market is higher after a rise in $E^{e}$ , given output, $A A$ shifts upward when a rise in the expected future exchange rate occurs. It shifts downward when the expected future exchange rate falls.   
4.	 A change in $R^{*}$ . A rise in $R^{*}$ raises the expected return on foreign currency deposits and therefore shifts the downward-sloping schedule at the top of Figure 17-6 to the right. Given output, the domestic currency must depreciate to restore interest parity. A rise in $R^{*}$ therefore has the same effect on $A A$ as a rise in $E^{e}$ : It causes an upward shift. A fall in $R^{*}$ results in a downward shift of $A A$ .   
5.	 A change in real money demand. Suppose domestic residents decide they would prefer to hold lower real money balances at each output level and interest rate. (Such a change in asset-holding preferences is a reduction in money demand.) A reduction in money demand implies an inward shift of the aggregate real money demand function $L(R,Y)$ for any fixed level of $Y_{\pm}$ , and it thus results in a lower interest rate and a rise in $E$ . A reduction in money demand therefore has the same effect as an increase in the money supply in that it shifts $_{A A}$ upward. The opposite disturbance of an increase in money demand would shift $A A$ downward.  

# Short-Run Equilibrium for an Open Economy: Putting the DD and AA Schedules Together  

By assuming output prices are temporarily fixed, we have derived two separate schedules of exchange rate and output levels: the $_{D D}$ schedule, along which the output market is in equilibrium, and the $A A$ schedule, along which the asset markets are in equilibrium. A short-run equilibrium for the economy as a whole must lie on both schedules because such a point must bring about equilibrium simultaneously in the output and asset markets. We can therefore find the economy’s short-run equilibrium by finding the intersection of the $D D$ and $A A$ schedules. Once again, it is the assumption that domestic output prices are temporarily fixed that makes this intersection a short-run equilibrium. The analysis in this section continues to assume the foreign interest rate $R^{*}$ , the foreign price level $P^{*}$ , and the expected future exchange rate $E^{e}$ also are fixed.  

Figure 17-8 combines the $D D$ and $A A$ schedules to locate short-run equilibrium. The intersection of $D D$ and $A A$ at point 1 is the only combination of exchange rate and output consistent with both the equality of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and asset market equilibrium. The short-run equilibrium levels of the exchange rate and output are therefore $E^{1}$ and $Y^{1}$ .  

To convince yourself that the economy will indeed settle at point 1, imagine the economy is instead at a position like point 2 in Figure 17-9. At point 2, which lies above $A A$ and $D D$ , both the output and asset markets are out of equilibrium. Because $E$ is  

# FIGURE 17-8  

# Short-Run Equilibrium: The ­Intersection of DD and AA  

The short-run equilibrium of the economy occurs at point 1, where the output market (whose equilibrium points are summarized by the $D D$ curve) and the asset market (whose equilibrium points are summarized by the $A A$ curve) simultaneously clear.  

![](images/2f509577f9c082524ff5cf3c0ac5d8bb26d064f328b70b7e23b0d3615a9b8a64.jpg)  

# FIGURE 17-9  

# How the Economy Reaches Its Short-Run Equilibrium  

Because asset markets adjust very quickly, the exchange rate jumps immediately from point 2 to point 3 on AA. The economy then moves to point 1 along $A A$ as output rises to meet aggregate demand.  

![](images/9cb8ba17ae562f43eafea59338602660a24d9f55519f84888c5a8e330b4d4c93.jpg)  

so high relative to $_{A A}$ , the rate at which $E$ is expected to fall in the future is also high relative to the rate that would maintain interest parity. The high expected future appreciation rate of the domestic currency implies that the expected domestic currency return on foreign deposits is below that on domestic deposits, so there is an excess demand for the domestic currency in the foreign exchange market. The high level of $E$ at point 2 also makes domestic goods cheap for foreign buyers (given the goods’ domestic currency prices), causing an excess demand for output at that point.  

The excess demand for domestic currency leads to an immediate fall in the exchange rate from $E^{2}$ to $E^{3}$ . This appreciation equalizes the expected returns on domestic and foreign deposits and places the economy at point 3 on the asset market equilibrium curve $A A$ . But since point 3 is above the $_{D D}$ schedule, there is still excess demand for domestic output. As firms raise production to avoid depleting their inventories, the economy travels along $_{A A}$ to point 1, where aggregate demand and supply are equal. Because asset prices can jump immediately while changes in production plans take some time, the asset markets remain in continual equilibrium even while output is changing.  

The exchange rate falls as the economy approaches point 1 along $A A$ because rising national output causes money demand to rise, pushing the interest rate steadily upward. (The currency must appreciate steadily to lower the expected rate of future domestic currency appreciation and maintain interest parity.) Once the economy has reached point 1 on $D D$ , aggregate demand equals output and producers no longer face involuntary inventory depletion. The economy therefore settles at point 1, the only point at which the output and asset markets clear.  

# Temporary Changes in Monetary and Fiscal Policy  

Now that we have seen how the economy’s short-run equilibrium is determined, we can study how shifts in government macroeconomic policies affect output and the exchange rate. Our interest in the effects of macroeconomic policies stems from their usefulness in counteracting economic disturbances that cause fluctuations in output, employment, and inflation. In this section, we learn how government policies can be used to maintain full employment in open economies.  

We concentrate on two types of government policy, monetary policy, which works through changes in the money supply, and fiscal policy, which works through changes in government spending or taxes.8 To avoid the complications that would be introduced by ongoing inflation, however, we do not look at situations in which the money supply grows over time. Thus, the only type of monetary policies we will study explicitly are one-shot increases or decreases in money supplies.9  

In this section, we examine temporary policy shifts, shifts that the public expects to be reversed in the near future. The expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , is now assumed to equal the long-run exchange rate discussed in Chapter 16, that is, the exchange rate that prevails once full employment is reached and domestic prices have adjusted fully to past disturbances in the output and asset markets. In line with this interpretation, a temporary policy change does not affect the long-run expected exchange rate, $E^{e}$ .  

We assume throughout that events in the economy we are studying do not influence the foreign interest rate, $R^{*}$ , or price level, $P^{*}$ , and that the domestic price level, $P$ , is fixed in the short run.  

# Monetary Policy  

The short-run effect of a temporary increase in the domestic money supply is shown in Figure 17-10. An increased money supply shifts $A A^{1}$ upward to $\bar{\mathbf{\nabla}}_{A}\Bar{A^{2}}$ but does not affect the position of $_{D D}$ . The upward shift of the asset market equilibrium schedule moves the economy from point 1, with exchange rate $E^{1}$ and output $Y^{1}$ , to point 2, with exchange rate $E^{2}$ and output $Y^{2}$ . An increase in the money supply causes a depreciation of the domestic currency, an expansion of output, and therefore an increase in employment.  

We can understand the economic forces causing these results by recalling our earlier discussions of asset market equilibrium and output determination. At the initial output level $Y^{1}$ and given the fixed price level, an increase in money supply must push down the home interest rate, $R$ . We have been assuming that the monetary change is temporary and does not affect the expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , so to preserve interest parity in the face of a decline in $R$ (given that the foreign interest rate, $R^{*}$ , does not change), the exchange rate must depreciate immediately to create the expectation that the home currency will appreciate in the future at a faster rate than was expected before $R$ fell. The immediate depreciation of the domestic currency, however, makes home products cheaper relative to foreign products. There is therefore an increase in aggregate demand, which must be matched by an increase in output.  

# Fiscal Policy  

As we saw earlier, expansionary fiscal policy can take the form of an increase in ­government spending, a cut in taxes, or some combination of the two that raises ­aggregate demand. A temporary fiscal expansion (which does not affect the expected future exchange rate) therefore shifts the $_{D D}$ schedule to the right but does not move AA.  

# FIGURE 17-10 Effects of a Temporary Increase in the Money Supply  

By shifting $A A^{1}$ upward, a temporary increase in the money supply causes a currency depreciation and a rise in output.  

![](images/5c4c33f7f683a0f25e00fc2c492d4dbacfe8edcacb8fc5712dc4dcbb4092bf34.jpg)  

# FIGURE 17-11 Effects of a Temporary Fiscal Expansion  

By shifting $D D^{1}$ to the right, a temporary fiscal expansion causes a currency appreciation and a rise in output.  

![](images/250979c06abde283aa6f39eb0bfd5d065987ec46550e5683bfd343804eddcf2d.jpg)  

Figure 17-11 shows how expansionary fiscal policy affects the economy in the short run. Initially the economy is at point 1, with an exchange rate $E^{1}$ and output $Y^{1}$ . ­Suppose the government decides to spend $\$30$ billion to develop a new space shuttle. This one-time increase in government purchases moves the economy to point 2, causing the currency to appreciate to $E^{2}$ and output to expand to $Y^{2}$ . The economy would respond in a similar way to a temporary cut in taxes.  

What economic forces produce the movement from point 1 to point 2? The increase in output caused by the increase in government spending raises the transactions demand for real money holdings. Given the fixed price level, this increase in money demand pushes the interest rate, $R$ , upward. Because the expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , and the foreign interest rate, $R^{*}$ , have not changed, the domestic currency must appreciate to create the expectation of a subsequent depreciation just large enough to offset the higher international interest rate difference in favor of domestic currency deposits.  

# Policies to Maintain Full Employment  

The analysis of this section can be applied to the problem of maintaining full employment in open economies. Because temporary monetary expansion and temporary fiscal expansion both raise output and employment, they can be used to counteract the effects of temporary disturbances that lead to recession. Similarly, disturbances that lead to overemployment can be offset through contractionary macroeconomic policies.  

Figure 17-12 illustrates this use of macroeconomic policy. Suppose the economy’s initial equilibrium is at point 1, where output equals its full-employment level, denoted $Y^{f}.$ . Suddenly there is a temporary shift in consumer tastes away from domestic ­products. As we saw earlier in this chapter, such a shift is a decrease in aggregate demand for domestic goods, and it causes the curve $D D^{1}$ to shift leftward, to $D D^{2}$ . At point 2, the  

# FIGURE 17-12  

# Maintaining Full Employment after a Temporary Fall in World Demand for Domestic Products  

A temporary fall in world demand shifts $D D^{1}$ to $D D^{2}.$ , reducing output from $\gamma^{f}$ to $Y^{2}$ and causing the currency to depreciate from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ (point 2). Temporary fiscal expansion can restore full employment (point 1) by shifting the $D D$ schedule back to its original position. Temporary monetary expansion can restore full employment (point 3) by shifting $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2}$ . The two policies differ in their exchange rate effects: The fiscal policy restores the currency to its previous value $\left(E^{1}\right)$ , whereas the monetary policy causes the currency to depreciate further, to $E^{3}$ .  

![](images/72b49cb98a39566b3347b63882237af8820a4f1592c5339067aedb4f738f744d.jpg)  

new short-run equilibrium, the currency has depreciated to $E^{2}$ and output, at $Y^{2}$ , is below its full-employment level: The economy is in a recession. Because the shift in preferences is assumed to be temporary, it does not affect $E^{e}$ , so there is no change in the position of $A A^{1}$ .  

To restore full employment, the government may use monetary or fiscal policy, or both. A temporary fiscal expansion shifts $D D^{2}$ back to its original position, restoring full employment and returning the exchange rate to $E^{1}$ . A temporary money supply increase shifts the asset market equilibrium curve to $A A^{2}$ and places the economy at point 3, a move that restores full employment but causes the home currency to depreciate even further.  

Another possible cause of recession is a temporary increase in the demand for money, illustrated in Figure 17-13. An increase in money demand pushes up the domestic interest rate and appreciates the currency, thereby making domestic goods more expensive and causing output to contract. Figure 17-13 shows this asset market disturbance as the downward shift of $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2}$ , which moves the economy from its initial, full-employment equilibrium at point 1 to point 2.  

Expansionary macroeconomic policies can again restore full employment. A temporary money supply increase shifts the $_{A A}$ curve back to $A A^{1}$ and returns the economy to its initial position at point 1. This temporary increase in money supply completely offsets the increase in money demand by giving domestic residents the additional money they desire to hold. Temporary fiscal expansion shifts $D D^{1}$ to $D D^{2}$ and restores full employment at point 3. But the move to point 3 involves an even greater appreciation of the currency.  

# FIGURE 17-13  

# Policies to Maintain Full Employment after a Money Demand Increase  

After a temporary money demand increase (shown by the shift from $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2})$ , either an increase in the money supply or temporary fiscal expansion can be used to maintain full employment. The two policies have different exchange rate effects: The monetary policy restores the exchange rate back to $E^{1}$ , whereas the fiscal policy leads to greater appreciation $\left(E^{3}\right)$ .  

![](images/b3599d55c3ab66addd98d19d237d7bf1e6160f209cff61ddf83e8aa41c3e6a70.jpg)  

# Inflation Bias and Other Problems of Policy Formulation  

The apparent ease with which a government can maintain full employment in our model is misleading, and you should not come away from our discussion of policy with the idea that it is easy to keep the macroeconomy on a steady course. Here are just a few of the many problems that can arise:  

1.	 Sticky nominal prices not only give a government the power to raise output when it is abnormally low but also may tempt it to create a politically useful economic boom, say, just before a close election. This temptation causes problems when workers and firms anticipate it in advance, for they will raise wage demands and prices in the expectation of expansionary policies. The government will then find itself in the position of having to use expansionary policy tools merely to prevent the recession that higher domestic prices otherwise would cause! As a result, macroeconomic policy can display an ­inflation bias, leading to high inflation but no average gain in output. Such an increase in inflation occurred in the United States, as well as in many other countries, during the 1970s. The inflation bias problem has led to a search for institutions—for example, central banks that operate independently of the government in power—that might convince market actors that government policies will not be used in a shortsighted way, at the expense of long-term price stability. As we noted in Chapter 15, many central banks throughout the world now seek to reach announced target levels of (low) ­inflation. Chapters 21 and 22 will discuss some of these efforts in greater detail.10  

2.	 In practice, it is sometimes hard to be sure whether a disturbance to the economy originates in the output or the asset markets. Yet a government concerned about the exchange rate effect of its policy response needs to know the source of the disturbance before it can choose between monetary and fiscal policy.   
3.	 Real-world policy choices are frequently determined by bureaucratic necessities rather than by detailed consideration of whether shocks to the economy are real (that is, they originate in the output market) or monetary. Shifts in fiscal policy often can be made only after lengthy legislative deliberation, while monetary policy is usually exercised expeditiously by the central bank. To avoid procedural delays, governments are likely to respond to disturbances by changing monetary policy even when a shift in fiscal policy would be more appropriate.   
4.	 Another problem with fiscal policy is its impact on the government budget. A tax cut or spending increase may lead to a larger government budget deficit, which must sooner or later be closed by a fiscal reversal, as happened following the ­multibillion-dollar fiscal stimulus package sponsored by the Obama administration in the United States in 2009. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee the government will have the political will to synchronize these actions with the state of the business cycle. The state of the electoral cycle may be more important, as we have seen.   
5.	 Policies that appear to act swiftly in our simple model operate in reality with lags of varying lengths. At the same time, the difficulty of evaluating the size and persistence of a given shock makes it hard to know precisely how much monetary or fiscal medicine to administer. These uncertainties force policy makers to base their actions on forecasts and hunches that may turn out to be quite wide of the mark.  

# Permanent Shifts in Monetary and Fiscal Policy  

A permanent policy shift affects not only the current value of the government’s policy instrument (the money supply, government spending, or taxes) but also the long-run exchange rate. This in turn affects expectations about future exchange rates. Because these changes in expectations have a major influence on the exchange rate prevailing in the short run, the effects of permanent policy shifts differ from those of temporary shifts. In this section, we look at the effects of permanent changes in monetary and fiscal policy, in both the short and long runs.11  

To make it easier to grasp the long-run effects of policies, we assume the economy is initially at a long-run equilibrium position and that the policy changes we examine are the only economic changes that occur (our usual “other things equal” clause). These assumptions mean that the economy starts out at full employment with the exchange rate at its long-run level and with no change in the exchange rate expected. In particular, we know that the domestic interest rate must initially equal the foreign rate, $R^{*}$ .  

# A Permanent Increase in the Money Supply  

Figure 17-14 shows the short-run effects of a permanent increase in the money supply on an economy initially at its full-employment output level $Y^{f}$ (point 1). As we saw earlier, even a temporary increase in $M^{s}$ causes the asset market equilibrium schedule to shift upward from $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2}$ . Because the increase in $M^{s}$ is now permanent, however, it also affects the exchange rate expected for the future, $E^{e}$ . Chapter 15 showed how a permanent increase in the money supply affects the long-run exchange  

# FIGURE 17-14  

# Short-Run Effects of a Permanent Increase in the Money Supply  

A permanent increase in the money supply, which shifts $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2}$ and moves the economy from point 1 to point 2, has stronger effects on the exchange rate and output than an equal temporary increase, which moves the economy only to point 3.  

![](images/ad3747be56b6061df4aaa49b8f1825c1508d3674d6347a0d3c7a609208f93b55.jpg)  

rate: A permanent increase in $M^{s}$ must ultimately lead to a proportional rise in $E$ . Therefore, the permanent rise in $M^{s}$ causes $E^{e}$ , the expected future exchange rate, to rise proportionally.  

Because a rise in $E^{e}$ accompanies a permanent increase in the money supply, the upward shift of $A A^{1}$ to $A A^{2}$ is greater than that caused by an equal, but transitory, increase. At point 2, the economy’s new short-run equilibrium, $Y$ and $E$ are both higher than they would be were the change in the money supply temporary. (Point 3 shows the equilibrium that might result from a temporary increase in $M^{s}$ .)  

# Adjustment to a Permanent Increase in the Money Supply  

The central bank does not reverse the increase in the money supply shown in Figure 17-14, so it is natural to ask how the economy is affected over time. At the short-run equilibrium, shown as point 2 in Figure 17-14, output is above its full-employment level and labor and machines are working overtime. Upward pressure on the price level develops as workers demand higher wages and producers raise prices to cover their increasing production costs. Chapter 15 showed that while an increase in the money supply must eventually cause all money prices to rise in proportion, it has no lasting effect on output, relative prices, or interest rates. Over time, the inflationary pressure that follows a permanent money supply expansion pushes the price level to its new long-run value and returns the economy to full employment.  

Figure 17-15 will help you visualize the adjustment back to full employment. ­Whenever output is greater than its full-employment level, $Y^{f},$ , and productive factors are working overtime, the price level $P$ is rising to keep up with rising production costs. Although the $_{D D}$ and $A A$ schedules are drawn for a constant price level $P$ , we have seen how increases in $P$ cause the schedules to shift. A rise in $P$ makes domestic goods more expensive relative to foreign goods, discouraging exports and encouraging imports.  

# FIGURE 17-15  

# Long-Run Adjustment to a Permanent Increase in the Money Supply  

After a permanent money supply increase, a steadily increasing price level shifts the $D D$ and $\mathbf{\nabla}A A$ schedules to the left until a new longrun equilibrium (point 3) is reached.  

![](images/e9e9a4d412f85283a2180bb25a543815aa9918630dd872bc23ad6a2c0d4510d8.jpg)  

A rising domestic price level therefore causes $D D^{1}$ to shift to the left over time. Because a rising price level steadily reduces the real money supply over time, $A A^{2}$ also travels to the left as prices rise.  

The $_{D D}$ and $A A$ schedules stop shifting only when they intersect at the fullemployment output level $Y^{f}.$ ; as long as output differs from $Y^{f},$ , the price level will change and the two schedules will continue to shift. The schedules’ final positions are shown in Figure 17-15 as $D D^{2}$ and $A A^{3}$ . At point 3, their intersection, the exchange rate, $E_{\ast}$ , and the price level, $P$ , have risen in proportion to the increase in the money supply, as required by the long-run neutrality of money. $\cdot_{A A^{2}}$ does not shift all the way back to its original position because $E^{e}$ is permanently higher after a permanent increase in the money supply: It too has risen by the same percentage as $M^{s}$ .)  

Notice that along the adjustment path between the initial short-run equilibrium (point 2) and the long-run equilibrium (point 3), the domestic currency actually appreciates (from $E^{2}$ to $E^{3}$ ) following its initial sharp depreciation (from $E^{1}$ to $E^{2}$ ). This exchange rate behavior is an example of the overshooting phenomenon discussed in Chapter 15, in which the exchange rate’s initial response to some change is greater than its long-run response.12  

We can draw on our conclusions to describe the proper policy response to a permanent monetary disturbance. A permanent increase in money demand, for example, can be offset with a permanent increase of equal magnitude in the money supply. Such a policy maintains full employment, but because the price level would fall in the absence of the policy, the policy will not have inflationary consequences. Instead, monetary expansion can move the economy straight to its long-run, full-employment position.  

Keep in mind, however, that it is hard in practice to diagnose the origin or persistence of a particular shock to the economy.  

# A Permanent Fiscal Expansion  

A permanent fiscal expansion not only has an immediate impact in the output market but also affects the asset markets through its impact on long-run exchange rate expectations. Figure 17-16 shows the short-run effects of a government decision to spend an extra $\$10$ billion a year on its space travel program forever. As before, the direct effect of this rise in $G$ on aggregate demand causes $D D^{1}$ to shift right to $D D^{2}$ . But because the increase in government demand for domestic goods and services is permanent in this case, it causes a long-run appreciation of the currency, as we saw in Chapter 16. The resulting fall in $E^{e}$ pushes the asset market equilibrium schedule $A A^{1}$ downward to $A A^{2}$ . Point 2, where the new schedules $D D^{2}$ and $\dot{}A A^{2}$ intersect, is the economy’s short-run equilibrium, and at that point the currency has appreciated to $E^{2}$ from its initial level while output is unchanged at $Y^{f}$ .  

The important result illustrated in Figure 17-16 is that when a fiscal expansion is permanent, the additional currency appreciation caused by the shift in exchange rate expectations reduces the policy’s expansionary effect on output. Without this additional expectations effect due to the permanence of the fiscal change, equilibrium would initially be at point 3, with higher output and a smaller appreciation. The greater the downward shift of the asset market equilibrium schedule, the greater the appreciation of the currency. This appreciation “crowds out” aggregate demand for domestic products by making them more expensive relative to foreign products.  

Figure 17-16 is drawn to show a case in which fiscal expansion, contrary to what you might have guessed, has no net effect on output. This case is not, however, a special one; in fact, it is inevitable under the assumptions we have made. The argument that  

# FIGURE 17-16  

# Effects of a Permanent Fiscal Expansion  

Because a permanent fiscal expansion changes exchange rate expectations, it shifts $A A^{1}$ leftward as it shifts $D D^{1}$ to the right. The effect on output (point 2) is nil if the economy starts in long-run equilibrium. A comparable temporary fiscal expansion, in contrast, would leave the economy at point 3.  

![](images/e044d7aa71e2a0f67ab9c80f2f7d2d3b04408dd90a11ff188cf685d60fc51b71.jpg)  

establishes this point requires five steps; by taking the time to understand them, you will solidify your understanding of the ground we have covered so far:  

1.	 As a first step, convince yourself (perhaps by reviewing Chapter 15) that because the fiscal expansion does not affect the money supply, $M^{s}$ ; the long-run values of the domestic interest rate (which equals the foreign interest rate); or output $Y^{f}.$ , it can have no impact on the long-run price level.   
2.	 Next, recall our assumption that the economy starts out in long-run equilibrium with the domestic interest rate, $R$ , just equal to the foreign rate, $R^{*}$ , and output equal to $\boldsymbol{Y}^{f},$ . Observe also that the fiscal expansion leaves the real money supply, $M^{s}/P$ , unchanged in the short run (that is, neither the numerator nor the denominator changes).   
3.	 Now imagine, contrary to what Figure 17-16 shows, that output did rise above $\boldsymbol{Y}^{f},$ . Because $M^{s}/P$ doesn’t change in the short run (Step 2), the domestic interest rate, $R$ , would have to rise above its initial level of $R^{*}$ to keep the money market in equilibrium. Since the foreign interest rate remains at $R^{*}$ , however, a rise in $Y$ to any level above $Y^{f}$ implies an expected depreciation of the domestic currency (by interest parity).   
4.	 Notice next that something is wrong with this conclusion. We already know (from Step 1) that the long-run price level is not affected by the fiscal expansion, so people can expect a nominal domestic currency depreciation just after the policy change only if the currency depreciates in real terms as the economy returns to longrun equilibrium. Such a real depreciation, by making domestic products relatively cheap, would only worsen the initial situation of overemployment that we have imagined to exist and thus would prevent output from ever actually returning to $Y^{f}$ .   
5.	 Finally, conclude that the apparent contradiction is resolved only if output does not rise at all after the fiscal policy move. The only logical possibility is that the currency appreciates right away to its new long-run value. This appreciation crowds out just enough net export demand to leave output at the full-employment level despite the higher level of $G$ .  

Notice that this exchange rate change, which allows the output market to clear at full employment, leaves the asset markets in equilibrium as well. Since the exchange rate has jumped to its new long-run value, $R$ remains at $R^{*}$ . With output also at $Y^{f},$ however, the long-run money market equilibrium condition $M^{s}/P=L(R^{*},Y^{f})$ still holds, as it did before the fiscal action. So our story hangs together: The currency appreciation that a permanent fiscal expansion provokes immediately brings the asset markets as well as the output market to positions of long-run equilibrium.  

We conclude that if the economy starts at long-run equilibrium, a permanent change in fiscal policy has no net effect on output. Instead, it causes an immediate and permanent exchange rate jump that offsets exactly the fiscal policy’s direct effect on aggregate demand. A fall in net export demand counteracts the rise in government demand.  

# Macroeconomic Policies and the Current Account  

Policy makers are often concerned about the level of the current account. As we will discuss more fully in Chapter 19, an excessive imbalance in the current account—either a surplus or a deficit—may have undesirable long-run effects on national welfare. Large external imbalances may also generate political pressures for governments to impose restrictions on trade. It is therefore important to know how monetary and fiscal policies aimed at domestic objectives affect the current account.  

Figure 17-17 shows how the DD-AA model can be extended to illustrate the effects of macroeconomic policies on the current account. In addition to the $_{D D}$ and $A A$ curves, the figure contains a new curve, labeled $X X.$ , which shows combinations of the exchange rate and output at which the current account balance would be equal to some desired level, say $C A(E P^{*}/P,Y-T)=X.$ . The curve slopes upward because, other things equal, a rise in output encourages spending on imports and thus worsens the current account if it is not accompanied by a currency depreciation. Since the actual level of $C A$ can differ from $X.$ , the economy’s short-run equilibrium does not have to be on the $X X$ curve.  

The central feature of Figure 17-17 is that $X X$ is flatter than $_{D D}$ . The reason is seen by asking how the current account changes as we move up along the $D D$ curve from point 1, where all three curves intersect (so that, initially, $C A=X$ ). As we increase $Y$ in moving up along $_{D D}$ , the domestic demand for domestic output rises by less than the rise in output itself (since some income is saved and some spending falls on imports). Along $_{D D}$ , however, total aggregate demand has to equal supply. To prevent an excess supply of home output, $E$ therefore must rise sharply enough along $_{D D}$ to make export demand rise faster than import demand. In other words, net foreign demand—the current account—must rise sufficiently along $_{D D}$ as output rises to take up the slack left by domestic saving. Thus, to the right of point 1, $_{D D}$ is above the $X X$ curve, where $C A>X$ similar reasoning shows that to the left of point 1, $_{D D}$ lies below the $X X$ curve (where $C A<X$ ).  

We can now examine the current account effects of macroeconomic policies. As shown earlier, an increase in the money supply, for example, shifts the economy to a position like point 2, expanding output and depreciating the currency. Since point 2 lies above $X X.$ , the current account has improved as a result of the policy action. Monetary expansion causes the current account balance to increase in the short run.  

# FIGURE 17-17  

# How Macroeconomic Policies Affect the Current Account  

Along the curve $\chi\chi,$ the current account is constant at the level $C A=X$ . Monetary expansion moves the economy to point 2 and thus raises the current account balance. Temporary fiscal expansion moves the economy to point 3, while permanent fiscal expansion moves it to point 4; in either case, the current account balance falls.  

![](images/4fe70542a7a0355590787df7e5245b72e6f480d21644d357a6d40ae2fa997549.jpg)  

Consider next a temporary fiscal expansion. This action shifts $D D$ to the right and moves the economy to point 3 in the figure. Because the currency appreciates and income rises, there is a deterioration in the current account. A permanent fiscal expansion has the additional effect of shifting $A A$ leftward, producing an equilibrium at point 4. Like point 3, point 4 is below $X X$ , so once again the current account worsens, and by more than in the temporary case. Expansionary fiscal policy reduces the current account balance.  

# Gradual Trade Flow Adjustment and Current Account Dynamics  

An important assumption underlying the DD-AA model is that, other things equal, a real depreciation of the home currency immediately improves the current account while a real appreciation causes the current account immediately to worsen. In reality, however, the behavior underlying trade flows may be far more complex than we have so far suggested, involving dynamic elements—on the supply as well as the demand side—that lead the current account to adjust only gradually to exchange rate changes. In this section, we discuss some dynamic factors that seem important in explaining actual patterns of current account adjustment and indicate how their presence might modify the predictions of our model.  

# The J-Curve  

Sometimes a country’s current account worsens immediately after a real currency depreciation and begins to improve only some months later, contrary to the assumption we made in deriving the $_{D D}$ curve. If the current account initially worsens after a depreciation, its time path, shown in Figure 17-18, has an initial segment reminiscent of a J and we therefore call it the J-curve.  

The current account, measured in domestic output, can deteriorate sharply right after a real currency depreciation (the move from point 1 to point 2 in the figure) because most import and export orders are placed several months in advance. In the first few months after the depreciation, export and import volumes therefore may reflect buying decisions that were based on the old real exchange rate: The primary effect of the depreciation is to raise the value of the pre-contracted level of imports in terms of domestic products. Because exports measured in domestic output do not change, while imports measured in domestic output rise, there is an initial fall in the current account, as shown.  

Even after the old export and import contracts have been fulfilled, it still takes time for new shipments to adjust fully to the relative price change. On the production side, producers of exports may have to install additional plant and equipment and hire new workers. To the extent that imports consist of intermediate materials used in domestic manufacturing, import adjustment will also occur gradually as importers switch to new production techniques that economize on intermediate inputs. There are lags on the consumption side as well. To expand significantly foreign consumption of domestic exports, for example, it may be necessary to build new retailing outlets abroad, a timeconsuming process.  

The result of these lags in adjustment is the gradually improving current account shown in Figure 17-18 as the move from point 2 to point 3 and beyond. Eventually, the increase in the current account tapers off as the adjustment to the real depreciation is completed.  

# FIGURE 17-18 The J-Curve  

The J-curve describes the time lag with which a real currency depreciation improves the current account.  

![](images/4cf3014fb312517cf830c9b6ab1a34fa0d9f4741705b0377773beca6b356e2d7.jpg)  

Empirical evidence indicates for most industrial countries a J-curve lasting more than six months but less than a year. Thus, point 3 in the figure is typically reached within a year of the real depreciation, and the current account continues to improve afterward.13  

The existence of a significant J-curve effect forces us to modify some of our earlier conclusions, at least for the short run of a year or less. Monetary expansion, for example, can depress output initially by depreciating the home currency. In this case, it may take some time before an increase in the money supply results in an improved current account and therefore in higher aggregate demand.  

If expansionary monetary policy actually depresses output in the short run, the domestic interest rate will need to fall further than it normally would to clear the home money market. Correspondingly, the exchange rate will overshoot more sharply to create the larger expected domestic currency appreciation required for foreign exchange market equilibrium. By introducing an additional source of overshooting, J-curve effects amplify the volatility of exchange rates.  

# Exchange Rate Pass-Through and Inflation  

Our discussion of how the current account is determined in the DD-AA model has assumed that nominal exchange rate changes cause proportional changes in real exchange rates in the short run. Because the DD-AA model assumes that the nominal output prices $P$ and $P^{*}$ cannot suddenly jump, movements in the real exchange rate, $q=E P^{*}/P$ , correspond perfectly in the short run to movements in the nominal rate, $E$ . In reality, however, even the short-run correspondence between nominal and real exchange rate movements, while quite close, is less than perfect. To understand fully how nominal exchange rate movements affect the current account in the short run, we need to examine more closely the linkage between the nominal exchange rate and the prices of exports and imports.  

The domestic currency price of foreign output is the product of the exchange rate and the foreign currency price, or $E P^{*}$ . We have assumed until now that when $E$ rises, for example, $P^{*}$ remains fixed so that the domestic currency price of goods imported from abroad rises in proportion. The percentage by which import prices rise when the home currency depreciates by 1 percent is known as the degree of pass-through from the exchange rate to import prices. In the version of the DD-AA model we studied previously, the degree of pass-through is 1; any exchange rate change is passed through completely to import prices. (Of course, the situation is symmetric for a country’s trade partners, who face the import price $P/E$ in terms of foreign currency. With $P$ also fixed in the short run in our model, this implies a pass-through of 1 to the foreign prices of exports.) Contrary to the preceding assumption, however, exchange rate pass-through can be incomplete. One possible reason for incomplete pass-through is international market segmentation, which allows imperfectly competitive firms to price to market by charging different prices for the same product in different countries. (Recall Chapter 16’s section on “Explaining the Problems with PPP.”)For example, a large foreign firm supplying automobiles to the United States may be so worried about losing market share that it does not immediately raise its U.S. prices by 10 percent when the dollar depreciates by 10 percent despite the fact that its revenue from American sales, measured in its own currency, will decline. Similarly, the firm may hesitate to lower its U.S. prices by 10 percent after a dollar appreciation of that size because it can thereby earn higher profits without investing resources immediately in expanding its shipments to the United States. In either case, the firm may wait to find out if the currency movement reflects a definite trend before making price and production commitments that are costly to undo. In practice, many U.S. import prices tend to rise by only around half of a typical dollar depreciation over the following year.  

We thus see that while a permanent nominal exchange rate change may be fully reflected in import prices in the long run, the degree of pass-through may be far less than 1 in the short run. Incomplete pass-through will have complicated effects, however, on the timing of current account adjustment. On the one hand, the short-run J-curve effect of a nominal currency change will be dampened by a low responsiveness of import prices to the exchange rate. On the other hand, incomplete pass-through implies that currency movements have less-than-proportional effects on the relative prices determining trade volumes. The failure of relative prices to adjust quickly will in turn be accompanied by a slow adjustment of trade volumes. Notice also how the link between nominal and real exchange rates may be further weakened by domestic price responses. In highly inflationary economies, for example, it is difficult to alter the real exchange rate, $E P^{*}/P$ , simply by changing the nominal rate $E$ because the resulting increase in aggregate demand quickly sparks domestic inflation, which in turn raises $P$ . To the extent that a country’s export prices rise when its currency depreciates, any favorable effect on its competitive position in world markets will be dissipated. Such price increases, however, like partial pass-through, may weaken the J-curve.  

# Global Value Chains and Exchange Rate Effects on Export and Import Prices  

Much of international trade takes the form of intermediate products, which may be imported for incorporation into other goods that the importing country subsequently exports. We saw in Chapter 8 how FDI, outsourcing, and offshoring have led this process to accelerate in recent years. The result has been a web of complex global value chains, in which different countries produce portions of the value added in a final product. Under these arrangements, one country’s value added may cross borders many times at successive production stages before reaching its ultimate buyer. Figure 17-19 illustrates one key aspect of global value chains: for many countries, previously imported value accounts for a significant portion of the gross value of exports (so-called “backward linkages”). Another key aspect of global value chains is that a country’s exports may go on to be incorporated as inputs into several rounds of exports from other countries (so-called “forward linkages”).  

Backward and forward linkages can have important implications for the effects of exchange rate changes on export and import prices. To simplify the discussion, let’s assume that the pass-through of an exchange rate change to import prices is complete, that is, when a country’s currency depreciates, its import prices rise immediately in proportion to the depreciation. If the country has strong backward linkages, however, that assumption means that the price of the intermediate imports used to produce its exports will rise. As a result, the depreciation will have only a partial effect in lowering the export prices it charges to its trading partners. For example, suppose Italy exports bicycles priced at €500, but half of this cost represents inputs imported from other countries. Then if the euro depreciates by 10 percent against all other currencies, the euro price of the bicycle rises to €525, a 5 percent increase.  

Without this rise in the bicycle’s euro price, the 10 percent euro depreciation would lower its dollar price by 10 percent. With this rise in the euro price, though, the fall in the dollar price is only 10 percent - 5 percent $=5$ percent, that is, the fall in the dollar price of the euro less the rise in the euro price of the bicycle. The presence of backward linkages thus mutes the effect of currency depreciation on export prices—and thereby on net exports—of a given exchange rate change.

FIGURE 17-19

Forward linkages work in the same direction on the import side, though the effect is more roundabout. Because a currency depreciation lowers a country’s export prices, it will also lower the prices of imports that incorporate those exports as inputs. Even if the domestic-currency prices of imports rise fully in response to a home currency depreciation, given the foreign-currency prices of imports, the currency depreciation can lower the foreign-currency import prices themselves in the presence of global value chains. This effect will reduce the exchange rate’s impact in shifting demand away from imports and raising net exports.  

Can we conclude that global value chains make exchange rate adjustments less effective in shifting aggregate demand? The answer is: not necessarily. There is strong evidence that more complex global value chains go hand in hand with larger volumes of both imports and exports (which is why they have helped to raise the volume of global trade substantially, as Chapter 8 noted). The larger are trade volumes, however, the larger will be the macroeconomic impact of a change in the exchange rate on GDP. This trade volume effect may offset the backward and forward linkage effects, leaving the overall impact of exchange rate changes on demand and output more or less the same.14  

# The Current Account, Wealth, and Exchange Rate Dynamics  

Our theoretical model showed that a permanent fiscal expansion would cause both an appreciation of the currency and a current account deficit. Although our discussion earlier in this chapter focused on the role of price level movements in bringing the economy from its immediate position after a permanent policy change to its long-run position, the definition of the current account should alert you to another underlying dynamic: The net foreign wealth of an economy with a deficit is falling over time.  

# UNDERSTANDING PASS-THROUGH TO IMPORT AND EXPORT PRICES  

exchange rates to international prices is complex, is related to the market power of trading firms, and can differ over different horizons of price adjustment. But researchers have identified other critical factors that affect how economists should forecast both the short-run impact of macroeconomic policies and the likely price-level implications of exchange rate changes.  

One key factor is the currency in which internationally traded goods are invoiced, that is, the currency in which sellers quote their prices and receive payment. Just as the U.S. dollar is the key vehicle currency in the global foreign exchange market  (recall Chapter 14’s section on “The ­Foreign Exchange Market”), it is also the dominant invoice currency—even for trades that may not involve the United States. (The other common invoice currency is the euro, but it is far behind the dollar in importance.) Gita Gopinath of Harvard University has argued that traded-goods prices, measured in the invoice currency, are not very sensitive to that currency’s exchange rate up to a twoyear horizon.15 This fact implies an asymmetry between short-run exchange rate pass-through for invoice currency countries and others.  

For example, over 90 percent of U.S. imports and exports are invoiced in dollars. Because these prices are quite sticky when measured in dollars, a dollar depreciation has little effect on the import prices U.S. consumers and firms face, but the immediate pass-through to importers of U.S. goods, in terms of their own currencies, is close to 1. The implication is that dollar depreciation may boost U.S. exports immediately but have little impact on U.S. imports. Of course, foreign firms selling into the United States and invoicing in dollars will earn lower profits in terms of their own currencies (can you see why?) and as a result will desire to raise their goods’ U.S. prices over time to recoup their losses.  

In contrast, in 2015, only 13 percent of Japan’s imports originated in the United States, but fully 71 percent of those imports were invoiced in dollars (with only 24 percent of imports invoiced in the home currency, the yen). Thus, a depreciation of the yen against the dollar has a powerful impact on import prices. In contrast, Japanese exporting firms, which mostly do not invoice in yen, see little short-run effect on export prices but substantial effects on their export profits. In contrast to the United States, the main channel for net export adjustment to an exchange rate change may, in the short run at least, be import rather than export adjustment—just the opposite as in the case of the United States.  

Invoice currencies provide only one complication in the analysis of pass-through. In addition, the relationship between an exchange rate change and subsequent price developments also depends on exactly why the exchange rate has changed, as Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology points out.16 For example, if the dollar weakens because of a fall in U.S. aggregate demand, thereby reducing the profits of firms that export to the United States, those firms may not wish to raise their dollar prices aggressively. In this case, pass-through will therefore look low. The response will be different if the depreciation results from a factor that simultaneously raises demand for U.S. output, such as a global shift in portfolio preferences toward nondollar assets.  

Recall that in Chapter 14 (our section on “Equilibrium in the Foreign Exchange Market”), we observed that in the real world, the exchange rate effect of an interest rate change depends on why the interest rate is changing. Similarly, the sequel to an exchange rate change will depend on the underlying economic factors that cause the change.  

Although we have not explicitly incorporated wealth effects into our model, we would expect people’s consumption to fall as their wealth falls. Because a country with a current account deficit is transferring wealth to foreigners, domestic consumption is falling over time and foreign consumption is rising. What are the exchange rate effects of this international redistribution of consumption demand in favor of foreigners? Foreigners have a relative preference for consuming the goods that they produce, and as a result, the relative world demand for home goods will fall and the home currency will tend to depreciate in real terms.  

This longer-run perspective leads to a more complicated picture of the real exchange rate’s evolution following a permanent change such as a fiscal expansion. Initially, the home currency will appreciate as the current account balance falls sharply. But then, over time, the currency will begin to depreciate as market participants’ expectations focus increasingly on the current account’s effect on relative international wealth levels.17  

# The Liquidity Trap  

During the lengthy Great Depression of the 1930s, the nominal interest rate hit zero in the United States, and the country found itself caught in what economists call a liquidity trap.  

Recall from Chapter 15 that money is the most liquid of assets, unique in the ease with which it can be exchanged for goods. A liquidity trap is a trap because, once an economy’s nominal interest rate falls to zero, the central bank will face great difficulty in reducing it further by increasing the money supply (that is, by increasing the economy’s liquidity). Why? At negative nominal interest rates, people would find money strictly preferable to bonds, and bonds therefore would be in excess supply. While a zero interest rate may please borrowers who can borrow for free, it worries makers of macroeconomic policy, who are trapped in a situation where they may no longer be able to steer the economy through conventional monetary expansion. Economists therefore recommend that if possible, central banks avoid the zero lower bound (ZLB) on the nominal interest rate.  

While it is very difficult for central banks to reduce the nominal interest rate below zero, there may be limited scope to do so. Starting in 2014, several major central banks, most prominently the European Central Bank, started to push nominal interest rates into negative territory, effectively by charging commercial banks on the cash they hold at the central bank. With cash paying a nominal interest of 0 percent, why would anyone want to hold a deposit paying a negative nominal interest rate, however small? The answer is related to the risks of holding large amounts of cash, such as theft or fire, as well as the costs of buying a large safe or renting space in someone else’s. (Sales of safes have, however, risen in some countries!)  

At some point, of course, if the interest rate becomes negative enough, it will still begin to pay to switch to cash despite these costs. As a result, there is a limit to how low nominal interest rates can go—many economists would put that limit somewhere between $^{-1}$ and $^{-2}$ percent, although the number is likely to be different in different economies. Taking account of the possibility of somewhat negative interest rates, economists refer to the effective lower bound (ELB) rather than ZLB, with the economy entering a liquidity trap once it is at the ELB. In the rest of the book we will largely ignore the difference between the ZLB and ELB for the sake of simplicity and associate the liquidity trap with an interest rate that is stuck at the ZLB.  

Economists thought liquidity traps were a thing of the past until Japan fell into one in the late 1990s. Despite a dramatic lowering of interest rates by the country’s central bank, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the country’s economy has stagnated and suffered deflation (a falling price level) since at least the mid-1990s. By 1999, the country’s short-term interest rates had effectively reached zero. In September 2004, for example, the Bank of Japan reported that the overnight interest rate (the one most immediately affected by monetary policy) was only 0.001 percent per year.  

Seeing signs of economic recovery, the BOJ raised interest rates slightly starting in 2006 but retreated back toward zero as a global financial crisis gathered force late in 2008 (see Chapter 19). That crisis also hit the United States hard, and as Figure 14-2 (in the Chapter 14 section on “The Demand for Foreign Currency Assets”) suggests, interest rates then plummeted toward zero in the United States as well as in Japan. Simultaneously, other central banks throughout the world slashed their own rates dramatically. The liquidity trap had gone global.  

The dilemma a central bank faces when the economy is in a liquidity trap slowdown can be seen by considering the interest parity condition when the domestic interest rate $R=0$ ,  

$$
R=0=R^{*}+(E^{e}-E)/E.
$$  

Assume for the moment that the expected future exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , is fixed. Suppose the central bank raises the domestic money supply so as to depreciate the currency temporarily (that is, to raise $E$ today but return the exchange rate to the level $E^{e}$ later). The interest parity condition shows that $E$ cannot rise once $R=0$ because the interest rate would have to become negative. Instead, despite the increase in the money supply, the exchange rate remains steady at the level  

$$
E=E^{e}/(1-R^{*}).
$$  

The currency cannot depreciate further.  

How is this possible? Our usual argument that a temporary increase in the money supply reduces the interest rate (and depreciates the currency) rests on the assumption that people will add money to their portfolios only if bonds become less attractive to hold. At an interest rate of $R=0$ , however, people are indifferent about trades between bonds and money—both yield a nominal rate of return rate equal to zero. An openmarket purchase of bonds for money, say, will not disturb the markets: People will be happy to accept the additional money in exchange for their bonds with no change in the interest rate from zero and, thus, no change in the exchange rate. In contrast to the case we examined earlier in this chapter, an increase in the money supply will have no effect on the economy! A central bank that progressively reduces the money supply by selling bonds will eventually succeed in pushing the interest rate up—the economy cannot function without some money—but that possibility is not helpful when the economy is in a slump and a fall in interest rates is the medicine that it needs.  

Figure 17-20 shows how the DD-AA diagram can be modified to depict the region of potential equilibrium positions involving a liquidity trap. The $D D$ schedule is the same, but the $A A$ schedule now has a flat segment at levels of output so low that the money market finds its equilibrium at an interest rate $R$ equal to zero. The flat segment of $A A$ shows the currency cannot depreciate beyond the level $E^{e}/(1-R^{*})$ . At the equilibrium point 1 in the diagram, output is trapped at a level $Y^{1}$ that is below the full-employment level $Y^{f}$ .  

Let’s consider next how an open-market expansion of the money supply works in this strange, zero-interest world. Although we do not show it in Figure 17-20, that action would shift $A A$ to the right: At an unchanged exchange rate, higher output $Y$ raises money demand, leaving people content to hold the additional money at the unchanged interest rate $R=0$ . The horizontal stretch of $A A$ becomes longer as a result. With more money in circulation, real output and money demand can rise further than before without driving the nominal interest rate to a positive level. (Eventually, as $Y$ rises even further, increased money demand results in progressively higher interest rates $R$ and therefore in progressive currency appreciation along the downward-sloping segment of $A A.$ .) The surprising result is that the equilibrium simply remains at point 1. Monetary expansion thus has no effect on output or the exchange rate. This is the sense in which the economy is “trapped.”  

Our earlier assumption that the expected future exchange rate is fixed is a key ingredient in this liquidity trap story. Suppose the central bank can credibly promise to raise the money supply permanently, so that $E^{e}$ rises at the same time as the current money  

# FIGURE 17-20  

# A Low-Output Liquidity Trap  

At point 1, output is below its full employment level. Because exchange rate expectations $E^{\mathrm{e}}$ are fixed, however, a monetary expansion will merely shift $\mathbf{\nabla}A A$ to the right, leaving the initial equilibrium point the same. The horizontal stretch of $A A$ gives rise to the liquidity trap.  

![](images/f5430b6e3a29659e3f1ba29e1c0647c7ec223b6a37e69522907df70a839297d5.jpg)  

supply. In that case, the $A A$ schedule will shift up as well as to the right, output will therefore expand, and the currency will depreciate. Observers of Japan’s experience have argued, however, that BOJ officials were so fearful of depreciation and inflation (as were many central bankers during the early 1930s) that markets did not believe the officials would be willing to depreciate the currency permanently. Instead, markets suspected an intention to restore an appreciated exchange rate later on and treated any monetary expansion as temporary. Only in the first half of 2013 did the Japanese government finally announce a credible intention to expand the money supply enough, and keep interest rates at zero long enough, to attain a 2 percent rate of annual inflation. At that point the yen depreciated sharply.18  

With the United States and Japan maintaining interest rates at zero or very close to it through 2016, some economists feared the Fed would be powerless to stop an American deflation similar to Japan’s. The Fed and other central banks responded by adopting what came to be called unconventional monetary policies, in which the central bank buys specific categories of assets with newly issued money, greatly increasing the money supply in the process. One such policy involves purchasing long-term government bonds so as to reduce long-term interest rates. Those rates play a big role in determining the interest charged for home loans, and when they fall, housing demand therefore rises. Another possible unconventional policy, which we will discuss in Chapter 18, is the purchase of foreign exchange.  

# How Big Is the Government Spending Multiplier?  

Many students first encounter the government spending multiplier during their initial exposure to macroeconomics. The multiplier measures the size of the increase in output caused by an increase in government spending, or in symbols, $\Delta Y/\Delta G$ .  

While at first glance it may seem that the multiplier is big, students quickly learn about factors that can reduce its size. If an increase in government spending also leads to an increase in the interest rate and this, in turn, discourages spending on consumption and investment, then the multiplier is smaller: A part of the potential expansionary impact of the fiscal policy is “crowded out” by the rise in the interest rate.  

In the open economy, the multiplier is smaller still. Some private spending leaks out of the economy through imports, and if the exchange rate appreciates, then as we have seen in this chapter, the resulting reduction in net exports is an additional channel for crowding out.  

Finally, under conditions of price flexibility and full employment, the multiplier is essentially zero: If the government wishes to consume more and resources are already fully employed in production, then the private sector must part with the output that the government wants. There is no way to get much more out of the existing, fully employed stocks of productive factors, and so $\Delta Y/\Delta G\approx0$ .  

Uncertainty about the multiplier’s size raised concerns outside academia once the world slipped into recession in 2008 owing to the global financial crisis that we will discuss in later chapters (starting with Chapter 19). Massive fiscal expansion again came into play due to the COVID-19 crisis of 2020. The United States, China, and other countries mounted big programs of fiscal expansion, including increased government spending, to prop up their stricken economies. Were these resources wasted, or were they helpful in reducing the severity of the slump? Would it be easy or painful later on to reduce government spending in order to roll back the government deficits the recession caused? The answers depended on the size of the government spending multiplier.  

Economists have been studying the question of the multiplier’s size for years, but the severity of the 2008–2009 recession inspired a new crop of theoretical and empirical studies. We saw earlier that in the open economy, permanent government spending has no impact on output—the multiplier is zero—but temporary government spending can raise output (recall Figure 17-16). Countercyclical fiscal expansion is most likely to be temporary (because the recession is temporary), and so this is also the case focused upon by recent research.  

In an exhaustive survey, Robert E. Hall of Stanford University suggests that most studies find a multiplier between 0.5 and 1.0 (see his paper in Further Readings). That is, when the government raises its consumption by $\$1$ , the resulting increase in output will be at most $\$1$ —smaller than the big multipliers of the simplest closed-economy models, but still an effect likely to have a substantial positive impact on employment.  

We saw earlier, however, that in 2009, many industrial economies lowered their interest rates dramatically, sometimes entering liquidity traps with zero rates of interest. Hall explained that this situation is exceptional because the usual “crowding out” does not occur, and he thought that for economies in liquidity traps the multiplier might be as high as 1.7. Lawrence Christiano, Martin ­Eichenbaum, and Sergio Rebelo of Northwestern University have suggested a much higher number based on their theoretical modeling: While below 1 normally, their multiplier can be as high as 3.7 in a liquidity trap! Alan Auerbach and Yuriy Gorodnichenko of the University of California, Berkeley, analyze data from the (mostly wealthy) member countries of the Organization for Economic ­Cooperation and Development and find that for economies in recession (though not necessarily in a liquidity trap), the multiplier is about 2.19  

Our model of the liquidity trap allows us to see easily that the multiplier is larger when the interest rate is held at zero, and it also yields an interesting additional prediction for the open-economy case. Not only is there no crowding out through the interest rate, there is also no crowding out through the exchange rate. Figure 17-16 shows the output effect of a temporary increase in $C$ under normal (positive interest rate) conditions. Compare this with the effect on Y of a similar spending increase in Figure 17-20 (assuming $R$ remains at zero). Because (by assumption) the expected future exchange rate $E^{\mathrm{e}}$ does not change when the rise in $C$ is temporary, DD simply slides to the right along the horizontal portion of $A A,$ which itself does not shift. Neither the interest rate nor the expected future exchange rate changes in Figure 17-20, so interest parity implies that the current exchange rate cannot change either. In Figure 17-16, in contrast, the increase in output raises money demand, pushing up $R$ and appreciating the currency. Because the currency appreciation reduces net exports, thereby limiting the net positive effect on output, the multiplier is smaller in Figure 17-16 than in Figure 17-20. In Figure 17-20, in fact, the multiplier is the same as under a fixed exchange rate, a case that we will examine in Chapter 18.  

One region where the multiplier’s size became a topic of contentious debate was Europe, where countries simultaneously cut government spending sharply after 2009 in order to reduce public deficits and debts. Our discussion of the multiplier might lead you to believe that the effects were highly contractionary. This is exactly what happened, as we shall see in Chapter 21.  

■■ The aggregate demand for an open economy’s output consists of four components corresponding to the four components of GNP: consumption demand, investment demand, government demand, and the current account (net export demand). An important determinant of the current account is the real exchange rate, the ratio of the foreign price level (measured in domestic currency) to the domestic price level.  

■■ Output is determined in the short run by the equality of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. When aggregate demand is greater than output, firms increase production to avoid unintended inventory depletion. When aggregate demand is less than output, firms cut back production to avoid unintended accumulation of inventories. ■■ The economy’s short-run equilibrium occurs at the exchange rate and output level where—given the price level, the expected future exchange rate, and foreign economic conditions—aggregate demand equals aggregate supply and the asset markets are in equilibrium. In a diagram with the exchange rate and real output on its axes, the short-run equilibrium can be visualized as the intersection of an upward-sloping DD schedule, along which the output market clears, and a downward-sloping $_{A A}$ schedule, along which the asset markets clear.  

■■ A temporary increase in the money supply, which does not alter the long-run expected nominal exchange rate, causes a depreciation of the currency and a rise in output. Temporary fiscal expansion also results in a rise in output, but it causes the currency to appreciate. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can be used by the government to offset the effects of disturbances to output and employment. Temporary monetary expansion is powerless to raise output or move the exchange rate, however, when the economy is in a liquidity trap with the nominal interest rate at the zero lower bound.   
■■ Permanent shifts in the money supply, which do alter the long-run expected nominal exchange rate, cause sharper exchange rate movements and therefore have stronger short-run effects on output than transitory shifts. If the economy is at full employment, a permanent increase in the money supply leads to a rising price level, which ultimately reverses the effect on the real exchange rate of the nominal exchange rate’s initial depreciation. In the long run, output returns to its initial level and all money prices rise in proportion to the increase in the money supply.   
■■ Because permanent fiscal expansion changes the long-run expected exchange rate, it causes a sharper currency appreciation than an equal temporary expansion. If the economy starts out in long-run equilibrium, the additional appreciation makes domestic goods and services so expensive that the resulting “crowding out” of net export demand nullifies the policy’s effect on output and employment. In this case, a permanent fiscal expansion has no expansionary effect at all. The government spending multiplier is zero for permanent fiscal expansion, unlike for temporary fiscal expansion.   
■■ A major practical problem is ensuring that the government’s ability to stimulate the economy does not tempt it to gear policy to short-term political goals, thus creating an inflation bias. Other problems include the difficulty of identifying the sources or durations of economic changes and time lags in implementing policies.   
■■ If exports and imports adjust gradually to real exchange rate changes, the current account may follow a $J.$ -curve pattern after a real currency depreciation, first worsening and then improving. If such a J-curve exists, currency depreciation may have an initial contractionary effect on output, and exchange rate overshooting will be amplified. Limited exchange rate pass-through, along with domestic price increases, may reduce the effect of a nominal exchange rate change on the real exchange rate. The same is true of global value chains, although these production arrangements also tend to raise the gross levels of exports and imports.

# PROBLEMS  

1.	 How does the $_{D D}$ schedule shift if there is a decline in investment demand?  

2.	 Suppose the government imposes a tariff on all imports. Use the DD-AA model to analyze the effects this measure would have on the economy. Analyze both temporary and permanent tariffs.   
3.	 In 2015, the Canadian government intended to adopt a balance budget act requiring the government to maintain a balanced budget at all times. Hence, if the government wishes to change government spending, it will always have to change the taxes by the same amount, that is, $\Delta G=\Delta T$ . Does this law imply that the government can no longer use fiscal policy to affect employment and output? (Hint: Analyze a “balanced-budget” increase in government spending, one that is accompanied by an equal tax hike.)   
4.	 Suppose there is a permanent fall in private aggregate demand for a country’s output (a downward shift of the entire aggregate demand schedule). What is the effect on output? What government policy response would you recommend?   
5.	 Why does a temporary increase in government spending cause the current account to fall by a smaller amount than does a permanent increase in government spending?   
6.	 If a government initially has a balanced budget but then cuts taxes, it is running a deficit that it must somehow finance. Suppose people think the government will finance its deficit by printing the extra money it now needs to cover its expenditures. Would you still expect the tax cut to cause a currency appreciation?   
7.	 You observe that a country’s currency depreciates while its current account worsens. What data might you look at to decide if you are witnessing a J-curve effect? What other macroeconomic change might bring about a currency depreciation coupled with a deterioration of the current account, even if there is no J-curve?   
8.	 A new government wins an election and announces that once it is inaugurated, it will increase the money supply. Use the DD-AA model to study the economy’s response to this announcement.   
9.	 How would you draw the DD-AA diagram when the current account’s response to exchange rate changes follows a J-curve? Use this modified diagram to examine the effects of temporary and permanent changes in monetary and fiscal policy.   
10.	 What does the Marshall-Lerner condition look like if the country whose real exchange rate changes does not start out with a current account of zero? (The Marshall-Lerner condition is derived in Appendix 2 under the “standard” assumption of an initially balanced current account.)   
11.	 Our model takes the price level $P$ as given in the short run, but in reality, the currency appreciation caused by a permanent fiscal expansion might cause $P$ to fall a bit by lowering some import prices. If $P$ can fall slightly due to a permanent fiscal expansion, is it still true that there are no output effects? (As previously, assume an initial long-run equilibrium.)   
12.	 Suppose interest parity does not hold exactly, but the true relationship is $R=R^{*}+\left(E^{e}-E\right)/E+\rho$ , where $\rho$ is a term measuring the differential  

riskiness of domestic versus foreign deposits. Suppose a permanent rise in domestic government spending, by creating the prospect of future government deficits, also raises $\rho$ , that is, makes domestic currency deposits more risky. Evaluate the policy’s output effects in this situation.  

13.	 If an economy does not start out at full employment, is it still true that a permanent change in fiscal policy has no current effect on output?   
14.	 Consider the following linear version of the $A A–D D$ model in the text: ­Consumption is given by $C=\left(1-s\right)Y$ , and the current account balance is given by $C A=a E-m Y$ . (In macroeconomics textbooks, $s$ is sometimes referred to as the marginal propensity to save, and $m$ is called the marginal propensity to import.) Then the condition of equilibrium in the goods market is $Y=C+I+G+C A={\left(1-s\right)}Y+I+G+a E-m Y.$ We will write the condition of money market equilibrium as $M^{s}/P=b Y-d R$ . On the assumption that the central bank can hold both the interest rate $R$ and the exchange rate $E$ constant and assuming that investment $I$ also is constant, what is the effect of an increase in government spending $G$ on output $\textstyle Y?$ (This number is often called the open-economy government spending multiplier, but as you can see, it is relevant only under strict conditions.) Explain your result intuitively.   
15.	 See if you can retrace the steps in the five-step argument at the end of the section on “Permanent Shifts in Monetary and Fiscal Policy” to show that a permanent fiscal expansion cannot cause output to fall.   
16.	 The chapter’s discussion of “Inflation Bias and Other Problems of Policy ­Formulation” (paragraph 4) states that there may not really be any such thing as a permanent fiscal expansion. What do you think? How would these considerations affect the exchange rate and output effects of fiscal policy? Do you see any parallels with this chapter’s discussion of the longer-run impact of current account imbalances?   
17.	 If you compare low-inflation economies with economies in which inflation is high and very volatile, how might you expect the degree of exchange rate pass-through to differ, and why?   
18.	 In November 2015, the Government of India formulated a policy for according preference to the government procurement of electronic goods that are manufactured domestically. According to the news reports, this campaign, referred to as “Make in India,” promotes economic strength and a more robust standing in the global market.” Do you think the Indian government spending constrained by this national preference policy has a bigger effect on Indian output than unconstrained Indian government spending? What could happen if this policy is extended to the overall government spending?   
19.	 Return to problem 14 and notice that, to complete the model described there, we must add the interest parity conditions. Observe also that if $Y^{f}$ is the fullemployment output level, then the long-run expected exchange rate, $E^{e}$ , satisfies the equation: $\bar{Y^{f}}=\left(a E^{e}+I+G\right)/\bar{(s}+m)$ . (We are again taking investment $I$ as given.) Using these equations, demonstrate algebraically that if the economy starts at full employment with $R=R^{*}$ , an increase in $G$ has no effect on output. What is the effect on the exchange rate? How does the exchange rate change depend on $a$ , and why?   
20.	 We can express a linear approximation to the interest parity condition (accurate for small exchange rate changes) as: $R=R^{*}+\left(E^{e}-E\right)/E^{e}$ . Adding this to the model of problems 14 and 19, solve for $Y$ as a function of $G$ . What is the government spending multiplier for temporary changes in $G$ (those that do not alter $E^{e}$ )? How does your answer depend on the parameters $a,b$ , and $d$ , and why?

# APPENDIX 1 TO CHAPTER 17  

# Intertemporal Trade and Consumption Demand  

We assume in the chapter that private consumption demand is a function of disposable income, $C=C(Y^{d})$ , with the property that when $Y^{d}$ rises, consumption rises by less [so that saving, $Y^{d}-C(Y^{d})$ , goes up too]. This appendix interprets this assumption in the context of the intertemporal model of consumption behavior discussed in the appendix to Chapter 6.  

The discussion in Chapter 6 assumed that consumers’ welfare depends on present consumption demand $D_{P}$ and future consumption demand $D_{F}$ . If present income is $Q_{P}$ and future income is $Q_{F}$ , consumers can use borrowing or saving to allocate their consumption over time in any way consistent with the intertemporal budget constraint  

$$
D_{P}+D_{F}/(1+r)=Q_{P}+Q_{F}/(1+r),
$$  

where $r$ is the real rate of interest.  

Figure 17A1-1 reminds you of how consumption and saving were determined in Chapter 6. If present and future output are initially described by the point labeled 1 in the figure, a consumer’s wish to pick the highest utility indifference curve consistent with his or her budget constraints leads to consumption at point 1 as well.  

# FIGURE 17A1-1  

# Change in Output and Saving  

A one-period increase in output raises saving.  

![](images/e67e2e518a0725584d037e9acaa51cbed45b26b5ab1ea728aea9c2da95ebebed.jpg)  

We have assumed zero saving at point 1 to show most clearly the effect of a rise in current output, which we turn to next. Suppose present output rises while future output doesn’t, moving the income endowment to point $2^{\prime}$ , which lies horizontally to the right of point 1. You can see that the consumer will wish to spread the increase in consumption this allows her over her entire lifetime. She can do this by saving some of the present income rise, $\mathcal{Q}_{P}^{2}-\mathcal{Q}_{P}^{1}$ , and moving up to the left along her budget line from her endowment point $2^{\prime}$ to point 2.  

If we now reinterpret the notation so that present output, $Q_{P}$ , corresponds to disposable income, $Y^{d}$ , and present consumption demand corresponds to $\bar{C}(Y^{d})$ , we see that while consumption certainly depends on factors other than current disposable income—notably, future income and the real interest rate—its behavior implies a rise in lifetime income that is concentrated in the present will indeed lead to a rise in current consumption less than the rise in current income. Since the output changes we have been considering in this chapter are all temporary changes that result from the shortrun stickiness of domestic money prices, the consumption behavior we simply assumed in the chapter does capture the feature of intertemporal consumption behavior essential for the DD-AA model to work.  

We could also use Figure 17A1-1 to look at the consumption effects of the real interest rate, which we mentioned in footnote 1. If the economy is initially at point 1, a fall in the real interest rate $r$ causes the budget line to rotate counterclockwise about point 1, causing a rise in present consumption. If initially the economy had been saving a positive amount, however, as at point 2, this effect would be ambiguous, a reflection of the contrary pulls of the income and substitution effects we introduced in the first part of this book on international trade theory. In this second case, the endowment point is point $2^{\prime}$ , so a fall in the real interest rate causes a counterclockwise rotation of the budget line about point $2^{\prime}$ .  Empirical evidence indicates that the positive effect of a lower real interest rate on consumption probably is weak.  

Use of the preceding framework to analyze the intertemporal aspects of fiscal policy would lead us too far afield, although this is one of the most fascinating topics in ­macroeconomics. We refer readers instead to any good intermediate macroeconomics text.20  

# APPENDIX 2 TO CHAPTER 17  

# The Marshall-Lerner Condition and Empirical Estimates of Trade Elasticities  

The chapter assumed a real depreciation of a country’s currency improves its current account. As we noted, however, the validity of this assumption depends on the response of export and import volumes to real exchange rate changes. In this appendix, we derive a condition on those responses for the assumption in the text to be valid. The condition, called the Marshall-Lerner condition, states that, all else equal, a real depreciation improves the current account if export and import volumes are sufficiently elastic with respect to the real exchange rate. (The condition is named after two of the economists who discovered it, Alfred Marshall and Abba Lerner.) After deriving the ­Marshall-Lerner condition, we look at empirical estimates of trade elasticities and analyze their implications for actual current account responses to real exchange rate changes.  

To start, write the current account, measured in domestic output units, as the difference between exports and imports of goods and services similarly measured:  

$$
C A(E P^{*}/P,Y^{d})=E X(E P^{*}/P)-I M(E P^{*}/P,Y^{d}).
$$  

Here, export demand is written as a function of $E P^{*}/P$ alone because foreign income is being held constant.  

Let $q$ denote the real exchange rate $E P^{*}/P$ , and let $E X^{*}$ denote domestic imports measured in terms of foreign, rather than domestic, output. The notation $E X^{*}$ is used because domestic imports from abroad, measured in foreign output, equal the volume of foreign exports to the home country. If we identify $q$ with the price of foreign products in terms of domestic products, then $I M$ and $E X^{*}$ are related by  

$$
I M=q\times E X^{*},
$$  

that is, imports measured in domestic output $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ (domestic output units>foreign output unit) $\times$ (imports measured in foreign output units).21  

We can therefore express the current account as  

$$
C A(q,Y^{d})=E X(q)-q\times E X^{*}(q,Y^{d}).
$$  

Now let $E X_{q}$ stand for the effect of a rise in $q$ (a real depreciation) on export demand, and let $E X_{q}^{*}$ stand for the effect of a rise in $q$ on import volume. Thus,  

$$
E X_{q}=\Delta E X/\Delta q,E X_{q}^{*}=\Delta E X^{*}/\Delta q.
$$  

As we saw in the chapter, $E X_{q}$ is positive (a real depreciation makes home products relatively cheaper and stimulates exports) while $E X_{q}^{*}$ is negative (a relative cheapening of home products reduces domestic import demand). Using these definitions, we can now ask how a rise in $q$ affects the current account, all else equal.  

If superscript 1 indicates the initial value of a variable while superscript 2 indicates its value after $q$ has changed by $\Delta q=q^{2}-q^{1}$ , then the change in the current account caused by a real exchange rate change $\Delta q$ is  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\Delta C A=C A^{2}-C A^{1}=(E X^{2}-q^{2}\times E X^{*2})-(E X^{1}-q^{1}\times E X^{*1})}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{{}=\Delta\mathrm{EX}-(q^{2}\times\Delta\mathrm{EX^{*}})-(\Delta q\times\mathrm{EX^{*1}}).}}\end{array}
$$  

Dividing through by $\Delta q$ gives the current account’s response to a change in $q$ ,  

$$
\Delta C A/\Delta q=E X_{q}-(q^{2}\times E X_{q}^{*})-E X^{*1}.
$$  

This equation summarizes the two current account effects of a real depreciation discussed in the text, the volume effect and the value effect. The terms involving $E X_{q}$ and $E X_{q}^{*}$ represent the volume effect, the effect of the change in $q$ on the number of output units exported and imported. These terms are always positive because $E X_{q}>0$ and $E X_{q}^{*}<0$ . The last term in the previous expression, $E X^{*1}$ , represents the value effect, and it is preceded by a minus sign. This last term tells us that a rise in $q$ worsens the current account to the extent that it raises the domestic output value of the initial volume of imports.  

We are interested in knowing when the right-hand side of the preceding equation is positive, so that a real depreciation causes the current account balance to increase. To answer this question, we first define the elasticity of export demand with respect to $q$ ,  

$$
\eta=(q^{1}/E X^{1})E X_{q},
$$  

and the elasticity of import demand with respect to $q$ ,  

$$
\eta^{*}=-(q^{1}/E X^{*1})E X_{q}^{*}.
$$  

(The definition of $\eta^{*}$ involves a minus sign because $E X_{q}^{*}<0$ , and we are defining trade elasticities as positive numbers.) Returning to our equation for $\Delta C A/\Delta q$ , we multiply its right-hand side by $(\boldsymbol{q}^{1}/E\boldsymbol{X}^{1})$ to express it in terms of trade elasticities. Then, if the current account is initially zero (that is, $E X^{1}=q^{1}\times E X^{*1})$ ), this last step shows that $\Delta C A/\Delta q$ is positive when  

$$
\eta+(q^{2}/q^{1})\eta^{\ast}-1>0.
$$  

If the change in $q$ is assumed to be small, so that $q^{2}\approx q^{1}$ , the condition for an increase in $q$ to improve the current account is  

$$
\eta+\eta^{*}>1.
$$  

This is the Marshall-Lerner condition, which states that if the current account is initially zero, a real currency depreciation causes a current account surplus if the sum of the relative price elasticities of export and import demand exceeds 1. (If the current account is not zero initially, the condition becomes more complex.) In applying the Marshall-Lerner condition, remember that its derivation assumes that disposable income is held constant when $q$ changes.  

Now that we have the Marshall-Lerner condition, we can ask whether empirical estimates of trade equations imply price elasticities consistent with this chapter’s assumption that a real exchange rate depreciation improves the current account. Table 17A2-1 presents International Monetary Fund elasticity estimates for trade in manufactured goods. The table reports export and import price elasticities measured over three successively longer time horizons and thus allows for the possibility that export and import demands adjust gradually to relative price changes, as in our discussion of the J-curve effect. Impact elasticities measure the response of trade flows to relative price changes in the first six months after the change, short-run elasticities apply to a one-year adjustment period, and long-run elasticities measure the response of trade flows to the price changes over a hypothetical infinite adjustment period.

For most countries, the impact elasticities are so small that the sum of the impact export and import elasticities is less than 1. Since the impact elasticities usually fail to satisfy the Marshall-Lerner condition, the estimates support the existence of an initial J-curve effect that causes the current account to deteriorate immediately following a real depreciation.  

It is also true, however, that most countries represented in the table satisfy the ­Marshall-Lerner condition in the short run and that virtually all do so in the long run. The evidence is therefore consistent with the assumption made in the chapter: Except over short time periods, a real depreciation is likely to improve the current account, while a real appreciation is likely to worsen it.  

# The IS-LM Model and the DD-AA Model  

In this appendix we examine the relationship between the DD-AA model of the chapter and another model frequently used to answer questions in international macroeconomics, the IS-LM model. The IS-LM model generalizes the DD-AA model by allowing the real domestic interest rate to affect aggregate demand.  

The diagram usually used to analyze the IS-LM model has the nominal interest rate and output, rather than the nominal exchange rate and output, on its axes. Like the DD-AA diagram, the IS-LM diagram determines the short-run equilibrium of the economy as the intersection of two individual market equilibrium curves, called $I S$ and $L M.$ . The $I S$ curve is the schedule of nominal interest rates and output levels at which the output and foreign exchange markets are in equilibrium, while the $L M$ curve shows points at which the money market is in equilibrium.22  

The IS-LM model assumes that investment, and some forms of consumer purchases (such as purchases of autos and other durable goods), are negatively related to the expected real interest rate. When the expected real interest rate is low, firms find it profitable to borrow and undertake investment plans. (The appendix to Chapter 6 presented a model of this link between investment and the real interest rate.) A low expected real interest rate also makes it more profitable to carry inventories rather than alternative assets. For both these reasons, we would expect investment to rise when the expected real interest rate falls. Similarly, because consumers find borrowing cheap and saving unattractive when the real interest rate is low, interest-responsive consumer purchases also rise when the real interest rate falls. As Appendix 1 to Chapter 17 shows, however, theoretical arguments as well as the evidence suggest the consumption response to the interest rate is weaker than the investment response.  

In the IS-LM model, aggregate demand is therefore written as a function of the real exchange rate, disposable income, and the real interest rate,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{D(E P^{*}/P,Y-T,R-\pi^{e})=C(Y-T,R-\pi^{e})+I(R-\pi^{e})}\\ &{\phantom{D}+G+C A(E P^{*}/P,Y-T,R-\pi^{e}),}\end{array}
$$  

where $\pi^{e}$ is the expected inflation rate and $R-\pi^{e}$ therefore is the expected real interest rate. The model assumes that $\mathrm{~P~}P^{*}$ , $G,$ T, $R^{*}$ , and $E^{e}$ are all given. (To simplify the notation, we’ve left $G$ out of the aggregate demand function D.)  

To find the $I S$ curve of $R$ and $Y$ combinations such that aggregate demand equals output,  

$$
Y=D(E P^{*}/P,Y-T,R-\pi^{e}),
$$  

we must first write this output market equilibrium condition so that it does not depend on $E$ .  

We solve for $E$ using the interest parity condition, $R=R^{*}+(E^{e}-E)/E$ . If we solve this equation for $E,$ , the result is  

$$
{\cal E}={\cal E}^{e}/(1+{\cal R}-{\cal R}^{*}).
$$  

Substitution of this expression into the aggregate demand function shows that we can express the condition for output market equilibrium as  

$$
Y=D[E^{e}P^{*}/P(1+R-R^{*}),Y-T,R-\pi^{e}].
$$  

To get a complete picture of how output changes affect goods market equilibrium, we must remember that the inflation rate in the economy depends positively on the gap between actual output, Y, and “full-employment” output, $Y^{f}$ . We therefore write $\pi^{e}$ as an increasing function of that gap:  

$$
\pi^{e}\ =\pi^{e}(Y-\ Y^{f}).
$$  

Under this assumption on expectations, the goods market is in equilibrium when  

$$
Y=D[E^{e}P^{*}/P(1+R-R^{*}),Y-T,R-\pi^{e}(Y-Y^{f})].
$$  

This condition shows that a fall in the nominal interest rate $R$ raises aggregate demand through two channels: (1) Given the expected future exchange rate, a fall in $R$ causes a domestic currency depreciation that improves the current account. (2) Given expected inflation, a fall in $R$ directly encourages consumption and investment spending that falls only partly on imports. Only the second of these channels—the effect of the interest rate on spending—would be present in a closed-economy $I S–L M$ model.  

The $I S$ curve is found by asking how output must respond to such a fall in the interest rate to maintain output market equilibrium. Since a fall in $R$ raises aggregate demand, the output market will remain in equilibrium after $R$ falls only if $Y$ rises. The $I S$ curve therefore slopes downward, as shown in Figure 17A3-1. Even though the $I S$ and $D D$ curves both reflect output market equilibrium, $I S$ slopes downward while $D D$ slopes upward. The reason for this difference is that the interest rate and the exchange rate are inversely related by the interest parity condition, given the expected future exchange rate.23  

The slope of the $L M$ (or money market equilibrium) curve is much easier to derive. Money market equilibrium holds when $M^{s}/P=L(R,Y)$ . Because a rise in the interest rate reduces money demand, it results in an excess supply of money for a given output level. To maintain equilibrium in the money market after $R$ rises, $Y$ must therefore rise also (because a rise in output stimulates the transactions demand for money). The $L M$ curve thus has a positive slope, as shown in Figure 17A3-1. The intersection of the $I S$ and $L M$ curves at point 1 determines the short-run equilibrium values of output, $Y^{1}$ , and the nominal interest rate, $R^{1}$ . The equilibrium interest rate, in turn, determines a short-run equilibrium exchange rate through the interest parity condition.

The $I S–L M$ model can be used to analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal policies. A temporary increase in the money supply, for example, shifts $L M$ to the right, lowering the interest rate and expanding output. A permanent increase in the money supply, however, shifts $L M$ to the right but also shifts IS to the right, since in an open economy that schedule depends on $E^{e}$ , which now rises.

# Effects of Permanent and Temporary Increases in the Money Supply in the IS-LM Model  

A temporary increase in the money supply shifts the $L M$ curve alone to the right, but a permanent increase shifts both the $I S$ and $L M$ curves in that direction.  

shows these shifts. At the new short-run equilibrium following a permanent increase in the money supply (point 2), output and the interest rate are higher than at the short-run equilibrium (point 3) following an equal temporary increase. The nominal interest rate can even be higher at point 2 than at point 1. This possibility provides another example of how the Fisher expected inflation effect of Chapter 16 can push the nominal interest rate upward after a monetary expansion.  

The left-hand side of Figure 17A3-2 shows how the monetary changes affect the exchange rate. This is our usual picture of equilibrium in the foreign exchange market, but it has been reflected through the vertical axis so that a movement to the left along the horizontal axis is an increase in $E$ (a depreciation of the home currency). The interest rate $R^{2}$ following a permanent increase in the money supply implies foreign exchange market equilibrium at point $2^{\prime}$ , since the accompanying rise in $E^{e}$ shifts the curve that measures the expected domestic currency return on foreign deposits. That curve does not shift if the money supply increase is temporary, so the equilibrium interest rate $\boldsymbol{R}^{3}$ that results in this case leads to foreign exchange equilibrium at point $3^{\prime}$ .  

Fiscal policy is analyzed in Figure 17A3-3, which assumes a long-run equilibrium starting point. A temporary increase in government spending, for example, shifts $I S^{1}$ to the right but has no effect on $L M.$ . The new short-run equilibrium at point 2 shows a rise in output and a rise in the nominal interest rate, while the foreign exchange market equilibrium at point $2^{\prime}$ indicates a temporary currency appreciation. A permanent increase in government spending causes a fall in the long-run equilibrium exchange rate and thus a fall in $E^{e}$ . The $I S$ curve therefore does not shift out as much as in the case of a temporary policy. In fact, it does not shift at all: As in the DD-AA model, a permanent fiscal expansion has no effect on output or the home interest rate. The reason why permanent fiscal policy moves are weaker than transitory ones can be seen in the ­figure’s left-hand side (point $3^{\prime}$ ). The accompanying change in exchange rate expectations generates a sharper currency appreciation and thus, through the response of net exports, a complete “crowding out” effect on aggregate demand.24
