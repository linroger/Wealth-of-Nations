# The Instruments of Trade Policy

While this question is interesting in itself, its answer is even more interesting if it also helps answer the question “What should a nation’s trade policy be?” For example, the grittiest part of the Brexit, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU) negotiations is over trade. Its tariff, quota, and subsidy rules are fixed by its EU membership. Thus, the EU, Britain, and certain third countries are faced with a dilemma of possibilities of trade. Outside the customs union of the EU, Britain would face tariffs and non-tariff barriers, which could add between 2 and 15 percent to the cost of exports, depending on the product.  

This chapter examines the policies that governments adopt toward international trade, policies that involve a number of different actions. These actions include taxes on some international transactions, subsidies for other transactions, legal limits on the value or volume of particular imports, and many other measures. The chapter thus provides a framework for understanding the effects of the most important instruments of trade policy.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

■ Evaluate the costs and benefits of tariffs, their welfare effects, and winners and losers of tariff policies. Discuss what export subsidies and agricultural subsidies are and explain how they affect trade in agriculture in the United States and the European Union. Recognize the effect of voluntary export restraints (VERs) on both importing and exporting countries and describe how the welfare effects of these VERs compare with tariff and quota policies.  

# Basic Tariff Analysis  

A tariff, the simplest of trade policies, is a tax levied when a good is imported. Specific tariffs are levied as a fixed charge for each unit of goods imported (for example, $\$3$ per barrel of oil). Ad valorem tariffs are taxes that are levied as a fraction of the value of the imported goods. In either case, the effect of the tariff is to raise the cost of shipping goods to a country.  

Tariffs are the oldest form of trade policy and have traditionally been used as a source of government income. Until the introduction of the income tax, for instance, the U.S. government raised most of its revenue from tariffs. Their true purpose, however, has usually been twofold: to provide revenue and to protect particular domestic sectors. In the early 19th century, for example, the United Kingdom used tariffs (the famous Corn Laws that led David Ricardo to develop his theory of comparative advantage; see Chapter 3) to protect its agriculture from import competition. In the late 19th century, both Germany and the United States protected their new industrial sectors by imposing tariffs on imports of manufactured goods. In the late 19th century, protection was a trade policy instrument used in Europe’s development. In Europe, tariffs had a positive impact on a country’s growth, specifically on infant industry grounds. For example, Sweden, Italy, and France adopted rather severe agricultural protection policies. Germany adopted protectionist policies in both agriculture and manufacturing and experienced strong growth of its infant industries with set higher tariffs. Also, countries of the New World, such as Canada, Australia, and the United States also chose to protect its manufacturing and infant industries from European competition. The importance of tariffs has declined in modern times because modern governments usually prefer to protect domestic industries through a variety of nontariff barriers, such as import quotas (limitations on the quantity of imports) and export restraints (limitations on the quantity of exports—usually imposed by the exporting country at the importing country’s request) and direct subsidies to producers. Nonetheless, tariffs are still used by virtually all nations. And the Trump administration’s trade war started in 2018 (see Chapter 4 and the case study in this chapter) shows how quickly those tariff declines can be reversed. Thus, an understanding of the effects of a tariff remains vital, both because they are still used and often threatened and because the effects of other trade policies are often evaluated against the benchmark effects of a tariff.  

In developing the theory of trade in Chapters 3 through 8, we adopted a general equilibrium perspective. That is, we were keenly aware that events in one part of the economy have repercussions elsewhere. However, in many (though not all) cases, trade policies toward one sector can be reasonably well understood without going into detail about those policies’ repercussions on the rest of the economy. For the most part, then, trade policy can be examined in a partial equilibrium framework. When the effects on the economy as a whole become crucial, we will refer back to general equilibrium analysis.  

# Supply, Demand, and Trade in a Single Industry  

Let’s suppose there are two countries, Home and Foreign, both of which consume and produce wheat, which can be costlessly transported between the countries. In each country, wheat is a simple competitive industry in which the supply and demand curves are functions of the market price. Normally, Home supply and demand will depend on the price in terms of Home currency, and Foreign supply and demand will depend on the price in terms of Foreign currency. However, we assume the exchange rate between the currencies is not affected by whatever trade policy is undertaken in this market. Thus, we quote prices in both markets in terms of Home currency.  

Trade will arise in such a market if prices are different in the absence of trade. Suppose that in the absence of trade, the price of wheat is higher in Home than it is in Foreign. Now let’s allow foreign trade. Since the price of wheat in Home exceeds the price in Foreign, shippers begin to move wheat from Foreign to Home. The export of wheat raises its price in Foreign and lowers its price in Home until the difference in prices has been eliminated.  

To determine the world price and the quantity traded, it is helpful to define two new curves: the Home import demand curve and the Foreign export supply curve, which are derived from the underlying domestic supply and demand curves. Home import demand is the excess  

![](images/40042c57a7121fa8852b6f4411462bd0457cdcb69383d16f1b7c5969753d181e.jpg)  
FIGURE 9-1

As the price of the good increases, Home consumers demand less, while Home producers supply more, so that the demand for imports declines.  

of what Home consumers demand over what Home producers supply; Foreign export supply is the excess of what Foreign producers supply over what Foreign consumers demand.  

Figure 9-1 shows how the Home import demand curve is derived. At the price $P^{1}$ , Home consumers demand $D^{1}$ , while Home producers supply only $S^{1}$ . As a result, Home import demand is $D^{1}-S^{1}$ . If we raise the price to $P^{2}$ , Home consumers demand only $D^{2}$ , while Home producers raise the amount they supply to $S^{2}$ , so import demand falls to $D^{2}\mathrm{~-~}S^{2}$ . These price–quantity combinations are plotted as points 1 and 2 in the right-hand panel of Figure 9-1. The import demand curve $M D$ is downward sloping because as price increases, the quantity of imports demanded declines. At $P_{A}$ , Home supply and demand are equal in the absence of trade, so the Home import demand curve intercepts the price axis at $P_{A}$ (import demand $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ zero at $P_{A}$ ).  

Figure 9-2 shows how the Foreign export supply curve $X S$ is derived. At $P^{1}$ Foreign producers supply $\boldsymbol{S}^{*1}$ , while Foreign consumers demand only $D^{*1}$ , so the amount of the total supply available for export is $\boldsymbol{\bar{S}}^{*1}-\boldsymbol{D}^{*1}$ . At $P^{2}$ Foreign producers raise the quantity they supply to $\boldsymbol{S}^{*2}$ and Foreign consumers lower the amount they demand to $D^{*\bar{2}}$ , so the quantity of the total supply available to export rises to $\boldsymbol{S}^{*2}-\dot{\boldsymbol{D}}^{*2}$ . Because the supply of goods available for export rises as the price rises, the Foreign export supply curve is upward sloping. At $P_{A}^{*}$ , supply and demand would be equal in the absence of trade, so the Foreign export supply curve intersects the price axis at $\bar{P}_{A}^{*}$ (export supply $\c=$ zero at $\boldsymbol{P}_{A}^{*}$ ).  

World equilibrium occurs when Home import demand equals Foreign export supply (Figure 9-3). At the price $P_{W}$ where the two curves cross, world supply equals world demand. At the equilibrium point 1 in Figure 9-3,  

Home demand - Home supply $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ Foreign supply - Foreign demand. By adding and subtracting from both sides, this equation can be rearranged to say that  

Home demand $+$ Foreign demand $\mathbf{\Sigma}=$ Home supply $^+$ Foreign supply or, in other words,

FIGURE 9-2  

# Deriving Foreign’s Export Supply Curve  

As the price of the good rises, Foreign producers supply more while Foreign consumers demand less, so that the supply available for export rises.

# Effects of a Tariff  

From the point of view of someone shipping goods, a tariff is just like a cost of transportation. If Home imposes a tax of $\$2$ on every bushel of wheat imported, shippers will be unwilling to move the wheat unless the price difference between the two markets is at least $\$2$ .  

Figure 9-4 illustrates the effects of a specific tariff of $t$ per unit of wheat (shown as $t$ in the figure). In the absence of a tariff, the price of wheat would be equalized at $P_{W}$ in both Home and Foreign, as seen at point 1 in the middle panel, which illustrates the world market. With the tariff in place, however, shippers are not willing to move wheat from Foreign to Home unless the Home price exceeds the Foreign price by at least $t$ .  

![](images/df577eff1a553da5b7ceaadd4b85b80291402d84ee6602b01ca819627420deb5.jpg)  
FIGURE 9-4  

# Effects of a Tariff  

A tariff raises the price in Home while lowering the price in Foreign. The volume traded thus declines.  

If no wheat is being shipped, however, there will be an excess demand for wheat in Home and an excess supply in Foreign. Thus, the price in Home will rise and that in Foreign will fall until the price difference is $t$ .  

Introducing a tariff, then, drives a wedge between the prices in the two markets. The tariff raises the price in Home to $P_{T}$ and lowers the price in Foreign to ${\boldsymbol{P}}_{T}^{*}={\boldsymbol{P}}_{T}-{\boldsymbol{t}}$ . In Home, producers supply more at the higher price, while consumers demand less, so that fewer imports are demanded (as you can see in the move from point 1 to point 2 on the $M D$ curve). In Foreign, the lower price leads to reduced supply and increased demand, and thus a smaller export supply (as seen in the move from point 1 to point 3 on the $X S$ curve). Thus, the volume of wheat traded declines from $Q_{W}$ , the free trade volume, to $\varrho_{T},$ the volume with a tariff. At the trade volume $Q_{T},$ , Home import demand equals Foreign export supply when ${\boldsymbol{P}}_{T}-{\boldsymbol{P}}_{T}^{*}=t$ .  

The increase in the price in Home, from $P_{W}$ to $P_{T},$ is less than the amount of the tariff because part of the tariff is reflected in a decline in Foreign’s export price and thus is not passed on to Home consumers. This is the normal result of a tariff and of any trade policy that limits imports. The size of this effect on the exporters’ price, however, is often very small in practice. When a small country imposes a tariff, its share of the world market for the goods it imports is usually minor to begin with, so that its import reduction has very little effect on the world (foreign export) price.  

The effects of a tariff in the “small country” case where a country cannot affect foreign export prices are illustrated in Figure 9-5. In this case, a tariff raises the price of the imported good in the country imposing the tariff by the full amount of the tariff, from $P_{W}$ to $P_{W}+t$ . Production of the imported good rises from $S^{1}$ to $S^{2}$ , while consumption of the good falls from $D^{1}$ to $D^{2}$ . As a result of the tariff, then, imports fall in the country imposing the tariff.  

# Measuring the Amount of Protection  

A tariff on an imported good raises the price received by domestic producers of that good. This effect is often the tariff’s principal objective—to protect domestic producers from the low prices that would result from import competition. In analyzing trade  

# FIGURE 9-5  

# A Tariff in a Small Country  

When a country is small, a tariff it imposes cannot lower the foreign price of the good it imports. As a result, the price of the import rises from $P W$ to $P W+t$ and the quantity of imports demanded falls from $D_{1}-S_{1}$ to $D_{2}\ -\ S_{2}$ .  

![](images/8147886de89df43eb446bb5f8453dc5739cf06e20cac2892e4eb841145fd9f86.jpg)  

policy in practice, it is important to ask how much protection a tariff or other trade policy actually provides. The answer is usually expressed as a percentage of the price that would prevail under free trade. An import quota on sugar could, for example, raise the price received by U.S. sugar producers by 35 percent.  

Measuring protection would seem to be straightforward in the case of a tariff: If the tariff is an ad valorem tax proportional to the value of the imports, the tariff rate itself should measure the amount of protection; if the tariff is specific, dividing the tariff by the price net of the tariff gives us the ad valorem equivalent.  

However, there are two problems with trying to calculate the rate of protection this simply. First, if the small-country assumption is not a good approximation, part of the effect of a tariff will be to lower foreign export prices rather than to raise domestic prices. This effect of trade policies on foreign export prices is sometimes significant.  

The second problem is that tariffs may have very different effects on different stages of production of a good. A simple example illustrates this point.  

Suppose an automobile sells on the world market for $\$8,000$ , and the parts out of which that automobile is made sell for $\$6,000$ . Let’s compare two countries: one that wants to develop an auto assembly industry and one that already has an assembly industry and wants to develop a parts industry.  

To encourage a domestic auto industry, the first country places a 25 percent tariff on imported autos, allowing domestic assemblers to charge $\$10,000$ instead of $\$8,000$ . In this case, it would be wrong to say that the assemblers receive only 25 percent protection. Before the tariff, domestic assembly would take place only if it could be done for $\$2,000$ (the difference between the $\$8,000$ price of a completed automobile and the \$6,000 cost of parts) or less; now it will take place even if it costs as much as $\$4,000$ (the difference between the $\$10,000$ price and the cost of parts). That is, the 25 percent tariff rate provides assemblers with an effective rate of protection of 100 percent.  

Now suppose the second country, to encourage domestic production of parts, imposes a 10 percent tariff on imported parts, raising the cost of parts of domestic assemblers from $\$6,000$ to $\$600$ . Even though there is no change in the tariff on assembled automobiles, this policy makes it less advantageous to assemble domestically. Before the tariff, it would have been worth assembling a car locally if it could be done for $\$2,000$ $\mathfrak{P8,000-56,000})$ ; after the tariff, local assembly takes place only if it can be done for $\$1,400$ $(\mathbb{S}8,000-\mathbb{S}6,600)$ . The tariff on parts, then, while providing positive protection to parts manufacturers, provides negative effective protection to assembly at the rate of $-30$ percent $(-600/2,000)$ .  

Reasoning similar to that seen in this example has led economists to make elaborate calculations to measure the degree of effective protection actually provided to particular industries by tariffs and other trade policies. Trade policies aimed at promoting economic development, for example (Chapter 11), often lead to rates of effective protection much higher than the tariff rates themselves.1  

# Costs and Benefits of a Tariff  

A tariff raises the price of a good in the importing country and lowers it in the exporting country. As a result of these price changes, consumers lose in the importing country and gain in the exporting country. Producers gain in the importing country and lose in the exporting country. In addition, the government imposing the tariff gains revenue. To compare these costs and benefits, it is necessary to quantify them. The method for measuring costs and benefits of a tariff depends on two concepts common to much microeconomic analysis: consumer and producer surplus.  

# Consumer and Producer Surplus  

Consumer surplus measures the amount a consumer gains from a purchase by computing the difference between the price he actually pays and the price he would have been willing to pay. If, for example, a consumer would have been willing to pay $\$8$ for a bushel of wheat but the price is only $\$3$ , the consumer surplus gained by the purchase is $\$5$ .  

Consumer surplus can be derived from the market demand curve (Figure 9-6). For example, suppose the maximum price at which consumers will buy 10 units of a good is $\$10$ . Then the 10th unit of the good purchased must be worth $\$10$ to consumers. If it were worth less, they would not purchase it; if it were worth more, they would have been willing to purchase it even if the price were higher. Now suppose that in order to get consumers to buy 11 units, the price must be cut to $\$9$ . Then the 11th unit must be worth only \$9 to consumers.  

Suppose the price is $\$9$ . Then consumers are willing to purchase only the 11th unit of the good and thus receive no consumer surplus from their purchase of that unit. They would have been willing to pay $\$10$ for the $10\mathrm{{th}}$ unit, however, and thus receive $\$1$ in consumer surplus from that unit. They would also have been willing to pay $\$12$ for the 9th unit; in that case, they would have received $\$3$ of consumer surplus on that unit, and so on.  

Generalizing from this example, if $P$ is the price of a good and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ the quantity demanded at that price, then consumer surplus is calculated by subtracting $P$ times  

# FIGURE 9-6  

# Deriving Consumer Surplus from the Demand Curve  

Consumer surplus on each unit sold is the difference between the actual price and what consumers would have been willing to pay.

FIGURE 9-7  

# Geometry of Consumer Surplus  

Consumer surplus is equal to the area under the demand curve and above the price.

$\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ from the area under the demand curve up to $\boldsymbol{Q}$ (Figure 9-7). If the price is $P^{1}$ , the quantity demanded is $D^{1}$ and the consumer surplus is measured by the areas labeled $a$ plus $b.$ If the price rises to $P^{2}$ , the quantity demanded falls to $D^{2}$ and consumer surplus falls by $b$ to equal just $a$ .  

Producer surplus is an analogous concept. A producer willing to sell a good for $\$2$ but receiving a price of \$5 gains a producer surplus of $\$3$ . The same procedure used to derive consumer surplus from the demand curve can be used to derive producer surplus  

# FIGURE 9-8  

Geometry of Producer Surplus  

Producer surplus is equal to the area above the supply curve and below the price.

from the supply curve. If $P$ is the price and $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ the quantity supplied at that price, then producer surplus is $P$ times $\boldsymbol{Q}$ minus the area under the supply curve up to $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ (Figure 9-8). If the price is $P^{1}$ , the quantity supplied will be $S^{1}$ , and producer surplus is measured by area $c.$ . If the price rises to $\dot{P^{2}}$ , the quantity supplied rises to $S^{2}$ , and producer surplus rises to equal $c$ plus the additional area $d.$ .  

Some of the difficulties related to the concepts of consumer and producer surplus are technical issues of calculation that we can safely disregard. More important is the question of whether the direct gains to producers and consumers in a given market accurately measure the social gains. Additional benefits and costs not captured by consumer and producer surplus are at the core of the case for trade policy activism discussed in Chapter 10. For now, however, we will focus on costs and benefits as measured by consumer and producer surplus.  

# Measuring the Costs and Benefits  

Figure 9-9 illustrates the costs and benefits of a tariff for the importing country. The tariff raises the domestic price from $P_{W}$ to $P_{T}$ but lowers the foreign export price from $P_{W}$ to $\boldsymbol{P}_{T}^{*}$ (refer back to Figure 9-4). Domestic production rises from $S^{1}$ to $S^{2}$ while domestic consumption falls from $D^{1}$ to $D^{2}$ . The costs and benefits to different groups can be expressed as sums of the areas of five regions, labeled $a,b,c,d,e$ .  

Consider first the gain to domestic producers. They receive a higher price and therefore have higher producer surplus. As we saw in Figure 9-8, producer surplus is equal to the area below the price but above the supply curve. Before the tariff, producer surplus was equal to the area below $P_{W}$ but above the supply curve; with the price rising to $P_{T}$ , this surplus rises by the area labeled $a$ . That is, producers gain from the tariff.  

Domestic consumers also face a higher price, which makes them worse off. As we saw in Figure 9-7, consumer surplus is equal to the area above the price but below the demand curve. Since the price consumers face rises from $P_{W}$ to $P_{T},$ the consumer surplus falls by the area indicated by $a+b+c+d.$ So consumers are hurt by the tariff.  

# FIGURE 9-9  

# Costs and Benefits of a Tariff for the Importing Country  

The costs and benefits to different groups can be represented as sums of the five areas a, $b,c,d,$ and e.  

![](images/10f17f8d632c3db2c96943e1b42aee27779658f6441413711e06207732f24c2f.jpg)  

There is a third player here as well: the government. The government gains by collecting tariff revenue. This is equal to the tariff rate $t$ times the volume of imports $Q_{T}={\bf\bar{\Psi}}D^{2}-S^{2} $ . Since $t=P_{T}-\bar{P}_{T}^{*},$ the government’s revenue is equal to the sum of the two areas $c$ and $e$ .  

Since these gains and losses accrue to different people, the overall cost-benefit evaluation of a tariff depends on how much we value a dollar’s worth of benefit to each group. If, for example, the producer gain accrues mostly to wealthy owners of resources, while consumers are poorer than average, the tariff will be viewed differently than if the good is a luxury bought by the affluent but produced by low-wage workers. Further ambiguity is introduced by the role of the government: Will it use its revenue to finance vitally needed public services or waste that revenue on $\$1,000$ toilet seats? Despite these problems, it is common for analysts of trade policy to attempt to compute the net effect of a tariff on national welfare by assuming that at the margin, a dollar’s worth of gain or loss to each group is of the same social worth.  

Let’s look, then, at the net effect of a tariff on welfare. The net cost of a tariff is or, replacing these concepts by the areas in Figure 9-9,  

$$
(a+b+c+d)-a-(c+e)=b+d-e.
$$  

That is, there are two “triangles” whose area measures loss to the nation as a whole and a “rectangle” whose area measures an offsetting gain. A useful way to interpret these gains and losses is the following: The triangles represent the efficiency loss that arises because a tariff distorts incentives to consume and produce, while the rectangle represents the terms of trade gain that arise because a tariff lowers foreign export prices.  

The gain depends on the ability of the tariff-imposing country to drive down foreign export prices. If the country cannot affect world prices (the small-country case illustrated in Figure 9-5), region $e$ , which represents the terms of trade gain, disappears, and it is clear that the tariff reduces welfare. A tariff distorts the incentives of both producers and consumers by inducing them to act as if imports were more expensive than they actually are. The cost of an additional unit of consumption to the economy is the price of an additional unit of imports, yet because the tariff raises the domestic price above the world price, consumers reduce their consumption to the point at which that marginal unit yields them welfare equal to the tariff-inclusive domestic price. This means that the value of an additional unit of production to the economy is the price of the unit of imports it saves, yet domestic producers expand production to the point at which the marginal cost is equal to the tariff-inclusive price. Thus, the economy produces at home additional units of the good that it could purchase more cheaply abroad.  

The net welfare effects of a tariff are summarized in Figure 9-10. The negative effects consist of the two triangles $b$ and $d.$ . The first triangle is the production distortion loss resulting from the fact that the tariff leads domestic producers to produce too much of this good. The second triangle is the domestic consumption distortion loss resulting from the fact that a tariff leads consumers to consume too little of the good. Against these losses must be set the terms of trade gain measured by the rectangle $e$ , which results from the decline in the foreign export price caused by a tariff. In the important case of a small country that cannot significantly affect foreign prices, this last effect drops out; thus, the costs of a tariff unambiguously exceed its benefits.

# Winners and Losers of the Trump Trade War  

In Chapter 4, we discussed the political economy considerations behind the Trump administration’s trade war. Even though the trade protections were intended to boost U.S. manufacturing employment, we detailed why the negative employment impacts massively outweighed the positive ones. In this case study, we examine the welfare consequences of that trade war in more detail using the cost-benefit analysis that we developed in this chapter.  

Figure 9-11 shows the timeline of the average tariffs imposed by the Trump administration in 2018–2019. Some tariffs on specific goods (solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum) were imposed on a large set of exporting countries; while some tariffs were targeted at specific countries (mostly China but also the European Union later on) and covered many different goods. By 2019, over 66 percent of Chinese exports to the United States were hit by the tariffs shown in Figure 9-11. The tariffs imposed on the European Union were on a much more limited set of goods as retaliation for a different trade dispute. (See the separate box later on in this chapter on the Boeing-Airbus dispute.)

# Average Tariffs on U.S. Imports  

Over the 2018–2019 period, the Trump administration drastically increased tariffs targeted both at specific goods as well as specific trading partners.

Several different studies have examined how those tariff increases have affected the prices of goods consumed in the United States.2 Because the United States is large (the small-country assumption does not hold), the tariffs could potentially pressure the exporters to the United States to lower their prices. This is the terms of trade gain of a tariff. Indeed, the proponents of the trade war claimed that U.S. consumers (and firms buying intermediate goods) would not face much of a price increase because those foreign exporters would absorb a large portion of the tariff into lower export prices. However, the evidence from those studies has unequivocally found that those potential terms of trade gains were negligible. Thus, the entire brunt of the tariffs has been borne by U.S. firms and consumers.  

Figure 9-12 shows how the annual cost of those higher import prices increased in line with the tariffs for U.S. households. After the last round of

tariff increases in 2019, the average annual cost for a U.S. household was above $\$300$ . However, this does not reflect the full cost of the tariffs for U.S. consumers. Some of the imported goods are bought by the U.S. government and lead to higher costs for government services. Some of the imported goods represent capital investment purchases by U.S. firms. Ultimately, those also lead to higher costs for the goods produced with that capital. And lastly, the tariffs also lead to higher prices for U.S. produced goods that compete with the imported goods hit by the tariff.  

Incorporating those additional costs nearly triples the average annual cost per U.S. household to $\$891$ . This is where the losses from the trade war are concentrated, along with the firms who use the affected goods as intermediate inputs. In the aggregate, this consumer surplus loss, represented by the areas $a+b+c+d$ in Figure 9-9, totals $\$123,45$ billion per year for the U.S. economy.3 As highlighted in the figure, some of that loss for consumers is offset by gains for some U.S. producers from the higher prices. Those are the firms producing steel, aluminum, solar panels, and washing machines—as well as others producing products that competed directly with Chinese imports. They benefit from the higher prices driven by the increased protection: They are the winners from the trade war. The associated increase in their producer surplus, area a, was estimated at $\$31.8$ billion per year. And lastly, some of the higher prices paid by U.S. consumers were collected by the U.S. government as tariff revenue. This revenue, area $c+e,$ amounted to $\$65.9$ billion. As we previously mentioned, area e—which would represent a terms of trade gain for the U.S. economy—was nil. Thus, the higher U.S. tariffs from the Trump trade war generated an overall efficiency loss, area $b+d,$ , equal to $\$123,456,7$ billion per year for the U.S. economy.  

And as we discussed back in Chapter 4, the new tariffs imposed by the United States inevitably led to retaliation by its trading partners. The welfare impacts of those retaliatory tariffs are not included in the costs we just mentioned. Figure 9-13 shows the progression of those retaliatory tariffs (averaged over the set of targeted goods) over time. China responded with higher tariffs in lock-step with the higher tariffs imposed by the United States. And the major steel and aluminum exporters to the United States (other than China) responded to the tariffs on those goods with tariffs on various U.S. imports.4 All those retaliatory tariffs overwhelmingly targeted agricultural products. (The Chinese tariffs covered virtually all U.S. agricultural exports.)  

In contrast to the case for an importing country setting a tariff, the welfare impacts for the exporting country are entirely absorbed by the producers for the targeted goods: Consumers are not affected, and the government does not collect any tariff revenue. In the case of those retaliatory tariffs, U.S. farmers

and ranchers were especially hard hit. Following their imposition starting in 2018, exports of U.S. agricultural products to China dropped 63 percent. The Trump administration was concerned about the political repercussions of those tariffs (given that they were so clearly connected to the prior tariffs imposed by the United States on those same countries) and authorized an unprecedented new program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “Market Facilitation Program”) to cover direct payments to farmers impacted by the retaliatory tariffs. In 2018 and 2019, those payments totaled just under $\$20$ billion. The total losses for farmers due to the trade war were likely much larger: Despite those direct government payouts, the number of farm bankruptcies increased by 24 percent in 2019.  

producer surplus at the expense of a loss in consumer surplus. However, there are many other indirect costs of tariffs. In an indefinite economic environment, it is usually quite challenging to spot whether the cause of import decline is due to improved efficiency of companies in the sector, or due to some “covered” government incentives.5 Nevertheless, imposed tariffs by one country in most cases would be followed by retaliation of another. If country A imposes a tariff, exporting producers of country B are hurt and the country loses out due to the tariff burden. Thus, country B may retaliate with a tariff of its own and form a broader violation of the free trade’s philosophies. As a result of this tariff war, both countries are more likely to end up worse off by the reduced volume trade.  

In June 2013, a “solar dispute” occurred between the world’s biggest economies and the world’s biggest trading partners, the European Union (EU) and China. The EU is China’s biggest international ­trading partner, and China is the EU’s second biggest partner, after U.S.. The trade dispute between Beijing and Brussels was one of the biggest in history. The European Commission, after a ninemonth investigation, started a formal complaint from a group of more than 20 European producers, imposed provisional tariffs on solar panels imported from China, and accused subsidized exporters of flooding the EU at prices below production cost. China became the largest producer of solar panels due to a rise in the world’s economy, influencing global trade by lowering prices in the manufacturing sector. Nearly 80 percent of the produced solar panels in China are exported to the EU market. However, according to EU trade commissioner Karel de Gucht, under a fair price the Chinese solar panels would be 88 percent higher than the current price. The inflow of Chinese solar panels became a big issue for local producers and competitors. There were opposing opinions between EU member states, because there were uncertainties about the impact of the tariff on the sector and the fact that the EU solar industry supports 265,000 jobs across Europe.  

Nevertheless, a tariff of 11.8 percent was set to be applied to Chinese solar imports to Europe from June 6, 2013, and was set to rise to an average of 47.6 percent within two months, imposing these duties for up to five years. Although the tariff was set to be applied to imports of solar panels, which value was €21 billion a year, this would have created a negative effect on the entire trading relationship worth about €480 billion and would have undermined the confidence of Chinese companies doing business in Europe.  

China, as opposed to the EU solar restraint, took steps to defend its interests and Beijing launched anti-dumping and anti-subsidy probes into imports of European wine. At the same time, exporters of luxury cars were also threatened as China was about to conduct another probe in the EU luxury cars industry. The wine industry is not the EU’s core industry. However, some EU countries, such as France, Italy, and Spain, would definitely experience a negative and damaging impact. China’s total bottled wine imports from 2002 to 2012 skyrocketed to around 15,000 percent and China is the number one importer of French wine. China’s local wine suppliers are the ones who would have benefited the most out of this tariff war.  

Nonetheless, China and the EU agreed to settle the dispute through negotiations rather than continuing to heat up the trade war. Trade between these two partners is estimated at €1 billion per day. As a result of this tariff war, the volume of trade between these two countries would be reduced, hurting the economies of both countries.  

In July 2013, per the settlement on the solar panel dispute both parties reached an agreement— a minimum price of $\mathrm{\notin0.56}$ per watt peak for the solar panels until the end of 2015 and a limitation on the export volume. Nearly 90 percent of China’s solar manufacturers agreed to the terms of this settlement.6  

# Other Instruments of Trade Policy  

Tariffs are the simplest trade policies, but in the modern world, most government intervention in international trade takes other forms, such as export subsidies, import quotas, voluntary export restraints, and local content requirements. Fortunately, once we have understood tariffs, it is not too difficult to understand these other trade instruments.  

# Export Subsidies: Theory  

An export subsidy is a payment to a firm or individual that ships a good abroad. Like a tariff, an export subsidy can be either specific (a fixed sum per unit) or ad valorem (a proportion of the value exported). When the government offers an export subsidy, shippers will export the good up to the point at which the domestic price exceeds the foreign price by the amount of the subsidy.  

The effects of an export subsidy on prices are exactly the reverse of those of a tariff (Figure 9-14). The price in the exporting country rises from $P_{W}$ to $P_{S},$ , but because the price in the importing country falls from $P_{W}$ to $\boldsymbol{P}_{S}^{*}$ , the price increase is less than the subsidy. In the exporting country, consumers are hurt, producers gain, and the government loses because it must expend money on the subsidy. The consumer loss is the area $a+b$ ; the producer gain is the area $a+b+c$ ; the government subsidy (the amount of exports times the amount of the subsidy) is the area $b+c+d+e+f+g$ . The net welfare loss is therefore the sum of the areas $b+d+e+f+g.$ Of these, $b$ and $d$ represent consumption and production distortion losses of the same kind that a tariff produces. In addition, and in contrast to a tariff, the export subsidy worsens the terms of trade because it lowers the price of the export in the foreign market from $P_{W}$ to $\boldsymbol{P}_{S}^{*}$ . This leads to the additional terms of trade loss $\boldsymbol{e}+\boldsymbol{f}+\boldsymbol{g}$ , which is equal to $\boldsymbol{P_{W}}-\boldsymbol{P}_{S}^{*}$ times the quantity exported with the subsidy. So an export subsidy unambiguously leads to costs that exceed its benefits.

# THE UNFRIENDLY SKIES: SETTLING THE LONGEST RUNNING TRADE DISPUTE  

gent on export performance.7 But what about more general production subsidies to companies that export—even if the subsidies are not directly tied to export performance? (This is the case we described in our theoretical model of export subsidies.) When it can be shown that those subsidies  

harm producers in other countries, the WTO labels those subsidies “actionable” and allows the impacted countries to impose countervailing duties (tariffs) against the subsidizing country.  

In 2021, the United States and the European Union finally agreed to  

end their 17-year trade dispute regarding the production subsidies received by Boeing and Airbus (the world’s two largest passenger airplane manufacturers). In 2004, the United States filed a case with the WTO complaining that European-owned Airbus had received favorable loan agreements for the development of their new A380 and A350 jumbo jets. The European Union immediately filed a counterclaim that Boeing received tax rebates and favorable contracting terms from the U.S. government. Both governments claimed that the assistance received by the airplane manufacturers amounted to actionable export subsidies—given the global nature of the market for passenger jets and the intense competition between those two firms. Eventually, after 14 years of legal wrangling and multiple rounds of appeals, the WTO ruled in favor of both cases, allowing both the United States and the European Union to impose countervailing duties.  

![](images/4281eba227feb92c01337ec3647e41c7d4e470809ddbe63e1e7b16541a75c394.jpg)  

In 2019, the United States imposed tariffs on European wines and specialty food items. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on U.S. whiskey, nuts, and tobacco. After several additional retaliatory tariff rounds and a change in U.S. administrations, the Biden administration and the European Union agreed in 2021 to remove the tariffs and address the favorable financial treatments received by both airline manufacturers.  

# Import Quotas: Theory  

An import quota is a direct restriction on the quantity of some good that may be imported. The restriction is usually enforced by issuing licenses to some group of individuals or firms. For example, the United States has a quota on imports of foreign cheese. The only firms allowed to import cheese are certain trading companies, each of which is allocated the right to import a maximum number of pounds of cheese each year; the size of each firm’s quota is based on the amount of cheese it imported in the past. In some important cases, notably sugar and apparel, the right to sell in the United States is given directly to the governments of exporting countries. Another example is the European Union applying tariff quotas to imports of a specified origin.8  

It is important to avoid having the misconception that import quotas somehow limit imports without raising domestic prices. The truth is that an import quota always raises the domestic price of the imported good. When imports are limited, the immediate result is that at the initial price, the demand for the good exceeds domestic supply plus imports. This causes the price to be bid up until the market clears. In the end, an import quota will raise domestic prices by the same amount as a tariff that limits imports to the same level (except in the case of domestic monopoly, in which the quota raises prices more than this; see the appendix to this chapter).  

The difference between a quota and a tariff is that with a quota, the government receives no revenue. When a quota instead of a tariff is used to restrict imports, the sum of money that would have appeared with a tariff as government revenue is collected by whoever receives the import licenses. License holders are thus able to buy imports and resell them at a higher price in the domestic market. The profits received by the holders of import licenses are known as quota rents. In assessing the costs and benefits of an import quota, it is crucial to determine who gets the rents. When the rights to sell in the domestic market are assigned to governments of exporting countries, as is often the case, the transfer of rents abroad makes the costs of a quota substantially higher than the equivalent tariff.  

# Tariff-Rate Quota Origin and its Application in Practice with Oilseeds  

In international trade, oilseed products are one of the most highly traded agricultural products (others include grains and meat), making this trade one of crucial importance for many countries, either through production or utilization. Oilseeds are crops that have high oil content such as soybeans, rapeseed, sunflower, flax, and cottonseed. In 2001, about 80 percent of the world imports of oilseeds consisted of 11 percent soybeans, 9 percent rapeseed, and other types of oilseeds. Tariff quotas for these goods are more often applied than those for the traditionally protected products like dairy or sugar.  

In practice, in 1990s world trade in oilseeds generally was characterized by “low to moderate” applied tariffs and bound tariff rates. The bound tariff rate, which is the maximum allowable rate under a country’s WTO commitments, in most cases is quite high, particularly in developing countries. For instance, the highest tariffs were imposed by Colombia (and Venezuela) with a 15 percent duty to its imports of soybeans in 2001, but it had a bound tariff rate of 97 percent under the WTO commitment. India had a 40 percent applied tariff, but imposed a 100 percent bound tariff rate. In general, tariff rates on oilseed products (for example, vegetable oils and oilseed meal) were much higher than those on whole oilseeds. This situation is called tariff escalation and its practice was designed for two main reasons: to protect both domestic oilseed crushing industry and vegetable oil refineries, and to discourage the development of processing activities in the countries of its origin.  

In Japan, for example, with limited domestic oilseed production, there was no tariff on whole oilseeds. However, a tariff of 12.9 yen/kg for soy oil/rape oil was imposed with intention to protect local crushers.9 The EU applied a tariff on soybean oil of 30 percent ad valorem, and had a bound tariff of 45 percent, for soybean meal a tariff was 5 percent (with a bound tariff of 10 percent). Although the duty on soybeans imports was bound duty-free under WTO commitment, all other oilseeds and oilseed meals imports also had free of duty import status under the Dillon round. An alternative measure in the form of non-tariff policies, specifically domestic price support and subsidies, served producers as a substitute. These policies encouraged excess production and distorted trade flows as well as reduced world imports, increased export subsidies, and encouraged low-price selling on world markets. EU oilseed production subsidies, real price supports, budgetary expenditures or oilseed crops increased dramatically (by 1985, the budgetary expenditure on oilseeds and protein crops exceeded 10 percent of the EU’s total annual spending on agriculture) for domestic growers resulted in oilseeds production increase.10 The EU nearly tripled oilseed production between 1980 and 1990, which contributed to a 53 percent drop in the volume of US soybean and soybean meals export for the same period, displacing and impairing US exports to the EU. This led to an oilseeds dispute between the United States and the EU in the end of 1980s, which was later solved by the Blair House agreement on oilseeds.11  

Uruguay’s Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) had greatly influenced the process of trade barriers reduction and the major achievement was cut in tariff levels on agricultural products, lowering the volume of and expenditures on subsidized export and reducing domestic programs for agriculture. Participating developed countries in URAA were required to reduce existing tariffs on agricultural products on an average of 36 percent. Whereas developing countries had committed to smaller average tariff reductions of 24 percent and longer transition period compared to developed countries. Another important requirement was to convert existing nontariff agricultural trade barriers to tariffs, establishing a tariff-rate quota (TRQ).  

The idea by TRQ was to impose a lower tariff rate to imports below a certain quantitative limit and higher tariffs to imports above that initial limit. As of URAA tariffs were to be reduced from the base levels to a bound level. According to URAA, the size of quota was aimed to be equal or greater than actual import levels during a recent period and required that out-of-quota bound tariff rates be reduced from the based tariff rates. In 1997 40 percent of 1,366 TRQs were supposed to increase their quotas, indicating easier market access.12 Of these TRQs, 124 (which is 9 percent) were applied to oilseeds and products. The 21 member states of the WTO notified having at least one TRQ on oilseeds or oilseed products. For instance, Iceland had 22 TRQs—Colombia, 20; Venezuela, 19; South Africa, 8; Guatemala, 7; and Thailand and Morocco had 6.13 The URAA fixed an upper bound on tariff levels for agricultural commodities, however these limits were often quite high, varying by country.

The establishment of TRQ aimed to bring more transparency of non-tariff barriers to trade and though was a major achievement, the level of trade creation resulting from these TRQs were quite modest. For TRQ quotas to be more effective and for the trade to be more liberalized, reduced tariffs (or elimination) on imports above the quota or increasing the quota level would be far better options for overall trade. The modest result was mostly linked to high over-quotas tariff rates, which was a barrier to trade in oilseeds and products. Overall tariff-rate quota became a more often used form of domestic market protection and in a way a gradual alternative to international trade liberalization form.  

# PERSPECTIVE ON EU OILSEED MARKET  

The EU is one of the top importers of oilseeds products, and oilseeds consumption is higher than the net production minus exports. In fact, the EU is highly dependent on imports of oilseed and its products (protein meals and vegetable oils). Oilseeds (rapeseed, sunflower seed, soybeans, and linseed) are grown in the European Union for food, feed, fuel and industrial purposes. Nearly all oilseeds are crushed and processed to produce oil and meal.14 Vegetable oils are used in the food industry, biodiesel and other industries. Oilseeds meals are also essential protein-rich animal fee ingredient. Some oilseeds have limited or no domestic production (such as soybeans, soybean products and palm oil). Around 54 percent of soybean meal, around 50 percent of sunflower meal and more that 80 percent of soybeans for crush are imported to meet the domestic demand. In the EU, cereal production represents the most important use of arable land, whereas 5.4 million ha are allocated to the production of oilseeds. Currently, about 2/3 of the oilseeds consumed within the European Union each year are produced in the EU and the rest is being imported. Since 2012, there are no specific domestic support measures for the production of oilseeds in the EU and no longer any restriction on the EU’s oilseed area.  

# FIGURE 9-16  

Tariffs on oilseeds as well as oilseed meals are set at zero, some duties vegetable oils (except olive oil) range from 0 to 12.8 percent.

From January 2002 to June 2008, the world’s food prices saw a drastic growth due to several factors. The rapid increase in oilseed prices was mostly caused by a large increase in biofuels production from grains and oilseeds both in the US and EU. The growth in the EU poultry sector was mostly responsible for the growing demand for protein feed. With mandatory use of biofuels in the EU by 2020 (as stated by the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive)16, the use of vegetable oils in the EU also increased, causing prices to rise as well as pushing the domestic oilseed production to grow.  

# Voluntary Export Restraints  

A variant on the import quota is the voluntary export restraint (VER), also known as a voluntary restraint agreement (VRA). (Welcome to the bureaucratic world of trade policy, where everything has a three-letter symbol!) A VER is a quota on trade imposed from the exporting country’s side instead of the importer’s. The most famous example is the limitation on auto exports to the United States enforced by Japan after 1981. The oil crisis in 1979 drastically raised oil prices and caused demand in the U.S. market to shift abruptly toward smaller cars. The cost advantage in favor of Japanese-produced cars was especially salient in this segment of the car market, and U.S. imports of Japanese cars soared as U.S. production declined. Strong political forces in the United States demanded protection. Rather than act unilaterally and risk creating a trade war, the U.S. and Japanese governments negotiated a “voluntary” limit on Japanese car exports to the United States.  

As in this example, voluntary export restraints are generally imposed at the request of the importer and are agreed to by the exporter to forestall other trade restrictions. As we will see in Chapter 10, certain political and legal advantages have made VERs preferred instruments of trade policy in some cases. From an economic point of view, however, a voluntary export restraint is exactly like an import quota where the licenses are assigned to foreign governments and is therefore very costly to the importing country. A VER is always more costly to the importing country than a tariff that limits imports by the same amount. The difference is that what would have been revenue under a tariff becomes rents earned by foreigners under the VER, so that the VER clearly produces a loss for the importing country. The U.S. government estimated that the VER with Japan cost U.S. auto consumers $\$3.2$ billion in 1984 alone with no offsetting tariff revenue collected by the U.S. government.  

Some voluntary export agreements cover more than one country. The most famous multilateral agreement is the Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which limited textile exports from 22 countries until the beginning of 2005. Such multilateral voluntary restraint agreements are known by yet another three-letter abbreviation: OMA, for “orderly marketing agreement.” Since then, the WTO has changed its rules and no longer allows VERs. However, this only applies to an agreement negotiated by governments and imposed onto exporters. In 2013, a European Union–China trade dispute over a surge in Chinese exports of solar panels was resolved by the Chinese producers “agreeing” to limit their exports to EU countries below 7 gigawatts-worth of solar panels per year—along with a minimum price floor for those units.  

# Local Content Requirements  

A local content requirement (also called rules of origin) is a regulation that requires some specified fraction of a final good to be produced domestically. In some cases, this fraction is specified in physical units, like the U.S. oil import quota in the 1960s. In other cases, the requirement is stated in value terms by requiring that some minimum share of the price of a good represent domestic value added.  

From the point of view of the domestic producers of parts, a local content regulation provides protection in the same way an import quota does. From the point of view of the firms that must buy locally, however, the effects are somewhat different. Local content does not place a strict limit on imports. Instead, it allows firms to import more, provided that they also buy more domestically. This means that the effective price of inputs to the firm is an average of the price of imported and domestically produced inputs.  

Consider, for instance, the earlier automobile example in which the cost of imported parts is $\$6,000$ . Suppose purchasing the same parts domestically would cost $\$10,000$ , but assembly firms are required to use 50 percent domestic parts. Then they will face an average cost of parts of $\mathbb{S8},000=(0.5\times\mathbb{S6},000+0.5\times\mathbb{S10},000$ ), which will be reflected in the final price of the car.  

The important point is that a local content requirement does not produce either government revenue or quota rents. Instead, the difference between the prices of imports and domestic goods in effect gets averaged in the final price and is passed on to consumers.  

Local content requirements are very common in certain industries, such as the automotive sector. When the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA; see the case study in Chapter 8) was recently renegotiated as the United States-MexicoCanada Agreement (USMCA) in 2020, the regional content requirements for vehicles was increased from 62.5 to 75 percent. This means that any car or truck exported within North America must contain at least 75 percent of content produced within the region. And an additional requirement was added stipulating that 45 percent of the content must be made by workers earning at least $\$16$ an hour. This effectively excludes most of the auto parts made in Mexico, where the wages are below that threshold. As we discuss in Chapter 10 (see the box on free trade area versus customs union), it is common for free trade areas such as NAFTA-USMCA to include local content requirements to address differences in each country’s tariffs with trading partners outside the region. However, those content restrictions are much more stringent than those needed to ensure that importers do not exploit differences in automotive tariffs between the North American countries. For example, the cost share of vehicle assembly (labor and capital services) is below 20 percent. A content requirement of 75 percent does much more than ensure that a vehicle is assembled in North America; it requires that most of the parts used in the assembly process be produced in North America and that 45 percent of them be produced in either the United States or Canada—given the wage requirement. The U.S. negotiators of the new USMCA treaty made clear that their intent was to impose additional restrictions on vehicles assembled in Mexico intended for sale in the U.S. market. In contrast, a vehicle assembled and sold in the United States need not satisfy any of those content restrictions.  

As we describe in the following box, governments also face local content requirements for their own purchases.  

# HEALTHCARE PROTECTION WITH LOCAL CONTENT REQUIREMENTS  

ocal content requirements (LCR) are attracting more and more attention as a non-tariff form of protectionism providing domestic producers additional benefits over the foreign competitors. In fact, both developed and developing countries have turned their interest towards this policy. While LCR has been around for a long period of time, in recent years a substantial increase has been witnessed in the use of these restrictions, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. Using LCR, various governments have put in efforts to improve domestic employment and industrial performance.  

For example, the healthcare sector in Brazil is divided into three groups: medical services and hospitals, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. While hospitals and other providers of medical services in Brazil cannot be owned by foreign companies, foreign companies are actively engaged in other healthcare sector groups: imported medical devices make around 60 percent and pharmaceuticals, 24 percent of Brazilian market. In 2011, the Brazilian pharmaceutical market was around $\$30$ billion, while the medical devices sector was more than 10 times bigger and made roughly $\$4$ billion. The Brazilian Ministry of Health controls the market of healthcare products and services through a licensing system. In order to sell either pharmaceutical or healthcare products, a producer (regardless the origin of the goods) must receive approval of the products registration as well as obtain a license.  

The idea of these requirements is to set a population’s sanitary control of production and marketing. As a result, it creates additional costs and requires additional time for foreign companies to register medical devices in the Brazilian market. Although registration requirements do not fall into the discriminative policy, it generates delays in business while waiting for approvals, permissions, and additional costs. Around 70 percent of Brazilian pharmaceuticals are manufactured by foreign companies, thus, foreign companies tend to acquire Brazilian companies or construct green field production plants because of the local content requirements and other aspects. In addition, with the target to create demand for domestic products and positively influence economy and increase employment rate in 2012, the Brazilian government established a LCR policy—up to 25 percent preferences for Brazilian medical devices and medicine in government contracts. This local content requirement obviously has a discriminative nature for those devices and medication produced abroad.17  

# Other Trade Policy Instruments  

Governments influence trade in many other ways. We list some of them briefly.  

1.	 Export credit subsidies. This is like an export subsidy except that it takes the form of a subsidized loan to the buyer. The United States, like most other countries, has a government institution, the Export-Import Bank, devoted to providing at least slightly subsidized loans to aid exports.   
2.	 National procurement. Purchases by the government or strongly regulated firms can be directed toward domestically produced goods even when these goods are more expensive than imports. In many countries, the major firms operating in sectors such as telecommunication, power generation and distribution, transportation, and mining are either partially or fully owned by the government. Those firms often face pressure to source from domestic suppliers.   
3.	 Red-tape barriers. Sometimes a government wants to restrict imports without doing so formally. Fortunately or unfortunately, it is easy to twist normal health, safety, and customs procedures in order to place substantial obstacles in the way of trade. The classic example is the French decree in 1982 that all Japanese videocassette recorders had to pass through the tiny customs house at Poitiers (an inland city nowhere near a major port)—effectively limiting the actual imports to a handful.  

# The Effects of Trade Policy: A Summary  

The effects of the major instruments of trade policy are usefully summarized by Table 9-1, which compares the effect of four major kinds of trade policy on the welfare of consumers.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE 9-1</td><td colspan="4">Effects of Alternative TradePolicies</td></tr><tr><td>Policy</td><td> Tariff</td><td>Export Subsidy</td><td>Import Quota</td><td>Voluntary Export Restraint</td></tr><tr><td>Producer surplus Consumer surplus</td><td>Increases</td><td>Increases Falls</td><td>Increases Falls</td><td>Increases Falls</td></tr><tr><td>Government revenue</td><td>Falls Increases</td><td>Falls (government</td><td>No change (rents to license</td><td>No change (rents to foreigners)</td></tr><tr><td>Overall national</td><td>Ambiguous</td><td>spending rises) Falls</td><td>holders) Ambiguous</td><td>Falls</td></tr><tr><td>welfare</td><td>(falls for small country)</td><td></td><td>(falls for small country)</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

This table certainly does not look like an advertisement for interventionist trade policy. All four trade policies benefit producers and hurt consumers. The effects of the policies on economic welfare are at best ambiguous; two of the policies definitely hurt the nation as a whole, while tariffs and import quotas are potentially beneficial only for large countries that can drive down world prices.  

Why, then, do governments so often act to limit imports or promote exports? We turn to this question in Chapter 10.  

1.	 In contrast to our earlier analysis, which stressed the general equilibrium interaction of markets, for analysis of trade policy it is usually sufficient to use a partial equilibrium approach.   
2.	 A tariff drives a wedge between foreign and domestic prices, raising the domestic price but by less than the tariff rate. An important and relevant special case, however, is that of a “small” country that cannot have any substantial influence on foreign prices. In the small-country case, a tariff is fully reflected in domestic prices.   
3.	 The costs and benefits of a tariff or other trade policy may be measured using the concepts of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Using these concepts, we can show that the domestic producers of a good gain because a tariff raises the price they receive; the domestic consumers lose, for the same reason. There is also a gain in government revenue.   
4.	 If we add together the gains and losses from a tariff, we find that the net effect on national welfare can be separated into two parts: On one hand is an efficiency loss, which results from the distortion in the incentives facing domestic producers and consumers. On the other hand is a terms of trade gain, reflecting the tendency of a tariff to drive down foreign export prices. In the case of a small country that cannot affect foreign prices, the second effect is zero, so that there is an unambiguous loss.   
5.	 The analysis of a tariff can be readily adapted to analyze other trade policy measures, such as export subsidies, import quotas, and voluntary export restraints. An export subsidy causes efficiency losses similar to those of a tariff but compounds these losses by causing a deterioration of the terms of trade. Import quotas and voluntary export restraints differ from tariffs in that the government gets no revenue. Instead, what would have been government revenue accrues as rents to the recipients of import licenses (in the case of a quota) and to foreigners (in the case of a voluntary export restraint).

6.	 For a company that produces candy canes, sugar is 70 percent of its ingredient costs. The United States limits the imports of sugar to protect cane farmers, which has led to an increase in the price of sugar by about 25 percent relative to what it would be otherwise. Suppose your country, however, allows free trade in candy canes, which are made with sugar that accounts for approximately 65 percent of its cost. What is the effective rate of protection on the process of turning sugar into candy canes?

# Tariffs and Import Quotas in the Presence of Monopoly  

The trade policy analysis in this chapter assumed that markets are perfectly competitive, so that all firms take prices as given. As we argued in Chapter 8, however, many markets for internationally traded goods are imperfectly competitive. The effects of international trade policies can be affected by the nature of the competition in a market.  

When we analyze the effects of trade policy in imperfectly competitive markets, a new consideration appears: International trade limits monopoly power, and policies that limit trade may therefore increase monopoly power. Even if a firm is the only producer of a good in a country, it will have little ability to raise prices if there are many foreign suppliers and free trade. If imports are limited by a quota, however, the same firm will be free to raise prices without fear of competition.  

The link between trade policy and monopoly power may be understood by examining a model in which a country imports a good and its import-competing production is controlled by only one firm. The country is small on world markets, so the price of the import is unaffected by its trade policy. For this model, we examine and compare the effects of free trade, a tariff, and an import quota.  

# FIGURE 9A-1  

# A Monopolist Under Free Trade  

# The Model with Free Trade  

The threat of import competition forces the monopolist to behave like a perfectly competitive industry.  

Figure 9A-1 shows free trade in a market where a domestic monopolist faces competition from imports. $D$ is the domestic demand curve: demand for the product by domestic residents. $P_{W}$ is the world price of the good; imports are available in unlimited quantities at that price. The domestic industry is assumed to consist of only a single firm, whose marginal cost curve is $M C.$ .  

![](images/028bafb59f9074b7cfe972e6608a68ca156c876f87b3a3107498770da6117b80.jpg)  

If there were no trade in this market, the domestic firm would behave as an ordinary profit-maximizing monopolist. Corresponding to $D$ is a marginal revenue curve $M R$ , and the firm would choose the monopoly profit-maximizing level of output $Q_{M}$ and price $P_{M}$ .  

With free trade, however, this monopoly behavior is not possible. If the firm tried to charge $P_{M}$ , or indeed any price above $P_{W}$ , nobody would buy its product because cheaper imports would be available. Thus international trade puts a lid on the monopolist’s price at $P_{W}$ .  

Given this limit on its price, the best the monopolist can do is produce up to the point where marginal cost is equal to the world price, at $Q_{f}.$ At the price $P_{W},$ domestic consumers will demand $D_{f}$ units of the good, so imports will be $D_{f}-Q_{f}.$ This outcome, however, is exactly what would have happened if the domestic industry had been perfectly competitive. With free trade, then, the fact that the domestic industry is a monopoly does not make any difference in the outcome.  

# The Model with a Tariff  

The effect of a tariff is to raise the maximum price the domestic industry can charge. If a specific tariff $t$ is charged on imports, the domestic industry can now charge $\mathit{P_{W}}+\mathit{t}$ (Figure 9A-2). The industry still is not free to raise its price all the way to the monopoly price, however, because consumers will still turn to imports if the price rises above the world price plus the tariff. Thus the best the monopolist can do is to set price equal to marginal cost, at $\textstyle Q_{t}$ . The tariff raises the domestic price as well as the output of the domestic industry, while demand falls to $D_{t}$ and thus imports fall. However, the domestic industry still produces the same quantity as if it were perfectly competitive.12  

# FIGURE 9A-2  

# A Monopolist Protected by a Tariff  

The tariff allows the monopolist to raise its price, but the price is still limited by the threat of imports.

# The Model with an Import Quota  

Suppose the government imposes a limit on imports, restricting their quantity to a fixed level $\overline{{\boldsymbol{{Q}}}}$ . Then the monopolist knows that when it charges a price above $P_{W},$ it will not lose all its sales. Instead, it will sell whatever domestic demand is at that price, minus the allowed imports $\overline{{\mathcal{Q}}}$ . Thus, the demand facing the monopolist will be domestic demand less allowed imports. We define the post-quota demand curve as $D_{q}\mathrm{;}$ it is parallel to the domestic demand curve $D$ but shifted $\overline{{\boldsymbol{{Q}}}}$ units to the left (so long as the quota is binding and the domestic price is above the world price $P_{W}$ ; see Figure 9A-3).  

Corresponding to $D_{q}$ is a new marginal revenue curve $M R_{q}$ . The firm protected by an import quota maximizes profit by setting marginal cost equal to this new marginal revenue, producing $Q_{q}$ and charging the price $P_{q}$ . (The license to import one unit of the good will therefore yield a rent of $P_{q}-P_{W},$ )  

# Comparing a Tariff and a Quota  

We now ask how the effects of a tariff and a quota compare. To do this, we compare a tariff and a quota that lead to the same level of imports (Figure 9A-4). The tariff level t leads to a level of imports $\overline{{\boldsymbol{{Q}}}}$ ; we therefore ask what would happen if instead of a tariff, the government simply limited imports to $\overline{{\boldsymbol{{Q}}}}$ .  

We see from the figure that the results are not the same. The tariff leads to domestic production of $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ and a domestic price of $P_{W}+t$ . The quota leads to a lower level of domestic production, $Q_{q},$ and a higher price, $P_{q}.$ . When protected by a tariff, the monopolistic domestic industry behaves as if it were perfectly competitive; when protected by a quota, it clearly does not.  

The reason for this difference is that an import quota creates more monopoly power than a tariff. When monopolistic industries are protected by tariffs, domestic firms know that if they raise their prices too high, they will still be undercut by imports. An import quota, on the other hand, provides absolute protection: No matter how high the domestic price, imports cannot exceed the quota level.  

# FIGURE 9A-3  

# A Monopolist Protected by an Import Quota  

The monopolist is now free to raise prices, knowing that the domestic price of imports will rise too.

# FIGURE 9A-4  

# Comparing a Tariff and a Quota  

A quota leads to lower domestic output and a higher price than a tariff that yields the same level of imports.

This comparison seems to say that if governments are concerned about domestic monopoly power, they should prefer tariffs to quotas as instruments of trade policy. In fact, however, protection has increasingly drifted away from tariffs toward nontariff barriers, including import quotas. To explain this, we need to look at considerations other than economic efficiency that motivate governments.
