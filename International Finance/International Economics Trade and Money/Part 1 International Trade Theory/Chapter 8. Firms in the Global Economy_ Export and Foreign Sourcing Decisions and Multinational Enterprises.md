# CHAPTER 8  

# Firms in the Global Economy: Export and Foreign Sourcing Decisions and Multinational Enterprises  

n this chapter, we continue to explore how economies of scale generate incenI tives for international specialization and trade. We now focus on economies of scale that are internal to the firm. As mentioned in Chapter 7, this form of increasing returns leads to a market structure that features imperfect competition. Internal economies of scale imply that a firm’s average cost of production decreases the more output it produces. Perfect competition that drives the price of a good down to marginal cost would imply losses for those firms because they would not be able to recover the higher costs incurred from producing the initial units of output.1 As a result, perfect competition would force those firms out of the market, and this process would continue until an equilibrium featuring imperfect competition is attained.  

Modeling imperfect competition means that we will explicitly consider the behavior of individual firms. This will allow us to introduce two additional characteristics of firms that are prevalent in the real world: (1) In most sectors, firms produce goods that are differentiated from one another. In the case of certain goods (such as bottled water and staples), those differences across products may be small, while in others (such as cars and cell phones), the differences are much more significant. (2) Performance measures (such as size and profits) vary widely across firms. We will incorporate this first characteristic (product differentiation) into our analysis throughout this chapter. To ease exposition and build intuition, we will initially consider the case when there are no performance differences between firms. We will thus see how internal economies of scale and product differentiation combine to generate some new sources of gains of trade via economic integration.  

We will then introduce differences across firms so that we can analyze how firms respond differently to international forces. We will see how economic integration generates both winners and losers among different types of firms. The better-performing firms thrive and expand, while the worse-performing firms contract. This generates one additional source of gain from trade: As production is concentrated toward better-performing firms, the overall efficiency of the industry improves. Lastly, we will study why those better-performing firms have a greater incentive to engage in the global economy, either by exporting, by sourcing some of their intermediate production processes abroad, or by becoming multinationals and operating in multiple countries.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

Understand how internal economies of scale and product differentiation lead to international trade and intra-industry trade.   
Recognize the new types of welfare gains from intra-industry trade.   
Describe how economic integration can lead to both winners and losers among firms in the same industry.   
Explain why economists believe that “dumping” should not be singled out as an unfair trade practice and why the enforcement of antidumping laws leads to protectionism.   
Explain why firms that engage in the global economy (exporters, outsourcers, multinationals) are substantially larger and perform better than firms that do not interact with foreign markets.   
Understand theories that explain the existence of multinationals and the motivation for foreign direct investment across economies.  

# The Theory of Imperfect Competition  

In a perfectly competitive market—a market in which there are many buyers and sellers, none of whom represents a large part of the market—firms are price takers. That is, they are sellers of products who believe they can sell as much as they like at the current price but cannot influence the price they receive for their product. For example, a wheat farmer can sell as much wheat as she likes without worrying that if she tries to sell more wheat, she will depress the market price. The reason she need not worry about the effect of her sales on prices is that any individual wheat grower represents only a tiny fraction of the world market.  

When only a few firms produce a good, however, the situation is different. To take perhaps the most dramatic example, the aircraft manufacturing giant Boeing shares the market for large jet aircraft with only one major rival, the European firm Airbus. As a result, Boeing knows that if it produces more aircraft, it will have a significant effect on the total supply of planes in the world and will therefore significantly drive down the price of airplanes. Or to put it another way, Boeing knows that if it wants to sell more airplanes, it can do so only by significantly reducing its price. In imperfect competition, then, firms are aware that they can influence the prices of their products and that they can sell more only by reducing their price. This situation occurs in one of two ways: when there are only a few major producers of a particular good, or when each firm produces a good that is differentiated (in the eyes of the consumer) from that of rival firms. As we mentioned in the introduction, this type of competition is an inevitable outcome when there are economies of scale at the level of the firm: The number of surviving firms is forced down to a small number and/or firms must develop products that are clearly differentiated from those produced by their rivals. Under these circumstances, each firm views itself as a price setter, choosing the price of its product, rather than a price taker.  

When firms are not price takers, it is necessary to develop additional tools to describe how prices and outputs are determined. The simplest imperfectly competitive market structure to examine is that of a pure monopoly, a market in which a firm faces no competition; the tools we develop for this structure can then be used to examine more complex market structures.  

# Monopoly: A Brief Review  

Figure 8-1 shows the position of a single monopolistic firm. The firm faces a downwardsloping demand curve, shown in the figure as $D$ . The downward slope of $D$ indicates that the firm can sell more units of output only if the price of the output falls. As you may recall from basic microeconomics, a marginal revenue curve corresponds to the demand curve. Marginal revenue is the extra or marginal revenue the firm gains from selling an additional unit. Marginal revenue for a monopolist is always less than the price because to sell an additional unit, the firm must lower the price of all units (not just the marginal one). Thus, for a monopolist, the marginal revenue curve, $M R$ , always lies below the demand curve.  

Marginal Revenue and Price  For our analysis of the monopolistic competition model later in this section, it is important for us to determine the relationship between the price the monopolist receives per unit and marginal revenue. Marginal revenue is always less than the price—but how much less? The relationship between marginal revenue and  

# FIGURE 8-1  

# Monopolistic Pricing and Production Decisions  

A monopolistic firm chooses an output at which marginal revenue, the increase in revenue from selling an additional unit, equals marginal cost, the cost of producing an additional unit. This profit-maximizing output is shown as $Q_{M}; $ the price at which this output is demanded is $P_{M}$ . The marginal revenue curve $M R$ lies below the demand curve $D$ because, for a monopoly, marginal revenue is always less than the price. The monopoly’s profits are equal to the area of the shaded rectangle, the difference between price and average cost times the amount of output sold.  

![](images/99791dcbe425396a0c6b8e5f3cb14bd06789ca99677b1c32581342ad95c1f610.jpg)  

price depends on two things. First, it depends on how much output the firm is already selling: A firm not selling very many units will not lose much by cutting the price it receives on those units. Second, the gap between price and marginal revenue depends on the slope of the demand curve, which tells us how much the monopolist has to cut his price to sell one more unit of output. If the curve is very flat, then the monopolist can sell an additional unit with only a small price cut. As a result, he will not have to lower the price by very much on the units he would otherwise have sold, so marginal revenue will be close to the price per unit. On the other hand, if the demand curve is very steep, selling an additional unit will require a large price cut, implying that marginal revenue will be much less than the price.  

We can be more specific about the relationship between price and marginal revenue if we assume that the demand curve the firm faces is a straight line. When this is the case, the dependence of the monopolist’s total sales on the price it charges can be represented by an equation of the form  

$$
Q=A-B\times P,
$$  

where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ is the number of units the firm sells, $P$ is the price it charges per unit, and $A$ and $B$ are constants. We show in the appendix to this chapter that in this case, marginal revenue is  

$$
\mathrm{Marginal\revenue}=M R=P-Q/B,
$$  

implying that  

$$
P-M R=Q/B.
$$  

Equation (8-2) reveals that the gap between price and marginal revenue depends on the initial sales, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ , of the firm and the slope parameter, $B$ , of its demand curve. If sales quantity, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ , is higher, marginal revenue is lower because the decrease in price required to sell a greater quantity costs the firm more. In other words, the greater is $B$ , the more sales fall for any given increase in price and the closer the marginal revenue is to the price of the good. Equation (8-2) is crucial for our analysis of the monopolistic competition model of trade in the upcoming section.  

Average and Marginal Costs  Returning to Figure 8-1, $A C$ represents the firm’s average cost of production, that is, its total cost divided by its output. The downward slope reflects our assumption that there are economies of scale, so the larger the firm’s output, the lower its costs per unit. $M C$ represents the firm’s marginal cost (the amount it costs the firm to produce one extra unit). In the figure, we assumed the firm’s marginal cost is constant (the marginal cost curve is flat). The economies of scale must then come from a fixed cost (unrelated to the scale of production). This fixed cost pushes the average cost above the constant marginal cost of production, though the difference between the two becomes smaller and smaller as the fixed cost is spread over an increasing number of output units.  

If we denote $c$ as the firm’s marginal cost and $F$ as the fixed cost, then we can write the firm’s total cost $(C)$ as  

$$
C=F+c\times Q,
$$  

where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ is once again the firm’s output. Given this linear cost function, the firm’s average cost is  

$$
A C=C/Q=(F/Q)+c.
$$  

# FIGURE 8-2  

# Average versus Marginal Cost  

This figure illustrates the average and marginal costs corresponding to the total cost function $C=5+x.$ . Marginal cost is always $1;$ average cost declines as output rises.  

![](images/c2e2b04879779373fe7d724164a97b28de6284499ae211af7dff0d86bc8ff93e.jpg)  

As we have discussed, this average cost is always greater than the marginal cost $c$ and declines with output produced $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ .  

If, for example, $F=5$ and $c=1$ , the average cost of producing 10 units is $(5/10)+1=1.5\$ , and the average cost of producing 25 units is $(5/25)+1=1.2\$ . These numbers may look familiar because they were used to construct Table 7-1 in Chapter 7. (However, in this case, we assume a unit wage cost for the labor input, and that the technology now applies to a firm instead of an industry.) The marginal and average cost curves for this specific numeric example are plotted in Figure 8-2. Average cost approaches infinity at zero output and approaches marginal cost at very large output.  

The profit-maximizing output of a monopolist is that at which marginal revenue (the revenue gained from selling an extra unit) equals marginal cost (the cost of producing an extra unit), that is, at the intersection of the $M C$ and $M R$ curves. In Figure 8-1, we can see that the price at which the profit-maximizing output $Q_{M}$ is demanded is $P_{M},$ which is greater than average cost. When $P>\mathsf{A C}$ , the monopolist is earning some monopoly profits, as indicated by the shaded box.2  

# Monopolistic Competition  

Monopoly profits rarely go uncontested. A firm making high profits normally attracts competitors. Thus, situations of pure monopoly are rare in practice. In most cases, competitors do not sell the same products—either because they cannot (for legal or technological reasons) or because they would rather carve out their own product niche. This leads to a market where competitors sell differentiated products. Thus, even when there are many competitors, product differentiation allows firms to remain price setters for their own individual product “variety” or brand. However, more competition implies lower sales for any given firm at any chosen price: Each firm’s demand curve shifts in when there are more competitors (we will model this more explicitly in the following sections). Lower demand, in turn, translates into lower profits.  

The incentive for additional new competitors persists so long as such entry is profitable. Once competition reaches a certain level, additional entry would no longer be profitable, and a long-run equilibrium is attained. In some cases, this occurs when there are only a small number of competing firms in the market (such as the market for large jet aircraft). This leads to a market structure called oligopoly. In this situation, a single firm has enough market share to influence market aggregates such as total industry output and average industry price.3 This in turn affects the demand conditions for the other firms. They will therefore have an incentive to adjust their prices in response to the pricing decision of the large firm and vice versa when the other firms are large, too. Thus, pricing decisions of firms are interdependent in an oligopoly market structure: Each firm in an oligopoly will consider the expected responses of competitors when setting their price. These responses, however, depend in turn on the competitors’ expectations about the firm’s behavior—and we are therefore in a complex game in which firms are trying to second-guess each other’s strategies. We will briefly discuss an example of an oligopoly model with two firms in Chapter 12.  

Let’s focus on a much simpler case of imperfect competition known as monopolistic competition. This market structure arises when the equilibrium number of competing firms is large and no firm attains a substantial market share. Then, the pricing decision of any given firm will not affect market aggregates and the demand conditions for the other firms, so the pricing decisions of the firms are no longer interrelated. Each firm sets its price given those market aggregates, knowing that the response of any other individual firm would be inconsequential. We next develop such a model of monopolistic competition. We then introduce trade under this market structure in the following section.  

Assumptions of the Model  We begin by describing the demand facing a typical monopolistically competitive firm. In general, we would expect a firm to sell more, the larger the total demand for its industry’s product and the higher the prices charged by its rivals. On the other hand, we would expect the firm to sell less the greater the number of firms in the industry and the higher its own price. A particular equation for the demand facing a firm that has these properties is4  

$$
Q=S\times[1/n-b\times(P-\overline{{P}})],
$$  

where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ is the quantity of output demanded, $S$ is the total output of the industry, $n$ is the number of firms in the industry, $b$ is a positive constant term representing the responsiveness of a firm’s sales to its price, $P$ is the price charged by the firm itself, and $\overline{{P}}$ is the average price charged by its competitors. Equation (8-5) may be given the following intuitive justification: If all firms charge the same price, each will have a market share $1/n$ . A firm charging more than the average of other firms will have a smaller market share, whereas a firm charging less will have a larger share.5  

It is helpful to assume that total industry output $S$ is unaffected by the average price $\overline{{P}}$ charged by firms in the industry. That is, we assume that firms can gain customers only at each other’s expense. This is an unrealistic assumption, but it simplifies the analysis and helps us focus on the competition among firms. In particular, it means that $S$ is a measure of the size of the market and that if all firms charge the same price, each sells $S/n$ units.6  

Next, we turn to the costs of a typical firm. Here we simply assume that total and average costs of a typical firm are described by equations (8-3) and (8-4). Note that in this initial model, we assume all firms are symmetric even though they produce differentiated products: They all face the same demand curve (8-5) and have the same cost function (8-3). We will relax this assumption in the next section.  

Market Equilibrium  When the individual firms are symmetric, the state of the industry can be described without describing any of the features of individual firms: All we really need to know to describe the industry is how many firms there are and what price the typical firm charges. To analyze the industry—for example, to assess the effects of international trade—we need to determine the number of firms $n$ and the average price they charge $\overline{{P}}$ . Once we have a method for determining $n$ and $\overline{{P}}$ , we can ask how they are affected by international trade.  

Our method for determining $n$ and $\overline{{P}}$ involves three steps. (1) First, we derive a relationship between the number of firms and the average cost of a typical firm. We show that this relationship is upward sloping; that is, the more firms there are, the lower the output of each firm—and thus the higher each firm’s cost per unit of output. (2) We next show the relationship between the number of firms and the price each firm charges, which must equal $\overline{P}$ in equilibrium. We show that this relationship is downward sloping: The more firms there are, the more intense is the competition among firms, and as a result the lower the prices they charge. (3) Finally, we introduce firm entry and exit decisions based on the profits that each firm earns. When price exceeds average cost, firms earn positive profits and additional firms will enter the industry; conversely, when the price is less than average cost, profits are negative and those losses induce some firms to exit. In the long run, this entry and exit process drives profits to zero. So the price $\overline{{P}}$ set by each firm must equal the average cost from step (1).  

1.	 The number of firms and average cost. As a first step toward determining $n$ and $\overline{{P}}$ , we ask how the average cost of a typical firm depends on the number of firms in the industry. Since all firms are symmetric in this model, in equilibrium they all will charge the same price. But when all firms charge the same price, so that $P=\overline{{P}}$ , equation (8-5) tells us that $Q=S/n$ ; that is, each firm’s output $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ is a $1/n$ share of the total industry sales $S$ . But we saw in equation (8-4) that average cost depends inversely on a firm’s output. We therefore conclude that average cost depends on the size of the market and the number of firms in the industry:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{A C=F/Q\ +\ c=(n\times F/S)\ +\ c.}\end{array}
$$  

Equation (8-6) tells us that other things equal, the more firms there are in the industry, the higher is average cost. The reason is that the more firms there are, the less each firm produces. For example, imagine an industry with total sales of 1 million widgets annually. If there are five firms in the industry, each will sell 200,000 annually. If there are 10 firms, each will sell only 100,000, and therefore each firm will have higher average cost. The upward-sloping relationship between $n$ and average cost is shown as $C C$ in Figure 8-3.  

2.	 The number of firms and the price. Meanwhile, the price the typical firm charges also depends on the number of firms in the industry. In general, we would expect that the more firms there are, the more intense will be the competition among them, and hence the lower the price. This turns out to be true in this model, but proving it takes a moment. The basic trick is to show that each firm faces a straightline demand curve of the form we showed in equation (8-1), and then to use equation (8-2) to determine prices.  

First recall that in the monopolistic competition model, firms are assumed to take each other’s prices as given; that is, each firm ignores the possibility that if it changes its price, other firms will also change theirs. If each firm treats $\overline{P}$ as given, we can rewrite the demand curve (8-5) in the form  

$$
Q=[(S/n)+S\times b\times\overline{{P}}]-S\times b\times P,
$$  

![](images/63a38e5b8098a41d12c6cdbce4914ac2a906890060038d8e078fa078579e2ac4.jpg)  
FIGURE 8-3 Equilibrium in a Monopolistically Competitive Market  

The number of firms in a monopolistically competitive market, and the prices they charge, are determined by two relationships. On one side, the more firms there are, the more intensely they compete, and hence the lower is the industry price. This relationship is represented by $P P$ . On the other side, the more firms there are, the less each firm sells and therefore the higher is the industry’s average cost. This relationship is represented by CC. If price exceeds average cost (that is, if the $P P$ curve is above the CC curve), the industry will be making profits and additional firms will enter the industry; if price is less than average cost, the industry will be incurring losses and firms will leave the industry. The equilibrium price and number of firms occurs when price equals average cost, at the intersection of $P P$ and $C C$ .  

where $b$ is the parameter in equation (8-5) that measured the sensitivity of each firm’s market share to the price it charges. Now this equation is in the same form as (8-1), with $(S/n)\bar{+\:S}\times b\times\overline{{P}}$ in place of the constant term $A$ and $S\times b$ in place of the slope coefficient $B$ . If we plug these values back into the formula for marginal revenue, (8-2), we obtain the marginal revenue for a typical firm of  

$$
M R=P-Q/(S\times b).
$$  

Profit-maximizing firms will set marginal revenue equal to their marginal cost, $c$ , so that  

$$
M R=P-Q/(S\times b)=c,
$$  

which can be rearranged to give the following equation for the price charged by a typical firm:  

$$
P=c+Q/(S\times b).
$$  

We have already noted, however, that if all firms charge the same price, each will sell an amount $Q=S/n$ . Plugging this back into (8-9) gives us a relationship between the number of firms and the price each firm charges:  

$$
P=c+1/(b\times n).
$$  

Equation (8-10) says algebraically that the more firms there are in an industry, the lower the price each firm will charge. This is because each firm’s markup over marginal cost, $P-c=1/(b\times n)$ , decreases with the number of competing firms. Equation (8-10) is shown in Figure 8-3 as the downward-sloping curve $P P$ .  

3.	 The equilibrium number of firms. Let us now ask what Figure 8-3 means. We have summarized an industry by two curves. The downward-sloping curve $P P$ shows that the more firms there are in the industry, the lower the price each firm will charge: The more firms there are, the more competition each firm faces. The upward-sloping curve $C C$ tells us that the more firms there are in the industry, the higher the average cost of each firm: If the number of firms increases, each firm will sell less, so firms will not be able to move as far down their average cost curve.  

The two schedules intersect at point $E$ , corresponding to the number of firms $n_{2}$ . The significance of $n_{2}$ is that it is the zero-profit number of firms in the industry. When there are $n_{2}$ firms in the industry, their profit-maximizing price is $P_{2}$ , which is exactly equal to their average cost $A C_{2}$ . This is the long-run monopolistic competition equilibrium that we previously described.  

To see why, suppose that $n$ were less than $n_{2}$ , say $n_{1}$ . Then the price charged by firms would be $P_{1}$ , while their average cost would be only $A C_{1}$ . Thus, firms would be earning positive profits.7 Conversely, suppose that $n$ were greater than $n_{2}$ , say $n_{3}$ . Then firms would charge only the price $P_{3}$ , while their average cost would be $A C_{3}$ . Firms would be suffering losses (profit is negative). Over time, firms will enter an industry that is profitable and exit one in which they lose money. The number of firms will rise over time if it is less than $n_{2}$ , fall if it is greater, leading to the equilibrium price $P_{2}$ with $n_{2}$ firms.  

We have just developed a model of a monopolistically competitive industry in which we can determine the equilibrium number of firms and the average price that firms charge. We now use this model to derive some important conclusions about the role of economies of scale in international trade.  

# Monopolistic Competition and Trade  

Underlying the application of the monopolistic competition model to trade is the idea that trade increases market size. In industries where there are economies of scale, both the variety of goods that a country can produce and the scale of its production are constrained by the size of the market. By trading with each other, and therefore forming an integrated world market that is bigger than any individual national market, nations are able to loosen these constraints. Each country can thus specialize in producing a narrower range of products than it would in the absence of trade; yet by buying from other countries the goods that it does not make, each nation can simultaneously increase the variety of goods available to its consumers. As a result, trade offers an opportunity for mutual gain even when countries do not differ in their resources or technology.  

Suppose, for example, there are two countries, each with an annual market for 1 million automobiles. By trading with each other, these countries can create a combined market of 2 million autos. In this combined market, more varieties of automobiles can be produced, at lower average costs, than in either market alone.  

The monopolistic competition model can be used to show how trade improves the trade-off between scale and variety that individual nations face. We will begin by showing how a larger market leads to both a lower average price and the availability of a greater variety of goods in the monopolistic competition model. Applying this result to international trade, we observe that trade creates a world market larger than any of the national markets that comprise it. Integrating markets through international trade therefore has the same effects as growth of a market within a single country.  

# The Effects of Increased Market Size  

The number of firms in a monopolistically competitive industry and the prices they charge are affected by the size of the market. In larger markets there usually will be both more firms and more sales per firm; consumers in a large market will be offered both lower prices and a greater variety of products than consumers in small markets.  

To see this in the context of our model, look again at the $C C$ curve in Figure 8-3, which showed that average costs per firm are higher the more firms there are in the industry. The definition of the $C C$ curve is given by equation (8-6):  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{A C=F/Q\ +\ c=n\times F/S\ +\ c.}\end{array}
$$  

Examining this equation, we see that an increase in total industry output $S$ will reduce average costs for any given number of firms $n$ . The reason is that if the market grows  

while the number of firms is held constant, output per firm will increase and the average cost of each firm will therefore decline. Thus, if we compare two markets, one with higher $S$ than the other, the $C C$ curve in the larger market will be below that in the smaller one.  

Meanwhile, the $P P$ curve in Figure 8-3, which relates the price charged by firms to the number of firms, does not shift. The definition of that curve was given in equation (8-10):  

$$
P=c+1/(b\times n).
$$  

The size of the market does not enter into this equation, so an increase in $S$ does not shift the $P P$ curve.  

Figure 8-4 uses this information to show the effect of an increase in the size of the market on long-run equilibrium. Initially, equilibrium is at point 1, with a price $P_{1}$ and a number of firms $n_{1}$ . An increase in the size of the market, measured by industry sales $S$ , shifts the $C C$ curve down from $C C_{1}$ to $C C_{2}$ , while it has no effect on the $P P$ curve. The new equilibrium is at point 2: The number of firms increases from $n_{1}$ to $n_{2}$ , while the price falls from $P_{1}$ to $P_{2}$ .  

Clearly, consumers would prefer to be part of a large market rather than a small one. At point 2, a greater variety of products is available at a lower price than at point 1.

FIGURE 8-4  

# Effects of a Larger Market  

An increase in the size of the market allows each firm, other things equal, to produce more and thus have lower average cost. This is represented by a downward shift from $C C_{1}$ to $C C_{2}$ . The result is a simultaneous increase in the number of firms (and hence in the variety of goods available) and a fall in the price of each.  

# Gains from an Integrated Market: A Numerical Example  

International trade can create a larger market. We can illustrate the effects of trade on prices, scale, and the variety of goods available with a specific numerical example.  

Suppose automobiles are produced by a monopolistically competitive industry. The demand curve facing any given producer of automobiles is described by equation (8-5), with $b=1/30{,}000$ (this value has no particular significance; it was chosen to make the example come out neatly). Thus, the demand facing any one producer is given by  

$$
Q=S\times[(1/n)-(1/30,000)\times(P-\overline{{P}})],
$$  

where $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ is the number of automobiles sold per firm, $S$ is the total number sold for the industry, $n$ is the number of firms, $P$ is the price that a firm charges, and $\overline{{P}}$ is the average price of other firms. We also assume that the cost function for producing automobiles is described by equation (8-3), with a fixed cost $F=\$750,000,000$ and a marginal cost $c=\$5,000$ per automobile (again, these values were chosen to give nice results). The total cost is  

$$
C=750,000,000+(5,000\times Q).
$$  

The average cost curve is therefore  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathrm{AC}=(750,000,000/Q)+5,000.}\end{array}
$$  

Now suppose there are two countries, Home and Foreign. Home has annual sales of 900,000 automobiles; Foreign has annual sales of 1.6 million. The two countries are assumed, for the moment, to have the same costs of production.  

Figure 8-5a shows the $P P$ and $C C$ curves for the Home auto industry. We find that in the absence of trade, Home would have six automobile firms, selling autos at a price of $\$10,000$ each. (It is also possible to solve for $n$ and $P$ algebraically, as shown in the Mathematical Postscript to this chapter.) To confirm that this is the long-run equilibrium, we need to show that the pricing equation (8-10) is satisfied and that the price equals average cost.  

Substituting the actual values of the marginal cost $c$ , the demand parameter $b$ , and the number of Home firms $n$ into equation (8-10), we find  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{P=\S10,000=c+1/(b\times n)=\S5,000+1/[(1/30,000)\times6]}\\ {=\S5,000+\S5,000,}\end{array}
$$  

so the condition for profit maximization—marginal revenue equaling marginal cost—is satisfied. Each firm sells 900,000 units/6 firms = 150,000 units/firm. Its average cost is therefore  

$$
A C=(\mathbb{S}750,000,000/150,000)+\mathbb{S}5,000=\mathbb{S}10,000.
$$  

Since the average cost of $\$10,000$ per unit is the same as the price, all monopoly profits have been competed away. Thus six firms, selling each unit at a price of $\$10,000$ , with each firm producing 150,000 cars, is the long-run equilibrium in the Home market.  

What about Foreign? By drawing the $P P$ and $C C$ curves [panel (b) in Figure 8-5], we find that when the market is for 1.6 million automobiles, the curves intersect at $n=8$ , $P=8{,}750$ . That is, in the absence of trade, Foreign’s market would support eight firms, each producing 200,000 automobiles, and selling them at a price of $\$8,750$ . We can again confirm that this solution satisfies the equilibrium conditions:  

$$
P=88,750=c+1/(b\times n)=55,000+1/[(1/30,000)\times8]=55,000+53,750,
$$

FIGURE 8-5 Equilibrium in the Automobile Market  

(a) The Home market: With a market size of 900,000 automobiles, Home’s equilibrium, determined by the intersection of the $P P$ and $C C$ curves, occurs with six firms and an industry price of $\$10,000$ per auto. (b) The Foreign market: With a market size of 1.6 million automobiles, Foreign’s equilibrium occurs with eight firms and an industry price of $\$8,750$ per auto. (c) The combined market: Integrating the two markets creates a market for 2.5 million autos. This market supports 10 firms, and the price of an auto is only $\$8,000$ .  

and  

$$
A C=(\mathbb{S}750,000,000/200,000)+\mathbb{S}5,000=\mathbb{S}8,750.
$$  

Now suppose it is possible for Home and Foreign to trade automobiles costlessly with one another. This creates a new, integrated market [panel (c) in Figure 8-5] with total sales of 2.5 million. By drawing the $P P$ and $C C$ curves one more time, we find that this integrated market will support 10 firms, each producing 250,000 cars and selling them at a price of \$8,000. The conditions for profit maximization and zero profits are again satisfied:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{P=8,000=c+1/(b\times n)=5,000+1/[(1/30,000)\times10]}\\ {=85,000+83,000,\phantom{00000}}\end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
A C=(\mathbb{S}750,000,000/250,000)+\mathbb{S}5,000=\mathbb{S}8,000.
$$  

We summarize the results of creating an integrated market in Table 8-1. The table compares each market alone with the integrated market. The integrated market supports more firms, each producing at a larger scale and selling at a lower price than either national market does on its own.  

Clearly everyone is better off as a result of integration. In the larger market, consumers have a wider range of choices, yet each firm produces more and is therefore able to offer its product at a lower price. To realize these gains from integration, the countries must engage in international trade. To achieve economies of scale, each firm must concentrate its production in one country—either Home or Foreign. Yet it must sell its output to customers in both markets. So each product will be produced in only one country and exported to the other.  

This numerical example highlights two important new features about trade with monopolistic competition relative to the models of trade based on comparative advantage that we covered in Chapters 3 through 6: (1) First, the example shows how product differentiation and internal economies of scale lead to trade between similar countries with no comparative advantage differences between them. This is a very different kind of trade than the one based on comparative advantage, where each country exports its comparative advantage good. Here, both Home and Foreign export autos to one another. Home pays for the imports of some automobile models (those produced by firms in Foreign) with exports of different types of models (those produced by firms in Home)—and vice versa. This leads to what is called intra-industry trade: two-way exchanges of similar goods. (2) Second, the example highlights two new channels for welfare benefits from trade. In the integrated market after trade, both Home and Foreign consumers benefit from a greater variety of automobile models (10 versus 6 or 8) at a lower price (\$8,000 versus $\$8,750$ or $\$10,000$ ) as firms are able to consolidate their production destined for both locations and take advantage of economies of scale.9

Empirically, is intra-industry trade relevant, and do we observe gains from trade in the form of greater product variety and consolidated production at lower average cost? The answer is yes.  

# The Significance of Intra-Industry Trade  

The proportion of intra-industry trade in world trade has steadily grown over the last half-century. The measurement of intra-industry trade relies on an industrial classification system that categorizes goods into different industries. Depending on the coarseness of the industrial classification used (hundreds of different industry classifications versus thousands), intra-industry trade accounts for one-quarter to nearly one-half of all world trade flows. Intra-industry trade plays an even more prominent role in the trade of manufactured goods among advanced industrial nations, which accounts for the majority of world trade.  

Table 8-2 shows measures of the importance of intra-industry trade for a number of U.S. manufacturing industries in 2009. The measure shown is intra-industry trade as a proportion of overall trade.10 The measure ranges from 0.97 for metalworking machinery and inorganic chemicals—industries where U.S. exports and imports are nearly equal—to 0.10 for footwear, an industry in which the United States has large imports but virtually no exports. The measure would be 0 for an industry in which the United States is only an exporter or only an importer, but not both; it would be 1 for an industry in which U.S. exports exactly equal U.S. imports.  

Table 8-2 shows that intra-industry trade is a very important component of trade for the United States in many different industries. Those industries tend to be ones that produce sophisticated manufactured goods, such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and specialized machinery. These goods are exported principally by advanced nations and are probably subject to important economies of scale in production. At the other end of the scale are the industries with very little intra-industry trade, which typically produce labor-intensive products such as footwear and apparel. These are goods that the United States imports primarily from less-developed countries, where comparative advantage is the primary determinant of U.S. trade with these countries.

What about the new types of welfare gains via increased product variety and economies of scale? A study by Christian Broda at Duquesne Capital Management and David Weinstein at Columbia University estimates that the number of available products in U.S. imports tripled in the 30-year time span from 1972 to 2001. They further estimate that this increased product variety for U.S. consumers represented a welfare gain equal to 2.6 percent of U.S. GDP!11  

Table 8-1 from our numerical example showed that the gains from integration generated by economies of scale were most pronounced for the smaller economy: Prior to integration, production there was particularly inefficient, as the economy could not take advantage of economies of scale in production due to the country’s small size. This is exactly what happened when the United States and Canada followed a path of increasing economic integration starting with the North American Auto Pact in 1964. That trade agreement was then broadened to include Mexico and most traded goods across North America (first as the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, which was recently renegotiated as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement, USMCA). The Case Study that follows describes how this integration led to consolidation and efficiency gains in the automobile sector—particularly on the Canadian side (whose economy is one-tenth the size of the U.S. economy).  

Similar gains from trade have also been measured for other real-world examples of closer economic integration. One of the most prominent examples has taken place in Europe over the last half-century. In 1957, the major countries of Western Europe established a free trade area in manufactured goods called the Common Market, or European Economic Community (EEC). (The United Kingdom entered the EEC later, in 1973.) The result was a rapid growth of trade that was dominated by intra-industry trade. Trade within the EEC grew twice as fast as world trade as a whole during the 1960s. This integration slowly expanded into what has become the European Union. When a subset of these countries (mostly, those countries that had formed the EEC) adopted the common euro currency in 1999, intra-industry trade among those countries further increased (even relative to that of the other countries in the European Union). Recent studies have also found that the adoption of the euro has led to a substantial increase in the number of different products that are traded within the Eurozone.  

# Automobile Intra-Industry Trade within ASEAN-4: 1998–2002  

ASEAN—the Association of Southeast Asian Nations was formed in 1967 in order to promote political, socioeconomic and cultural cooperation among its members. Over the last 50 years, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of intraindustry trade across the world. In this context, the growth in the automobile industry within the ASEAN-4—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and ­Thailand—between 1998 and 2002, is an example of the role of economies of scale in generating beneficial international trade.12 While the case does not fit our model exactly since it involves multinational firms, it does show that the basic concepts we have developed are useful in the real world.  

The automobile industry in ASEAN-4 was propelled by a series of deregulation and liberalization measures, including trade liberalization steps like AFTA (the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement in 1998), and it experienced significant growth. Since 2002, it has recovered its losses due to the 1997 Asian crisis, and has reached a level of production of 1.4 million automobiles. Within the ASEAN-4, Thailand had assumed a leading role as an export-hub, with other countries concentrating mostly on production of automobile parts. European countries were the main destination for the ASEAN-4 automotive exports, attracting 60 percent of total automotive exports; Australia was also becoming a major destination for the trade relations.  

In 2001, intra-ASEAN-4 exports in automobile parts accounted for about 14 percent of total exports, with the European Union (EU), Japan, and NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement among the United States, Canada, and ­Mexico) comprising other hefty export markets, with the regional markets acquiring rising importance over time. While lower in the ASEAN-4 when compared to other major trading blocs like the EU, NAFTA, and MERCOSUR, intra-industry trade in automobile parts seemed to be on the rise in all these regions.  

Automobile intra-industry trade reflects the standard dichotomy between quality differentiation (vertical differentiation) and attribute differentiation (horizontal differentiation). For the ASEAN-4 countries, there seemed to be significant differences relating to the importance of this vertical and horizontal differentiation. While the share of horizontal differentiation in automobile parts exhibited a low and constant amount, vertical differentiation rose by a robust 50 percent and placed the ASEAN-4, with a share of 63.5 percent, at the top of the list of major trading blocks in terms of vertical differentiation. With the constant share of horizontal differentiation, the rapid rise in vertical differentiation took place at the expense of mainly one-way trade. In terms of comparison, the total share of intra-industry trade was still below those observed in other major trading blocks.  

There are interesting findings when one looks into intra-industry trends among the ASEAN-4 countries, Again, horizontal intra-industry trade remained relatively stable; however, vertical intra-industry trade exhibited remarkable growth, increasing overall shares of intra-industry trade for all the ASEAN-4 members, except the Philippines, to 70 percent by 2002. The most important automobile components traded among the ASEAN-4 countries were engines and engine parts, and transmissions and machinery, ranging from 21 percent to 36 percent (interestingly, the generic component “other auto parts” that makes up half of all trade in automobile components is all accounted by intra-industry trade). Of course, trade characteristics for the various automobile components are not uniform, for example, one-way trade is dominant for transmissions and machinery, while intra-industry trade dominates trade in engines and engine parts. Trade differences also existed among countries; for example, Indonesia’s main export was electric parts, which accounted mostly for one-way trade, while Malaysia’s main exports were transmission and machinery, which accounted primarily for intra-industry trade.  

It is not surprising that economies of scale explain a good part of intra-industry trade in automobiles and automobile components for the ASEAN-4 countries. For example, the total market size, the declining differences in market sizes, and the size of the automobile industry itself all contributed positively to the overall automobile intra-industry growth. For the ASEAN-4 countries, deeper economic integration was not a determinant of intra-industry growth; this may be due to the fact that the period under consideration did not include important trade liberalization measures that took effect after 2002. This made market and industry size characteristics (economies of scale) the major determinants of automobile intra industry growth rather than regional ones during the 1998–2002 period.  

# Firm Responses to Trade: Winners, Losers, and Industry Performance  

In our numerical example of the auto industry with two countries, we saw how economic integration led to an increase in competition between firms. Of the 14 firms producing autos before trade (6 in Home and 8 in Foreign), only 10 firms “survive” after economic integration; however, each of those firms now produces at a bigger scale (250,000 autos produced per firm versus either 150,000 for Home firms or 200,000 for Foreign firms before trade). In that example, the firms were assumed to be symmetric, so exactly which firms exited and which survived and expanded was inconsequential. In the real world, however, performance varies widely across firms, so the effects of increased competition from trade are far from inconsequential. As one would expect, increased competition tends to hurt the worst-performing firms the hardest because they are the ones who are forced to exit. If the increased competition comes from trade (or economic integration), then it is also associated with sales opportunities in new markets for the surviving firms. Again, as one would expect, it is the best-performing firms that take greatest advantage of those new sales opportunities and expand the most.  

These composition changes have a crucial consequence at the level of the industry: When the better-performing firms expand and the worse-performing ones contract or exit, then overall industry performance improves. This means that trade and economic integration can have a direct impact on industry performance: It is as if there were technological growth at the level of the industry. Empirically, these composition changes generate substantial improvements in industry productivity.  

Take the example of Canada’s closer economic integration with the United States (see the preceding Case Study and the discussion in Chapter 2). We discussed how this integration led the automobile producers to consolidate production in a smaller number of Canadian plants, whose production levels rose dramatically. The Canada– U.S. Free Trade Agreement, which went into effect in 1989, extended the auto pact to most manufacturing sectors. A similar process of consolidation occurred throughout the affected Canadian manufacturing sectors. However, this was also associated with a selection process: The worst-performing producers shut down while the betterperforming ones expanded via large increases in exports to the U.S. market. Daniel Trefler at the University of Toronto has studied the effects of this trade agreement in great detail, examining the varied responses of Canadian firms.13 He found that productivity in the most affected Canadian industries rose by a dramatic 14 to 15 percent (replicated economy-wide, a 1 percent increase in productivity translates into a 1 percent increase in GDP, holding employment constant). On its own, the contraction and exit of the worst-performing firms in response to increased competition from U.S. firms accounted for half of the 15 percent increase in those sectors.  

# Performance Differences across Producers  

We now relax the symmetry assumption we imposed in our previous development of the monopolistic competition model so that we can examine how competition from increased market size affects firms differently.14 The symmetry assumption meant that all firms had the same cost curve (8-3) and the same demand curve (8-5). Suppose now that firms have different cost curves because they produce with different marginal cost levels $c_{i}.$ . We assume all firms still face the same demand curve. Product-quality differences between firms would lead to very similar predictions for firm performance as the ones we now derive for cost differences.  

Figure 8-6 illustrates the performance differences between firms 1 and 2 when $c_{1}<c_{2}$ . In panel (a), we have drawn the common demand curve (8-5) as well as its associated marginal revenue curve (8-8). Note that both curves have the same intercept on the vertical axis [plug $Q=0$ into (8-8) to obtain $M R=P]$ ; this intercept is given by the price $P$ from (8-5) when $Q=0$ , which is the slope of the demand curve $1/(S\times b)$ . As we previously discussed, the marginal revenue curve is steeper than the demand curve. Firms 1 and 2 choose output levels $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ , respectively, to maximize their profits. This occurs where their respective marginal cost curves intersect the common marginal revenue curve. They set prices $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ that correspond to those output levels on the common demand curve. We immediately see that firm 1 will set a lower price and produce a higher output level than firm 2. Since the marginal revenue curve is steeper than the demand curve, we also see that firm 1 will set a higher markup over marginal cost than firm 2: $P_{1}-c_{1}>P_{2}-c_{2}$ .  

The shaded areas represent operating profits for both firms, equal to revenue $P_{i}\times Q_{i}$ minus operating costs $c_{i}\times Q_{i}$ (for both firms, $i=1$ and $i=2$ ). Here, we have assumed the fixed cost $F$ (assumed to be the same for all firms) cannot be recovered and does (a) Demand and cost curves for firms 1 and 2. Firm 1 has a lower marginal cost than firm $2\colon c_{1}<c_{2}$ . Both firms face the same demand curve and marginal revenue curve. Relative to firm 2, firm 1 sets a lower price and produces more output. The shaded areas represent operating profits for both firms (before the fixed cost is deducted). Firm 1 earns higher operating profits than firm 2. (b) Operating profits as a function of a firm’s marginal cost $C_{j}.$ . Operating profits decrease as the marginal cost increases. Any firm with marginal cost above $c^{*}$ cannot operate profitably and shuts down.

FIGURE 8-6 Performance Differences across Firms  

not enter into operating profits (that is, it is a sunk cost). Since operating profits can be rewritten as the product of the markup times the number of output units sold, $(P_{i}-c_{i})\times Q_{i},$ , we can determine that firm 1 will earn higher profits than firm 2 (recall that firm 1 sets a higher markup and produces more output than firm 2). We can thus summarize all the relevant performance differences based on marginal cost differences across firms. Compared to a firm with a higher marginal cost, a firm with a lower marginal cost will (1) set a lower price but at a higher markup over marginal cost; (2) produce more output; and (3) earn higher profits.15  

Panel (b) in Figure 8-6 shows how a firm’s operating profits vary with its marginal cost $c_{i}.$ . As we just mentioned, this will be a decreasing function of marginal cost. Going back to panel (a), we see that a firm can earn a positive operating profit so long as its marginal cost is below the intercept of the demand curve on the vertical axis at $\overline{{P}}+[1/(b\times n)]$ . Let $c^{*}$ denote this cost cutoff. A firm with a marginal cost $c_{i}$ above this cutoff is effectively “priced out” of the market and would earn negative operating profits if it were to produce any output. Such a firm would choose to shut down and not produce (incurring an overall profit loss equal to the fixed cost $F$ ). Why would such a firm enter in the first place? Clearly, it wouldn’t if it knew about its high cost $c_{i}$ prior to entering and paying the fixed cost $F$ .  

We assume that entrants face some randomness about their future production cost $c_{i}.$ . This randomness disappears only after $F$ is paid and is sunk. Thus, some firms will regret their entry decision if their overall profit (operating profit minus the fixed cost $F$ ) is negative. On the other hand, some firms will discover that their production cost $c_{i}$ is very low and that they earn high positive overall profit levels. Entry is driven by a similar process as the one we described for the case of symmetric firms. In that previous case, firms entered until profits for all firms were driven to zero. Here, there are profit differences between firms, and entry occurs until expected profits across all potential cost levels $c_{i}$ are driven to zero.  

# The Effects of Increased Market Size  

Panel (b) of Figure 8-6 summarizes the industry equilibrium given a market size $S$ . It tells us which firms survive and produce (with cost $c_{i}$ below $c^{*}$ ) and how their profits will vary with their cost levels $c_{i}$ . What happens when economies integrate into a single larger market? As was the case with symmetric firms, a larger market can support a larger number of firms than can a smaller market. This leads to more competition in addition to the direct effect of increased market size $S_{\mathbf{\alpha}}$ . As we will see, these changes will have very different repercussions on firms with different production costs.  

Figure 8-7 summarizes those repercussions induced by market integration. In panel (a), we start with the demand curve $D$ faced by each firm. All else equal, we expect increased competition to shift demand in for each firm. On the other hand, we also expect a bigger market size $S$ , on its own, to move demand out. This intuition is correct and leads to the overall change in demand from $D$ to $D^{\prime}$ shown in panel (a). Notice how the demand curve rotates, inducing an inward shift for the smaller firms (with lower output quantities) as well as an outward shift for the larger firms. In essence, the effects of increased competition dominate for those smaller firms whereas the effects of increased market size are dominant for the larger firms.  

We can also analytically characterize the effects of increased competition and market size on the demand curve $D$ . Recall that the vertical intercept of this demand curve is $\overline{{P}}+[1/(b\times n)]$ , while its slope is $1/(S\times b)$ . Increased competition (a higher number of firms $n$ ) holding market size $S$ constant lowers the vertical intercept for demand, leaving its slope unchanged: This is the induced inward shift from more competition.16 The direct effect of increased market size $S$ flattens the demand curve (lower slope), leaving the intercept unchanged: This generates an outward rotation of demand. Combining these two effects, we obtain the new demand curve $D^{\prime}$ , which has a lower vertical intercept and is flatter than the original demand curve $D$ .  

Panel (b) of Figure 8-7 shows the consequences of this demand change for the operating profits of firms with different cost levels $c_{i}.$ . The decrease in demand for the smaller firms translates into a new, lower-cost cutoff, $c^{*\prime}$ : Some firms with the high cost levels above $c^{*\prime}$ cannot survive the decrease in demand and are forced to exit. On the other hand, the flatter demand curve is advantageous to some firms with low cost levels: They can adapt to the increased competition by lowering their markup (and hence their price) and gain some additional market share.17 This translates into increased profits for some of the best-performing firms with the lowest cost levels $c_{i}$ 18 .

FIGURE 8-7 Winners and Losers from Economic Integration  

(a) The demand curve for all firms changes from $D$ to $D^{\prime}$ . It is flatter, and has a lower vertical intercept. (b) Effects of the shift in demand on the operating profits of firms with different marginal cost $C_{j}$ . Firms with marginal cost between the old cutoff, $c^{*},$ , and the new one, $c^{*\prime}$ , are forced to exit. Some firms with the lowest marginal cost levels gain from integration and their profits increase.  

Figure 8-7 illustrates how increased market size generates both winners and losers among firms in an industry. The low-cost firms thrive and increase their profits and market shares, while the high-cost firms contract and the highest-cost firms exit. These composition changes imply that overall productivity in the industry is increasing as production is concentrated among the more productive (low-cost) firms. This replicates the findings for Canadian manufacturing following closer integration with U.S. manufacturing, as we previously described. These effects tend to be most pronounced for smaller countries that integrate with larger ones, but it is not limited to those small countries. Even for a big economy such as the United States, increased integration via lower trade costs leads to important composition effects and productivity gains.19  

# Trade Costs and Export Decisions  

Up to now, we have modeled economic integration as an increase in market size. This implicitly assumes that this integration occurs to such an extent that a single combined market is formed. In reality, integration rarely goes that far: Trade costs among countries are reduced, but they do not disappear. In Chapter 2, we discussed how these trade costs are manifested even for the case of the two very closely integrated economies of the United States and Canada. We saw how the U.S.–Canada border substantially decreases trade volumes between Canadian provinces and U.S. states.  

Trade costs associated with this border crossing are also a salient feature of firmlevel trade patterns: Very few firms in the United States reach Canadian customers. In fact, most U.S. firms do not report any exporting activity at all (because they sell only to U.S. customers). In 2007, only 4 percent of the 5.5 million firms operating in the United States reported any export sales. Firms in the manufacturing sector are substantially more likely to export (trade costs are relatively lower than in the agricultural, mining, and service sectors). Yet, even within this sector most predisposed to exporting, only 35 percent of manufacturing firms export. Table 8-3 shows the breakdown of this percentage by specific industries within the manufacturing sector. We see that there is some substantial variation in the proportion of exporting firms across industries. This variation is related to the comparative advantage of the U.S. industries (as we described in detail in Chapter 5): U.S. exports are concentrated in relatively capital-intensive and skill-intensive industries, and firms in those industries are substantially more likely to export. However, even in the most export-oriented industries, a substantial proportion of firms report no exporting activity (they only sell to U.S. consumers). This highlights one major reason why trade costs associated with national borders reduce trade so much: Those costs drastically cut down the number of firms willing or able to reach customers across the border. (The other reason is that the trade costs also reduce the export sales of firms that do reach those customers across the border.)  

In our integrated economy without any trade costs, firms were indifferent as to the location of their customers. We now introduce trade costs to explain why firms actually do care about the location of their customers and why so many firms choose not to reach customers in another country. As we will see shortly, this will also allow us to explain important differences between those firms that choose to incur the trade costs and export, and those that do not. Why would some firms choose not to export? Simply put, the trade costs reduce the profitability of exporting for all firms. For some, that reduction in profitability makes exporting unprofitable. We now formalize this argument.  

To keep things simple, we will consider the response of firms in a world with two identical countries (Home and Foreign). Let the market size parameter $S$ now reflect the size of each market, so that $2\times S$ now reflects the size of the world market. We cannot analyze this world market as a single market of size $2\times S$ because this market is no longer perfectly integrated due to trade costs.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE 8-3</td><td>Proportion of U.S. Firms Reporting Export Sales by Industry, 2007</td></tr><tr><td>Printing Furniture WoodProducts Apparel Fabricated Metals</td><td>15% 16% 21% 22% 30%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Transportation Equipment 57% Machinery 61% Chemicals 65% Electrical Equipment and Appliances 70% Computer and Electronics 75%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Specifically, assume that a firm must incur an additional cost $t$ for each unit of output that it sells to customers across the border. We now have to keep track of the firm’s behavior in each market separately. Due to the trade cost $t$ , firms will set different prices in their export market relative to their domestic market. This will lead to different quantities sold in each market and ultimately to different profit levels earned in each market. As each firm’s marginal cost is constant (does not vary with production levels), those decisions regarding pricing and quantity sold in each market can be separated: A decision regarding the domestic market will have no impact on the profitability of different decisions for the export market.  

Consider the case of firms located in Home. Their situation regarding their domestic (Home) market is exactly as was illustrated in Figure 8-6, except that all the outcomes, such as price, output, and profit, relate to the domestic market only.20 Now consider the decisions of firms 1 and 2 (with marginal costs $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ ) regarding the export (Foreign) market. They face the same demand curve in Foreign as they do in Home (recall that we assumed the two countries are identical). The only difference is that the firms’ marginal cost in the export market is shifted up by the trade cost t. Figure 8-8 shows the situation for the two firms in both markets.  

What are the effects of the trade cost on the firms’ decisions regarding the export market? We know from our previous analysis that a higher marginal cost induces a firm to raise its price, which leads to a lower output quantity sold and lower profits. We also know that if marginal cost is raised above the threshold level $c^{*}$ , then a firm cannot profitably operate in that market. This is what happens to firm 2 in Figure 8-8. Firm 2 can profitably operate in its domestic market because its cost there is below the threshold: $c_{2}\leq c^{*}$ . However, it cannot profitably operate in the export market because its cost there is above the threshold: $c_{2}+t>c^{*}$ . Firm 1, on the other hand, has a low enough cost that it can profitably operate in both the domestic and the export markets: $c_{1}+t\leq c^{*}$ . We can extend this prediction to all firms based on their marginal cost $c_{i}.$ . The lowest-cost firms with $c_{i}\leq c^{*}-t$ export; the higher-cost firms with $c^{*}$ $-\ t<c_{i}\leq c^{*}$ still produce for their domestic market but do not export; the highestcost firms with $c_{i}>c^{*}$ cannot profitably operate in either market and thus exit.  

We just saw how the modeling of trade costs added two important predictions to our model of monopolistic competition and trade: Those costs explain why only a subset of firms export, and they also explain why this subset of firms will consist of relatively larger and more productive firms (those firms with lower marginal cost). Empirical analyses of firms’ export decisions from numerous countries have provided overwhelming support for this prediction that exporting firms are bigger and more productive than firms in the same industry that do not export. In the United States in a typical manufacturing industry, an exporting firm is on average more than twice as large as a firm that does not export. The average exporting firm also produces 21 percent more value added (output minus intermediate inputs) per worker than the average nonexporting firm. Similar differences across exporters and non-exporters are also observed in European countries.21

# Export Decisions with Trade Costs  

(a) Firms 1 and 2 both operate in their domestic (Home) market. (b) Only firm 1 chooses to export to the Foreign market. It is not profitable for firm 2 to export given the trade cost t.  

# Dumping  

Adding trade costs to our model of monopolistic competition also added another dimension of realism: Because markets are no longer perfectly integrated through costless trade, firms can choose to set different prices in different markets. The trade costs also affect how a firm responds to competition in a market. Recall that a firm with a higher marginal cost will choose to set a lower markup over marginal cost (this firm faces more intense competition due to its lower market share). This means that an exporting firm will respond to the trade cost by lowering its markup for the export market.  

Consider the case of firm 1 in Figure 8-8. It faces a higher marginal cost $c_{1}+t$ in the Foreign export market. Let $P_{1}^{D}$ and $\bar{P}_{1}^{X}$ denote the prices that firm 1 sets on its domestic (Home) market and export (Foreign) market, respectively. Firm 1 sets a lower markup $P_{1}^{X}-\left(c_{1}+t\right)$ on the export market relative to its markup $P_{1}^{D}-c_{1}$ on the domestic market. This in turn implies that $P_{1}^{X}-t<P_{1}^{D}$ and that firm 1 sets an export price (net of trade costs) lower than its domestic price.  

That is considered dumping by firm 1 and is regarded by most countries as an “unfair” trade practice. Any firm from Foreign can appeal to its local authorities (in the United States, the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission are the relevant authorities) and seek punitive damages against firm 1. This usually takes the form of an antidumping duty imposed on firm 1 and would usually be scaled to the price difference between P1D and P1X - t.22  

Dumping is a controversial issue in trade policy (see the case study below). For now, we just note that firm 1 is not behaving any differently than the foreign firms it is competing against in the Foreign market. In that market, firm 1 sets exactly the same markup over marginal cost as Foreign firm 2 with marginal cost $c_{2}=c_{1}+t.$ . Firm 2’s pricing behavior is perfectly legal, so why is firm 1’s export pricing decision considered to represent an “unfair” trade practice? This is one major reason why economists believe that the enforcement of dumping claims is misguided (see the Case Study for a further discussion) and that there is no good economic justification for dumping to be considered particularly harmful.  

Our model of monopolistic competition highlighted how trade costs have a natural tendency to induce firms to lower their markups in export markets, where they face more intense competition due to their reduced market share. This makes it relatively easy for domestic firms to file a dumping complaint against exporters in their markets. In practice, those antidumping laws can then be used to erect barriers to trade by discriminating against exporters in a market.  

# Antidumping as Protectionism  

Economists have never been very happy with the idea of singling out dumping as a prohibited practice. For one thing, setting different prices for different customers is a perfectly legitimate business strategy—like the discounts that airlines offer to students, senior citizens, and travelers who are willing to stay over a weekend, all falling under the rubric of “price discrimination.” Also, the legal definition of dumping deviates substantially from the economic definition. Since it is often difficult to prove that foreign firms charge higher prices to domestic than to export customers, affected nations instead often try to calculate a supposedly fair price based on estimates of foreign production costs. This “fair price” rule can interfere with perfectly normal business practices: A firm may well be willing to sell a product for a loss while it is lowering its costs through experience or breaking into a new market. Even absent such dynamic considerations, our model highlighted how monopolistically competitive firms have an incentive to lower their markups in export markets due to competition effects associated with trade costs.  

Most countries have in place a regulatory framework dealing with dumping complaints. In the United States, this involves the Commerce Department and eventually the International Trade Commission. In the European Union, dumping falls under the jurisdiction of the European Commission and the Directorate General Trade and various Committees. In India, dumping falls under the purview of the Customs and Tariffs Acts and the Anti-Dumping Rules. Opinions differ as to whether dumping constitutes “fair” competition and within the framework of WTO rules, many governments around the world are allowed by WTO rules to take action against dumping (despite being allowed as a practice, “condemned but not prohibited”), by following a specific set of procedures whereby “material injury” needs to be established and sets forth three methods by which a good’s “normal” value is calculated.  

In spite of almost universally negative assessments from economists, however, formal complaints about dumping have been filed with growing frequency since about 1970. In the early 1990s, the bulk of anti-dumping complaints were directed at developed countries. But since 1995, developing countries have accounted for the majority of anti-dumping complaints. And among those countries, China has attracted a particularly large number of complaints.  

There are two main reasons behind this trend. First and foremost has been China’s massive export growth. No firm enjoys facing stiff increases in competition, and anti-dumping laws allow firms to insulate themselves from this competition by raising their competitors’ costs. Second, proving unfair pricing by a Chinese firm is relatively easier than for exporters from other countries. Most developed countries (including the United States) facing this surge in Chinese exports have labeled China a “nonmarket” economy. A BusinessWeek story describes the difference that this description makes when a U.S. firm files an antidumping complaint against a Chinese exporter:  

That means the United States can simply ignore Chinese data on costs on the assumption they are distorted by subsidized loans, rigged markets, and the controlled yuan. Instead, the government uses data from other developing nations regarded as market economies. In the TV and furniture cases, the United States used India—even though it is not a big exporter of these goods. Since India’s production costs were higher, China was ruled guilty of dumping.23  

As the quote suggests, China has been subject to antidumping duties on TVs and furniture, along with a number of other products including crepe paper, hand trucks, shrimp, ironing tables, plastic shopping bags, iron pipe fittings, saccharin, solar panels, and most recently tires and cold-rolled steel. These duties are high. As high as 78 percent on color TVs, 266 percent for cold-rolled steel, and 330 percent on saccharin.  

# Multinationals and Foreign Direct Investment  

When is a corporation multinational? In U.S. statistics, a U.S. company is considered foreign-controlled, and therefore a subsidiary of a foreign-based multinational, if 10 percent or more of its stock is held by a foreign company; the idea is that 10 percent is enough to convey effective control. Similarly, a U.S.-based company is considered multinational if it owns more than 10 percent of a foreign firm. The controlling (owning) firm is called the multinational parent, while the “controlled” firms are called the multinational affiliates.  

When a U.S. firm buys more than 10 percent of a foreign firm, or when a U.S. firm builds a new production facility abroad, that investment is considered a U.S. outflow of foreign direct investment (FDI). The latter is called greenfield FDI, while the former is called brownfield FDI (or cross-border mergers and acquisitions). Conversely, investments by foreign firms in production facilities in the United States are considered U.S. FDI inflows. We describe the worldwide patterns of FDI flows in the following section.  

For now, we focus on the decision of a firm to become a multinational parent. Why would a firm choose to operate an affiliate in a foreign location?  

The answer depends, in part, on the production activities that the affiliate carries out. These activities fall into two main categories: (1) The affiliate replicates the production process (that the parent firm undertakes in its domestic facilities) elsewhere in the world; and (2) the production chain is broken up, and parts of the production processes are transferred to the affiliate location. Investing in affiliates that do the first type of activities is categorized as horizontal FDI. Investing in affiliates that do the second type of activities is categorized as vertical FDI.24  

Vertical FDI is mainly driven by production cost differences between countries (for those parts of the production process that can be performed in another location). What drives those cost differences between countries? This is just the outcome of the theory of comparative advantage that we developed in Chapters 3 through 7. For example, Intel (the world’s largest computer chip manufacturer) has broken up the production of chips into wafer fabrication, assembly, and testing. Wafer fabrication and the associated research and development are very skill-intensive, so Intel still performs most of those activities in the United States as well as in Ireland and Israel (where skilled labor is still relatively abundant).25 On the other hand, chip assembly and testing are laborintensive, and Intel has moved those production processes to countries where labor is relatively abundant, such as Malaysia, the Philippines, Costa Rica, and China. This type of vertical FDI is one of the fastest-growing types of FDI and is behind the large increase in FDI inflows to developing countries (see Figure 8-9).  

When a multinational engages in vertical FDI, it will then ship intermediate goods across its network of domestic and foreign affiliates. The resulting trade is classified as intra-firm trade. It represents roughly one-third of worldwide trade and over 40 percent of U.S. trade.  

In contrast to vertical FDI, horizontal FDI is dominated by flows between developed countries; that is, both the multinational parent and the affiliates are located in developed countries. The main reason for this type of FDI is to locate production near a firm’s large customer bases. Hence, trade and transport costs play a much more important role than production cost differences for these FDI decisions. Consider the example of Toyota, which is the world’s largest motor vehicle producer (at least, at the time of writing, though Volkswagen is a close second). At the start of the 1980s, Toyota produced almost all of its cars and trucks in Japan and exported them throughout the world, but mostly to North America and Europe. High trade costs to those markets (in large part due to trade restrictions; see Chapter 9) and rising demand levels there induced Toyota to slowly expand its production overseas. By 2009, Toyota produced over half of its vehicles in assembly plants abroad. Toyota has replicated the production process for its most popular car model, the Corolla, in assembly plants in Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Pakistan, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and Venezuela: This is horizontal FDI in action.

# Inflows of Foreign Direct Investment, 1970–2019 (Percent of World GDP)  

Worldwide flows of FDI have significantly increased since the mid-1990s, though the rates of increase have been very uneven. Historically, most of the inflows of FDI have gone to the developed countries in the OECD. However, the proportion of FDI inflows going to developing and transition economies has steadily increased over time and accounted for roughly half of worldwide FDI flows since 2009.

# Patterns of Foreign Direct Investment Flows around the World  

Figure 8-9 shows how the magnitude of worldwide FDI flows has evolved over the last 50 years. We first examine patterns for the world, where FDI flows must be balanced: Hence world inflows are equal to world outflows. We see that there was a massive increase in multinational activity in the mid- to late-1990s, when worldwide FDI flows more than quadrupled relative to world GDP. We also see that the growth rate of FDI is very uneven, with huge peaks and troughs. Those peaks and troughs correlate with the gyrations of stock markets worldwide (strongly dominated by fluctuations in the U.S. stock market) and the related waves of cross-border mergers and acquisitions (greenfield FDI is much more stable over time). The financial collapse in 2000 (the bursting of the dot-com bubble) and the most recent financial crisis in 2007–2009 also induced huge crashes in worldwide FDI flows. Fluctuations in FDI flows are also strongly influenced by changes in corporate tax policy. The U.S. “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” enacted in 2017 strongly cut the corporate tax rate for U.S. multinationals. In response, those multinationals repatriated a substantial proportion of their foreign earnings, which led to a sharp reduction in the value of their foreign investments and a drop in the value of world FDI.  

Looking at the distribution of FDI inflows across groups of countries, we see that historically, the richest OECD countries have been the biggest recipients of inward FDI. However, we also see that those inflows are much more volatile (this is where the FDI related to mergers and acquisitions is concentrated) than the FDI going to the remaining countries with lower incomes. Finally, we also see that there has been a steady expansion in the share of FDI that flows to those countries outside the OECD. This accounted for roughly half of worldwide FDI flows since 2009. The BRICS countries (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa) have accounted for a substantial portion of this increase: FDI flows to those countries have tripled in the past two decades.  

Figure 8-10 shows the list of the top 25 countries whose firms engage in FDI outflows. Because those flows are very volatile, they have been averaged over the past three years (2017–2019). We see that FDI outflows are still dominated by the developed economies; but we also see that big developing countries, most notably China (including Hong Kong), are playing an increasingly important role. In fact, one of the fastestgrowing FDI segments is flows from developing countries into other developing countries. Multinationals in both China and India play a prominent role in this relatively new type of FDI. We also see that international tax policies can shape the location of FDI. For example, the British Virgin Islands would not figure in that top 25 list were it not for its status as an international tax haven.26 Firms from that location that engage in FDI are mainly offshore companies: They are incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but their productive activities are located elsewhere in the world.  

FDI flows are not the only way to measure the presence of multinationals in the world economy. Other measures are based on economic activities such as sales, value

added (sales minus purchased intermediate goods), and employment. Sales of FDI affiliates are often used as the benchmark of multinational activity. This provides the relevant benchmark when comparing the activities of multinationals to export volumes. However, the sales of multinationals are also often compared to country GDPs showing, for example, that the big multinationals have higher sales volumes than the GDPs of many countries in the world. For the world as a whole in 2015, the total sales of the largest 100 multinationals amounted to 10.7 percent of world GDP.  

However striking, this comparison is misleading and overstates the influence of multinationals because country GDP is measured in terms of value added: Intermediate goods used in final production are not double-counted in this GDP measure. On the other hand, the intermediate goods that one multinational sells to another are double-counted in the multinationals’ sales totals (once in the sales of the producer of the intermediate goods and another time as part of the final value of the goods sold by the user of the intermediate goods). As a result, the appropriate comparison between multinationals and GDPs should be based on value added. (See the box on “Whose Trade Is It?” in the next section for a further discussion of this important measurement issue.) Since value added by multinationals is roughly 20 percent of their total sales, using this metric reduces the contribution of the largest 100 multinationals to around 2 percent of world GDP. This percentage is still nonnegligible, but not as eye-catching as the measure based on total sales.  

# COVID-19 and Foreign Direct Investment Flows around the World  

Figure 8-11 shows how the magnitude of worldwide FDI flows has evolved over the last 30 years. We first examine patterns for the world, where FDI flows must be balanced: Hence world inflows are equal to world outflows. We see that there was a massive increase in multinational activity in the mid- to late-1990s, when worldwide FDI flows more than quintupled and then again in the early 2000s. We also see that the growth rate of FDI is very uneven, with huge peaks and troughs. Significant world financial and currency events during this period, not all of which having affected adversely FDI flows, include the asset price bubble in Japan (1986–2003), the ERM crisis of the early 1990s (that led to the Black Wednesday of 16th September, 1992, when the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the ERM), the early 1990s world recession, the savings and loan crisis of the 1990s in the United States, the Finnish and ­Swedish banking crises of the 1990s, the 1994 speculative peso crisis in Mexico, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the economic crisis in Argentina (1998–2002), the dot-com crisis and the late 2000s world financial crisis. Among the above, the early 1990s ERM crisis and the worldwide recession, the Argentinian crisis and the financial collapse in 2000 (the burst of the dotcom bubble) and the most recent financial crisis in 2007–2009 seem to have induced slowdowns or huge crashes in worldwide FDI flows.  Global FDI flows rose modestly in 2019 at $\$1.54$ trillion, following the sizable decline registered in 2017 and again in 2018, when they plummeted to below-average levels.

Looking at the distribution of FDI inflows across groups of countries, historically the richest OECD countries have been the biggest recipients of inward FDI 1 $\$800$ billion in 2019, mostly toward the United States, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), but those inflows are much more volatile than those flowing into countries with lower incomes. For developing economies, FDI remains the largest external source of finance $\$685$ billion in 2019). It makes up around 39 percent of total incoming finance in all developing economies considered as a group (made up of countries mostly from Asia and Latin America.  

Figure 8-12 shows the list of the top 20 countries whose firms participate in FDI outflows. While FDI outflows are still dominated by the developed economies, big developing countries, most notably China (including Hong Kong), are playing an increasingly important role. Flows among developing countries is emerging as one of the fastest growing elements of FDI. Multinational firms in both China and India play a prominent role in this.  

Other measures of the presence of multinational firms in the world economy are based on economic activities such as sales, value added (sales minus purchased intermediate goods), and employment.  

As of June 2020, the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have an immediate impact on FDI amount: the physical closure of places of business to contain the spread of the virus causes immediate delays in the implementation of investment projects. Progress on several greenfield projects and many mergers and acquisitions is also temporarily suspended.

In the long term, the pandemic is likely to force multinational firms into finding supply chain resilience. It could also lead to a policy push for more domestic self-sufficiency in essential items, which may include industrial capacity in general. Tighter restrictions on international trade and investment have already emerged as a result of the pandemic. The trend toward rationalization of international operations, reshoring, nearshoring, and regionalization is likely to accelerate, leading to downward pressure on FDI.  

Consequently, developing economies are expected to see a further decrease in FDI in the range of 30 percent to 45 percent. Unlike with the global financial crisis, developing economies appear more vulnerable to this crisis since their production and investments are less diversified and therefore more exposed to systemic risks.

# Foreign Direct Investment and Foreign Sourcing Decisions  

We now apply the model we developed to analyze the firms’ export decisions to additional decisions regarding their operations in a global marketplace. Firms may choose to invest in foreign production sites located closer to their foreign customers; in other words to engage in horizontal FDI. On the purchasing side, firms may choose to source some of their intermediate inputs in Foreign locations. This is vertical FDI whenever the firms take an ownership stake in their foreign suppliers. (We discuss later the additional firm decision to integrate with its suppliers.)  

# The Horizontal FDI Decision  

As we previously mentioned, firms have an incentive to locate a production facility near their foreign customers in order to avoid the high trade costs associated with exports to that foreign destination. On the other hand, there are also increasing returns to scale in production. As a result, it is not cost effective to replicate the production process too many times and operate facilities that produce too little output to take advantage of those increasing returns. This is called the proximity-concentration trade-off for FDI. Empirical evidence on the extent of FDI across sectors strongly confirms the relevance of this trade-off: FDI activity is concentrated in sectors where trade costs are high (such as the automobile industry); however, when increasing returns to scale are important and average plant sizes are large, one observes higher export volumes relative to FDI. Empirical evidence also shows that there is an even stronger sorting pattern for FDI at the firm level within industries: Multinationals tend to be substantially larger and more productive than non-multinationals in the same country. Even when one compares multinationals to the subset of exporting firms in a country, one still finds a large size and productivity differential in favor of the multinationals.  

Our theoretical model of firm export decisions captured in Figure 8-8 can also be used to explain those different responses to the proximity-concentration trade-off across firms. There, if a firm wants to reach customers in Foreign, it has only one possibility: Export and incur the trade cost $t$ per unit exported. Let’s now introduce the choice of becoming a multinational via horizontal FDI: A firm could avoid the trade cost $t$ by building a production facility in Foreign. Of course, building this production facility is costly and implies incurring the fixed cost $F$ again for the foreign affiliate. (Note, however, that this additional fixed cost need not equal the fixed cost of building the firm’s original production facility in Home; characteristics specific to the individual country will affect this cost.) For simplicity, continue to assume that Home and Foreign are similar countries so that this firm could build a unit of a good at the same marginal cost in this foreign facility. (Recall that horizontal FDI mostly involves developed countries with similar factor prices.)  

The firm’s export versus FDI choice will then involve a trade-off between the perunit export cost $t$ and the fixed cost $F$ of setting up an additional production facility. Any such trade-off between a per-unit and a fixed cost boils down to scale. If the firm sells $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ units in the foreign market, then it incurs a total trade-related cost $Q\times t$ to export; this is weighed against the alternative of the fixed cost $F_{\mathrm{\bullet}}$ . If $Q>F/t$ , then exporting is more expensive, and FDI is the profit-maximizing choice.  

This leads to a scale cutoff for FDI. This cutoff summarizes the proximityconcentration trade-off: Higher trade costs on one hand and lower fixed production costs on the other hand both lower the FDI cutoff. The firm’s scale, however, depends on its performance measure. A firm with low enough cost $c_{i}$ will want to sell more than $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ units to foreign customers. The most cost-effective way to do this is to build an affiliate in Foreign and become a multinational. Some firms with intermediate cost levels will still want to serve customers in Foreign, but their intended sales $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ are low enough that exports, rather than FDI, will be the most cost-effective way to reach those customers.  

# The Foreign Sourcing Decision  

A firm’s decision to break up its production chain and move parts of that chain to a foreign supplier will also involve a trade-off between per-unit and fixed costs—so the scale of the firm’s activity will again be a crucial element determining this outcome. When it comes to foreign sourcing, the key cost saving is not related to the shipment of goods across borders; rather, it involves production cost differences for the parts of the production chain that are being moved. As we previously discussed, those cost differences stem mostly from comparative advantage forces.  

We will not discuss those cost differences further here, but rather ask why—given those cost differences—all firms do not choose to operate affiliates in low-wage countries to perform the activities that are most labor-intensive and can be performed in a different location. The reason is that, as with the case of horizontal FDI, foreign sourcing requires a substantial fixed cost investment in a relationship with a foreign supplier in a country with the appropriate characteristics.27 Again, as with the case of horizontal FDI, there will be a scale cutoff for foreign sourcing that depends on the production cost differentials on one hand, and the fixed cost of coordinating with a foreign supplier on the other hand.28 Only those firms operating at a scale above that cutoff will choose to source from a foreign supplier.  

This sorting scheme for firms to import intermediate goods is similar to the one we described for the firm’s export and horizontal FDI choice: Only a subset of relatively more productive (lower-cost) firms will choose to foreign-source and import some intermediate goods.  

And again, there is overwhelming empirical support for this prediction regarding foreign sourcing: Manufacturing firms that import intermediate goods are substantially bigger and more productive than firms in the same industries that do not import. In the United States in a typical manufacturing industry, an importing firm is two and a half times larger than a firm that does not import. And the average importing firm is also 25 percent more productive—as measured by valued-added per worker. These so-called performance premia associated with foreign sourcing are even larger than the ones we previously mentioned associated with exporting. And as would be expected, there is a huge overlap between those sets of firms that foreign source and export—because both of those activities involve a trade-off in favor of a larger scale. And amongst this selected subset of firms, the largest and most productive are overwhelmingly multinationals. For the world as a whole, multinationals are responsible for 80 percent of all trade flows.  

# The Outsourcing Decision: Make or Buy  

Our discussion of multinationals up to this point has neglected an important motive. We discussed the location motive for production facilities that leads to multinational formation. However, we did not discuss why the parent firm chooses to own the affiliate in that location and operate as a single multinational firm. This is known as the internalization motive.  

As a substitute for horizontal FDI, a parent could license an independent firm to produce and sell its products in a foreign location; as a substitute for vertical FDI, a parent could contract with an independent firm (supplier) to perform specific parts of the production process in the foreign location with the best cost advantage.  

What are the key elements that determine this make-or-buy internalization choice? Control over a firm’s proprietary technology offers one clear advantage for internalization. Licensing another firm to perform the entire production process in another location (as a substitute for horizontal FDI) often involves a substantial risk of losing some proprietary technology. On the other hand, there are no clear reasons why an independent firm should be able to replicate that production process at a lower cost than the parent firm. This gives internalization a strong advantage; so horizontal FDI is widely favored over the alternative of technology licensing to replicate the production process.  

The trade-off between foreign sourcing and vertical FDI is much less clear-cut. There are many reasons why an independent firm could produce some parts of the production process at lower cost than the parent firm (in the same location). First and foremost, an independent firm can specialize in exactly that narrow part of the production process. As a result, it can also benefit from economies of scale if it performs those processes for many different parent firms.30 Other reasons stress the advantages of local ownership in the alignment and monitoring of managerial incentives at the production facility.  

But internalization also provides its own benefits when it comes to vertical integration between a firm and its supplier of a critical input to production: This avoids (or at least lessens) the potential for a costly renegotiation conflict after an initial agreement has been reached. Such conflicts can arise regarding many specific attributes of the input that cannot be specified in (or enforced by) a legal contract written at the time of the initial agreement. This can lead to a holdup of production by either party. For example, the buying firm can claim that the quality of the part is not exactly as specified and demand a lower price. The supplying firm can claim that some changes demanded by the buyer led to increased costs and demand a higher price at delivery time.  

Much progress has been made in recent research formalizing those trade-offs. This research explains how this important internalization choice is made, by describing when a firm chooses to integrate with its suppliers via vertical FDI and when it chooses an independent contractual relationship with those suppliers abroad.31 Developing those theories is beyond the scope of this text; ultimately, many of those theories also boil down to different trade-offs between production cost savings and the fixed cost of moving parts of the production process abroad.  

# WHOSE TRADE IS IT?  

the time of writing) iPhone 11 Pro Max from Apple, this transaction is recorded as a $\$490$ import from China (where the iPhone is assembled and tested). That is the total manufacturing cost of this unit. Of course, this consumer will pay much more than that for the phone (the unsubsidized price ranges between $\$1,100–81,450$ ). This difference is not a pure profit for Apple as it covers the cost of Apple’s U.S. workforce involved in the marketing, design, and engineering for the phone (Apple employs over 50,000 nonretail workers in addition to the 26,000 workers in their retail stores).32 Given the dozens of millions of iPhones bought by U.S. consumers, the $\$490$ per phone import price represents tens of billions of dollars’ worth of imports from China that contributes to the large trade deficit between the United States and China. This bilateral trade deficit (totaling $\$344$ billion in 2019) accounts for 56 percent of the overall U.S. trade deficit (in goods and services) with the rest of the world and is prominently featured in the press and by politicians (often as a sign of unfair trade practices).33  

However, the rise in intermediate good trade (see also the following Case Study) makes these aggregate statistics very misleading. Take the iPhone example. Less than $\$10$ of the $\$490$ total cost represents assembly and testing costs ­(performed in China). The remaining cost ­represents the iPhone’s component costs, which are overwhelmingly produced outside of China (the battery for the iPhone is now produced in China, but that adds just another $\$10$ of Chinese valued added). The manufacturing of these ­components is spread throughout Asia (Korea, Japan, and Taiwan are the largest suppliers), Europe, and the Americas. This last region includes 75 sites in the United States that ­contribute to the production of iPhone ­components and employ $257{,}000\ \mathrm{U}.\mathrm{S}$ . workers.34 For example, the glass screens are produced in ­Kentucky and the Face ID chips in Texas. And many of the component producers outside the United States employ U.S. researchers and engineers. For example, the  

![](images/e9606b467b79c3e93bb1a39ec32a8458f27291c0efefce90eacc0cd0ad3a2163.jpg)  

Korean company Samsung—one of the largest suppliers of iPhone components (by value)— operates research facilities in Texas and California that employ several thousand workers.  

Thus, the reported U.S. iPhone imports from China actually represent imports from many other countries—including the United States—that export iPhone components to China. This entails a decomposition of the $\$490$ gross import cost by value added based on location (the country where the value was added).35 Using this more accurate measure of trade at value added, only a tiny fraction of the $\$490$ import cost represents an import from China. The tens of billions worth of U.S. iPhone imports from China therefore grossly inflate the true value of the bilateral deficit between the two countries.  

A similar decomposition from gross value to value added can be performed for all U.S. trade (exports and imports) with all of its trading partners. These bilateral trade flows and trade deficits can then be converted from gross value (the way they are typically reported) to value added. This accounting change leaves the overall U.S. trade deficit (with the rest of the world) unchanged but can drastically affect the measures of the bilateral trade deficits across various trading partners. And the measure of bilateral trade deficit with China is the most profoundly affected: A recent paper calculates that the true bilateral deficit between the United States and China (at value added) is roughly half of the reported bilateral trade deficit based on gross value.36 Conversely, the trade deficits with Germany, Japan, and Korea are magnified when measured as value added because those countries manufacture many of the components that are assembled in China and then imported as final goods into the United States.  

In a world where production chains increasingly stretch around the world, measures of bilateral trade deficits based on standard trade flows (at gross value) are quickly losing their relevance.  

# CASE STUDY  

# Shipping Jobs Overseas? Offshoring and Labor Market Outcomes in Germany  

When a company offshores part of its production chain abroad, it is then importing an intermediate good or service. For example, a company may import a part, component, or even an entire assembled product; or it may import business services by using accountants and/or call centers located abroad. As we discuss in the next section, the overall effects of trade in such intermediates are very similar to the trade in final goods that we have focused on up to now. Yet, when it comes to the effects of offshoring on employment, there is one additional dimension: The lower price of the imported intermediates not only benefits a firm’s owners and their consumers, it also benefits the firm’s remaining workers—because the lower price induces firms to increase their purchases of intermediates, which improves the productivity of the remaining workers.37 This productivity effect also induces the offshoring firm to hire additional workers dedicated to the remaining parts of the production process.  

There exist numerous studies that examine the impact of offshore outsourcing on labor market outcomes. In many cases, the overall employment effect for the offshoring firm is either neutral or positive: Several studies of multinationals have found that when they expand their overseas employment, they concurrently also expand their domestic employment.38 At a macroeconomic level, studies have found evidence that in advanced economies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States), while total employment growth has by far surpassed a mostly stagnating employment picture in low-skilled intensive sectors, no apparent slowdown in aggregate employment has been observed since 1981 and that any possible initial losses in low-skilled occupations was offset by skill premium gains made by shifts toward high-skilled activities and by the creation of new jobs due to offshoring cost-saving effects.39 In other words, employment growth may be induced by higher productivity and competitiveness of firms.  

A recent study on the labor market effects of offshoring on the German economy offers interesting insights on how offshoring affects workers’ labor market transitions.40 The study is of particular interest as its results are based on individual, daily information on workers’ job histories and flows (“separations”) amongst various employment categories, that is, from employment to another job, to unemployment, and to dropping from the labor force (nonparticipation). The German economy is the largest in the European Union, with a vibrant export-sector leading to significant trade surpluses and with a growing offshoring share in recent years, mostly in manufacturing but also in the service sector as of late, affected by developments in information and communication technology.  

Results from a vast, micro data set (1991–2000) representing 2 percent of German employees are rather revealing: while offshoring seems to affect negatively worker flows from manufacturing employment to nonparticipation, overall job stability in the manufacturing industry is not affected either by “narrow” or “wider” measures of offshoring. For the service sector, overall job stability is actually strengthened by both offshoring measures. Therefore, economy-wide labor market effects of offshoring seem to be at worse neutral. At a disaggregated level, manufacturing medium-skilled workers seem to be the ones most prone to be driven to nonparticipation as a result of offshoring. In the service sector, those workers who benefit most from offshoring seem to be the high-skilled ones, whose job stability rises. In addition, offshoring effects also seem to be heterogeneous by age: in manufacturing, for example, offshoring seems to increase the unemployment risk for older workers but reduce it for middle-aged ones.  

Given all these facts on the impact of offshoring for employment, the view that offshoring simply amounts to “shipping jobs overseas” is misleading. True, when a firm based in Germany, Canada, or the United States moves a call center to India, or moves the assembly of its product to China, then some specific jobs that used to be performed in the United States are now performed in India or China. However, the evidence shows that in terms of overall employment, those jobs are replaced by other ones in the origin countries: some related to the expansion effect at the offshoring firms and others by firms providing intermediate goods and services to firms located abroad (in shoring). Yet, just as with other forms of trade, trade in intermediates has substantial consequences for the distribution of income. Those call center or manufacturing workers displaced by offshoring are often not the ones who are hired by the expanding firms. Their plight is not made any easier by the gains that accrue to other workers. We discuss these overall welfare consequences in the next section.  

# Consequences of Multinationals and Foreign Outsourcing  

Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned that internal economies of scale, product differentiation, and performance differences across firms combined to deliver some new channels for the gains from trade: Increased product variety and higher industry performance as firms move down their average cost curve and production is concentrated in the larger, more productive firms. What are the consequences for welfare of the expansion in multinational production and outsourcing?  

We just saw how multinationals and firms that outsource take advantage of cost differentials that favor moving production (or parts thereof) to particular locations. In essence, this is very similar to the relocation of production that occurred across sectors when opening to trade. As we saw in Chapters 3 through 6, the location of production then shifts to take advantage of cost differences generated by comparative advantage.  

We can therefore predict similar welfare consequences for the case of multinationals and outsourcing: Relocating production to take advantage of cost differences leads to overall gains from trade, but it is also likely to induce income distribution effects that leave some people worse off. We discussed one potential long-run consequence of outsourcing for income inequality in developed countries in Chapter 5.  

Yet some of the most visible effects of multinationals and offshoring more generally occur in the short run, as some firms expand employment while others reduce employment in response to increased globalization. In Chapter 4, we described the substantial costs associated with involuntary worker displacements linked to inter-industry trade (especially for lower-skilled workers). The costs associated with displacements linked to offshoring are just as severe for workers with similar characteristics. As we argued in Chapter 4, the best policy response to this serious concern is still to provide an adequate safety net to unemployed workers without discriminating based on the economic force that induced their involuntary unemployment. Policies that impede firms’ abilities to relocate production and take advantage of these cost differences may prevent these short-run costs for some, but they also forestall the accumulation of long-run economywide gains.  

■■ Trade need not be the result of comparative advantage. Instead, it can result from increasing returns or economies of scale, that is, from a tendency of unit costs to be lower with larger output. Economies of scale give countries an incentive to specialize and trade even in the absence of differences between countries in their resources or technology. Economies of scale can be internal (depending on the size of the firm) or external (depending on the size of the industry).  

■■ Economies of scale internal to firms lead to a breakdown of perfect competition; models of imperfect competition must be used instead to analyze the consequences of increasing returns at the level of the firm. An important model of this kind is the monopolistic competition model, which is widely used to analyze models of firms and trade.   
■■ In monopolistic competition, an industry contains a number of firms producing differentiated products. These firms act as individual monopolists, but additional firms enter a profitable industry until monopoly profits are competed away. Equilibrium is affected by the size of the market: A large market will support a larger number of firms, each producing at a larger scale and thus a lower average cost, than a small market.   
■■ International trade allows for the creation of an integrated market that is larger than any one country’s market. As a result, it is possible to simultaneously offer consumers a greater variety of products and lower prices. The type of trade generated by this model is intra-industry trade.   
■■ When firms differ in terms of their performance, economic integration generates winners and losers. The more productive (lower-cost) firms thrive and expand, while the less productive (higher-cost) firms contract. The least-productive firms are forced to exit.   
■■ In the presence of trade costs, markets are no longer perfectly integrated through trade. Firms can set different prices across markets. These prices reflect trade costs as well as the level of competition perceived by the firm. When there are trade costs, only a subset of more productive firms choose to export; the remaining firms serve only their domestic market.   
■■ Dumping occurs when a firm sets a lower price (net of trade costs) on exports than it charges domestically. A consequence of trade costs is that firms will feel competition more intensely on export markets because the firms have smaller market shares in those export markets. This leads firms to reduce markups for their export sales relative to their domestic sales; this behavior is characterized as dumping. Dumping is viewed as an unfair trade practice, but it arises naturally in a model of monopolistic competition and trade costs where firms from both countries behave in the same way. Policies against dumping are often used to discriminate against foreign firms in a market and erect barriers to trade.   
■■ Some multinationals replicate their production processes in foreign facilities located near large customer bases. This is categorized as horizontal foreign direct investment (FDI). An alternative is to export to a market instead of operating a foreign affiliate in that market. The trade-off between exports and FDI involves a lower per-unit cost for FDI (no trade cost) but an additional fixed cost associated with the foreign  

facility. Only firms that operate at a big enough scale will choose the FDI option over exports.  

Some multinationals break up their production chain and perform some parts of that chain in their foreign facilities. This is categorized as vertical foreign direct  

investment (FDI). One alternative is to outsource those parts of the production chain to an independent foreign firm. Both of those modes of operation are categorized as offshoring. Relative to the option of no offshoring, offshoring involves lower production costs but an additional fixed cost. Only firms that operate at a big enough scale will choose to offshore. ■■ Multinational firms and firms that outsource parts of production to foreign countries take advantage of cost differences across production locations. This is similar to models of comparative advantage where production at the level of the industry is determined by differences in relative costs across countries. The welfare consequences are similar as well: There are aggregate gains from increased multinational production and outsourcing, but also changes in the income distribution that leaves some people worse off.

1.	 In perfect competition, firms set price equal to marginal cost. Why can’t firms do this when there are internal economies of scale?   
2.	 Suppose the two countries we considered in the numerical example on pages 208–212 were to integrate their automobile market with a third country and a fourth country, which have an annual market for 2 million and 1 million automobiles, respectively. Find the number of firms, the output per firm, and the price per automobile in the new integrated market after trade.   
3.	 Suppose that fixed costs for a firm in the automobile industry (start-up costs of factories, capital equipment, and so on) are $\$7.5$ billion and that variable costs are equal to $\$20,000$ per finished automobile. Because more firms increase competition in the market, the market price falls as more firms enter an automobile market or specifically, $P=20,000+200>n$ , where $n$ represents the number of firms in a market. Assume that the initial size of the U.S. and the European automobile markets are 400 million and 650 million people, respectively. a.	 Calculate the equilibrium number of firms in the U.S. and European automobile markets without trade. b.	 What is the equilibrium price of automobiles in the United States and Europe if the automobile industry is closed to foreign trade?   
c.	 Now suppose the United States decides on free trade in automobiles with Europe. The trade agreement with the Europeans adds 533 million consumers to the automobile market, in addition to the 300 million in the United States. How many automobile firms will there be in the United States and Europe combined? What will be the new equilibrium price of automobiles?   
d.	 Why are prices in the United States different in (c) and (b)? Are consumers better off with free trade? In what ways?  

4.	 Go back to the model with firm performance differences in a single integrated market (pp. 214–216). Now assume a new technology becomes available. Any firm can adopt the new technology, but its use requires an additional fixed-cost investment. The benefit of the new technology is that it reduces a firm’s marginal cost of production by a given amount.  

a.	 Could it be profit maximizing for some firms to adopt the new technology but not profit maximizing for other firms to adopt that same technology? Which firms would choose to adopt the new technology? How would they be different from the firms that choose not to adopt it?   
b.	 Now assume there are also trade costs. In the new equilibrium with both trade costs and technology adoption, firms decide whether to export and also whether to adopt the new technology. Would exporting firms be more or less likely to adopt the new technology relative to nonexporters? Why?  

5.	 In the chapter, we described a situation where dumping occurs between two symmetric countries. Briefly describe how things would change if the two countries had different sizes.  

a.	 How would the number of firms competing in a particular market affect the likelihood that an exporter to that market would be accused of dumping? (Assume the likelihood of a dumping accusation is related to the firm’s price difference between its domestic price and its export price: the higher the price difference, the more likely the dumping accusation.)   
b.	 Would a firm from a small country be more or less likely to be accused of dumping when it exports to a large country (relative to a firm from the large country exporting to the small country)?  

6.	 Which of the following are foreign direct investments?  

a.	 A Chinese company pays $\$6.49$ million for a stake in the Hilton.   
b.	 A Russian businessman buys $\$44$ billion on FOREX.   
c.	 An American company buys another American company; stockholders in the bought U.S. company sell their shares on FOREX.   
d.	 A Turkish company builds a factory in Ethiopia and manages the factory as a contractor to the Turkish government.  

7.	 For each of the following, specify whether the foreign direct investment is horizontal or vertical; in addition, describe whether that investment represents an FDI inflow or outflow from the countries that are mentioned. a.	 Vodafone (a U.K.-based company) plans to improve its network and services in Romania after the results in this market lagged behind other countries. b.	 General Electric (an American company) buys Alstom (another American company) energy assets.  

c.	 Exxon (an American company) plans the construction of new delayed coker unit in Belgium.   
d.	 Petro China (a Chinese company) plans to invest in global oil and natural gas assets in a venture in Western Australia.   
8.	 If there are internal economies of scale, why would it ever make sense for a firm to produce the same good in more than one production facility?   
9.	 Most firms in the apparel and footwear industries choose to outsource production to countries where labor is abundant (primarily, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean)—but those firms do not integrate with their suppliers there. On the other hand, firms in many capital-intensive industries choose to integrate with their suppliers. What could be some differences between the labor-intensive apparel and footwear industries on the one hand and capital-intensive industries on the other hand that would explain these choices?   
10.	 Consider the example of industries in problem 9. What would those choices imply for the extent of intra-firm trade across industries? That is, in what industries would a greater proportion of trade occur within firms?

# APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 8  

# Determining Marginal Revenue  

In our exposition of monopoly and monopolistic competition, we found it useful to have an algebraic statement of the marginal revenue faced by a firm given the demand curve it faced. Specifically, we asserted that if a firm faces the demand curve  

$$
Q=A-B\times P,
$$  

its marginal revenue is  

$$
M R=P-(1/B)\times Q.
$$  

In this appendix, we demonstrate why this is true.  

Notice first that the demand curve can be rearranged to state the price as a function of the firm’s sales rather than the other way around. By rearranging (8A-1), we get  

$$
P=(A/B)-(1/B)\times Q.
$$  

The revenue of a firm is simply the price it receives per unit multiplied by the number of units it sells. Letting $R$ denote the firm’s revenue, we have  

$$
R=P\times Q=[(A/B)-(1/B)\times Q]\times Q.
$$  

Let us next ask how the revenue of a firm changes if it changes its sales. Suppose the firm decides to increase its sales by a small amount, $d X,$ , so that the new level of sales is $Q=Q+d Q$ . Then the firm’s revenue after the increase in sales, $R$ , will be  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{R^{\prime}=P^{\prime}\times Q^{\prime}=[(A/B)-(1/B)\times(Q+d Q)]\times(Q+d Q)}\\ &{=[(A/B)-(1/B)\times Q]\times Q+[(A/B)-(1/B)\times Q]\times d Q}\\ &{\qquad-(1/B)\times Q\times d Q-(1/B)\times(d Q)^{2}.}\end{array}
$$  

Equation (8A-5) can be simplified by substituting in from (8A-1) and (8A-4) to get  

$$
R^{\prime}=R+P\times d Q-(1/B)\times Q\times d Q-(1/B)\times(d Q)^{2}.
$$  

When the change in sales $d Q$ is small, however, its square $(d Q)^{2}$ is very small (e.g., the square of 1 is 1, but the square of $1/10$ is 1/100). So for a small change in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ , the last term in (8A-6) can be ignored. This gives us the result that the change in revenue from a small change in sales is  

$$
R^{\prime}=R=[P-(1/B)\times Q]\times d Q.
$$  

So the increase in revenue per unit of additional sales—which is the definition of marginal revenue—is  

$$
M R=(R^{\prime}-R)/d Q=P-(1/B)\times Q,
$$  

which is just what we asserted in equation (8A-2).
