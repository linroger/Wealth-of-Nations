# CHAPTER 5  

# Resources and Trade: The Heckscher-Ohlin Model  

f labor were the only factor of production, as the Ricardian model assumes, I comparative advantage could arise only because of international differences in labor productivity. In the real world, however, while trade is partly explained by differences in labor productivity, it also reflects differences in countries’ resources. Canada exports forest products to the United States not because its lumberjacks are more productive relative to their U.S. counterparts but because sparsely populated Canada has more forested land per capita than the United States. Thus, a realistic view of trade must allow for the importance not just of labor but also of other factors of production such as land, capital, and mineral resources.  

To explain the role of resource differences in trade, this chapter examines a model in which resource differences are the only source of trade. This model shows that comparative advantage is influenced by the interaction between nations’ resources (the relative abundance of factors of production, called factor abundance) and the technology of production (which influences the relative intensity with which different factors of production, called factor intensity, are used in the production of different goods). Some of these ideas were presented in the specific factors model of Chapter 4, but the model we study in this chapter puts the interaction between abundance and intensity in sharper relief by looking at long-run outcomes when all factors of production are mobile across sectors.  

That international trade is largely driven by differences in countries’ resources is one of the most influential theories in international economics. Developed by two Swedish economists, Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin (Ohlin received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1977), the theory is often referred to as the Heckscher-Ohlin theory. Because the theory emphasizes the interplay between the proportions in which different factors of production are available in different countries and the proportions in which they are used in producing different goods, it is also referred to as the factor-proportions theory.  

To develop the factor-proportions theory, we begin by describing an economy that does not trade and then ask what happens when two such economies trade with each other. We will see that as opposed to the Ricardian model with a single factor of production, trade can affect the distribution of income across factors, even in the long run. We discuss the extent to which trade may be contributing to increases in wage inequality in developed countries. We then conclude with a further review of the empirical evidence for (and against) the predictions of the factor-proportions theory of trade.  

# LEARNING GOALS  

After reading this chapter, you will be able to:  

■ Explain how differences in resources generate a specific pattern of trade.   
■ Discuss why the gains from trade will not be equally spread even in the long run and identify the likely winners and losers. Understand the possible links between increased trade and rising wage inequality in the developed world. See how empirical patterns of trade and factor prices support some (but not all) of the predictions of the factor-proportions theory.  

# Model of a Two-Factor Economy  

In this chapter, we’ll focus on the simplest version of the factor-proportions model, sometimes referred to as “2 by 2 by $2^{\circ}$ : two countries, two goods, two factors of production. In our example, we’ll call the two countries Home and Foreign. We will stick with the same two goods, cloth (measured in yards) and food (measured in calories), that we used in the specific factors model of Chapter 4. The key difference is that in this chapter, we assume that the immobile factors that were specific to each sector (capital in cloth, land in food) are now mobile in the long run. Thus, land used for farming can be used to build a textile plant; conversely, the capital used to pay for a power loom can be used to pay for a tractor. To keep things simple, we model a single additional factor that we call capital, which is used in conjunction with labor to produce either cloth or food. In the long run, both capital and labor can move across sectors, thus equalizing their returns (rental rate and wage) in both sectors.  

# Prices and Production  

Both cloth and food are produced using capital and labor. The amount of each good produced, given how much capital and labor are employed in each sector, is determined by a production function for each good:  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{Q_{C}=Q_{C}(K_{C},L_{C}),\ }\\ {Q_{F}=Q_{F}(K_{F},L_{F}),\ }\end{array}
$$  

where $Q_{C}$ and $Q_{F}$ are the output levels of cloth and food, $K_{C}$ and $L_{C}$ are the amounts of capital and labor employed in cloth production, and $K_{F}$ and $L_{F}$ are the amounts of capital and labor employed in food production. Overall, the economy has a fixed supply of capital $K$ and labor $L$ that is divided between employment in the two sectors.  

We define the following expressions that are related to the two production technologies:  

$a_{K C}=$ capital used to produce one yard of cloth $a_{L C}={}$ labor used to produce one yard of cloth $a_{K F}={}$ capital used to produce one calorie of food $a_{L F}={}$ labor used to produce one calorie of food  

These unit input requirements are very similar to the ones defined in the Ricardian model (for labor only). However, there is one crucial difference: In these definitions, we speak of the quantity of capital or labor used to produce a given amount of cloth or food rather than the quantity required to produce that amount. The reason for this change from the Ricardian model is that when there are two factors of production, there may be some room for choice in the use of inputs.  

In general, those choices will depend on the factor prices for labor and capital. However, let’s first look at a special case in which there is only one way to produce each good. Consider the following numerical example: Production of one yard of cloth requires a combination of two work-hours and two machine-hours. The production of food is more automated; as a result, production of one calorie of food requires only one work-hour along with three machine-hours. Thus, all the unit input requirements are fixed at $a_{K C}=2$ ; $a_{L C}=2$ ; $a_{K F}=3$ ; $a_{L F}=1$ ; and there is no possibility of substituting labor for capital or vice versa. Assume that an economy is endowed with 3,000 units of machine-hours along with 2,000 units of work-hours. In this special case of no factor substitution in production, the economy’s production possibility frontier can be derived using those two resource constraints for capital and labor. Production of $Q_{C}$ yards of cloth requires $2Q_{C}=a_{K C}\times Q_{C}$ machine-hours and $2Q_{C}=a_{L C}\times Q_{C}$ work-hours. Similarly, production of $Q_{F}$ calories of food requires $3Q_{F}=a_{K F}\times Q_{F}$ machine-hours and $1Q_{F}=a_{L F}\times Q_{F}$ work-hours. The total machine-hours used for both cloth and food production cannot exceed the total supply of capital:  

$$
a_{K C}\times Q_{C}+a_{K F}\times Q_{F}\leq K\mathrm{or}2Q_{C}+3Q_{F}\leq3,000.
$$  

This is the resource constraint for capital. Similarly, the resource constraint for labor states that the total work-hours used in production cannot exceed the total supply of labor:  

$$
a_{L C}\times Q_{C}+a_{L F}\times Q_{F}\leq L\mathrm{or}2Q_{C}+Q_{F}\leq2,000.
$$  

Figure 5-1 shows the implications of (5-1) and (5-2) for the production possibilities in our numerical example. Each resource constraint is drawn in the same way we drew the production possibility line for the Ricardian case in Figure 3-1. In this case, however, the economy must produce subject to both constraints, so the production possibility frontier is the solid line. If the economy specializes in food production (point 1), then it can produce 1,000 calories of food. At that production point, there is spare labor capacity: Only 1,000 work-hours out of 2,000 are employed. Conversely, if the economy specializes in cloth production (point 2), then it can produce 1,000 yards of cloth. At that production point, there is spare capital capacity: Only 2,000 machine-hours out of 3,000 are employed. At production point 3, the economy is employing all of its labor and capital resources (1,500 machine-hours and 1,500 work-hours in cloth production, and 1,500 machine-hours along with 500 work-hours in food production).1  

The important feature of this production possibility frontier is that the opportunity cost of producing an extra yard of cloth in terms of food is not constant. When the economy is producing mostly food (to the left of point 3), then there is spare labor capacity. Producing two fewer units of food releases six machine-hours that can be

FIGURE 5-1  

# The Production Possibility Frontier without Factor Substitution: Numerical Example  

If capital cannot be substituted for labor or vice versa, the production possibility frontier in the factor-proportions model would be defined by two resource constraints: The economy can’t use more than the available supply of labor (2,000 work-hours) or capital (3,000 machine-hours). So the production possibility frontier is defined by the solid line in this figure. At point 1, the economy specializes in food production, and not all available workhours are employed. At point 2, the economy specializes in cloth, and not all available machine-hours are employed. At production point 3, the economy employs all of its labor and capital resources. The important feature of the production possibility frontier is that the opportunity cost of cloth in terms of food isn’t constant: It rises from ${}^{2}/{}_{3}$ to 2 when the economy’s mix of production shifts toward cloth.  

used to produce three yards of cloth: The opportunity cost of cloth is ${}^{2}/{}_{3}$ . When the economy is producing mostly cloth (to the right of point 3), then there is spare capital capacity. Producing two fewer units of food releases two work-hours that can be used to produce one yard of cloth: The opportunity cost of cloth is 2. Thus, the opportunity cost of cloth is higher when more units of cloth are being produced.  

Now let’s make the model more realistic and allow the possibility of substituting capital for labor and vice versa in production. This substitution removes the kink in the production possibility frontier; instead, the frontier $P P$ has the bowed shape shown in Figure 5-2. The bowed shape tells us that the opportunity cost in terms of food of producing one more unit of cloth rises as the economy produces more cloth and less food. That is, our basic insight about how opportunity costs change with the mix of production remains valid.  

Where on the production possibility frontier does the economy produce? It depends on prices. Specifically, the economy produces at the point that maximizes the value  

Quantity of food,

FIGURE 5-2  

# The Production Possibility Frontier with Factor Substitution  

If capital can be substituted for labor and vice versa, the production ­possibility frontier no longer has a kink. But it remains true that the ­opportunity cost of cloth in terms of food rises as the economy’s production mix shifts toward cloth and away from food.  

of production. Figure 5-3 shows what this implies. The value of the economy’s ­production is  

$$
V=P_{C}\times Q_{C}+P_{F}\times Q_{F},
$$  

where $P_{C}$ and $P_{F}$ are the prices of cloth and food, respectively. An isovalue line—a line along which the value of output is constant—has a slope of $-P_{C}/P_{F}$ . The economy produces at the point $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ , the point on the production possibility frontier that touches the highest possible isovalue line. At that point, the slope of the production possibility frontier is equal to $-P_{C}/P_{F}.$ . So the opportunity cost in terms of food of producing another unit of cloth is equal to the relative price of cloth.  

# Choosing the Mix of Inputs  

As we have noted, in a two-factor model producers may have room for choice in the use of inputs. A farmer, for example, can choose between using relatively more mechanized equipment (capital) and fewer workers, or vice versa. Thus, the farmer can choose how much labor and capital to use per unit of output produced. In each sector, then, producers will face not fixed input requirements (as in the Ricardian model) but trade-offs like the one illustrated by curve $\boldsymbol{{\mathit{I I}}}$ in Figure 5-4, which shows alternative input combinations that can be used to produce one calorie of food.  

What input choice will producers actually make? It depends on the relative costs of capital and labor. If capital rental rates are high and wages low, farmers will choose to produce using relatively little capital and a lot of labor; on the other hand, if the

FIGURE 5-3 Prices and Production  

The economy produces at the point that maximizes the value of production given the prices it faces; this is the point on the highest possible isovalue line. At that point, the opportunity cost of cloth in terms of food is equal to the ­relative price of cloth, $P_{C}/P_{F}$ .  

# FIGURE 5-4 Input Possibilities in Food Production  

A farmer can produce a calorie of food with less capital if he or she uses more labor, and vice versa.

# FIGURE 5-5  

# Factor Prices and Input Choices  

In each sector, the ratio of labor to capital used in production depends on the cost of labor relative to the cost of capital, $w/r$ . The curve $F F$ shows the labor-capital ratio choices in food production, while the curve CC shows the corresponding choices in cloth production. At any given wagerental ratio, cloth production uses a higher laborcapital ratio; when this is the case, we say that cloth production is labor-intensive and that food production is capital-intensive.  

![](dcc3fa5c58c6373de309cb18ccd2fbc79349bf4fe519b5532bcd162491e970b2.jpg)  

rental rates are low and wages high, they will save on labor and use a lot more capital. If $w$ is the wage rate and $r$ the rental cost of capital, then the input choice will depend on the ratio of these two factor prices, $w/r$ .2 The relationship between factor prices and the ratio of labor to capital use in production of food is shown in Figure 5-5 as the curve $F F$ .  

There is a corresponding relationship between $w/r$ and the labor-capital ratio in cloth production. This relationship is shown in Figure 5-5 as the curve CC. As drawn, $C C$ is shifted out relative to $F F_{\ast}$ , indicating that at any given factor prices, production of cloth will always use more labor relative to capital than will production of food. When this is true, we say that production of cloth is labor-intensive, while production of food is capital-intensive. Notice that the definition of intensity depends on the ratio of labor to capital used in production, not the ratio of labor or capital to output. Thus a good cannot be both capital- and labor-intensive.  

The $C C$ and $F F$ curves in Figure 5-5 are called relative factor demand curves; they are very similar to the relative demand curve for goods. Their downward slope characterizes the substitution effect in the producers’ factor demand. As the wage $w$ rises relative to the rental rate $r$ , producers substitute capital for labor in their production decisions. The previous case we considered with no factor substitution is a limiting case, where the relative demand curve is a vertical line: The ratio of labor to capital demanded is fixed and does not vary with changes in the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ . In the remainder of this chapter, we consider the more general case with factor substitution, where the relative factor demand curves are downward sloping.  

# Factor Prices and Goods Prices  

Suppose for a moment the economy produces both cloth and food. (This need not be the case if the economy engages in international trade because it might specialize completely in producing one good or the other, but let us temporarily ignore this possibility.) Then competition among producers in each sector will ensure that the price of each good equals its cost of production. The cost of producing a good depends on factor prices: If wages rise—other things equal—the price of any good whose production uses labor will also rise.  

The importance of a particular factor’s price to the cost of producing a good depends, however, on how much of that factor the good’s production involves. If food production makes use of very little labor, for example, then a rise in the wage will not have much effect on the price of food, whereas if cloth production uses a great deal of labor, a rise in the wage will have a large effect on the price. We can therefore conclude that there is a one-to-one relationship between the ratio of the wage rate to the rental rate, $(w/r)$ , and the ratio of the price of cloth to that of food, ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}.$ . This relationship is illustrated by the upward-sloping curve SS in Figure 5-6.3  

Let’s look at Figures 5-5 and 5-6 together. In Figure 5-7, the left panel is Figure 5-6 (of the SS curve) turned counterclockwise 90 degrees, while the right panel reproduces Figure 5-5. By putting these two diagrams together, we see what may seem at first to be a surprising linkage of the prices of goods to the ratio of labor to capital used in the production of each good. Suppose the relative price of cloth is $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{1}$ (left panel of Figure 5-7); if the economy produces both goods, the ratio of the wage rate to the capital rental rate must equal $(w/r)^{1}$ . This ratio then implies that the ratios of labor to capital employed in the production of cloth and food must be $(L_{C}/K_{C})^{1}$ and $(L_{F}/K_{F})^{1}$ , respectively (right panel of Figure 5-7). If the relative price of cloth were to rise to the level indicated by $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{2}$ , the ratio of the wage rate to the capital rental rate would rise to $(w/r)^{2}$ . Because labor is now relatively more expensive, the ratios of labor to  

# FIGURE 5-6  

# Factor Prices and Goods Prices  

Because cloth production is labor-intensive while food production is capital-intensive, there is a oneto-one relationship between the factor price ratio $w/r$ and the relative price of cloth $P_{C}/P_{F};$ the higher the relative cost of labor, the higher must be the relative price of the labor-intensive good. The relationship is illustrated by the curve $S S$ .  

![](5f127a0c7ce295a6cadb302aa4462d4d44268e824d031654610d93261791def0.jpg)

FIGURE 5-7  

# From Goods Prices to Input Choices  

Given the relative price of cloth $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{1}$ , the ratio of the wage rate to the capital rental rate must equal $(w/r)^{1}$ . This wage-rental ratio then implies that the ratios of labor to capital employed in the production of cloth and food must be $(L_{C}/K_{C})^{1}$ and $(L_{F}/K_{F})^{1}$ . If the relative price of cloth rises to $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{2},$ , the wage-rental ratio must rise to $(w/r)^{2}$ . This will cause the labor-capital ratio used in the production of both goods to drop.  

capital employed in the production of cloth and food would therefore drop to $(L_{C}/K_{C})^{2}$ and $(L_{F}/\bar{K}_{F})^{2}$ .  

We can learn one more important lesson from this diagram. The left panel already tells us that an increase in the price of cloth relative to that of food will raise the income of workers relative to that of capital owners. But it is possible to make a stronger statement: Such a change in relative prices will unambiguously raise the purchasing power of workers and lower the purchasing power of capital owners by raising real wages and lowering real rents in terms of both goods.  

How do we know this? When ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}$ increases, the ratio of labor to capital falls in both cloth and food production. But in a competitive economy, factors of production are paid their marginal product—the real wage of workers in terms of cloth is equal to the marginal productivity of labor in cloth production, and so on. When the ratio of labor to capital falls in producing either good, the marginal product of labor in terms of that good increases—so workers find their real wage higher in terms of both goods. On the other hand, the marginal product of capital falls in both industries, so capital owners find their real incomes lower in terms of both goods.  

In this model, then, as in the specific factors model, changes in relative prices have strong effects on income distribution. Not only does a change in the prices of goods change the distribution of income; it always changes it so much that owners of one factor of production gain while owners of the other are made worse off.4  

# Resources and Output  

We can now complete the description of a two-factor economy by describing the relationship between goods prices, factor supplies, and output. In particular, we investigate how changes in resources (the total supply of a factor) affect the allocation of factors across sectors and the associated changes in output produced.  

Suppose we take the relative price of cloth as given. We know from Figure 5-7 that a given relative price of cloth, say $({P_{C}}/{P_{F}})^{1}$ , is associated with a fixed wage-rental ratio $(\dot{w}/r)^{1}$ (so long as both cloth and food are produced). That ratio, in turn, determines the ratios of labor to capital employed in both the cloth and the food sectors: $(L_{C}/K_{C})^{1}$ and $(L_{F}/K_{F})^{1}$ , respectively. Now we assume that the economy’s labor force grows, which implies that the economy’s aggregate labor to capital ratio, $L/K$ , increases. At the given relative price of cloth $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{1}$ , we just saw that the ratios of labor to capital employed in both sectors remain constant. How can the economy accommodate the increase in the aggregate relative supply of labor $L/K$ if the relative labor demanded in each sector remains constant at $(L_{C}/K_{C})^{1}$ and $(L_{F}/K_{F})^{1}\}$ In other words, how does the economy employ the additional labor hours? The answer lies in the allocation of labor and capital across sectors: The labor-capital ratio in the cloth sector is higher than that in the food sector, so the economy can increase the employment of labor to capital (holding the labor-capital ratio fixed in each sector) by allocating more labor and capital to the ­production of cloth (which is labor-intensive).5 As labor and capital move from the food sector to the cloth sector, the economy produces more cloth and less food.  

The best way to think about this result is in terms of how resources affect the economy’s production possibilities. In Figure 5-8, the curve $T T^{1}$ represents the economy’s production possibilities before the increase in labor supply. Output is at point 1, where the slope of the production possibility frontier equals minus the relative price of cloth, $-P_{C}/P_{F},$ and the economy produces $Q_{C}^{1}$ and $\bar{Q_{F}^{1}}$ of cloth and food. The curve $T T^{2}$ shows the production possibility frontier after an increase in the labor supply. The production possibility frontier shifts out to $T T^{2}$ . After this increase, the economy can produce more of both cloth and food than before. The outward shift of the frontier is, however, much larger in the direction of cloth than of food—that is, there is a biased expansion of production possibilities, which occurs when the production possibility frontier shifts out much more in one direction than in the other. In this case, the expansion is so strongly biased toward cloth production that at unchanged relative prices, production moves from point 1 to point 2, which involves an actual fall in food output from $Q_{F}^{1}$ to $Q_{F}^{2}$ and a large increase in cloth output from $Q_{C}^{1}$ to $Q_{C}^{2}$ .  

The biased effect of increases in resources on production possibilities is the key to understanding how differences in resources give rise to international trade.6 An increase  

# FIGURE 5-8  

# Resources and Production Possibilities  

An increase in the supply of labor shifts the economy’s production ­possibility frontier outward from $T T^{1}$ to $T T^{2}$ but does so disproportionately in the direction of cloth production. The result is that at an unchanged relative price of cloth (indicated by the slope $-P_{C}/P_{F}),$ food production ­actually declines from $\boldsymbol{Q}_{F}^{1}$ to $\textstyle Q_{F}^{2}$ .  

![](480028fe5751bea4bd4910587ba5653f54cbdf4d476827595d87f40f5064e729.jpg)  

in the supply of labor expands production possibilities disproportionately in the direction of cloth production, while an increase in the supply of capital expands them disproportionately in the direction of food production. Thus, an economy with a high relative supply of labor to capital will be relatively better at producing cloth than an economy with a low relative supply of labor to capital. Generally, an economy will tend to be relatively effective at producing goods that are intensive in the factors with which the country is relatively well endowed.  

We will further see later some empirical evidence confirming that changes in a ­country’s resources lead to growth that is biased toward the sectors that intensively use the factor whose supply has increased. We document this for the Chinese economy, which has recently experienced substantial growth in its supply of skilled labor.  

# Effects of International Trade between Two-Factor Economies  

Having outlined the production structure of a two-factor economy, we can now look at what happens when two such economies, Home and Foreign, trade. As always, Home and Foreign are similar along many dimensions. They have the same tastes and therefore have identical relative demands for food and cloth when faced with the same relative prices of the two goods. They also have the same technology: A given amount of labor and capital yields the same output of either cloth or food in the two countries. The only difference between the countries is in their resources: Home has a higher ratio of labor to capital than Foreign does.  

# Relative Prices and the Pattern of Trade  

Since Home has a higher ratio of labor to capital than Foreign, Home is labor-abundant and Foreign is capital-abundant. Note that abundance is defined in terms of a ratio and not in absolute quantities. For example, the total number of workers in the United States is roughly three times higher than that in Mexico, but Mexico would still be considered labor-abundant relative to the United States since the U.S. capital stock is more than three times higher than the capital stock in Mexico. “Abundance” is always defined in relative terms, by comparing the ratio of labor to capital in the two countries; thus no country is abundant in everything.  

Since cloth is the labor-intensive good, Home’s production possibility frontier relative to Foreign’s is shifted out more in the direction of cloth than in the direction of food. Thus, other things equal, Home tends to produce a higher ratio of cloth to food.  

Because trade leads to a convergence of relative prices, one of the other things that will be equal is the price of cloth relative to that of food. Because the countries differ in their factor abundances, however, for any given ratio of the price of cloth to that of food, Home will produce a higher ratio of cloth to food than Foreign will: Home will have a larger relative supply of cloth. Home’s relative supply curve, then, lies to the right of Foreign’s.  

The relative supply schedules of Home (RS) and Foreign $(R S^{*})$ are illustrated in Figure 5-9. The relative demand curve, which we have assumed to be the same for both countries, is shown as $R D$ . If there were no international trade, the equilibrium for Home would be at point 1, and the relative price of cloth would be $(P_{C}/{P_{F}})^{1}$ . The equilibrium for Foreign would be at point 3, with a relative price of cloth given by $(\bar{P}_{C}/P_{F})^{3}$ . Thus, in the absence of trade, the relative price of cloth would be lower in Home than in Foreign.  

When Home and Foreign trade with each other, their relative prices converge. The relative price of cloth rises in Home and declines in Foreign, and a new world relative price of cloth is established at a point somewhere between the pretrade relative prices,  

# FIGURE 5-9  

# Trade Leads to a Convergence of ­Relative Prices  

In the absence of trade, Home’s equilibrium would be at point 1, where domestic ­relative supply RS intersects the relative demand curve $R D$ . Similarly, Foreign’s equilibrium would be at point 3. Trade leads to a world relative price that lies between the pretrade prices $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{1}$ and $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{3},$ such as $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{2}$ at point 2.  

![](028fb44a65c0b848dc144bb60dba5e39a90aeae95d70d453a5ba9199374cdb04.jpg)  

say at $(P_{C}/P_{F})^{2}$ . In Chapter 4, we discussed how an economy responds to trade based on the direction of the change in the relative price of the goods: The economy exports the good whose relative price increases. Thus, Home will export cloth (the relative price of cloth rises in Home), while Foreign will export food. (The relative price of cloth declines in Foreign, which means that the relative price of food rises there.)  

Home becomes an exporter of cloth because it is labor-abundant (relative to ­Foreign) and because the production of cloth is labor-intensive (relative to food production). Similarly, Foreign becomes an exporter of food because it is capital-abundant and because the production of food is capital-intensive. These predictions for the pattern of trade (in the two-good, two-factor, two-country version that we have studied) can be generalized as the following theorem, named after the original developers of this model of trade:  

Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem: The country that is abundant in a factor exports the good whose production is intensive in that factor.  

In the more realistic case with multiple countries, factors of production, and numbers of goods, we can generalize this result as a correlation between a country’s abundance in a factor and its exports of goods that use that factor intensively: Countries tend to export goods whose production is intensive in factors with which the countries are abundantly endowed.7  

# Trade and the Distribution of Income  

We have just discussed how trade induces a convergence of relative prices. Previously, we saw that changes in relative prices, in turn, have strong effects on the relative earnings of labor and capital. A rise in the price of cloth raises the purchasing power of labor in terms of both goods while lowering the purchasing power of capital in terms of both goods. A rise in the price of food has the reverse effect. Thus, international trade can have a powerful effect on the distribution of income, even in the long run. In Home, where the relative price of cloth rises, people who get their incomes from labor gain from trade, but those who derive their incomes from capital are made worse off. In Foreign, where the relative price of cloth falls, the opposite happens: Laborers are made worse off and capital owners are made better off.  

The resource of which a country has a relatively large supply (labor in Home, capital in Foreign) is the abundant factor in that country, and the resource of which it has a relatively small supply (capital in Home, labor in Foreign) is the scarce factor. The general conclusion about the income distribution effects of international trade in the long run is: Owners of a country’s abundant factors gain from trade, but owners of a country’s scarce factors lose.  

In our analysis of the specific factors case, we found that factors of production that are “stuck” in an import-competing industry lose from the opening of trade. Here, we find that factors of production that are used intensively by the import-competing industry are hurt by the opening of trade—regardless of the industry in which they are employed. Still, the theoretical argument regarding the aggregate gains from trade is identical to the specific factors case: Opening to trade expands an economy’s consumption possibilities (see Figure 4-11), so there is a way to make everybody better off. However, one crucial difference exists regarding the income distribution effects in these two models. The specificity of factors to particular industries is often only a temporary problem: Garment makers cannot become computer manufacturers overnight, but given time the U.S. economy can shift its manufacturing employment from declining sectors to expanding ones. Thus, income distribution effects that arise because labor and other factors of production are immobile represent a temporary, transitional problem (which is not to say that such effects are not painful to those who lose). In contrast, effects of trade on the distribution of income among land, labor, and capital are more or less permanent.  

Compared with the rest of the world, the United States is abundantly endowed with highly skilled labor while low-skilled labor is correspondingly scarce. This means that international trade has the potential to make low-skilled workers in the United States worse off—not just temporarily, but on a sustained basis. The negative effect of trade on low-skilled workers poses a persistent political problem, one that cannot be remedied by policies that provide temporary relief (such as unemployment insurance). Consequently, the potential effect of increased trade on income inequality in advanced economies such as the United States has been the subject of a large amount of empirical research. We review some of that evidence in the Case Study that follows, and conclude that trade has been, at most, a contributing factor to the measured increases in income inequality in the United States.  

# North-South Trade and Income Inequality  

The distribution of wages in the United States has become considerably more unequal since the 1970s. In 1970, a male worker with a wage at the 90th percentile of the wage distribution (earning more than the bottom 90 percent but less than the top 10 percent of wage earners) earned 3.2 times the wage of a male worker at the bottom 10th percentile of the distribution. By 2016, that worker at the 90th percentile earned more than 5.5 times the wage of the worker at the bottom 10th percentile. Wage inequality for female workers has increased at a similar rate over that same time span. Much of this increase in wage inequality was associated with a rise in the premium attached to education, especially since the 1980s. In 1980, a worker with a college degree earned 40 percent more than a worker with just a high school education. This education premium rose steadily through the 1980s and 1990s to 80 percent. Since then, it has been roughly flat (though wage disparities among college graduates continued rising).  

Why has wage inequality increased? Many observers attribute the change to the growth of world trade and in particular to the growing exports of manufactured goods from newly industrializing economies (NIEs) such as Mexico and China. Until the 1970s, trade between advanced industrial nations and less-developed economies—often referred to as “North-South” trade because most advanced nations are still in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere—consisted overwhelmingly of an exchange of Northern manufactures for Southern raw materials and agricultural goods, such as oil and coffee. From 1970 onward, however, former raw material exporters increasingly began to sell manufactured goods to high-wage countries like the United States. As we learned in ­Chapter 2, developing countries have dramatically changed the kinds of goods they export, moving away from their traditional reliance on agricultural and mineral products to a focus on manufactured goods. While NIEs also provided a rapidly growing ­market for exports from the high-wage nations, the exports of the newly industrializing economies obviously differed greatly in factor intensity from their imports. ­Overwhelmingly, NIE exports to advanced nations consisted of clothing, shoes, and other relatively unsophisticated products (“low-tech goods”) whose production is intensive in unskilled labor, while advanced-country exports to the NIEs consisted of capital- or skill-intensive goods such as chemicals and aircraft (“hightech goods”).  

To many observers, the conclusion seemed straightforward: What was happening was a move toward factor-price equalization. Trade between advanced countries that are abundant in capital and skill and NIEs with their abundant supply of unskilled labor was raising the wages of highly skilled workers and lowering the wages of less-skilled workers in the skill- and capital-abundant countries, just as the factor-proportions model predicts.  

This is an argument with much more than purely academic significance. If one regards the growing inequality of income in advanced nations as a serious problem, as many people do, and if one also believes that growing world trade is the main cause of that problem, it becomes difficult to maintain economists traditional support for free trade. (As we have previously argued, in principle, taxes and government payments can offset the effect of trade on income distribution, but one may argue that this is unlikely to happen in practice.) Some influential commentators have argued that advanced nations will have to restrict their trade with low-wage countries if they want to remain basically middle-class societies.  

While some economists believe that growing trade with low-wage countries has been the main cause of rising income inequality in the United States, most empirical researchers believed at the time of this writing that international trade has been at most a contributing factor to that growth and that the main causes lie elsewhere.8 This skepticism rests on three main observations.  

First, the factor-proportions model says that international trade affects income distribution via a change in relative prices of goods. So if international trade was the main driving force behind growing income inequality, there ought to be clear evidence of a rise in the prices of skill-intensive products compared with those of unskilled-labor-intensive goods. Studies of international price data, however, have failed to find clear evidence of such a change in relative prices.  

Second, the model predicts that relative factor prices should converge across countries: If wages of skilled workers are rising and those of unskilled workers are falling in the skill-abundant country, the reverse should be happening in the labor-abundant country. Studies of income distribution in developing countries that have opened themselves to trade have shown that at least in some cases, the reverse is true. In Mexico, in particular, careful studies have shown that the transformation of the country’s trade in the late 1980s—when Mexico opened itself to imports and became a major exporter of manufactured goods—was accompanied by rising wages for skilled workers and growing overall wage inequality, closely paralleling developments in the United States. More recently, China has gone through a similar transformation since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001; and there too, this transformation has been associated with rising wage inequality.  

Third, although trade between advanced countries and NIEs has grown rapidly, it still constitutes only a small percentage of total spending in the advanced nations. As a result, estimates of the “factor content” of this trade—the skilled labor exported, in effect, by advanced countries embodied in skill-intensive exports and the unskilled labor, in effect, imported in labor-intensive imports—are still only a small fraction of the total supplies of skilled and unskilled labor. This suggests that these trade flows couldn’t have had a very large impact on income distribution.  

What, then, is responsible for the growing gap between skilled and unskilled workers in the United States? The view of the majority is that the villain is not trade but rather new production technologies that put a greater emphasis on worker skills (such as the widespread introduction of computers and other advanced technologies in the workplace). This is often referred to as a technology-skill complementarity or skill-biased technological change.9  

We discuss the links between this type of technological change and rising wage inequality in the following section.  

# Skill-Biased Technological Change and Income Inequality  

We now extend our two-factor production model to incorporate technological change that is skill-biased. We discuss how this provides a much better fit for the empirical patterns associated with rising wage inequality in the United States. We also describe some new research that links back portions of this technological change to trade and outsourcing.  

Consider the variant of our two-good, two-factor model where skilled and unskilled labor are used to produce “high-tech” and “low-tech” goods. Figure 5-10 shows the relative factor demands for producers in both sectors: the ratio of skilled-unskilled workers employed as a function of the skilled-unskilled wage ratio ( $L L$ curve for lowtech and HH for high-tech).  

We have assumed that production of high-tech goods is skilled-labor intensive, so the HH curve is shifted out relative to the LL curve. In the background, an SS curve (see Figures 5-6 and 5-7) determines the skilled-unskilled wage ratio as an increasing function of the relative price of high-tech goods (with respect to low-tech goods).

FIGURE 5-10   
Increased Wage Inequality: Trade- or Skill-Biased Technological Change?  

The $L L$ and $\boldsymbol{H}\boldsymbol{H}$ curves show the skilled-unskilled employment ratio, $S/U,$ as a function of the skilledunskilled wage ratio, $w_{S}/w_{U},$ in the low-tech and high-tech sectors. The high-tech sector is more skillintensive than the low-tech sector, so the $\boldsymbol{H}\boldsymbol{H}$ curve is shifted out relative to the $L L$ curve. Panel (a) shows the case where increased trade with developing countries leads to a higher skilled-unskilled wage ratio. Producers in both sectors respond by decreasing their relative employment of skilled workers: $S_{L}/U_{L}$ and $S_{H}/U_{H}$ both decrease. Panel (b) shows the case where skill-biased technological change leads to a higher skilled-unskilled wage ratio. The $L L$ and $\boldsymbol{H}\boldsymbol{H}$ curves shift out (increased relative demand for skilled ­workers in both sectors). However, in this case producers in both sectors respond by increasing their relative employment of skilled workers: $S_{L}/U_{L}$ and $S_{H}/U_{H}$ both increase.  

In panel (a), we show the case where increased trade with developing countries generates an increase in wage inequality (the skilled-unskilled wage ratio) in those countries (via an increase in the relative price of high-tech goods). The increase in the relative cost of skilled workers induces producers in both sectors to reduce their employment of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers.  

In panel (b), we show the case where technological change in both sectors generates an increase in wage inequality. This technology change is classified as “skill-biased” because it shifts out the relative demand for skilled workers in both sectors (both the $L L$ and the $H H$ curves shift out). It also induces larger productivity gains in the hightech sector due to its complementarity with skilled workers. Thus, for any given relative price of high-tech goods, the technology change is associated with a higher skilledunskilled wage ratio (the SS curve shifts). Even though skilled labor is relatively more expensive, producers in both sectors respond to the technological change by increasing their employment of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers. [Note that the trade explanation in panel (a) predicts an opposite response for employment in both sectors.]  

We can now examine the relative merits of the trade versus skill-biased technological change explanations for the increase in wage inequality by looking at the changes in the skilled-unskilled employment ratio within sectors in the United States. A widespread increase in these employment ratios for all different kinds of sectors (both skilledlabor-intensive and unskilled-labor-intensive sectors) in the U.S. economy points to the skill-biased technological explanation. This is exactly what has been observed in the United States over the last half-century.  

In Figure 5-11, sectors are separated into four groups based on their skill intensity. U.S. firms do not report their employment in terms of skill but use a related categorization of production and non-production workers. With a few exceptions, non-production positions require higher levels of education—and so we measure the skilled-unskilled employment ratio in a sector as the ratio of non-production employment to production employment.10 Sectors with the highest non-production  

![](1275cde90650d1d60f6abee72643d70921282fb9e350cc6c0cdc1ef60965763f.jpg)

Sectors are grouped based on their skill intensity. The non-production–production employment ratio has increased over time in all four sector groups.

to production employment ratios are classified as most skill-intensive. Each quadrant of Figure 5-11 shows the evolution of this employment ratio over time for each group of sectors (the average employment ratio across all sectors in the group). Although there are big differences in average skill intensity across the groups, we clearly see that the employment ratios are increasing over time for all four groups. This widespread increase across most sectors of the U.S. economy is one of the main pieces of evidence pointing to the technology explanation for the increases in U.S. wage inequality.  

Yet, even though most economists agree that skill-biased technological change has occurred, recent research has uncovered some new ways in which trade has been an indirect contributor to the associated increases in wage inequality, by accelerating this process of technological change. These explanations are based on the principle that firms have a choice of production methods that is influenced by openness to trade and foreign investment. For example, some studies show that firms that begin to export also upgrade to more skill-intensive production technologies. On the import side, other studies have shown that competition from NIEs can also trigger innovations in more skill-intensive technologies (such as automation). Trade liberalization can then generate widespread technological change by inducing a large proportion of firms to make such technology-upgrade choices.  

Another example is related to foreign outsourcing and the liberalization of trade and foreign investment. In particular, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)  described in Chapter 2, recently renamed as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA), has made it substantially easier for firms to move different parts of their production processes (research and development, component production, assembly, marketing) across different locations in North America. Because production worker wages are substantially lower in Mexico, U.S. firms have an incentive to move the processes that use production workers more intensively to Mexico (such as component production and assembly). The processes that rely more intensively on higher-skilled, non-production workers (such as research and development and marketing) tend to stay in the United States (or Canada). From the U.S. perspective, this break-up of the production process increases the relative demand for skilled workers and is very similar to skill-biased technological change. One study finds that this outsourcing process from the United States to Mexico can explain 21 to 27 percent of the increase in the wage premium between non-production and production workers.11  

Thus, some of the observed skill-biased technological change, and its effect on increased wage inequality, can be traced back to increased openness to trade and foreign investment. And, as we have mentioned, increases in wage inequality in advanced economies are a genuine concern. However, the use of trade restrictions targeted at limiting technological innovations—because those innovations favor relatively higherskilled workers—is particularly problematic: Those innovations also bring substantial aggregate gains (along with the standard gains from trade) that would then be foregone. Consequently, economists favor longer-term policies that ease the skill-acquisition process for all workers so that the gains from the technological innovations can be spread as widely as possible.  

# THE DECLINING LABOR SHARE OF INCOME AND CAPITAL-SKILL COMPLEMENTARITY  

n the previous Case Study, we documented the divergence in wages for American workers over the past half-century. Skilled workers were not the only factor of production who experienced compensation gains during this time period. Over that same time span, the compensation of capital owners also increased. We can measure this by looking at the share of total income going to labor compensation: The remainder of the total income is the returns (compensation) to capital. Figure 5-12 shows how this labor income share for American workers declined from 65 percent in 1975 to 60 percent in 2012 (in other words, the return to capital owners increased from 35 to 40 percent).12  

One possible explanation for this trend— just as it was for the increasing compensation of skilled workers—is increased trade with the labor-­abundant newly industrializing economies (NIEs). This would induce a move toward factorprice equalization for the compensation of capital and labor: The compensation of capital would increase for capital-abundant United States, while it would decrease for the labor-abundant NIEs. Once again, the evidence strongly contradicts this prediction. Figure 5-12 also shows the average world trend for the labor share based on a wide sample of 59 ­countries (with available data from 1975 to 2012). The trend toward lower labor income share (and higher capital shares) is a worldwide phenomenon that has been experienced in labor-abundant countries (including China, India, and Mexico) to the same extent as it has been for capital-­abundant countries such as the United States. Thus, once again, the evidence

supports an explanation based on technological changes within sectors (the increases in the return to capital also occur predominantly within sectors).  

One popular way of modeling this type of technological change in recent research is to introduce a production function with three factors (skilled and unskilled labor, and capital) where capital is a much closer substitute for unskilled labor than for skilled labor. This is referred to as capital-skill complementarity (because the low substitution between skilled workers and capital makes those factors complements in production). ­Technological change takes the form of new and better machines (capital) that displace unskilled workers but still require skilled workers. This generates higher returns for both capital and skilled workers while depressing the returns to unskilled workers. This type of technological change (automation) can explain the observed worldwide increases in both wage inequality and the returns to capital as well as the within-sector increases in the employment share of (relatively skilled) nonproduction workers (see previous Case Study).  

# Factor-Price Equalization  

In the absence of trade, labor would earn less in Home than in Foreign, and capital would earn more. Without trade, labor-abundant Home would have a lower relative price of cloth than capital-abundant Foreign, and the difference in relative prices of goods implies an even larger difference in the relative prices of factors.  

When Home and Foreign trade, the relative prices of goods converge. This convergence, in turn, causes convergence of the relative prices of capital and labor. Thus, there is clearly a tendency toward equalization of factor prices. How far does this tendency go?  

The surprising answer is that in the model, the tendency goes all the way. ­International trade leads to complete equalization of factor prices. Although Home has a higher ratio of labor to capital than Foreign, once they trade with each other, the wage rate and the capital rent rate are the same in both countries. To see this, refer back to Figure 5-6, which shows that given the prices of cloth and food, we can determine the wage rate and the rental rate without reference to the supplies of capital and labor. If Home and Foreign face the same relative prices of cloth and food, they will also have the same factor prices.  

To understand how this equalization occurs, we have to realize that when Home and Foreign trade with each other, more is happening than a simple exchange of goods. In an indirect way, the two countries are in effect trading factors of production. Home lets Foreign use some of its abundant labor, not by selling the labor directly but by trading goods produced with a high ratio of labor to capital for goods produced with a low labor-capital ratio. The goods that Home sells require more labor to produce than the goods it receives in return; that is, more labor is embodied in Home’s exports than in its imports. Thus Home exports its labor, embodied in its labor-intensive exports. Conversely, since Foreign’s exports embody more capital than its imports, Foreign is indirectly exporting its capital. When viewed this way, it is not surprising that trade leads to equalization of the two countries’ factor prices.  

Although this view of trade is simple and appealing, there is a major problem with it: In the real world, factor prices are not equalized. For example, there is an extremely wide range of wage rates across countries (Table 5-1). While some of these differences may reflect differences in the quality of labor, they are too wide to be explained away on this basis alone.

To understand why the model doesn’t give us an accurate prediction, we need to look at its assumptions. Three assumptions crucial to the prediction of factor-price equalization are in reality certainly untrue. These are the assumptions that (1) technologies are the same, (2) costless trade equalizes the prices of goods in the two countries, and (3) both countries produce both goods.  

1.	 The proposition that trade equalizes factor prices will not hold if countries have different technologies of production. For example, a country with superior technology might have both a higher wage rate and a higher rental rate than a country with an inferior technology.   
2.	 Complete factor-price equalization also depends on complete convergence of the prices of goods. In the real world, prices of goods are not fully equalized by international trade. This lack of convergence is due to both natural barriers (such as transportation costs) and barriers to trade such as tariffs, import quotas, and other restrictions.   
3.	 Even if all countries use the same technologies and face the same goods prices, factor-price equalization still depends on the assumption that countries produce the same set of goods. We assumed this when we derived the wage and rental rates from the prices of cloth and food in Figure 5-6. However, countries may be induced to specialize in the production of different goods. A country with a very high ratio of labor to capital might produce only cloth, while a country with a very high ratio of capital to labor might produce only food. This implies that factorprice equalization occurs only if the countries involved are sufficiently similar in their relative factor endowments. (A more thorough discussion of this point is given in the appendix to this chapter.) Thus, factor prices need not be equalized between countries with radically different ratios of capital to labor or of skilled to unskilled labor.  

# Empirical Evidence on the Heckscher-Ohlin Model  

The essence of the Heckscher-Ohlin model is that trade is driven by differences in factor abundance across countries. We just saw how this leads to the natural prediction that goods trade is substituting for factor trade, and hence that goods trade across countries should embody those factor differences. This prediction, based on the factor content of trade, is very powerful and can be tested empirically. However, we will see that the empirical success of this strict test is very limited—mainly due to the same reasons that undermine the prediction for factor-price equalization. Does this mean that differences in factor abundance do not help explain the observed patterns of trade across countries? Not at all. First, we will show that relaxing the assumptions generating factor-price equalization vastly improves the predictive success for the factor content of trade. Second, we will look directly at the pattern of goods traded between developed and developing countries—and we will see how well they fit with the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model.  

# Trade in Goods as a Substitute for Trade in Factors: Factor Content of Trade  

Tests on U.S. Data  Until recently, and to some extent even now, the United States has been a special case among countries. Until a few years ago, the United States was much wealthier than other countries, and U.S. workers visibly worked with more capital per person than their counterparts in other countries. Even now, although some Western European countries and Japan have caught up, the United States continues to be high on the scale of countries as ranked by capital-labor ratios.  

One would then expect the United States to be an exporter of capital-intensive goods and an importer of labor-intensive goods. Surprisingly, however, this was not the case in the 25 years after World War II. In a famous study published in 1953, economist Wassily Leontief (winner of the Nobel Prize in 1973) found that U.S. exports were less capital-intensive than U.S. imports.13 This result is known as the Leontief paradox.  

Table 5-2 illustrates the Leontief paradox as well as other information about U.S. trade patterns. We compare the factors of production used to produce $\$1$ million worth of 1962 U.S. exports with those used to produce the same value of $1962\mathrm{U}.\mathrm{S}.$ . imports. As the first two lines in the table show, Leontief’s paradox was still present in that year: U.S. exports were produced with a lower ratio of capital to labor than U.S. imports.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>TABLE 5-2</td><td colspan="3">Factor Content of U.S. Exports and Imports for 1962</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Imports</td><td>Exports</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Capital per million dollars Labor (person-years) per million dollars</td><td>$2,132,000 119</td><td>$1,876,000 131</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Capital-labor ratio (dollars per worker) Average years of education per worker</td><td>$17,916</td><td>$14,321</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Proportion of engineers and scientists in work force</td><td>9.9 0.0189</td><td>10.1 0.0255</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Source: Robert Baldwin,“Determinants of the Commodity Structure of U.S. Trade," American</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Economic Review 61 (March 1971), pp. 126-145.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

As the rest of the table shows, however, other comparisons of imports and exports are more in line with what one might expect. The United States exported products that were more skilled-labor-intensive than its imports, as measured by average years of education. We also tended to export products that were “technology-intensive,” requiring more scientists and engineers per unit of sales. These observations are consistent with the position of the United States as a high-skill country, with a comparative advantage in sophisticated products. Why then do we observe the Leontief paradox? Is it limited to the United States and/or the types of factors considered? The short answer is no.  

Tests on Global Data  A study by Harry P. Bowen, Edward E. Leamer, and Leo ­Sveikauskas14 extended Leontief’s predictions for the factor content of trade to 27 countries and 12 factors of production. Based on the factor content of a country’s exports and imports, they checked whether a country was a net exporter of a factor of production whenever it was relatively abundantly endowed with that factor (and conversely, whether the country was a net importer for the other factors). They assessed factor abundance by comparing a country’s endowment of a factor (as a share of the world’s supply of that factor) with the country’s share of world GDP. For example, the United States has about 24 percent of world income in 2019 but only about 4 percent of the world’s workers. This yields Leontief ’s original prediction that the factor ­content of U.S. trade should show net imports of labor. Bowen et al. tallied the success/ failure of this sign test across the 27 countries and 12 factors in their study. They ended up with a success rate of only 61 percent—not much better than what one would obtain from a random coin toss! In other words, the factor content of trade ran in the opposite direction to the prediction of the factor proportions theory in 39 percent of the cases.  

These results confirmed that the Leontief paradox was not an isolated case. ­However, this negative empirical performance is perhaps not surprising—given that it represents a demanding test of a theory that also predicts factor-price equalization (which is clearly at odds with the empirical evidence on cross-country wage differences). As we discussed, the assumption of common technology across countries plays a crucial role in delivering this prediction.  

The Case of the Missing Trade  Another indication of large technology differences across countries comes from discrepancies between the observed volumes of trade and those predicted by the Heckscher-Ohlin model. In an influential paper, Daniel Trefler15 at the University of Toronto pointed out that the Heckscher-Ohlin model can also be used to derive predictions for a country’s volume of trade based on differences in that country’s factor abundance with that of the rest of the world (since, in this model, trade in goods is substituting for trade in factors). In fact, factor trade turns out to be substantially smaller than the Heckscher-Ohlin model predicts.  

A large part of the reason for this disparity comes from a false prediction of largescale trade in labor between rich and poor nations. Consider our example for the United States in 2011, with 25 percent of world income but only 5 percent of the world’s workers. Our simple factor-proportions theory should not only predict that U.S. trade should embody net imports of labor—but that the volume of those imported labor services should be huge because they need to account for the United States’ very low abundance of labor relative to the rest of the world. In fact, the volume of factor content of trade between labor- and capital-abundant countries is several orders of magnitude smaller than the volume predicted by the factor proportions theory (based on the observed differences in factor abundance across countries).

Trefler showed that allowing for technology differences across countries helped to resolve the predictive success of both the sign test for the direction of the factor content of trade as well as the missing trade (although there was still plenty of trade left missing). The way this resolution works is roughly as follows: If workers in the United States are much more efficient than the world average, then the “effective” labor supply in the United States is correspondingly larger—and hence the expected volume of imported labor services into the United States is correspondingly lower.  

If one makes the working assumption that technological differences between countries take a simple multiplicative form—that is, a given set of inputs in any country produces a multiple or fraction of the output produced in the United States—it is possible to use data on factor trade to estimate the relative efficiency of production in different countries. Table 5-3 shows Trefler’s estimates for a sample of countries (the multiplicative constant relative to the United States); they suggest that technological differences are in fact very large.  

A Better Empirical Fit for the Factor Content of Trade  Subsequently, an important study by Donald Davis and David Weinstein at Columbia University showed that if one relaxes this assumption on common technologies along with the remaining two assumptions underlying factor-price equalization (countries produce the same set of goods and costless trade equalizes goods prices), then the predictions for the direction and volume of the factor content of trade line up substantially better with the empirical evidence—ultimately generating a good fit. Table 5-4 shows the improvement in the empirical fit, measured both by the predictive success for the sign test (the direction of the factor content of trade) and the missing trade ratio: the ratio of the actual volume of factor content trade to the predicted volume (if one, then there is no missing trade; as the ratio decreases below one, an increasing proportion of predicted trade is missing). For this study, the required data (which included detailed information on the technologies used by each country) was only available for two factors (labor and capital) and 10 countries.  

In the first column of Table 5-4, all three assumptions behind factor-price equalization are imposed (same technologies across countries, countries produce the same set of goods, and costless trade equalizes goods prices). This test is very similar to the one performed by Bowen et al., though the predictive success for the sign test is substantially worse (32 percent success versus 61 percent reported by Bowen et al.). This is due to the different sample of countries and factors considered, and data cleaning procedures based on the newly available information on production techniques. We also see the extent of the missing trade: Virtually all of the predicted volume of factor trade is missing. These results confirm once more that this strict test for the Heckscher-Ohlin model performs very poorly.

The results in the second column were obtained once the assumption of common technologies was dropped, as in the study by Trefler. There is a substantial improvement in both empirical tests, although their overall predictive success is still quite weak. In the third column, the assumption that countries produce the same set of goods is also dropped. We see how this induces a massive improvement for the predictive success of the sign test for the direction of the factor content of trade (up to 86 percent success). The extent of missing trade is also vastly reduced, though the observed trade volume still represents only 19 percent of predicted trade. In the fourth and last column, the assumption of goods-price equalization via costless trade is also dropped. The predictive success for the direction of trade increases further to 91 percent. At this point, we can say that the Leontief paradox is relegated to a statistical anomaly. Column four also shows a huge improvement in the extent of missing trade: The observed trade now represents 69 percent of predicted trade.  

Overall, Table 5-4 highlights vast differences in the predictive success of the ­factor-proportions theory for the direction and volume of the factor content of trade. At one end (column one), we find virtually no support for the prediction of the Heckscher-Ohlin model; however, we also see how this failure is driven by particular assumptions built into our “pure” Heckscher-Ohlin model. When those assumptions are dropped, we can reformulate a model of trade based on differences in factor proportions that fits the observed pattern of factor content of trade quite well (column four).  

# Patterns of Exports between Developed and Developing Countries  

Another way to see how differences in factor proportions shape empirical trade patterns is to contrast the exports of labor-abundant, skill-scarce nations in the developing world with the exports of skill-abundant, labor-scarce nations. In our “2 by 2 by $2^{\circ}$ theoretical model (2 goods, 2 countries, 2 factors), we obtained the ­Heckscher-Ohlin theorem stating that the country abundant in a factor exports the good whose production is intensive in that factor. A paper by John Romalis at the University of Sydney16 showed how this prediction for the pattern of exports can be extended to multiple countries producing multiple goods: As a country’s skill abundance increases, its exports are increasingly concentrated in sectors with higher skill intensity. We now see how this prediction holds when comparing the exports of countries at opposite ends of the skill-abundance spectrum as well as when we compare how exports change when a country such as China grows and becomes relatively more skill-abundant.  

Figure 5-13 contrasts the exports of three developing countries (Bangladesh, ­Cambodia, and Haiti) at the lower end of the skill-abundance spectrum with the three largest European economics (Germany, France, and the United Kingdom) at the upper end of the skill-abundance spectrum. The countries’ exports to the United States by sector are partitioned into four groups in increasing order of skill intensity. These are the same four sector groups used in Figure 5-11.17 Figure 5-13 clearly shows how the exports of the three developing countries to the United States are overwhelmingly concentrated in sectors with the lowest skill-intensity. Their exports in high skill-intensity

sectors are virtually nil. The contrast with the export pattern for the three European countries is apparent: The exports to the United States for those skill-­abundant ­countries are concentrated in sectors with higher skill intensity.  

Changes over time also follow the predictions of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. ­Consider the experience of China over the last three decades, where high growth (especially in the last decade and a half) has been associated with substantial increases in skill abundance. Figure 5-14 shows how the pattern of Chinese exports to the United States by sector has changed over time. Exports are partitioned into the same four groups as Figure 5-13, ordered by the sectors’ skill intensity. We clearly see how the pattern of Chinese exports has fundamentally shifted: As predicted by the Chinese change in factor proportions, the concentration of exports in high-skill sectors steadily increases over time. In the most recent years, we see how the greatest share of exports is transacted in the highest skill-intensity sectors—whereas exports were concentrated in the lowest skill-intensity sectors in the earlier years.18  

# Implications of the Tests  

We do not observe factor-price equalization across countries. When we test the “pure” version of the Heckscher-Ohlin model that maintains all the assumptions behind factor-price equalization, we find that a country’s factor content of trade bears little resemblance to the theoretical predictions based on that country’s factor abundance. However, a less restrictive version of the factor proportions model fits the predicted patterns for the factor content of trade. The pattern of goods trade between developed and developing countries also fits the predictions of the model quite well.  

Lastly, the Heckscher-Ohlin model remains vital for understanding the effects of trade, especially on the distribution of income. Indeed, the growth of North-South trade in manufactures—a trade in which the factor intensity of the North’s imports is very different from that of its exports—has brought the factor-proportions approach into the center of practical debates over international trade policy.  

■■ To understand the role of resources in trade, we develop a model in which two goods are produced using two factors of production. The two goods differ in their factor intensity; that is, at any given wage-rental ratio, production of one of the goods will use a higher ratio of capital to labor than production of the other.   
■■ As long as a country produces both goods, there is a one-to-one relationship between the relative prices of goods and the relative prices of factors used to produce the goods. A rise in the relative price of the labor-intensive good will shift the distribution of income in favor of labor and will do so very strongly: The real wage of labor will rise in terms of both goods, while the real income of capital owners will fall in terms of both goods.   
■■ An increase in the supply of one factor of production expands production possibilities, but in a strongly biased way: At unchanged relative goods prices, the output of the good intensive in that factor rises while the output of the other good actually falls.   
■■ A country with a large supply of one resource relative to its supply of other resources is abundant in that resource. A country will tend to produce relatively more of goods that use its abundant resources intensively. The result is the basic Heckscher-Ohlin theory of trade: Countries tend to export goods that are intensive in the factors with which they are abundantly supplied.   
■ Because changes in relative prices of goods have very strong effects on the relative earnings of resources and because trade changes relative prices, international trade has strong income distribution effects. The owners of a country’s abundant factors gain from trade, but the owners of scarce factors lose. In theory, however, there are still gains from trade, in the limited sense that the winners could compensate the losers and everyone would be better off.   
■■ Increasing trade integration between developed and developing countries could potentially explain rising wage inequality in developed countries. However, little empirical evidence supports this direct link. Rather, the empirical evidence suggests that technological change rewarding worker skill has played a much greater role in driving wage inequality.   
■■ In an idealized model, international trade would actually lead to equalization of the  

prices of factors such as labor and capital between countries. In reality, complete  

factor-price equalization is not observed because of wide differences in resources, barriers to trade, and international differences in technology. ■ Empirical evidence is mixed on the Heckscher-Ohlin model. Yet a less restrictive version of the model fits the predicted patterns for the factor content of trade quite well. Also, the Heckscher-Ohlin model does a good job of predicting the pattern of trade between developed and developing countries.

2.	 In the United States, where Internet services are cheap, the ratio of capital to labor used is higher than that of capital used in accounting services.

# APPENDIX TO CHAPTER 5  

# Factor Prices, Goods Prices, and Production Decisions  

In the main body of this chapter, we made three assertions that are true but not carefully derived. First was the assertion, embodied in Figure 5-5, that the ratio of labor to capital employed in each industry depends on the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ . Second was the assertion, embodied in Figure 5-6, that there is a one-to-one relationship between relative goods prices ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}$ and the wage-rental ratio. Third was the assertion that an increase in a country’s labor supply (at a given relative goods price ${\cal P}_{C}/{\cal P}_{F})$ will lead to movements of both labor and capital from the food sector to the cloth sector (the labor-intensive sector). This appendix briefly demonstrates those three propositions.  

# Choice of Technique  

Figure 5A-1 illustrates again the trade-off between labor and capital input in producing one unit of food—the unit isoquant for food production shown in curve $H.$ It also, however, illustrates a number of isocost lines: combinations of capital and labor input that cost the same amount.  

An isocost line may be constructed as follows: The cost of purchasing a given amount of labor $L$ is $w L$ ; the cost of renting a given amount of capital $K$ is $r K$ . So if  

# FIGURE 5A-1  

# Choosing the Optimal Labor-Capital Ratio  

To minimize costs, a producer must get to the lowest possible isocost line; this means choosing the point on the unit isoquant (curve II) where the slope is equal to minus the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ .  

![](bd6c314839db1b3bb6538e0227dac2dc0575f93907506b72344725d516c5d5d0.jpg)  

one is able to produce a unit of food using units of labor and units of capital, the total cost of producing that unit, $c$ , is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{c=w a_{L F}+r a_{K F}.}\end{array}
$$  

A line showing all combinations of $a_{L F}$ and $a_{K F}$ with the same cost has the equation  

$$
a_{K F}=(c/r)-(w/r)a_{L F}.
$$  

That is, it is a straight line with a slope of $-w/r$ .  

The figure shows a family of such lines, each corresponding to a different level of costs; lines farther from the origin indicate higher total costs. A producer will choose the lowest possible cost given the technological trade-off outlined by curve $\boldsymbol{{I I}}$ . Here, this occurs at point 1, where $\boldsymbol{{\mathit{I I}}}$ is tangent to the isocost line and the slope of $\boldsymbol{{\mathit{I I}}}$ equals $-w/r$ .  (If these results seem reminiscent of the proposition in Figure 4-5 that the economy produces at a point on the production possibility frontier whose slope equals minus ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}},$ you are right: The same principle is involved.)  

Now compare the choice of labor-capital ratio for two different factor-price ratios. In Figure 5A-2, we show input choices given a low relative price of labor $(w/r)^{1}$ and a high relative price of labor $(w/r)^{2}$ . In the former case, the input choice is at 1; in the latter case at 2. That is, the higher relative price of labor leads to the choice of a lower labor-capital ratio, as assumed in Figure 5-5.  

# Goods Prices and Factor Prices  

We now turn to the relationship between goods prices and factor prices. There are several equivalent ways of approaching this problem; here, we follow the analysis introduced by Abba Lerner in the 1930s.  

# FIGURE 5A-2  

# Changing the Wage-Rental Ratio  

A rise in w/r shifts the lowest-cost input choice from point 1 to point 2; that is, it leads to the choice of a lower labor-capital ratio.  

![](ee00e254d8deb386b539008f9abf3f1e0d9f040843023733f9e4deeffaaa8d08.jpg)  

# FIGURE 5A-3  

# Determining the Wage-Rental Ratio  

The two isoquants $C C$ and $F F$ show the inputs necessary to produce one dollar’s worth of cloth and food, respectively. Since price must equal the cost of production, the inputs into each good must also cost one dollar. This means that the wage-rental ratio must equal minus the slope of a line tangent to both isoquants.  

![](31717b2785bcfde666f146d0eedbe4151bd57f216eafb0f110e0f288685d75cb.jpg)  

Figure 5A-3 shows capital and labor inputs into both cloth and food production. In previous figures, we have shown the inputs required to produce one unit of a good. In this figure, however, we show the inputs required to produce one dollar’s worth of each good. (Actually, any dollar amount will do as long as it is the same for both goods.) Thus, the isoquant for cloth, $C C$ , shows the possible input combinations for producing $1/P_{C}$ units of cloth; the isoquant for food, $F F_{\astrosun}$ , shows the possible combinations for producing $1/P_{F}$ units of food. Notice that as drawn, cloth production is labor-intensive (and food production is capital-intensive): For any given $w/r$ , cloth production will always use a higher labor-capital ratio than food production.  

If the economy produces both goods, then it must be the case that the cost of producing one dollar’s worth of each good is, in fact, one dollar. Those two production costs will be equal to one another only if the minimum-cost points of production for both goods lie on the same isocost line. Thus, the slope of the line shown, which is just tangent to both isoquants, must equal (minus) the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ .  

Finally, now, consider the effects of a rise in the price of cloth on the wage-rental ratio. If the price of cloth rises, it is necessary to produce fewer yards of cloth in order to have one dollar’s worth. Thus, the isoquant corresponding to a dollar’s worth of cloth shifts inward. In Figure 5A-4, the original isoquant is shown as $C C^{1}$ , the new isoquant as $C C^{2}$ .  

Once again, we must draw a line just tangent to both isoquants; the slope of that line is minus the wage-rental ratio. It is immediately apparent from the increased steepness of the isocost line [slope $=-(w/r)^{2}]$ that the new $w/r$ is higher than the previous one: A higher relative price of cloth implies a higher wage-rental ratio.  

# More on Resources and Output  

We now examine more rigorously how a change in resources—holding the prices of cloth and food constant—affects the allocation of those factors of production across sectors and how it thus affects production responses. The aggregate employment of labor to capital $L/K$ can be written as a weighted average of the labor-capital employed in the cloth sector $(L_{C}/K_{C})$ and in the food sector $(L_{F}/K_{F})$ :  

$$
\frac{L}{K}=\frac{K_{C}}{K}\frac{L_{C}}{K_{C}}+\frac{K_{F}}{K}\frac{L_{F}}{K_{F}}
$$  

# FIGURE 5A-4  

# A Rise in the Price of Cloth  

If the price of cloth rises, a smaller output is now worth one dollar, so $C C^{1}$ is replaced by $C C^{2}$ . The implied wage-rental ratio must therefore rise from $(w/r)^{1}$ to $(w/r)^{2}$ .  

![](e3a973ef2d48d00c5160e05ce14a980e76a898250d52bd500b242cc4c82d88c6.jpg)  

Note that the weights in this average, $K_{C}/K$ and $K_{F}/K_{\sun}$ , add up to 1 and are the proportions of capital employed in the cloth and food sectors. We have seen that a given relative price of cloth is associated with a given wage-rental ratio (so long as the economy produces both cloth and food), which in turn is associated with given labor-capital employment levels in both sectors $(L_{C}/K_{C}$ and $L_{F}/K_{F})$ . Now consider the effects of an increase in the economy’s labor supply $L$ at a given relative price of cloth: $L/K$ increases while $L_{C}/K_{C}$ and $L_{F}/K_{F}$ both remain constant. For equation (5A-1) to hold, the weight on the higher labor-capital ratio, $L_{C}/K_{C},$ must increase. This implies an increase in the weight $K_{C}/K$ and a corresponding decrease in the weight $K_{F}/K$ . Thus, capital moves from the food sector to the cloth sector (since the total capital supply $K$ remains constant in this example). Furthermore, since $L_{F}/K_{F}$ remains constant, the decrease in $K_{F}$ must also be associated with a decrease in labor employment $L_{F}$ in the food sector. This shows that the increase in the labor supply, at a given relative price of cloth, must be associated with movements of both labor and capital from the food sector to the cloth sector. The expansion of the economy’s production ­possibility ­frontier is so biased toward cloth that—at a constant relative price of cloth—the ­economy produces less food.  

As the economy’s labor supply increases, the economy concentrates more and more of both factors in the labor-intensive cloth sector. If enough labor is added, then the economy specializes in cloth production and no longer produces any food. At that point, the one-to-one relationship between the relative goods price ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}$ and the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ is broken; further increases in the labor supply $L$ are then associated with decreases in the wage-rental ratio along the $C C$ curve in Figure 5-7.  

A similar process would occur if the economy’s capital supply were to increase— again holding the relative goods price ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}$ fixed. So long as the economy produces both cloth and food, the economy responds to the increased capital supply by concentrating production in the food sector (which is capital-intensive): Both labor and capital move to the food sector. The economy experiences growth that is strongly biased toward food. At a certain point, the economy completely specializes in the food sector, and the one-to-one relationship between the relative goods price ${{P}_{C}}/{{P}_{F}}$ and the wage-rental ratio $w/r$ is broken once again. Further increases in the capital supply $K$ are then associated with increases in the wage-rental ratio along the $F F$ curve in Figure 5-7.
