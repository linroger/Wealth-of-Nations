# Characteristics of the Eurodollar Market
## THE EUROCURRENCY MARKET

Eurocurrency markets are defined as banking markets which involve short-term borrowing and lending conducted outside of the legal jurisdiction of the authorities of the currency that is used. For example,  eurodollar deposits are dollar deposits held in London and Paris.

The eurocurrency market has two sides to it:

1. The receipt of deposits
1. The loaning out of those deposits

By far the most important eurocurrency is the eurodollar which currently accounts for approximately 60–65% of all eurocurrency activity,  followed by the euroeuro,  eurofrancs (Swiss),  eurosterling and euroyen.

The use of the prefix 'euro' is somewhat misleading because dollar deposits held by banks in Hong Kong or Tokyo are equally outside the legal jurisdiction of the US authorities and also constitute eurodollar deposits. This more widespread geographical base means that euromarkets are often referred to as 'offshore' markets.

The eurocurrency market is part of the international money market since it involves lending and borrowing for a period of less than a year. By contrast,  the Eurobond market is part of the international capital market and involves lending and borrowing for periods of more than a year.

A Eurobond is a bond that is sold by a government,  institution or company in a currency that is different from the country where the bond is issued. For example,  a dollar bond sold in London is a dollar Eurobond,  and a sterling bond sold in Germany is a sterling Eurobond.

## PARTICIPANTS IN THE EUROCURRENCY AND EUROBOND MARKETS

There are numerous participants in the international money and capital markets,  including:

- National governments
- Local authorities
- Financial institutions such as banks and multinational firms
- Companies
- International institutions,  such as the IMF,  World Bank and European Investment Bank
- Private investors

Most industrialized countries' participants act both as lenders and borrowers of funds,  while many developing countries use the markets almost exclusively for borrowing purposes.

The [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]] between different countries are motivated by factors such as:

1. Trade financing motive
1. Borrowing/lending motive
1. Speculative motive
1. Hedging motive
1. Capital flight motive

In the 1970s and early 1980s,  the vast majority of loans made by the eurobanks to the developing countries were made by syndicates of eurobanks. A syndicate is normally led by a lead or managing bank,  with other banks contributing funding to participate in a loan. [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]] reduce the exposure of individual banks to particular borrowers.

A final factor behind the growth of eurobanking activity has been the rapid growth of world trade,  which provides companies with foreign currency balances to earn interest on and others that require foreign currency funding.

12.14 THE MANAGEMENT OF A EUROBOND ISSUE

| Amount: |$100 million-$4,     000 million. |
| ---- | ---- |
| Issuers: | Governments,      international organisations eg: the World Bank,      the European Investment Bank,      banks/financial institutions and major corporations with AAA,      AA,      A credit ratings accounting for approximately 75% of all corporate issues. |
| Maturity: | Normally 10 years or less. |
|  | Most issues being in the 4-7 year range. |
| Principal: | Typically repayable in full upon maturity"bullet form"). Occasionally some issues have the principal repayable in stages over the life of the bond and sometimes the principal repayable linked to movements in a market index such as the Nikkei or Standard & Poor 500. |
| Coupon: | Payable annually. Vast majority are "straights,      that is,      at a fixed coupon. Approximately a quarter of issues are at a variable coupon linked to a spread over [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate ( [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] )]] (or some other benchmark) known as floating rate notes. |
| Yield: | Spread over US Treasury bonds depends on credit rating. |
|  | AAA governments around 10-20 basis points |
|  | AAA corporates around 20-40 basis points |

# Characteristics of the Eurodollar Market

**Key features:**

- Generally free from government regulation
- Not subject to reserve requirements,  interest rate controls,  or deposit insurance
- Users include banks,  companies,  institutions,  governments
- The benchmark eurocurrency interest rate is the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
- Increasingly,  floating interest rates tied to [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] rather than fixed rates
- Eurobank assets and liabilities mostly short-term with matched maturities

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF EUROBANKS

The key reason eurobanks can offer higher deposit rates and lower lending rates than comparable U.S. facilities is:

1. No reserve requirements
1. Economies of scale
1. Avoid domestic regulations/costs
1. Highly competitive internationally
1. No deposit insurance fees
1. Low customer default rates

This allows a greater margin between deposit funding costs and lending revenue.

## COEXISTENCE OF DOMESTIC AND EUROBANKING

The rapid growth of eurobanking despite some domestic banking deregulation shows it serves specialized cross-border banking needs. Its key advantage is avoidance of regulations like reserves.

Eurobanking is likely to keep coexisting with domestic banking by serving particular global financial services needs.

## CONCERNS ABOUT EUROCURRENCY MARKETS

Concerns include:

- Huge unregulated credit creation potential
- Interbank linkages meaning one failure could spread
- Fuelled rising inflation in 1960s/1970s

But advantages include:

- Widened borrowing/lending options
- Enabled access to competitive rates
- Facilitated international [[Chapter 14- Capital Flows and the Current Account|capital flows]]

Properly regulated,  the eurocurrency markets provide useful services but oversight is needed to reduce systemic financial risks.

## THE INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL MARKET AND EUROBONDS

The **international capital market** enables longer term (over 1 year) cross-border lending/borrowing. It includes:

1. Domestic bond markets
1. Foreign bond markets
1. The Eurobond market

A **Eurobond** is sold in a different currency to the country of issuance – e.g. a dollar bond sold in London.

## ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF EUROBONDS

The first Eurobond was issued in 1963. Growth accelerated due to:

- 1980s: Banks reluctant to lend to corporations
- 1990s: Companies realized they could borrow more cheaply than bank loans by issuing bonds directly

**Key Eurobond benefits:**

- Avoid domestic regulations and disclosure requirements
- Well-known companies access lower cost funding than in domestic bond markets

Around 75% of issues have AAA/AA ratings. Governments/agencies and corporations use the market. Some issuers want currencies to later swap.

## MAJOR TYPES OF EUROBONDS

Major types include:

**Straights**: Fixed coupon bonds with principal repayment at maturity

**Floaters**: Interest rate adjusts every 3-6 months in line with market rates

**Convertibles**: Can convert into company shares at a set price

**Warrants**: Enable share purchases at a set price

**Asset-backed**: Based on income streams from underlying collateral assets

**Innovations**: Include equity-indexed principal,  calls,  and euro denomination.

## CONTROL OF THE EUROBOND MARKET

Although outside direct jurisdiction,  key currency countries can influence their currency's Eurobond market by:

- Requiring use of domestic clearance systems for settlement
- Pressuring domestic banks not to participate
- Limiting access to domestic bond investors

So major economies exert some control over Eurobond issues in their currency.

## MANAGEMENT OF A EUROBOND ISSUE

**Key player groups:**

1. **Management group**: Lead bank(s) running the issuance
1. **Underwriting syndicate**: Banks/firms guaranteeing the raising of funds
1. **Selling group**: Institutions assisting with bond allocation

**Process includes:**

- Prospectus issuance
- Investor interest canvassing
- Finalizing bond terms
- Primary issuance
- Development of a secondary market

Fees range from 0.5-2% based on issue complexity and bank rivalries also affect outcomes.
