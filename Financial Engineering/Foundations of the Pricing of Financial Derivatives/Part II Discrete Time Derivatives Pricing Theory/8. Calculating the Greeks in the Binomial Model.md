In particular, dealers that make markets in options need to be able to hedge the risk.1 Hence, they must know how sensitive their options are to changes in market conditions. Knowing these sensitivities enables them to balance that risk using other instruments. These sensitivities are often known as the Greeks. This term arose because they are primarily identified with Greek letters, such as delta and gamma. End users, such as corporate executives, portfolio managers, and regulators, have all found these measures and other Greeks to be very useful. For example, in Chapter 18 we will see an application of option theory to gain insights on corporate default risk. Within this framework, the Greeks provide useful information regarding sensitivities of default risk to changes in market conditions. Numerous financial instruments contain option-like features where understanding the related Greeks will aid in financial decision-making.  

# 8.1 STANDARD APPROACH  

Let $S$ be the current price of the underlying asset and $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $d$ be the up and down factors. The discrete risk-free rate per period is $r_{:}$ , and $X$ is the exercise price of the option. We illustrate both calls and puts in the binomial model for two periods in Figure 8.1.  

We are interested in the sensitivities of the option value to the underlying, to time to expiration, to the volatility, and to the risk-free interest rate. These four parameters are subject to change over time; hence, risk managers need to understand how their option values change along with other assets for which they are responsible.  

Recall that put-call parity (PCP) can be expressed generically as  

$$
c=S-P V(X)+p,
$$  

where $P V(X)$ denotes the present value of $X$ . In this and future chapters the interest rate quotation convention, such as different ways of discrete compounding and even continuous compounding, can vary. Hence, for convenience, we will simply rely on a generic present value function. PCP is based on static arbitrage transactions. Therefore, put-call parity should hold with any model for option pricing. Thus, we will rely on the linkage between puts and calls whenever convenient.

FIGURE 8.1 The Binomial Model (Two Periods)  

# 8.1.1 Delta  

The sensitivity of call and put options to the value of the underlying is called the delta. Of course, it is intuitive that a put moves opposite to the underlying as it benefits from decreases in the price of the underlying. Thus, its delta must be negative. Here, we take the negative of the traditional measure of the put delta to represent it as a positive number, simplifying various binomial model interpretations.2 The call and put deltas are formally defined as  

$$
\Delta_{c}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial S}\mathrm{\nabla}^{\mathrm{and}}\Delta_{{\phi}}=-\frac{\partial p}{\partial S}.
$$  

We have specified the deltas in terms of partial derivatives. At this point, we do not have a continuous and differentiable model of the option value, which will come later with the Black-Scholes-Merton model. We can observe the following relationship between call and put deltas based on put-call parity, Equation (8.1), and the fact that the partial derivative of anything with itself is one. Thus, we know (recall our put delta is signed)  

$$
\Delta_{c}=1-\Delta_{p}.
$$  

In discrete time, we approximate the deltas with the following:  

$$
\Delta_{c}\simeq\frac{\Delta c}{\Delta S}\mathrm{~and~}\Delta_{\boldsymbol{p}}\simeq-\frac{\Delta\boldsymbol{p}}{\Delta S},
$$  

where the delta symbols in the numerator and denominator reflect the change in the prices of the options and asset from their current prices. The problem in measuring delta in a binomial tree is that technically we must assume that the asset price changes without an increment of time. Time is a variable and if we advance further into the tree, we have not held time constant. With delta, we are attempting to measure the sensitivity of the option to a single effect, the change in the value of the underlying. From the binomial tree diagram, we see that the asset price can change only with an increment of time, not at a given instant in time. One way to deal with this problem is to have enough binomial periods so that the length of each time step is very short. There is also another way to fit the tree to deal with the problem, which we explore in the second half of this chapter. For now, let us measure delta the best we can, given the form of the tree we have used to now.  

As we shall see later when covering the Black-Scholes-Merton model, in a continuous time world, the option price is nonlinear with respect to the asset price, meaning that the option price change is not the same upward as it is downward for a given change in the underlying. This result is due to the convexity of the relationship between the option price and the asset price. That convexity is evident in the binomial model as well. Although it is not apparent in Figure 8.1, the option price change is not the same upward as it is downward. In continuous time, we deal with this problem by using the first derivative, which is the limit of the rate of change in the option price for an infinitesimal change in the asset price. The first derivative linearizes the change in the option price in relation to the change in the asset price. In the binomial model, the usual approach to measuring delta is to take the average of the two possible call price changes and divide by the average of the two possible asset price changes:3  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\Delta_{c}=\frac{(1/2)(c_{u}-c)+(1/2)(c-c_{d})}{(1/2)(S u-S)+(1/2)(S-S d)}=\frac{c_{u}-c_{d}}{S u-S d}}\\ {\displaystyle\Delta_{p}=1-\Delta_{c}=-\frac{(1/2)(p_{u}-p)+(1/2)(p-p_{d})}{(1/2)(S u-S)+(1/2)(S-S d)}=\frac{p_{d}-p_{u}}{S u-S d}.}\end{array}
$$  

Recall that in Chapter 7, our derivation of the binomial model revealed that this is the correct measure of delta because it is the number of shares that should be held to hedge in relation to a short position in one call option. This idea is the same notion of delta in the continuous time world of the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Because the delta is $\Delta c/\Delta S$ , if we hold $\Delta c/\Delta S$ units of the asset and the asset changes by $\Delta S$ , the position in the asset changes by $(\Delta c/\Delta S)\Delta S=\Delta c$ . If we hold one short call, then it changes by $-\Delta c$ and the net result is an offset.  

# 8.1.2 Gamma  

A short option position hedged with delta units of a long asset position will be a perfect hedge provided that the effect of the asset price change is accurately captured by the delta. In the real, non-binomial world, this result will occur only if the asset price change is infinitesimal. Hence, delta-hedged positions are at least partially vulnerable to virtually any change in the asset price, however large that change may be. In other words, there are essentially no changes that are truly infinitesimal in the real world. In addition, the delta will change with any change in time. If the delta changes, the hedged position must be revised to reflect a new number of shares that will balance the asset price risk. If the delta is not revised quickly enough, the hedged position will lose its effectiveness. The gamma reflects the change in the delta given a change in the asset price and captures this effect. Technically gamma is somewhat meaningless in a binomial world unless we impose some limitations on our ability to trade to adjust the hedge position whenever the asset price changes. We often use the binomial model to approximate a continuous time world, however, so we need to know how to estimate the gamma in the binomial model.4  

The gamma is formally defined as  

$$
\Gamma=\frac{\partial\left(\frac{\partial c}{\partial S}\right)}{\partial S}=\frac{\partial^{2}c}{\partial S^{2}}.
$$  

Taking the second derivative of Equation (8.1), we note that the gamma of the call and put are equal or  

$$
\Gamma_{c}=\Gamma_{p}.
$$  

In the binomial model, we measure the call gamma by first noting that the call delta can change from the above measure, $\Delta_{\mathrm{c}}$ , either to the new delta if the asset goes up, which we call $\Delta_{c u}$ , or to the new delta if the asset goes down, which we call $\Delta_{c d}$ . Using the formula for the call delta, these deltas at time 1 are defined as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\Delta_{c u}=\frac{c_{u2}-c_{u d}}{{S u}^{2}-{S u d}}}\\ {\displaystyle\Delta_{c d}=\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d2}}{{S u d}-{S d}^{2}}.}\end{array}
$$  

In the binomial model, the gamma is estimated by averaging the change in the delta, $(1/2)(\Delta_{u}-\Delta)+(1/2)(\Delta-\Delta_{d})=(1/2)(\Delta_{u}-\Delta_{d})$ , and dividing by the average change in the asset price. For the numerator,  

$$
(1/2)(\Delta_{u}-\Delta_{d})=(1/2)\left(\frac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{u d}}{{S u}^{2}-{S u d}}\right)-(1/2)\left(\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d^{2}}}{{S u d}-{S d}^{2}}\right).
$$  

For the denominator,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{(1/4)(S u^{2}-S u)+(1/4)(S u-S u d)+(1/4)(S u d-S d)+(1/4)(S d-S d^{2})}\\ &{\quad=(1/4)(S u^{2}-S d^{2}).}\end{array}
$$  

So now we have the following estimate of the call gamma:  

$$
\Gamma_{c}=\frac{\left(\frac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{u d}}{{S u}^{2}-{S u d}}\right)-\left(\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d^{2}}}{{S u d}-{S d}^{2}}\right)}{(1/2)({S u}^{2}-{S d}^{2})}.
$$  

Following this logic, the put gamma can be estimated in a similar fashion:  

$$
\Gamma_{p}=\frac{\left(\frac{\dot{p}_{d^{2}}-\dot{p}_{u d}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{\dot{p}_{u d}-\dot{p}_{u^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)}{(1/2)(S u^{2}-S d^{2})}.
$$  

Note that in order to calculate the call or put gamma, you need the asset and option prices two time periods ahead. Thus, one important limitation of this approach is that it is impossible to calculate the gamma one time step before expiration. This point in time, which would often be very close to expiration, would tend to have a high gamma unless the option is deep in- or out-of-the-money. Therefore, there can be a critical need to estimate the gamma at that very point at which it cannot be estimated. One solution is to use a large number of time steps of very short length.  

# 8.1.3 Theta  

The theta is the effect of the change in time on the option price. It captures the time value decay, meaning that it reflects the rate at which the option price changes when nothing else changes. We know that option prices move toward their exercise values, and at expiration, they equal their exercise value. The formal specification of theta for a continuous time world is  

$$
\Theta_{c}=\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}\mathrm{\and\}\Theta_{p}=\frac{\partial p}{\partial t},
$$  

where $t$ is the current point in time. If the remaining time is, say, $\tau=T-t$ , then $\partial t=$ $T-\partial\tau$ . Sometimes theta is evaluated in terms of $\partial\tau$ , but we need not do so here as the transformation is simple.  

Observing the binomial tree diagram, it should be apparent that an estimate of theta is obtained as  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\Theta_{c}=\displaystyle\frac{c_{u d}-c}{2\Delta t}\mathrm{{and}}}}\\ {{\Theta_{p}=\displaystyle\frac{p_{u d}-p}{2\Delta t},}}\end{array}
$$  

where $\Delta t$ is the length of each time step. Note that we are measuring the change in option price without the effect of an asset price change. Two time steps are required for the asset to return to where it started.5 In other words, to measure the time sensitivity at time 0, we take the difference in the price two periods later at the same asset price, $c_{u d}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ , and subtract the current option price, dividing that difference by $2\Delta t$ , because two time steps have elapsed.  

# 8.1.4 Vega and Rho  

Vega and rho are the effects of the volatility and interest rate, respectively, on the option price.6 Unfortunately, vega and rho cannot be measured as easily as delta, gamma, and theta. To understand why, it is necessary to understand the role of volatility and the interest rate in a typical option pricing model.  

The volatility and interest rate are assumed constant over the life of the option. When working in a continuous time world, we can certainly take the derivative of the BlackScholes-Merton model with respect to the volatility or interest rate, but their interpretations are simply that the option price will be different if we use a different volatility or interest rate. This point should be very clear in the binomial model. The binomial tree changes only as a result of time and the asset price change. The volatility and interest rate affect the up and down factors and the risk-neutral probability, but these parameters are constant throughout the tree. It is possible, however, to allow the up and down factors and the risk-free rate to change, but this is the subject of more advanced models.  

If we want to measure the sensitivity of the binomial option price to a different volatility or interest rate, we would simply recalculate the binomial option value with a different volatility or interest rate, keeping in mind that the sensitivity is different depending on whether we use a higher or lower volatility or interest rate. We would try both an increase and a decrease in the volatility and interest rate. We would then average the option price difference and divide by the average difference of the volatility or interest rate to get a reasonable estimate of the vega or rho.7  

# 8.2 AN ENHANCED METHOD FOR ESTIMATING DELTA AND GAMMA  

Because delta and gamma should technically be measured without a change in time, a modified method of fitting the binomial tree can be used to achieve this property. Suppose we wish to fit a binomial tree with $N$ time steps. With this modification we fit the tree with $N+2$ time steps and position the current asset price in the middle of the second time step, in the following manner. In our example in the previous section, we assess the Greeks assuming we are at point in time 2 with one up move. Figure 8.2 illustrates the binomial tree for a call where the shade indicates actual potential paths for the current stock price $(S u d)$ .  

Now let us position ourselves right in the center where the current asset price is Sud, with the corresponding option price being $c_{u d}$ . We shall see that this binomial tree offers several advantages over the standard approach. As we shall learn in the next sections, it will enable us to calculate both delta and gamma without imposing a time change.8  

# 8.2.1 Delta  

Positioned at the current asset price of $S_{u d}$ , we can now measure the effect of a different asset price on the option price without moving forward in time. Notice that at this time point, there are two other asset prices, $S u^{2}$ and $S d^{2}$ . We can observe the effect of the asset  

![](f5e67f9a90f4e3fe51f6b585430dd2ae333ed8c9e0b8884328a113ea3c7894ce.jpg)  
FIGURE 8.2 Two-Period Expanded Binomial Model  

price being $S u^{2}$ or $S d^{2}$ at the same time point and measure delta as the average option price change divided by the average asset price change.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\Delta_{c}=\cfrac{\left(1/2\right)\left(c_{u^{2}}-c_{u d}\right)+\left(1/2\right)\left(c_{u d}-c_{d^{2}}\right)}{\left(1/2\right)\left(S u^{2}-S u d\right)+\left(1/2\right)\left(S u d-S d^{2}\right)}=\cfrac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{d^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S d^{2}}\ \mathrm{and}}\\ &{\Delta_{p}=\cfrac{\left(1/2\right)\left(p_{u d}-p_{u^{2}}\right)+\left(1/2\right)\left(p_{d^{2}}-p_{u d}\right)}{\left(1/2\right)\left(S u^{2}-S u d\right)+\left(1/2\right)\left(S u d-S d^{2}\right)}=\cfrac{p_{d^{2}}-p_{u^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S d^{2}}.}\end{array}
$$  

So, now our estimate of delta does not permit any passage of time.  

# 8.2.2 Gamma  

Remember that gamma measures the change in delta, given a change in the asset price. From the point at which the asset is at Sud, we can think of the gamma as being the difference in the change in option price over the change in asset price for the asset price in the node above and for the asset price in the node below. That is,  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\Gamma_{c}=\frac{\left(\frac{c_{u2}-c_{u d}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)-\left(\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d2}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)}{(1/2)\left(S u^{2}-S d^{2}\right)}\mathrm{~and~}}\\ &{\Gamma_{p}=\frac{\left(\frac{p_{d2}-p_{u d}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{p_{u d}-p_{u2}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)}{(1/2)\left(S u^{2}-S d^{2}\right)}.}\end{array}
$$  

The numerator measures the average difference in the delta and the denominator measures the average asset price change. Note that we can now measure gamma at any time step, including the one before expiration.  

# 8.2.3 Theta  

As in the standard case, theta will require two time steps ahead of the current price. The theta would then be measured the same as in the standard case:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\Theta_{c}=\frac{c_{u^{2}d^{2}}-c_{u d}}{2\Delta t}\ \mathrm{and}}\\ &{\Theta_{p}=\frac{{p_{u^{2}d^{2}}-p_{u d}}}{{2\Delta t}}.}\end{array}
$$  

# 8.2.4 Vega and Rho  

The same issues concerning the estimation of vega and rho that were discussed previously would apply here. The tree does not technically permit the volatility or the interest rate to change. The tree could be recomputed with small changes in volatilities and interest rates to obtain estimates of the vega and rho, but these measures would technically mean the sensitivity if vega and rho were different but fixed, as opposed to variable.  

# 8.3 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES  

Now let us take a look at some numerical examples. Let us first look at a simple problem with two binomial time steps. Later we extend the problem to more time steps. We use the following inputs: $S=100$ , $X=100$ , $\tau=2$ (time to expiration), $\sigma=0.4$ , $r=0.07$ (discrete), and $n=2$ . With the inputs expressed in these terms, we have to convert them to their binomial analogs. Thus, we now introduce a reasonable and widely used formula to convert the volatility and risk-free rate of the asset return to the binomial parameters,  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{u=e^{\sigma\sqrt{\tau/n}}}\\ {d=1/u}\\ {r(p e r p e r i o d)=(1+r)^{\tau/n}-1.}\end{array}
$$  

Note here that $d$ is the reciprocal of $\boldsymbol{u}$ , but that does not have to be the case. Research on the binomial model has produced many formulas for converting volatility of the underlying to the $u$ and $d$ factors. In the limit, all of them produce the desired result. This is just one of the more widely used formulas. The calculations are  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{u=e^{0.4\sqrt{2/2}}=1.4918\phantom{-}}\\ {d=1/1.4918=0.6703}\\ {r(p e r p e r i o d)=(1+r)^{T/n}=(1.07)^{2/2}-1=0.07.}\end{array}
$$  

We obtain $u=1.4918$ , $d=0.6703$ , and the per-period risk-free rate is 0.07. The length of a time step is $2{\mathrm{~(years)}}/2=1.$ That is, each time step is one year. The standard binomial tree is as shown in Figure 8.3.9  

The standard Greeks are computed as follows:  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Delta_{c}=\cfrac{c_{u}-c_{d}}{S u-S d}=\cfrac{55.72-0}{149.18-67.03}=0.6783~\mathrm{and}~\Delta_{p}}\\ {=\cfrac{p_{d}-p_{u}}{S u-S d}=\cfrac{26.43-0}{149.18-67.03}=0.3217,}\end{array}
$$  

$$
\Gamma_{c}=\frac{\left(\frac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{u d}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)-\left(\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d^{2}}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)}{(1/2)(S u^{2}-S d^{2})}=\frac{\left(\frac{122.55-0}{222.55-100}\right)-\left(\frac{0-0}{100-44.93}\right)}{(1/2)(222.55-44.93)}=0.0113\approx3.033
$$  

$$
\Gamma_{p}=\frac{\left(\frac{p_{d^{2}}-p_{u d}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{p_{u d}-p_{u^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)}{(1/2)(S u^{2}-S d^{2})}=\frac{\left(\frac{5S.07-0}{100-44.93}\right)-\left(\frac{0-0}{222.55-100}\right)}{(1/2)(222.5S-44.93)}=0.0113,
$$  

$$
\Theta_{c}=\frac{c_{u d}-c}{2\Delta t}=\frac{0-25.34}{2(1)}=-12.67\mathrm{and}\Theta_{p}=\frac{p_{u d}-p}{2\Delta t}=\frac{0-12.68}{2(1)}=-6.34.
$$  

Note that from Equations (8.3) and (8.7), the put-call parity relationship for delta and gamma hold. The tree for the more precise method is as shown in Figure 8.4: The positioning of this tree in the context of time merits an explanation. The current state is the middle position of time 2 where the asset is at 100 and the call is at 25.34.10 In general terms, the current state is where the asset price is $S_{u d}$ . To obtain the states above and below, where the asset price is $S_{u^{2}}$ and $S_{d^{2}}$ , we have to back up and generate states $S_{u}$ and $S_{d}$ and then back up to generate S. Once we have this information, we can generate the prices $S_{u^{2}}$ and $S_{d^{2}}$ . The option still expires in two years, and with two periods, each time step is one year. It is important to understand that the time steps before the current step, time 2, are artificial. They do not imply a past history. And in general, $S_{u d}$ does not have to equal

S and only does so if $d$ is the reciprocal of $u$ . That is the case in this example, given the formula we chose to convert volatility to $u$ and $d$ , but it does not have to be in general.  

Delta and gamma are computed as follows:  

$$
\Delta_{c}=\frac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{d^{2}}}{{S u}^{2}-{S d}^{2}}=\frac{135.21-0}{222.55-44.93}=0.7612,
$$  

$$
\Delta_{\boldsymbol{p}}=\frac{p_{d^{2}}-p_{u^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S d^{2}}=\frac{42.41-0}{222.55-44.93}=0.2388,
$$  

$$
\Gamma_{c}=\frac{\left(\frac{c_{u^{2}}-c_{u d}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)-\left(\frac{c_{u d}-c_{d^{2}}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)}{(1/2)(S u^{2}-S d^{2})}=\frac{\left(\frac{135.21-25.34}{222.55-100}\right)-\left(\frac{25.34-0}{100-44.93}\right)}{(1/2)(222.55-44.93)}=0.0049,\beta_{u}=\beta_{d}=\beta_{d}=\beta_{d}.
$$  

$$
\Gamma_{p}=\frac{\left(\frac{p_{d^{2}}-p_{u d}}{S u d-S d^{2}}\right)-\left(\frac{p_{u d}-p_{u^{2}}}{S u^{2}-S u d}\right)}{(1/2)(S u^{2}-S d^{2})}=\frac{\left(\frac{42.41-12.68}{100-44.93}\right)-\left(\frac{12.68-0}{222.55-100}\right)}{(1/2)(222.55-44.93)}=0.0049.
$$  

Theta is the same as in the standard method, but this will not always be the case. The period two time steps ahead in both models is the expiration, so the option value will be the same, but for models with more time steps, the thetas will not always be the same.  

The expanded method works better for a limited number of time steps, but with the incredible speed of the computers of today, most binomial computations can be done with a large number of time steps reasonably fast. In that case, the length of each time step would be very short, and the standard method will give relatively accurate measures of delta and gamma. Let us work a problem with a large number of time steps. We will see in Chapter 9 that these answers should converge to those obtained from the Black-Scholes-Merton model. Working the same problem with 500 time steps, we get the following results in Table 8.1, which we show alongside the Black-Scholes-Merton values.11  

The differences are, as expected, quite small.  

# 8.4 DIVIDENDS  

As explained in Chapter 7, dividends pose a significant problem with the multiplicative binomial model. The binomial Greeks presented here would require the binomial lattice to be adjusted based on the escrow method. Once the dividend-adjusted binomial  

lattice was constructed, the computation of binomial Greeks would proceed as described in this chapter.  

# 8.5 RECAP AND PREVIEW  

In option valuation, the Greeks are the changes in the value of an option for changes in the inputs that determine the value of an option. They are sensitivity measures and are important in the valuation and trading of options. We examined the various Greeks known as the delta, gamma, theta, vega, and rho, and we showed how they can be calculated in the binomial model. We also presented numerical examples.  

In Chapter 9, we show how the binomial model can be extended to a continuous-time world in which the time step is extremely small and how the value ultimately converges to the Black-Scholes-Merton option value.

1. A dealer stands ready to buy or sell options at the behest of a client. The dealer takes the opposite position of the client and lays off the risk by hedging. In essence, dealers are wholesalers or intermediaries of risk.   
2. In Chapter 14, we revert to the traditional put delta with the negative sign. Thus, in this introductory material, we report put deltas as positive numbers.   
3. Note that the price changes are expressed as $c_{u}-c$ and $c-c_{d}$ . We are taking the average absolute price changes. Thus, we need to have $c-c_{d}$ rather than $c_{d}-c$ because the latter is negative. We take the same approach for S. Further, we take the negative of the traditional put delta so it is represented as a positive number.   
4. These points will become clearer when we cover the Greeks in a continuous time world.   
5. Here we note that if the down factor is not the inverse of the up factor, meaning a nonrecombining tree, then $S u d\neq S$ , and this method will not be as precise. Nonetheless, with enough time steps, Sud will often be close enough to $s$ to ignore any such problems.   
6. Vega is referred to as an option Greek as the Greek letter nu, $\nu.$ , looks similar to the letter v for volatility. Vega is not a Greek letter, as say delta, gamma, theta, and so on. Nonetheless, in the history of options someone decided that vega sounded like a good term for the effect of volatility on an option price.   
7. We should also make sure that the change in volatility and interest rate is very small, given that we are attempting to approximate a derivative.   
8. Also, with this type of tree, if we need to measure gamma one period prior to expiration, we can do so. Otherwise, we could not.   
9. We do not illustrate the calculations for how the option prices are obtained because this is covered in Chapter 7.   
10. Note that this price is the same current price we used in the standard method.   
11. We have not covered the Black-Scholes-Merton model yet but showing the computed values from that model gives us a preview of how the binomial model will converge to it.
