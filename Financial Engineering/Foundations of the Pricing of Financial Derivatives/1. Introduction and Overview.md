# Introduction and Overview  

Finance is the study of money, something commonly used as a medium of exchange. It involves the measurement and management of money: how much we had, how much we have, and how much we expect to have in the future. Much of what we study and do in finance, however, is about making money, so its focus tends to be on the future. Yet, the future is unknown, and the unknown is about risk. People take risks in order to earn money. Finance is essentially the study of the risk and return of money.  

In order to do what we do in finance, we must measure money. In fact, measurement in terms of monetary units, such as US dollars, is a core activity of finance, and there is considerably more to measuring money than just counting it. The challenge in finance is in measuring the value of assets that are not cash but can be expressed in terms of cash. An instrument is a generic term that refers to a tool that measures something. A financial instrument is a type of instrument defined as a tool that measures something in dollars or other currency units. In our context, positive-valued financial instruments are called assets and negative-valued financial instruments are called liabilities. In general, assets and liabilities are both categorized as instruments or financial instruments because our focus is on finance. Thus, an instrument can reference either assets or liabilities.  

Some instruments trade in a market where we can observe their prices, but does that mean that we do not question whether these prices are good prices, in the sense of fairly and accurately reflecting what something should be worth? If you need to buy a used car and you find a 10-year-old car with 150,000 miles on it selling for $\$50,000$ , does that mean you would pay that price? No, it is likely you would believe that price to be too high. Perhaps $\$5,000$ is a better price. What we have just done is a valuation of the car. We may have gotten it from some service, observed the prices of similar cars, or simply said that $\$5,000$ is the amount we would pay, meaning that we would willingly part with the consumption of $\$5,000$ of other goods and services to obtain the car.  

Likewise, securities that trade in markets have prices that are observable, but that does not mean that we accept those prices as fair. These securities need to be valued, meaning to assign a number to them that represents what one thinks is a fair price. If the value assigned by the investor exceeds the price at which the security is trading in the market, the security is attractively priced and would suggest that the investor should buy the security. If the value assigned by the investor is below the price at which the security is trading in the market, the security is unattractively priced and would suggest that the investor should sell the security if they own it, short sell it if they do not own it, or simply not trade it at all.  

We now explain our motivation for writing Foundations of the Pricing of Financial Derivatives.  

# 1.1 MOTIVATION FOR THIS BOOK  

Many finance courses focus on valuing stocks and bonds. Yet, there is also another family of financial instruments known as derivatives, and valuing derivatives is one of the most technical subjects in finance. It requires not only setting up a model of the prices of assets that trade in the market but also establishing a means by which one can connect the derivative to the asset on which the derivative is based. There is a great deal of technical knowledge that must transfer from instructor to student. Much of that knowledge can seem cryptic and inaccessible, though that could be a bit of an overreaction from the fear of learning something new. However, those who know this subject reasonably well can easily fall into the trap of assuming that those who do not know this subject well should find the subject easy. That is the pitfall of being a scholar. A scholar thinks that material in which they have expertise in is not that difficult, when in fact, it really is quite challenging. What a scholar should do in conveying knowledge, however, is to recall how it was when they were learning it. In other words, putting oneself in the student’s shoes and empathizing with the student will result in the most successful learning environment. That is indeed one of the overriding objectives of this book: to teach some seemingly complex material in a very user-friendly way.  

For without a doubt, teaching and learning advanced material in finance is challenging to the instructor and to the student. Indeed, one of the greatest challenges for instructors in advanced graduate courses in finance is to cover a large body of highly technical information in a relatively short course of study. Well-prepared students make it a lot easier, but student preparation is often not at the desired level, and classes are frequently filled with students with varying degrees of preparation. In an ideal world, such students would have previously had courses in probability, calculus, linear algebra, coding, stochastic processes, econometrics, numerical analysis, non-parametric statistics, differential equations, microeconomics and macroeconomics, and last but certainly not least, finance. It is common for faculty members and students alike to complain that students are inadequately prepared for the technical rigors of advanced graduate study in finance. This book is an effort to address this problem by leveling the base of preparation.  

The degree of preparation of finance students is typically a function of the program in which the student is enrolled. Graduate study in finance can generally be done in one of three types of programs. One is an MBA, which usually comprises two years of study, the first consisting of a core set of business courses, of which a broad survey of finance is typically one component. The second year of an MBA is composed of a few required courses in general business but largely permits students to tailor their programs toward their specialized interests. Many students choose to take second-year courses in finance. The MBA is usually the marquee program at top-tier universities, a large money-maker, and is designed to draw students with degrees from all undergraduate disciplines. Hence, the first-year finance course starts at the very foundations of the subject with such topics as time value of money and discounted cash flow valuation, ultimately moving on to understanding financial markets, the relationship between risk and return, market efficiency, and corporate capital structure and dividend policy. Though some MBA students have technical backgrounds, most do not. Hence, MBA students will often struggle with advanced finance courses that are particularly quantitative.  

A second form of masters’ level study in finance is the specialized master’s degree in finance, often called an MS or master of science, and sometimes MSF for master of science in finance. Such a program provides concentrated graduate study in finance, typically over a period of one to two academic years. There may be certain core or required courses, and students are usually allowed to take electives in their preferred areas of finance. Students in this type of program will almost always have previously studied finance and will tend to have more technical backgrounds than the average MBA student.  

The third type of program in finance is the doctor of philosophy or PhD. This degree, requiring a minimum of four years, is an intensive research-oriented program that requires all students to achieve a high level of understanding of theoretical models and empirical research methods.1 It is here that the greatest problem lies in giving students a sufficient level of technical knowledge without sacrificing the time they need to devote to seminars in the various areas of finance. When students are accepted into PhD programs in finance, they are typically required to have a solid foundation in math. But, the definition of a “solid foundation in math” can vary, and merely taking some math courses and making good grades is not necessarily enough. Most finance PhD students, even those with strong math backgrounds, learn something new about math while in their PhD programs. Students who have been accepted into PhD programs are often advised to take more math courses before starting the program. They usually do, but it does not often help nearly as much as one might think.  

Let us be clear. Finance is not mathematics. Mathematics is a set of tools used in finance. But just as one cannot build furniture efficiently without knowledge of how to use tools, one cannot understand finance without having the necessary tools of mathematics.  

And, as noted, one of the most technical subjects in finance is derivative pricing theory. Sometimes it can be even difficult to keep terms straight because terms can mean different things in different settings. Throughout this book, we will use price and value interchangeably as is financial industry custom. Technically, the concept of price refers to the monetary amount that is exchanged when something is traded, irrespective of what one thinks the item is worth. Value refers to an instrument’s non-observed monetary amount as assigned by a market participant. The individual may or may not be using a formal mathematical model. Thus, technically, formal models in finance, such as the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (BSMOPM), should have been termed the capital asset valuation model (CAVM) and the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model (BSMOVM). Theoretical models are just a means of expressing one’s view on value. As we will see later, arbitrage activity typically moves observed market prices to the arbitrageur’s value. Hence, we will stick with financial industry custom even though value will always have higher levels of epistemic uncertainty when compared to the market price.  

Although the majority of finance faculty and PhD students will not specialize in derivatives, there is no doubt that a solid understanding of derivative pricing theory is an important element of doctoral-level education in finance. Derivative pricing theory, in particular the Black-Scholes-Merton model, has had a tremendous impact on finance. It has provided a framework for understanding not only standard derivatives, such as options, but also it has shown us that derivatives can explain many other topics and relationships in finance, such as callable bonds, convertible bonds, credit risk, and corporate capital structure. The impact of derivative pricing theory has been so great that Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1995 to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton with special recognition to the late Fischer Black for work on this subject. Yet, with the increasing need for students to take so many courses in econometrics and statistics, there is often little room in a doctoral program for such a course.  

Our goal is to introduce the vast financial derivatives markets to PhD students and others in hopes that it will stimulate your interest in research related to financial derivatives, as well as aid in your future research agenda, even if your agenda is not explicitly financial derivatives. By way of introduction, we present selected derivatives market prices in Table 1.1.2 Derivatives market prices are unique and often convey cloaked information. On completion of this book, you will be better able to rightfully interpret what information is and is not conveyed.  

Table 1.1 Panel A shows natural gas futures prices. Notice that the key descriptor is the delivery month. We denote the current year as Y1. Thus, the December Y1 last traded futures price is $\$2.896/\mathrm{MMBtu}$ (million British thermal units). Note that futures prices generally rise for longer maturities with the exception of September.3 The aggregate open interest is the number of either long or short positions currently outstanding. Each contract is for 10,000 MMBtu. Thus, the natural gas futures market currently represents 12,689,550,000 MMBtus.  

Table 1.1 Panel B shows option prices of the SPY, which is the exchange-traded fund of the S&P 500 Index. With options, the key descriptors are more complex requiring both the maturity date expressed in days to maturity here and strike price. For example, the 114-day call price with strike price $\$280$ share is $\$10.40$ share and the corresponding put price is $\$9.76$ share. Notice that with longer maturities, similar strike options have higher prices. Further, call prices decline for higher strike prices, whereas put prices rise for higher strike prices. You will learn why later in this book.  

Table 1.1 Panel C shows interest rate swap rates. For example, a five-year swap was quoted at $2.022\%$ . The mid fixed rate is the average of the bid and ask rate for the fixed leg of a fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. Notice that this fixed rate initially declines and then subsequently rises for longer maturities.4  

Table 1.1 Panel D shows 1-month secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) futures data.5 The data provided here are rate-based and hence show the implied interest rates rather than quoted prices. The interest rate is simply 100 minus the quoted price. For example, the November Y1 rate of 5.400 implies a quoted price of 94.600. Each SOFR futures contract is for $\$5,000,000$ notional amount on 1-month interest rates. At this point, just notice the aggregate open interest is 704,883. Open interest is the number of long contracts outstanding. Thus, the total number of contracts outstanding, representing both long and short positions as this is an exchange-traded contract, is $1,409766\ [=2(704,883)]$ .

As each contract is for $\$5,000,000$ notional, the aggregate notional amount represented by this one market is $\$7,048,830,000,000$ or over $\$7$ trillion. The notional amount or simply notional is the implied principal on which interest calculations are based. Thus, without explaining all this data in great detail, clearly the derivatives industry is large and involves numerous interesting complexities worthy of investigation.  

The purpose of this book is to provide detailed training in the pricing of financial derivatives in a lean and efficient manner. It endeavors to convey the mathematical foundations of derivative pricing theory in a compact way. And although there is a great deal of mathematical formality, it is far less so than there would be in a more formal mathematical course in the subject. There are many great books of that genre, but their audience is quite a bit different. Indeed, no pure mathematician or financial engineer will likely give this book much praise, and that is of no concern. It is not an attempt to turn the student into a quant. What it does attempt to do, however, is to take a finance PhD student who in all likelihood is not going to specialize in derivatives and give that person the foundational layers that will pay off in a better understanding of the role that derivatives play in finance. This book does not incorporate the latest advanced mathematical knowledge. Its goal is more modest: to lay a solid foundation in a lean and efficient manner.  

But enough about the book. Let us now begin to lay that foundation. A good place to start is to define a derivative.  

# 1.2 WHAT IS A DERIVATIVE?  

This book is about derivatives, so to get started we need to know just exactly what a derivative is. There is a very basic definition of a derivative that goes like this:  

A derivative is a financial instrument in which the payoff is derived from the value of some other asset.  

The payoff is the unknown future cash payment required by the derivative contract. This definition works relatively well, but there are situations in which it breaks down. It does this by encompassing instruments that most people would not consider derivatives. For example, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds derive their values from the securities they hold, and most people would not consider them derivatives.  

The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which is the accounting industry association that sets standards for financial accounting, has given us a good definition. In 1998, it created a new standard, which was called FAS (Financial Accounting Standard) 133 and is now called ASC (Accounting Standards Codification) 815, which laid out a new set of procedures for derivatives accounting. It provides a reasonably strong and more detailed definition, which is as follows:  

A derivative is a contract with one or more underlyings and one or more notional amounts. Its value changes as the value of the underlying changes. Its initial value is either zero or an amount smaller than that required by other transactions to obtain the same payoff. At expiration it settles either by delivery or an equivalent cash amount.  

As it turns out, this definition works relatively well but does leave out a bit. Note that the definition says that a derivative is a contract. Let us not forget that a contract is a legal document and enforceable by law. Though not mentioned in the definition, a contract has two parties, so perhaps we should add that there are two parties, and we should probably identify them. One party is the buyer of the derivative, sometimes called the long, whose wealth benefits when the value of the derivative increases. The long or buyer is also sometimes known as the holder, in particular when the derivative is an option. The opposite party is called the short, whose position benefits when the value of the derivative decreases. The short is the seller of the contract and is sometimes called the writer, particularly if the derivative is an option. These parties to whom we have been referring are also sometimes called counterparties. When we prepend the word counter, we are implying a relationship. Each party is counter to the other. For the most part, however, we can use the terms party or counterparty interchangeably.  

The ACS definition says that the derivative has an underlying, which can sometimes be an asset, such as a stock, bond, currency, or commodity, or it can be something else such as an interest rate.6 It can even have more than one underlying. The statement says that the value of the derivative changes with the value of the underlying, but note that it does not specify whether the value changes linearly or not (we shall see that there are both linear and nonlinear cases). The statement also mentions that the initial value of the derivative is either zero or a smaller amount than the value of the underlying, which implies that derivatives have a tremendous amount of leverage. One either invests no money or a smaller amount than would be required to obtain the equivalent exposure in the underlying. And as mentioned, at expiration, the derivative settles up either by delivering the underlying or by having one party, the long or short, exchange an equivalent cash amount with the other party, the corresponding short or long.  

The reference to a notional amount captures the requirement that a derivative is based on a certain amount of the underlying. This amount might be shares of stock, face value of bonds, units of currency, or, say, barrels of oil. We should also add that a derivative provides either a right or an obligation to engage in a transaction at a future date. Options provide a right, and forwards, futures, and swaps provide an obligation. We shall see what these points mean in later chapters.  

So, let us now try to rewrite the definition of a derivative. We shall also do a little paraphrasing to keep the accountants at bay.  

A derivative is a legally enforceable contract between two parties, the buyer or long and the seller or short, who has at least one underlying and a notional amount for each underlying. The value of the derivative changes with the value of the underlying(s). The initial amount of money one must put down to engage in the derivative contract is either zero or a smaller amount than required to obtain equivalent exposure in the underlying(s). When it expires, the derivative either settles by delivery of the underlying(s) or the parties exchange the cash equivalent.  

Alas, it is virtually impossible to give a one-sentence definition, but this four-sentence definition works quite well. As we get into the specifics of certain types of derivatives, we will have to add some features, but for now, we are set.  

Now that we have defined a derivative let us go back and contrast it with the market for the underlying. Oftentimes, one would just call this type of market the stock market, bond market, currency market, or commodity market. It is common in derivatives lingo to call the market for the underlying the spot market. This term refers to transactions that are done “on the spot,” meaning that one pays for it and receives it immediately.7  

This procedure contrasts with derivatives, which always refer to transactions that will be conducted in the future.  

So where are these things called derivatives? Well, they are created and traded in markets. There are two types of these markets, though the differences are becoming blurred. First, there are exchange-listed derivatives, sometimes called listed derivatives, which are standardized instruments that trade on exchanges. An exchange is an entity, usually in the form of a corporation or nonprofit, that provides a physical or electronic facility for trading. When we think of an exchange, we tend to think of something like the New York Stock Exchange, but derivatives exchanges also exist, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Also, derivatives can trade on exchanges that are more known as stock exchanges, such as Euronext and the Korea Exchange.  

What we mean by the notion of standardized instruments is that the exchanges have decided on most of the terms and conditions, such as which underlyings will have derivatives available for trade, when these derivatives will expire, and how many units of the underlying are covered by a single derivative contract. There are also other terms that are germane to certain types of derivatives that are specified by the exchange. What the exchange does not specify, however, is the price, which is negotiated between the parties on each trade.  

An exchange also has rules as to who can trade on the exchanges, and it provides clearing services, which references a system of bookkeeping that matches the counterparties and ensures that the money passes from one party to the other as appropriate. The exchanges also ensure that the parties that make money will always be paid, with the funds coming from the parties that lose money. The exchange guarantees that if the parties losing money cannot pay the parties making money, the exchange will cover through its clearinghouse. In this way, exchanges provide a guaranty that essentially eliminates credit risk.  

The other type of derivative is the over-the-counter, sometimes called OTC, or customized derivative, which trades in an informal market. This type of transaction is essentially one between any two parties that is not conducted on an exchange. As such, the parties can customize the transaction with any terms and conditions they want, as long as they do not break a law. Corporations commonly create derivatives with their banks to manage various risks they face.  

Derivatives markets, whether exchanges or over-the-counter, rely on a set of firms or individuals called dealers. Dealers stand ready to take either side of a derivative. They do this by quoting a bid price, the price they are willing to pay, and an ask price, the price they are demanding to sell. The ask is higher than the bid, so the dealer has a profit built into the quote. Thus, the investor has a built-in loss as the investor must buy high at the ask price and sell low at the bid. When a dealer takes on a transaction, it has acquired exposure; however, it does not generally carry that exposure, which would be risking its own survival on market direction. Instead, it lays off the risk by finding an offsetting transaction elsewhere in the market. Dealers are, thus, wholesalers of risk. They can easily do virtually any transaction in any market, quickly, and with low cost.  

# 1.3 OPTIONS VERSUS FORWARDS, FUTURES, AND SWAPS  

There are two general classes of derivatives that are distinguished by the fact that one class has payoffs that are linear in the underlying, while the other has payoffs that are nonlinear in the underlying. The former are forwards, futures, and swaps. Their payoffs are linearly related to the underlying in that the relationship between what the derivative pays when it expires and the value of the underlying is the same for any value of the underlying. Note that we are not saying that the payoff is the same for any value of the underlying. We are saying that the relationship is the same. This means that we can write the payoff function of the derivative as a linear function of the value of the underlying.  

Derivative instruments whose payoffs are linear—forwards, futures, and swaps—are also known as symmetric instruments. A symmetric instrument is one in which the payoff for a given change in the underlying is the same in absolute value as the payoff if the underlying changes by the same magnitude but in the opposite direction. For example, if the underlying moves up by 5 and the derivative payoff is 10, then a move of $-5$ will result in a payoff of $-10$ . The up-front cost to enter into a forward or swap is zero. You essentially pay for the large gains by bearing the risk of large losses.  

Options compose the family known as nonlinear derivatives. For them, the payoff of the derivative and the value of the underlying are not related in a linear manner, so we cannot write the payoff function as a linear function. As we shall see, however, they are related in what we call a piece-wise linear manner, meaning that the relationship is linear over one range of the underlying but different over another. You can think of that description as a straight line with one slope connected to another straight line with a different slope. We shall get into the details of what these explanations mean in later chapters.  

Derivative instruments with payoffs that are nonlinear—options and other option-like instruments—are also known as asymmetric instruments, because the payoffs are not symmetric. That is, the payoff for a given move in the underlying is not equivalent in absolute value to the payoff for the same move in the opposite direction of the underlying. So, for example, if the underlying goes up by 5 and the derivative pays 10, a move of $-5$ will not result in a payoff of $-10$ on the derivative. The cost to enter an asymmetric instrument is nonzero. You essentially pay for the large gains by paying the price, also called a premium, up front or you bear the risk of large losses by receiving this price or premium up front.  

This book will start with options. In fact, most of the book is really about options, because as it turns out, options are far more difficult to model than are forwards, futures, and swaps. Everything we know about options will apply to forwards, futures, and swaps, but we shall not need to go to such mathematical lengths to derive our models for those instruments. For the most part, their models are obtained by simple present value calculations.  

# 1.4 SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES MARKETS  

The derivatives market is massive in size and global in scope. Measuring the overall size of the derivatives markets, however, is a bit difficult. Generally, derivatives markets are broken down into the over-the-counter (OTC) markets and exchange-traded markets. The OTC markets are typically measured by either notional amount or gross market value. Recall the notional amount, or notional for short, reflects the characteristic that a derivative is based on a certain amount of the underlying. This amount might be shares of stock, face value of bonds, units of currency, barrels of oil, and so forth. Gross market value is the current absolute value of one side of the derivatives position. The overall gross market value of derivatives is zero because for every long position there has to be a short position. The exchange-traded derivatives markets is generally measured with either open interest or trading volume.  

Each measure has its advantages and disadvantages. The notional amount is a number that grossly overstates the amount of money that is transacted or at risk. Derivative payments are based on the notional amount, but most derivatives do not involve paying the notional itself. The notional amount, however, is a fairly accurate number, because it is written into the contracts. Market value, however, must be estimated either from market prices, from educated guesses, or from using models. Yet, market value reflects more accurately the amount of money at risk. Most of this book is about estimating market value.  

Figure 1.1 Panel A presents the notional amount of OTC derivatives outstanding approximately the decade before and after the global financial crisis of 2008–2009. Clearly, the global financial crisis starting in 2008 significantly affected the growth of the OTC market. The gross market value illustrated in Figure 1.1 Panel B shows a spike in December 2008 that reflects the significant gyrations in all world markets, and the subsequent declines indicate a move out of OTC derivatives. Figure 1.1 Panel C illustrates the exchange-traded open interest. The rise in recent years reflects the push by regulatory bodies for more centralized clearing in response to the global financial crisis. In summary, the size of the derivatives market, measured in hundreds of trillions of dollars, warrants further investigation.  

Table 1.2 Panel A presents annual volume by region expressed as a percentage of total volume for a recent year based on information provided by the Futures Industry Association. North America and Asia Pacific have gone back and forth in ranking between number one and number two for a while, but the Asia Pacific region now dominates. Table 1.2 Panel B shows the volume by category for the same year. Equity and equity index derivatives dominate the rankings. Foreign exchange and interest rates are generally next in the rankings. Thus, the derivatives markets span the globe as well as span numerous underlying instruments.

Thus, the derivatives industry is truly global and massive in size. Techniques to value and manage derivatives have now affected every facet of finance. Within the three broad categories of finance—investments, corporate finance, and financial services—mastery of financial derivatives valuation and management methodologies enhances one’s capacities to solve financial challenges. Derivatives are so pervasive that it is common to find financial analysis problems that are more accurately understood from a derivatives perspective. For example, in project finance, you often find embedded options, such as the option to terminate a project or extend it. In investments, you often encounter embedded options in callable and convertible instruments. In fact, a common stock can be analyzed as a call option on the firm. Finally, banks often deal with implicit options, such as from loans that can be prepaid to deposits containing early withdrawal possibilities. Thus, if you hang out in the derivatives world for a while, you will also find it hard to name a finance issue that does not benefit from derivatives knowledge.  

# 1.5 OUTLINE AND FEATURES OF THE BOOK  

This book is divided into seven parts, each of which contains between two and seven chapters. Beyond this first chapter, the structure is as follows:  

Part I: Basic Foundations for Derivative Pricing Chapter 2: Boundaries, Limits, and Conditions on Option Prices Chapter 3. Elementary Review of Mathematics for Finance  

Chapter 4: Elementary Review of Probability for Finance Chapter 5: Financial Applications of Probability Distributions Chapter 6: Basic Concepts in Valuing Risky Assets and Derivatives   
Part II: Discrete Time Derivatives Pricing Theory Chapter 7: The Binomial Model Chapter 8: Calculating the Greeks in the Binomial Model Chapter 9: Convergence of the Binomial Model to the Black-Scholes-Merton Model   
Part III: Continuous Time Derivatives Pricing Theory Chapter 10: The Basics of Brownian Motion and Wiener Processes Chapter 11: Stochastic Calculus and Itô’s Lemma Chapter 12: Properties of the Lognormal and Normal Diffusion Processes fo Modeling Assets Chapter 13: Deriving the Black-Scholes-Merton Model Chapter 14: The Greeks in the Black-Scholes-Merton Model Chapter 15: Girsanov’s Theorem in Option Pricing Chapter 16: Connecting Discrete and Continuous Brownian Motions   
Part IV: Extensions and Generalizations of Derivative Pricing Chapter 17: Applying Linear Homogeneity Rule to Option Pricing Chapter 18: Compound Option Pricing Chapter 19: American Call Option Pricing Chapter 20: American Put Option Pricing Chapter 21: Min-Max Option Pricing Chapter 22: Pricing Forwards, Futures, and Options on Forwards and Futures

Part VI: Interest Rate Derivatives Chapter 25: The Term Structure of Interest Rates Chapter 26: Interest Rate Contracts: Forward Rate Agreements, Swaps, and Options Chapter 27: Fitting an Arbitrage-Free Term Structure Model Chapter 28: Pricing Fixed-Income Securities and Derivatives Using an ArbitrageFree Binomial Tree   
Part VII: Miscellaneous Topics Chapter 29: Option Prices and the Prices of State-Contingent Claims Chapter 30: Option Prices and Expected Returns Chapter 31: Implied Volatility and the Volatility Smile Chapter 32: Pricing Foreign Currency Options  

As previously suggested, the book does contain many equations. Some are numbered, and some are not. The ones that are not numbered are generally intermediate stages of a derivation, but if those equations need to be referenced later, then they are numbered. An effort is made to provide supporting actual examples in practice as well as illustrated calculations. Most of the calculations you would do from these models are fairly simple. A few end-of-chapter problems are provided so you can confirm your understanding of the basic concepts. Equations showing calculations are typically not numbered.  

A technical book such as this one employs a large number of symbols. Every effort has been made to use symbols in a unique manner, but some replication is inevitable. For example, $p$ is an excellent symbol for probability but also an excellent symbol for the price of a put. The lower case $d$ is an excellent symbol for the down factor in the binomial model, but it is widely used as a factor in the Black-Scholes-Merton model, in the form $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ . The Greek letter rho with the symbol $\rho$ is commonly used for correlation but rho is also a partial derivative of the Black-Scholes-Merton model. The letter $X$ is often a variable in mathematics, but it is commonly used as the exercise price of an option. Tolerance for symbol duplication is a necessary evil in material of this sort. Symbols must, therefore, be context specific. There should never be a situation in which a symbol takes on two meanings in the same context.  

# 1.6 FINAL THOUGHTS AND PREVIEW  

Although your relatives might disagree, the study of finance and in particular financial derivatives is fascinating. If you do not believe this, take a look at Bernstein (1992, 1996, 2007), Mehrling (2005), Derman (2004), and Taleb (2001, 2007), all of which are highly readable books directed to the general public that give interesting insights into the body of human knowledge about the subject we call finance. You will find that the study of finance reveals profound insights into the behavior of people as they endeavor to grow their wealth. Studying finance does not provide a road to riches, but it does provide useful guidelines that can tilt the odds in favor of the investor, even the small investor who may feel out of their league.  

The study of finance will challenge you as much as just about any subject ever has. Perhaps you should think of it as a rollercoaster ride. There is an uphill part, and there may be several. But there is also a downhill part that will be found when subjects begin to make sense because a strong foundation has been laid. There may even be thrills and chills that will leave you exhilarated when it is all over. If you have come this far in your education, please do not fear the ride that awaits, as this book will hold your hand for the duration.  

As noted, most of this book will deal with options. In Chapter 2, we shall more formally introduce the concept of an option and identify certain boundaries, limits, and conditions on option prices. These statements are not pricing models. They are simply general statements to which the pricing models must conform, or investors would exploit them until prices adjust and do conform. They tell us the ground rules within which we must operate and show us why these rules exist.  

So, let us get started.  

# QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS  

1 What is money?  

2 What is at the core activity of finance?  

3 Provide a working definition of a financial derivative.  

4 Contrast a symmetric derivative instrument with an asymmetric derivative instrument.  

5 Contrast exchange-listed derivatives with over-the-counter derivatives.  

6 “Finance is mathematics.” Evaluate and explain whether this statement is true or false.  

# NOTES  

1. There is yet another type of graduate finance program, which is the masters’ or doctorate in financial mathematics, quantitative finance, or financial engineering. These programs are usually conducted in engineering or math departments and schools, and they are designed to train students to become specialists in the subject. This book deals with the same topics as do those programs, but its audience is different.   
2. The data are based on information provided by Bloomberg® on May 29, 2019.   
3. We will explore explanations for this pattern in Chapter 22.   
4. See Chapter 26 for more details on interpreting patterns in swap rates.   
5. In 2023, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) was phased out. In terms of trading volume, the LIBOR-related Eurodollar futures contract was the most successful futures contract ever launched. SOFR replaced LIBOR.   
6. Note that the use of the word underlying is grammatically incorrect. Underlying is a participle, which is a noun or verb that is used as an adjective, and therefore must modify a noun. In the world of derivatives, however, the word underlying is used as a noun. Words often enter the English language through the highway of finance, and they do not always conform to the correct rules of the language, but they become good examples of the dynamic nature of the English language. Incidentally, the term underlier is also sometimes used.  

7. Another term for the spot market is the cash market.
