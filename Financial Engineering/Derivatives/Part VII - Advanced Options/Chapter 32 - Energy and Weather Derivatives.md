# Energy and Weather Derivatives  

# Aims  

• To outline the main types of energy and weather derivatives.   
• To show how energy derivatives are used for speculation and hedging ‘price risk’.   
• To show how weather derivatives are used to hedge ‘volume risk’ of energy producers and users.   
• To discuss the use of catastrophe bonds.  

There are large oil reserves in a number of countries around the globe, most noticeably the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (e.g. the Middle East, Venezuela, Nigeria, etc.) and Russia, who together control about $60\%$ of the world’s oil reserves. Russia also has huge natural gas reserves.  

Energy prices such as oil and natural gas are highly volatile. This means that large energy suppliers (e.g. in oil exploration and re!neries such as BP, Shell, Exxon Mobile) and users of energy (e.g. airlines, transport, and manufacturing companies) face considerable uncertainty about the price they will receive or pay for energy in the future. To mitigate such price risk, consumers and producers can use either over-the-counter (OTC) or exchange traded energy contracts such as forwards, futures, options, and swaps. These ‘commodity derivatives’ are widely used in the energy sector – some are cash settled and some involve physical delivery of the underlying commodity. Electricity is a little diferent to oil and natural gas since it cannot be stored but its price can also vary tremendously on an hourly basis and derivatives contracts on electricity are also available.  

The weather, in the form of abnormally high or low temperatures afects many industries. These include !rms who have substantial heating costs in winter or costs of air conditioning in summer, the leisure sector (hotels, ski resorts) and the agricultural sector (e.g. crop growers, vineyards, and orange growers). Abnormal variations in temperature can afect the volume of output produced by these industries which in turn afects their pro!ts. However, derivative contracts based on ‘temperature’ can be used to mitigate these risks due to unforeseen ‘volume efects’.  

There are also weather derivatives based on the number of frost days in a month or the depth of snowfall at particular locations. Because the revenues and costs of various industries (e.g. fower growers, municipal authorities, and not least, ski resorts) are afected by frost and snowfall, weather derivatives can be used to mitigate the impact of abnormal levels of snow and frost-days, on the output of these sectors.  

In life there is always the possibility of an unusually large natural catastrophe even though this may have a relatively low probability of occurrence – for example, very severe hurricanes, foods and earthquakes. Insurance claims against such events could cause a speci!c insurance company to go into liquidation, so there is a need to spread such risks across many participants – so called catastrophe (CAT) bonds are one way of doing this.  

In this chapter we examine how derivatives are used to hedge (or insure) against price volatility found in spot energy markets and how weather derivatives are used to mitigate changes in pro!ts which result from changes in the volume of output (e.g. in agriculture, energy supply and the hotel and leisure sectors), caused by abnormal changes in the weather.  

# 32.1 ENERGY CONTRACTS  

We will not give an exhaustive account of energy derivatives but instead concentrate on the main features of these contracts, so you get a favour of what is on ofer. There has been an active OTC and exchange-traded market in oil products since the early 1980s. OTC forward contracts set a known !xed price today, for future delivery at speci!c delivery points. Futures and options contracts are traded on crude oil and its re!ned products, gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel. The key exchanges trading these contracts are the New York Mercantile Exchange, (NYMEX), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the International Commodities Exchange (ICE) in London. Traded options contracts are usually written on the futures price rather than the cash market (spot) price and are therefore ‘futures options’ – but we largely ignore this nuance in this chapter.  

One crude oil futures contract is for delivery of 1,000 barrels, while one jet fuel, heating oil or gasoline futures contract is for delivery of 42,000 gallons (equivalent to 1,000 barrels). Some contracts require physical delivery (e.g. light sweet crude oil futures on NYMEX) while others must be cash settled (e.g. Brent crude oil futures on ICE, Gulf Coast Jet Fuel on CME) and do not allow delivery.  

It is only recently that futures and option contracts on jet fuel have been introduced on CME. These trade Sunday to Friday 6 p.m.–5 p.m. on the Globex platform, with a 60-minute break each day (beginning at 5 p.m.). Monthly contracts are available for 36 consecutive months and one contract is for delivery of 42,000 gallons. These are ‘average price’ futures contracts as the foating price for each futures contract month is the arithmetic average of the daily high and low (‘Platts’ jet fuel) spot prices averaged over each business day in the month. Gulf Coast Jet Fuel options are European and also have a payof which depends on the average price over the month – so they are Asian average price options.  

There is also the possibility of avoiding delivery arrangements set by the exchange and instead using ‘exchange of futures for physicals’ (EFP) arrangements, prior to maturity. This is simply a bilateral agreement about location and price, for delivery between the party with the long futures position and the party with (an equal contract size) short position. The futures exchange (clearing house) must be noti!ed of the EFP arrangement and the futures positions for both parties are then terminated. EFP might be used when the long wants delivery at a speci!c location that is diferent from that stipulated in the futures contract – if it cost more in transportation and insurance costs to deliver to the long’s desired location then the holder of the long futures position will pay an additional cash amount to the trader holding a short position.  

There are also OTC and exchange traded contracts on natural gas. Delivery is ‘through the pipe’ at a speci!c geographical location, at a speci!c uniform rate through the month. The seller of natural gas (e.g. short futures position) is responsible for delivery at a speci!c delivery point, for example at the Henry Hub gas interconnector (in Louisiana) or at Zeebrugge (in Belgium) – a key European hub. The supplier of gas might be a separate company to the producer of the gas – particularly in deregulated gas markets such as the USA and UK. NYMEX and ICE trade futures (and options) contracts which (if not closed out) require physical delivery of 10,000 million British thermal units (mbtu) of natural gas. Of course, if you go to delivery and you need your gas in Boston, then you had better make sure you have purchased capacity in the pipe between the Louisiana delivery hub and Boston – because the pipe might be full! Options and swaps on natural gas are also available in the OTC market.  

The electricity market is a bit diferent to oil and gas, as electricity cannot be stored. (Technically you can store it in a battery but this might require a very large battery.) In the US and UK electricity is produced primarily in gas-!red, coal-!red, and nuclear plants. The latter provide the base load and extra demand is met by gas and coal-!red plants (and some by wind turbines and solar). The transmission of electricity is costly and there are also transmission losses to consider, over long distances. So, electricity in the US is provided !rst to a speci!c region and any excess can then be sold in the wholesale market. Spikes in electricity consumption can be triggered by abnormally high temperatures in summer (particularly in the US where air conditioning is widely used) or abnormally low temperatures in winter. So there is considerable volatility in electricity prices on a daily basis.  

There are active markets in the US and UK in OTC forwards, options and swaps on electricity prices and NYMEX and ICE trade a futures contract on the price of electricity. The contracts allow one party to receive a speci!ed number of megawatt hours, at a speci!ed price and location, during a particular month. For example, this could be a $5\times8$ contract, for Monday to Friday only during of-peak hours $\operatorname{11}{\mathfrak{p}}.{\mathfrak{m}}$ . to 7 a.m.) within a speci!ed month.  

There is also a $5\times16$ contract for peak hours (7 a.m. to $11{\mathrm{~p.m.}}$ ) from Monday to Friday or a $7\times24$ contract for delivery over 24 hours, for 7 days.  

With an option contract on electricity you have precisely that – an option to take delivery at the strike price $K$ or not. If the contract is for daily exercise, then with one day’s notice you can choose whether you want to take delivery of electricity at a price $K$ , for the next day. For an option with monthly exercise, you make a decision at the beginning of the month whether you will take delivery of electricity each day at the strike price $K$ .  

In electricity and natural gas derivatives markets you can also be a ‘swinger’. You can purchase a swing option (also called a take-and-pay option). For an ‘electric swinger’, the option holder sets a maximum and minimum amount of power she will take on each day during a speci!c month and a maximum and minimum over the whole month. Each megawatt taken is at the strike price, K. You can then ‘swing’ the amount of power you choose to take each day (within the bounds set), although there is also usually a limit on the number of days on which you can change your rate of daily consumption.  

At this point it is also worth mentioning another market which is likely to be of increasing importance in the future – carbon trading. This is a market where permits can be purchased by !rms wanting to increase their output of greenhouse gases. The supply of permits is provided by !rms who have been given an allocation of permits which exceed their output of greenhouse gases (see Finance Blog 32.1).  

# Finance Blog 32.1 Carbon Trading  

Going green seems to be catching on. We have recycling of household rubbish, supermarkets charging for plastic bags or providing their customers with ‘bags for life’, houses with wind turbines and solar panels and holidaymakers paying to ofset the carbon emissions of air travel. On a bigger scale we have the Kyoto, Paris, and Katowice conferences to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. What methods are available for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industry?  

One method is to tax emissions. The problem here is that you have to set the tax rate at a level you think will achieve your emissions target but given the technological complexities involved, you could set the tax rate too high or too low, thus undershooting or overshooting your target.  

The method which seems to have the most adherents is carbon trading. This usually afects sectors such as power-generation, cement, ceramics, steel and paper industries. However, it is noticeable that the scheme does not cover air transport. The scheme works by setting allocations for emissions for each !rm in the scheme. Firms which emit less than their allocation can sell the unused portion of their permits to the extreme polluters, via exchanges in London and Chicago. Although the US did not sign up to Kyoto it has a similar permit scheme limiting carbon dioxide, sulphur and nitrogen oxide emissions. In Europe it has been argued that the initial carbon permit allocation was too generous, so the price of carbon permits in the market was low and this provided little incentive for !rms to curb their emissions.  

It has been suggested that permits should not be allocated by government decree but should be auctioned. The higher the market price set when trading the permits, the higher the costs of pollution for speci!c !rms and the greater incentive they have to innovate with clean technology or simply to reduce !nal output. Total carbon dioxide emissions are therefore set by the scheme but their allocation across !rms is set by the market. At the moment, trading environmental permits are available in spot markets and on NYMEX there are futures and futures options on various spot market traded indices of pollution (e.g. CO2 emissions).

# 32.2 HEDGING WITH ENERGY FUTURES  

# 32.2.1 Running an Airline  

Suppose you own a medium-size US airline ‘EasyFly’ and your marketing manager has told you the ticket prices you will be charging on all your routes, based on maintaining your competitive position in the market. If jet fuel remains at its current level it is estimated that EasyFly will make a handsome pro!t over the next 3 years. But that is a big ‘if’, in today’s volatile oil market. If EasyFly does nothing and jet fuel remains at its current level (or falls) you will be a happy CEO and your shareholders will be smiling too. But if jet fuel rises in price, then despite all your eforts on the technical side (reliability, customer service, maintenance, staf costs, etc.) EasyFly will end up with lower pro!ts and you may lose your job as CEO.  

Here we demonstrate the use of a cross hedge so we assume EasyFly hedges some or all of its projected jet fuel costs, using heating oil (HO) futures contracts (traded on NYMEX) rather than futures on jet fuel prices. Since EasyFly fears a rise in spot jet fuel prices in the future it should go long (buy) heating oil futures today. If spot jet fuel prices do rise over the next year, so will the futures price on heating oil and EasyFly can close out its HO-futures contracts on NYMEX at a pro!t – the latter ofsets the higher cost of EasyFly’s spot jet fuel.  

What practical issues are involved? EasyFly has to decide what quantity $Q$ (gallons) of fuel to hedge and then calculate the appropriate number of futures contracts for each month:  

$$
N_{F}=\frac{M o n e t a r y\:\nu a l u e\:t o\:b e\:h e d g e d\:(=Q\times S)}{C o n t r a c t\:s i z e\times S}\times\beta=\frac{Q}{C o n t r a c t\:s i z e}\times\beta
$$  

Beta $\beta$ , is the slope of a (OLS) regression with the change in the spot price of jet fuel as the dependent variable and the change in the futures price of heating oil as the independent variable. In practice either of the following equations are used to estimate beta: $\Delta S=\alpha+\beta\Delta F$ , or $\Delta S/S=\alpha+\beta(\Delta F/F)$ . Since heating oil and jet fuel prices correspond to diferent ‘commodities’ this is a ‘cross hedge’.  

As you have to estimate the relationship between these two price changes, your hedge will be less than perfect – this is basis risk. However, over short horizons of say 1 year, the correlation coe\$cient (and ‘beta’) between changes in heating oil and jet fuel prices is quite high (the beta is around 0.9) and is reasonably stable over time – so, on average your hedge will work.  

But basis risk is also afected by changes in the convenience yield, that is, the premium that holders of heating oil place on having the ‘physical’ heating oil available to satisfy their normal customers – this can cause a divergence between changes in the spot and futures prices at particular periods and could lead to an increase in the hedging error.  

Suppose in January EasyFly decides to hedge 2 million gallons of jet fuel for each of the months of April, May, and June. The contract size for heating oil futures is 42,000 gallons (equivalent to 1,000 barrels) hence the number of futures contracts for each month of the hedge is 47.6 (48). So in January EasyFly goes long 48-April, 48-May, and 48-June contracts – taken together this is referred to as a strip hedge.  

If EasyFly closes out each contract just before its maturity date this will provide a reasonably good hedge – any gains/losses on the futures contracts will closely ofset any increased/lower costs of the spot jet fuel in April, May, and June. Efectively, EasyFly ‘locks in’ a known average purchase price for jet fuel, approximately given by the average of the current quoted futures prices in January for the April, May, and June futures contracts. EasyFly will not take delivery in the futures contracts because it requires physical jet fuel (at various airports around the country) and the futures contract it has used delivers heating oil to New York Harbour – also, planes don’t fy well on heating oil!  

# 32.2.2 Caps and Floors  

The futures hedge ‘locks in’ a known efective price for jet fuel but does not allow Easyfy to gain from lower jet fuel prices should they occur. What if EasyFly wanted to set a cap (upper limit) on future jet fuel costs but also wanted to bene!t from lower jet fuel prices should they occur?  

Suppose the current spot price of jet fuel on 15 January is $S_{0}=\$1.9$ per gallon and EasyFly will purchase jet fuel on 15 April in the cash market (e.g. at Atlanta airport). We know from earlier chapters that to set a maximum price payable, EasyFly needs to purchase a (European) call option (on jet fuel) at a speci!c strike price, $K_{c}=\$2.2$ per gallon (say), with an expiration date $T=15\mathrm{{April}^{1}}$ .  

On 15 April, if jet fuel prices turn out to be high $(S_{T}>K_{c})$ and the option is cash settled, EasyFly receives cash of $S_{T}-K_{c}$ . Hence, even though the spot price of the jet fuel EasyFly buys is high, the net cost of purchasing fuel on 15 April is $S_{T}-(S_{T}-K_{c})=K_{c}$ , so EasyFly efectively ends up paying a maximum price of $K_{c}=\$2.2$ (plus the cost of the call option premium). On the other hand, if the spot price of fuel turns out to be low (say $S_{T}=\$1.7$ per gallon) on 15 April, then EasyFly ‘throws away’ the call option (i.e. does not exercise the option) and buys fuel at the low spot price of $\$1.7$ (at Atlanta airport). For the insurance that the option provides, EasyFly has to pay the call premium $c$ on 15 January.  

The call option caps EasyFly’s maximum payment for fuel at $K_{c}$ for a specifc month in the future – it is a caplet. If EasyFly wants to purchase fuel over several months ahead, then it need a series of calls – all with the same strike – but with diferent maturity dates, which match the dates of EasyFly’s future spot purchases of fuel. This requires a strip of caplets, which are collectively known as a cap and are provided OTC by large banks and other !nancial institutions.  

It should be fairly obvious that if you are a supplier of jet fuel (e.g. Exxon Mobile) and hold large physical reserves, then what you are worried about is a fall in the price of jet fuel, in the future. You can insure a foor value for your future jet fuel sales by buying a put option with strike $K_{p}=\$1.6$ say – this will guarantee you receive at least $\$1.6$ per gallon for your oil in the future. Of course if spot prices rise $S_{T}>K_{p}$ , Exxon Mobile ‘throws away’ the put and simply sells its fuel at the high spot price. In these circumstances the put is (not surprisingly) known as a foorlet and a strip of puts is $a$ foor.  

The advantage of the put is that it gives Exxon Mobile the bene!t of selling its jet fuel at high spot prices should they occur but also guarantees a foor price of $K_{p}=\$1.6$ should spot fuel prices fall sharply. In contrast, hedging a fall in fuel prices using a short futures position locks in the price you will pay in the future, so you cannot take advantage of lower spot fuel prices, should this occur.  

# 32.2.3 Collar  

Go back to the example of EasyFly that capped the price of its future purchases of fuel by buying a call with a strike, $K_{c}=\$2.2$ . But buying the call may be expensive. Today, on 15 January EasyFly could ofset some of the cost of the call premium $c$ , by selling a put (with strike price $K_{p}<K_{c})$ and receiving the put premium $P$ . If EasyFly, who will purchase fuel in the future, undertakes a ‘buy call-sell put’ position then this is known as a collar (and if the call and put premia exactly ofset each other it is known as a zero-cost collar). We know what happens if fuel prices rise, the call sets the maximum efective cost of fuel purchases at $K_{c}$ . But what happens if fuel prices fall substantially?  

If the airline had not sold the put, it would directly bene!t from very low spot prices $S_{T}$ . But if EasyFly has sold a put and if $S_{T}<K_{p}$ on 15 April, it will have to pay out $(K_{p}-S_{T})$ to the holder (buyer) of the put. If $S_{T}<K_{p}$ , the efective cost of fuel for EasyFly is equal to the spot price of fuel plus Easyfy’s cash payout on the put $=S_{T}+(K_{p}-S_{T})=K_{p}$ . Hence if $K_{p}=\$1.6$ , the minimum efective cost of the fuel by the airline will be $\$1.6$ per gallon (even if spot fuel prices are below $\$1.6$ . So if EasyFly has to purchase airline fuel in the future and it also undertakes a collar trade, it will cap its efective cost at an upper level $K_{c}=\$2.2$ , but also set a foor level it will pay for fuel of $K_{p}=\$1.6$ . (Note that for the above to work as described, $K_{p}<K_{c}$ .)

FIGURE 32.1 Collar trade by airline  

The efective cost (ignoring the cost of the call and the put) of the jet fuel to EasyFly is given in Figure 32.1. If the spot price turns out to be between $K_{p}=\$1.6$ and $K_{c}=\$2.2$ , say $S_{T}=\$1.8$ then neither of the options is in-the-money and EasyFly purchases fuel at the spot price of $\$1.8$ .  

The key outcome of a collar trade for EasyFly is that it sets a maximum $\left(K_{c}=\$2.2\right)$ and minimum price $(K_{p}=\$1.6)$ for fuel paid by the airline.  

# 32.3 ENERGY SWAPS  

We have already discussed interest rate and currency swaps in previous chapters. Now we examine how the energy sector might use swaps to ofset any price risks they face. Suppose in January a company such as Centrica in the UK agrees to supply natural gas (NG) to a large industrial customer-ABC (e.g. manufacturing !rm) at a !xed price $S(f i x)$ , every month for a 6-month period beginning on 1 January. Centrica decides it will buy the gas in the spot market at whatever price it has to pay at the time of purchase (i.e. it pays a ‘foating price’, $S(f l o a t)$ to the gas producer who supplies the gas via the European hub at Zeebrugge in Belgium) – Figure 32.2.  

Clearly, if the spot price of gas rises, the pro!t margin of Centrica will be squeezed (and it may even be committed to supplying the gas at a loss if the spot price in Zeebrugge S foat rises above $S(f i x)$ . How can it ofset this price risk without renegotiating any of its existing contracts with its customers? It can undertake a receive-!xed, pay-foating swap from a swap dealer where $S(f l o a t)$ is the foating price used and $X$ is the agreed !xed price (see the left-hand side of Figure 32.2). $X$ is the swap rate. If the spot price of NG in Zeebrugge $S_{T}(f l o a t)$ at the end of any month is higher than $X$ then Centrica receives a cash payment of $S_{T}(f l o a t)-X$ from the swap dealer. If Centrica buys gas in the cash market at $S_{T}(f l o a t)$ , then the efective cost of Centrica’s gas purchases is:  

$$
{\mathrm{gas}}=S_{T}(f l o a t)-\{S_{T}(f l o a t)-X\}=X
$$  

![](8bfa35c275d647db6bf19c6c861c3b14ecc1233e1c6925633c90b00155a54135.jpg)  
FIGURE 32.2 Natural gas – !xed for foating swap  

Only the LHS of this diagram is the swap. Centrica must ensure that $S(\mathfrak{f i x})>X$ before taking on the swap  

The net result is that Centrica receives $S(f i x)$ from its industrial customers and pays the swap dealer $X$ . As long as $S(f i x)$ is greater than $X$ , Centrica will have locked in a !xed pro!t margin of $S(f i x)-X$ on 1 January, on each unit of NG supplied over the next 6 months.  

There are other important elements to the swap deal. There will be a notional quantity $Q$ of NG in the swap, for example this might be $Q=1$ million mbtu per day and the ‘tenor’ of the swap could be every month from January to June. The swap payments to Centrica would then be:  

Swap payments each month to Centrica $\b=$ 1 million days S foat X where ‘days’ $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ number of days in the month. The swap contract may be cash settled each month and it is then a ‘contract for diferences’ as only the net cash payment is made by one of the parties to the swap contract. If, in any month:  

$S(f l o a t)>X$ , then Centrica receives cash from the swap dealer.  

$S(f l o a t)<X$ , then Centrica pays cash to the swap dealer.  

The foating index $S(f l o a t)$ will have to be decided upon and this spot price often goes under rather strange names; for example, for the Centrica deal it might be the ‘front of month inside FERC’ index. In fact, the foating payment S foat you receive from the swap dealer is based on the ‘front of month’ (FOM) price but Centrica might buy its NG at spot prices throughout the month, so there is some residual price risk remaining.  

# 32.3.1 Pricing the Swap  

The !xed price $X$ for NG (say) quoted in the swap is the ‘swap rate’ and will vary depending on the maturity of the swap deal – so diferent swap rates will be quoted for 1-year, 2-year, . . etc. swaps. Broadly speaking, the swap rate $X$ is an average of the forward prices for NG over the life of the swap – in terms of jargon, ‘the swap is priced of the forward curve’ (i.e. forward prices of NG at diferent maturities – see Figure 32.3).  

![](f789c08c3ea16ad9a0672b6e3c1d1663d2c4c33760f83ee765307d3e5e8692d9.jpg)  
FIGURE 32.3 Pricing a commodity swap  

The foating cash fows in the swap depend on future spot prices and our best guess (at $t=0$ ) of these prices are the current quoted forward prices, $F_{k}$ . The notional volume in the swap contract $V o l_{k}$ can be diferent in diferent months. The risk-free discount rate is $d_{k}=e^{-r_{k}t_{k}}$ – using continuously compounded rates. The swap is priced at inception so that it has zero value to both parties:  

Expected Present value of foating receipts accruing time- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot k=V o l_{k}F_{k}d_{k}$ Present value of !xed payments accruing time- $\boldsymbol{\cdot}\boldsymbol{k}=X(V o l_{k}d_{k})$  

The swap must have zero expected value at inception, so the !xed swap rate $X$ quoted today is:  

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n}{V o l_{k}}{F_{k}}d_{k}=X\sum_{k=1}^{n}{V o l_{k}}d_{k}
$$  

$$
X={\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}V o l_{k}F_{k}d_{k}}{\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}V o l_{k}d_{k}}}
$$  

Hence the swap rate $X$ is determined by a (complex weighted) average of the forward prices of NG and current spot yields, over the life of the swap.  

An OTC swap of the above type can be tailor-made by the swap dealer to suit Centrica. It can begin immediately or can have a delayed start (i.e. ‘forward swap’) or it can be made to apply only to speci!c months when Centrica feels the spot price for NG is likely to be abnormally high. The notional quantity in the swap (e.g. 1 million mbtu of NG per day), can be pre-set at diferent levels on particular days within a month. Alternatively, the notional quantity can be a !xed daily amount within any one month but with diferent daily levels applying for each separate month. These would then be referred to as ‘roller coaster swaps’. With a swap, Centrica efectively locks in the efective price it pays for NG, over several months in the future, regardless of whether the spot price for NG in Zeebrugge turns out to be high or low.  

Suppose Centrica is happy to receive $S(f l o a t)-X$ from the swap dealer when spot prices turn out to be high (and hence has an efective cost of buying NG of $X$ ). But when the foating price of NG is less than the !xed price $X$ in the swap, Centrica only wants to pay the swap dealer $60\%$ of $S(f l o a t)-X$ . For example, if $S(f l o a t)=80\$ and $X=100$ then the efective cost of buying NG would be $80+60\%\times20=92$ , whereas with a plain vanilla swap the efective cost would have been $X=100$ . So the $60\%$ swap deal’ allows Centrica to pay less when prices are low and hence participate in some of the bene!t of low prices – not surprisingly this is known as a participation swap.  

You may have noticed in Figure 32.2 that the swap dealer has taken on risk, since she is paying $S(f l o a t)$ to Centrica each month and receiving $X$ -!xed from Centrica – so if NG prices rise in the future the swap dealer will experience losses. How does the swap dealer deal with this problem? Well, she may be lucky and !nd an ofsetting deal with another party who wants to pay the swap dealer a foating price (with the same maturity and tenor as the original swap with Centrica). This may happen automatically or the swap dealer can shade her price quotes to encourage such swaps. But let us assume (realistically) that even after these ofsetting swaps she still ends up as a net payer at a foating price.  

We know that the swap dealer fears a rise in S foat . But if there is a futures contract where the underlying asset is the spot price of NG, she can go long (an appropriate number of) futures contracts. Then if $S(f l o a t)$ increases in the future she can close out the futures at a pro!t and use this cash infow to ofset the higher foating payment in her swap deal. So in actual fact what derivatives markets are very good at providing is ‘risk spreading’ across a wide array of participants in these markets. The price risk is still there, but each party only holds ‘just a bit’ of it – it is an e\$cient ‘risk sharing’ mechanism. In short, without derivatives markets households’ gas bills might be even higher. The nearby blog shows how electricity producers can ‘lock in’ a pro!t margin on their power generation plant.  

# Finance Blog 32.2 Spark Spread Swap  

We all know that electricity can produce a spark and in the UK an electrician is called a ‘sparky’. What can a ‘spark’ have to do with swaps? Suppose you run a gas-!red power plant (‘Voltaire’) which produces electricity. (Centrica also owns gas-!red power plants in the UK.) Voltaire’s pro!t margin (per unit of electricity) is  

Pro!t margin of electric power plant $=S(e l e c t r i c)-S(N G)$  

(continued)  

# (continued)  

where both prices are measured in say ‘pounds per megawatt hour’, £/MWh. (This simpli!ed presentation avoids complications like the ‘heat rate’ which is the rate at which NG can be converted into electricity.) Voltaire may be willing to take on some ‘price risk’ due to the spot price of NG rising more than the price of electricity in the future, hence squeezing pro!t margins. But, if in any future periods $S(N G)>S(e l e c t r i c)$ , Voltaire may temporarily shut down the plant and cease to provide electricity to the ‘national grid’ during these periods. (Of course many other factors may enter into the decision to temporarily close down the plant, not least the ease with which the plant can be up and running again.)  

We can view the power plant as earning net receipts of $S(e l e c t r i c)-S(N G)$ (per megawatt hour) which will fuctuate as these two spot prices move up and down over time. Suppose Voltaire thinks that over the next few months either electricity or NG prices or both are likely to be more volatile than normal (e.g. due to highly variable weather conditions which afect electricity prices or risks on the supply of NG ‘through the pipe which afect spot NG prices). This means if Voltaire does nothing it faces great uncertainty about its future pro!t margins in selling electricity.  

To avoid this uncertainty Voltaire takes out a swap and agrees to pay a swap dealer an amount $S(e l e c t r i c)-S(N G)$ , in return for receiving a !xed payment $X$ , from the swap dealer, over each of the next few months. The net result of running the power plant and having the swap position is that Voltaire has efectively !xed its pro!t margin at $X$ (per megawatt of electricity sold). The agreed !xed payment $X$ , in this particular swap is known as the spark spread swap rate. Once again swaps allow one party (Voltaire) to ofset its risks from price fuctuations and to ‘lock in’ known cash receipts over the life of the spark spread swap.

# 32.3.2 Crack Spread  

The ‘crack’ you have probably heard of is the white powder ‘celebs’ allegedly snort to add zing to their lives.2 Well ‘crack’ appears in energy markets too, in the form of the ‘crack spread’. An oil re!ner (‘Heatforce’) can convert crude oil (CO) into heating oil (HO) and its pro!t margin (per barrel) depends on the diference between these two prices. (I hope you can see the analogy with the spark spread). Clearly, the oil re!ner is worried that in the future either heating oil prices fall or crude oil prices rise, or both – since this will hit its pro!t margin.  

Heatforce could ofset this risk by hedging using separate futures contracts on crude oil and heating oil – it would go long crude oil futures and would short heating oil futures. However, to save Heatforce the trouble of undertaking these two transactions itself, the futures market bundles them together and provides a futures contract on the crack spread. That is, the crack spread futures price moves (approximately) dollar-for-dollar with the cash market (spot) price diferential $S_{H O}-S_{C O}$ . Since Heatforce is worried about a fall in the (spot) crack spread, it will hedge by today, shorting crack spread futures. If the spot crack spread rises she makes higher pro!t margins but loses an equal amount on her short futures position. On the other hand if the spot crack spread falls her pro!t margins are squeezed but she makes an equal (dollar) amount when she closes out the short futures position.  

There is a 1:1 crack spread futures contract which takes account of the fact that 1 barrel of crude oil can (physically) be re!ned to produce 1 barrel of heating oil – as outlined above. But it is also possible to take 3 barrels of crude oil and convert this into 2 barrels of gasoline (petrol) and 1 barrel of heating oil. This re!ner faces price risk in the ratio 3:2:1 and it may not surprise you that there is a 3:2:1 crack-spread futures contract to hedge price risks for this type of re!nery. Crack spread contracts are traded on CME and ICE.  

# 32.4 WEATHER DERIVATIVES  

Weather derivatives can be used by companies whose output and hence pro!ts are afected by abnormal movements in ‘the weather’. Whereas most futures contracts are used to hedge uncertain future price movements, broadly speaking weather futures are used to hedge uncertainty about the levels of ‘output’ in future periods (e.g. the number of gallons of heating oil you might sell to consumers in future months).  

For the moment let’s consider ‘temperature’ as the only ‘weather variable’ infuencing revenues, costs, and pro!ts (that is, we ignore such weather factors as the number of frost days, or the depth of snowfalls, which clearly afect some !rms’ output, like ski resorts). Energy producers and consumers are afected by temperature since this infuences the amount of energy (heating oil, natural gas, electricity) used for heating in the winter months and (in the USA) the amount used for air conditioning in summer (see Weather Risk Management Association, www.wrma.org). The volume of agricultural production is also infuenced by temperature (e.g. orange growers in Florida), as are leisure industries (e.g. hotel and holiday companies) and some manufacturers (e.g. of cold drinks or ice cream).  

To keep things simple at this point, assume there are traded futures and options contracts, whose payof depends on the temperature (at a particular point in time and at a particular geographical location), relative to an (arbitrary) average daily temperature which we take to be $65^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$ . Let us also assume these derivatives contracts apply to a particular month (and we assume all months have 30 days).  

Hence on 15 January, if on average market participants believe that the average daily temperature in June will be ${70}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ then the current value of the June-weather futures contract will be $(70-65)^{\circ}\mathrm{F}\times30{\mathrm{days}}=150$ degree-days. The average cooling degree day (CDD) is 5 and the expected cumulative CDDs in June are 150 – this is because a higher temperature than $65~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ is likely to lead to more energy use for ‘cooling’, using air conditioning. Traders would say that the June contract is currently trading at 150 CDD. The futures contract multiple (on CME) is $\$20$ (per cumulative-CDD), so the June-futures price (on 15 January) is $\$20\times150C D D s=\S3,000$ .  

As you are probably aware, one of the main topics of conversation of the average citizen is what the weather might be like over the coming months. So, one can only assume they might sometimes like to gamble on the weather. Clearly this is possible using traded weather futures. On 15 January assume the June weather futures is trading at $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$ , equivalent to a price of $\$3,400$ but you think the (average) daily temperature in June will be $80~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$ As a ‘weather speculator’ you should buy June-weather futures at $\$3,000$ . In June if your guess turns out to be correct, the June-futures contract (you purchased in January) will be priced at around $(80-65)\times30~\mathrm{days}\times\S20=\S9{,}000$ and your pro!t on closing out will be $\$6,000$ . The latter !gure is simply the increase in the average daily temperature of $10{}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}(=80-70)$ , scaled up by the 30 days and the $\$20$ per index point.  

Pro!t $\b=$ Increase in temperature in futures contract $\times30$ days \$20  

In January the quoted price for the June-futures forecasts 150 CDDs for June (i.e. an average daily temperature of $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ). Hence if you thought the average temperature in June would be ${68}^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ then as a speculator you would sell June-futures in January and hope to close out at a lower price in June.  

What would an ‘option contract on the weather’ look like? Assume that on 15 January market participants expect the average daily temperature in June at a particular location (e.g. Portland Oregon) will be $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$ so cumulative CDDs for June are $(70-65)\times30=150.$ A strike ‘price’ of $K=150\:C D D s$ for the June-options contract therefore corresponds to an expected average temperature in June of $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$ Let’s take speculation !rst. If on 15 January, you think the average daily temperature in Portland in June will be higher than $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ then you might buy an option on CDD with a strike $K=150{\cal C}D D.$ . If the average temperature in June actually turns out to be greater than $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$ the option will be in-the-money and can be exercised at a pro!t. If it is less than $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$ you simply lose your option premium.  

# 32.4.1 Hedging and Insurance  

Now let’s consider hedging with weather derivatives. Suppose you run a number of large retail outlets in California (e.g. shops, o\$ces, hotels), which use air conditioning. On 15 January you may be worried that the temperature in June will be abnormally high so your air conditioning (energy) costs will rise, due to an increase in usage (i.e. ‘volume risk’), hence reducing your pro!ts.  

To ofset some or all of this forecast extra energy cost you could buy June-weather futures on 15 January. If the temperature turns out to be abnormally high in June, you can then close out your futures position at a pro!t, which can be used to ofset your higher air conditioning costs. If the temperature turns out to be lower than average in June, you close out your futures at a loss, but this is ofset by lower energy costs. Here the aim of the hedge is to keep overall energy costs in June constant, regardless of the outcome for temperatures in June. If the hedge is successful the !rm’s spot purchases of energy in June plus any pro!ts/loss on the futures will be close to the known June-futures invoice price quoted in January.  

Of course you have to work out how much pro!t you will lose for each one degree Fahrenheit rise in temperature over that implied in the June-futures price (i.e. over $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ). Only then can you decide how many weather futures to purchase in order to ofset your expected increase in energy costs (and loss in pro!ts). So you need someone to provide you with a business scenario model, which shows how overall pro!ts (in June) vary with temperature.  

How would options work? On 15 January if you buy a June-call option ‘on temperature’ with a strike of $K=150~C D D$ this provides a cap on energy costs due to higher out-turn average daily temperatures in June of more than $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F},$ which causes increased use of air conditioning. If the June temperature turns out to be above $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ (i.e. the number of CDD in June is greater than $K=150{\cal C D D}_{\it.}^{\mathrm{~~}}$ ) then the money you make after exercising the call option will just ofset your higher air conditioning costs, so your pro!ts remain at their normal level. However, if the average daily temperature in June falls below $70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F};$ , (below the strike) your call option is worthless, but your energy costs fall, as you are using less air conditioning at lower temperatures.  

You buy the 150-CDD June-call option on 15 January, then in June you have an asymmetric payof. You obtain higher than average pro!ts if temperatures turn out to be lower than $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ in June (because you use less air conditioning) and ‘normal pro!ts’ if the temperature is abnormally high – as the call when exercised is in-the-money, which pays for your higher energy costs. Of course, to obtain this insurance you have to pay the call premium on 15 January.  

So buying the June-call option on 15 January sets an efective maximum value of $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\cdot}\mathbf{\boldsymbol{K}}^{\prime}$ for your air-conditioning costs but allows you to take advantage of lower air-conditioning costs should temperatures in June be abnormally low. In contrast, when hedging on 15 January with a weather futures contract you make average pro!ts, regardless of whether the temperature in June turns out to be high or low.  

# 32.4.2 Contract Details  

Now we have sorted out the general principles of speculation and hedging with weather derivatives, let us look at a few of the contractual and institutional details. The !rst OTC weather derivatives were introduced around 1997 and are based on the number of daily ‘heating degree days’ (HDD) or ‘cooling degree days’ (CDD), de!ned as:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{D a i l y H D D=\operatorname*{max}(65-T e m p,0)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{D a i l y C D D=\operatorname*{max}(T e m p-65,0)}}\end{array}
$$  

where Temp is the average of the highest and lowest temperature ${\binom{\circ}{\mathrm{F}}}$ during the day at a speci!c location (e.g. at the Chicago O’Hare Airport weather station calculated by the Earth  

Satellite Corporation). For example if $T e m p=70~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ then the daily $C D D=5$ and the $H D D=0$ . The monthly HDD and $C D D$ are simply the sum of the daily values. For example, the average daily temperature in Chicago in November is about $50~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}_{:}$ , which is $15~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ below the ‘baseline’ $65^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ set in weather contracts – giving an average daily $H D D=15$ . Suppose it has been abnormally cold in the Fall in Chicago so the actual out-turn values of daily HDD in November are somewhat lower than average, namely 20, 18, 20, 15, 19, 25, and the other 24 days have $H D D=15$ . Then the cumulative HDD out-turn for November is 477. Note that when temperatures are low (i.e. well below $65^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ), then HDD is high – a negative correlation. However, CDD increases with temperature (above $65^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ ) – a positive correlation.  

Lots of ‘bespoke’ weather futures are sold in the OTC market but some plain vanilla contracts are also available with 24-hour electronic trading (e.g. on the CME-Globex trading platform) – both weather futures and European options (on weather futures) are based on the monthly (cumulative) HDD or CDD. These products are also available as seasonal products. The winter season is November to March and the summer season May to September, although April can be added to the summer and October to the winter season, so all months can be covered. You can choose from 2 to 6 months in a seasonal strip contract, so you might choose say 3 months (December, January and March) from the winter season strip, as these may be the months when your (energy) needs are highest but also most volatile and hence may need to be hedged. The CME clearing house guarantees trading on Globex by requiring ‘performance bond’ deposits (i.e. collateral placed in a margin account) at each level in the clearing process – customer to broker, broker to clearing !rm, and clearing !rm to clearing house.  

There are also weather derivatives which have payofs that depend on the number of frost days in the month or on the depth of snowfall at particular geographical locations. These derivatives work along the same broad principles as weather derivatives based on temperature, as described above. Forwards and futures contracts written on frost days allow !rms to protect their pro!ts due to abnormal volume changes in their business, caused by abnormal severe frosts in particular months in particular locations (e.g. wine growers in Napa and Sonoma Valley in California who sufer if grapes are harmed by severe frosts, particularly in spring when the vines are most vulnerable; ditto fower growers in Holland).  

The payout from snowfall derivatives is based on the number of inches of snow measured at speci!c locations at speci!c times of the day. If there is less or more daily snowfall than average in particular months, the ‘snow derivative’s’ payof at maturity will refect this outcome. The most obvious case where snow derivatives can be used is by owners of businesses in ski resorts. If there is a lack of snow at particular ski resorts (and sometimes if there is too much snow and risk of avalanches), !rms operating in this market can sufer abnormal losses. Also, excessive snowfalls can also severely disrupt the revenues and costs of transport companies, such as road haulage (the trucking business).  

Options contracts allow you to purchase insurance. For example, in November a wine grower might buy a call option on ‘frost days’ in March. The call option pays out depending on the number of frost days (above the strike ‘price’ of a !xed level of frost days in the month) and this compensates wine growers for any deterioration in the grape harvest, due to frost. On the other hand, if the number of frost days in March is below the ‘strike rate’ then the call expires out-of-the-money but the grape grower (vigneron) has the bene!t of a healthy crop of grapes to make excellent ‘grand cru’ wines (hopefully). The payment of the call premium is the cost of this insurance.  

# 32.4.3 Pricing Options on Temperature  

Temperature is uncorrelated with the (stock) market return, hence there is zero systematic risk and estimates of temperature from historical data can be assumed to apply in a risk-neutral world. Weather options can therefore be priced by using historical data on temperature to estimate the expected payof and then discounting using the risk-free rate.  

Suppose you have 60 years of historical data on cumulative HDD for January (at Chicago O’Hare Airport) and the histogram closely approximates a lognormal distribution from which you measure the mean $H D D=820$ with a standard deviation of (the logarithm of $H D D=$ 0.10. In January 2018 you purchase a $T=1$ year call option on HDD with a strike of $K=800$ , (when the risk-free rate is $3\%$ p.a.). The OTC option contract stipulates that each cumulative HDD is $\$1,000$ . Example 32.1 shows how to price the call.  

# EXAMPLE 32.1  

# Pricing a Call Option on HDD  

Using insights from Black–Scholes and Black’s model, it can be shown that if a stochastic variable $\ln V_{T}$ is normally distributed with mean (expected value) $E V_{T}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{V}$ Then the expected payof at $T$ is:  

$$
E[\operatorname*{max}(V_{T}-K,0)]=(E V_{T})N(d_{1})-K N(d_{2})
$$  

$$
d_{1}=\frac{\ln(E V_{T}/(K)+\sigma_{V}^{2}/2}{\sigma_{V}}d_{2}=\frac{\ln(E V_{T}/(K)-\sigma_{V}^{2}/2}{\sigma_{V}}=d_{1}-\sigma_{V}
$$  

Substituting $E V_{T}=820,K=800$ , $\sigma=0.10$ we have:  

$$
d_{1}=0.2969,d_{2}=0.1969,E V_{T}N(d_{1})-K N(d_{2})=43.279
$$  

$$
r i c e o f c a l l=\S1\mathrm{{,}000\exp\left(-0.03\right)\times43.279=\S42,000}
$$  

# 32.5 REINSURANCE AND CAT BONDS  

We have seen how weather derivatives can be used to hedge and provide insurance when there are abnormal weather conditions. In general OTC and exchange traded weather derivatives are used to hedge changes in temperature (or frost days or lack or excess of snowfall) which are slightly diferent from ‘average’. These products are provided in the OTC derivatives market by large banks, specialist energy !rms,3 and insurance companies. On the other hand, extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and foods are generally dealt with via some form of explicit insurance contract with an insurance company.  

Any single insurance company might hold a large number of catastrophe insurance contracts and may therefore be carrying a lot of risk, from low probability but highly costly events. To mitigate some of this risk an insurance company may reinsure say $70\%$ of its risks with other companies, leaving it liable to only $30\%$ of any claim (Lloyds of London is probably the oldest organisation providing such ‘reinsurance’). Alternatively the insurance company can purchase a series of reinsurance contracts for excess cost layers. If the insurance company has $\$1000$ exposure to hurricane damage in Florida then it may issue (separate) excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts to cover losses between $\$400$ and $\$500$ , $\$500$ , and $\$600$ etc. Between $\$400$ and $\$500$ of losses, the insurance company receives a dollar-for-dollar payof from the reinsurer but receives nothing from this particular reinsurance contract if losses are outside this range. Hence, for the !rst reinsurance contract, the insurance company has the equivalent of a long bull spread – namely, a long call at a strike of $\$400$ and a short call at a strike of $\$500$ .  

Reinsurance contracts are very useful but the insurance company can also issue bonds to cover catastrophic (CAT) risks. These have a liquid secondary market and can be sold to many investors thus ‘spreading’ the catastrophic risk more widely. CAT bonds pay a higher than average interest (coupon) but the holders agree to cover the ‘excess-of-loss’ insurance. For example, by issuing $\$100$ principal of CAT bonds an insurance company could cover losses between $\$400$ and $\$500$ by not re-paying some or all of the principal on the CAT bonds, should these losses occur. Alternatively it can make a much larger bond issue, with the covenant that any losses between $\$400$ and $\$500$ will be covered by a reduction in interest payments.  

The demand for CAT bonds by investors arises from the fact that they pay higher coupons (or yield to maturity) and the returns on CAT bonds have an almost zero correlation with stock market returns and hence have no systematic risk. In a diversi!ed stock portfolio speci!c risk will be small but adding CAT bonds can improve the (mean-variance) risk-return trade of in any already well diversi!ed stock portfolio.  

# 32.6 SUMMARY  

• Forwards, futures, options, and swap contracts on the price of energy products (oil products, natural gas, electricity) are available OTC and as exchange traded products.  

• Energy derivatives can be used to hedge (forwards, futures and swaps) and to provide insurance (options) against future changes in spot energy prices.   
• Some contracts are cash settled and others involve delivery – although alternative delivery arrangements from those stipulated in the contract can be separately negotiated and this is known as ‘exchange of futures for physicals’ (EFP).   
• Weather derivatives can be used to hedge (or provide insurance) against changes in the volume of energy used by industries whose pro!ts depend on the weather.   
• The most actively traded weather derivatives are based on temperature at particular locations at speci!c times but others depend on the number of frost days or the depth of snowfalls.   
• The key exchanges for energy derivatives are the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the International Commodities Exchange (ICE) in London. There is also a very large OTC market.  

# EXERCISES  

# Question 1  

You will have to purchase 560,000 barrels of (spot) jet fuel in 1 year’s time. There is a futures contract available on heating oil which you are going to use to hedge your jet fuel purchases.  

Contract size for heating oil is 42,000 barrels. Changes in jet fuel and heating oil price have a beta of 0.9.  

How would you implement the hedge and explain what happens if the spot price of heating oil either increases or decreases over the next year?  

What is the efective price of your jet fuel?  

Briefy explain why your strategy might not result in a ‘perfect hedge’.  

# Question 2  

It is 22 September and you have agreed to sell 10,000 mbtu of NG at $S(\mathrm{fix})=8.60\:\S/.$ mbtu to a commercial customer in early January. You do not currently have the NG. You will buy the NG in the cash market at the end of December but you are worried that NG prices will increase between September and the end of December.  

On 22 September you decide to hedge your position by using an at-the-money (ATM) option (on NG futures). Assume the options are cash settled. ATM options are available which have a (!xed) strike price $K_{:}$ , equal to the current futures price, $F_{0}(\mathrm{Jan}){=}8.20\ \S/\mathrm{mbtu}$ .  

# Derivatives (22 September)  

The NG-futures for January delivery on NYMEX is $F_{0}(\mathrm{Jan})=8.20\:\Phi/\mathrm{mbtu}$ ATM call costs, $C_{0}=\$15$ (with expiry date of 28 December).  

ATM put costs $P_{0}=\$17$ .  

Cash payof to call futures option $=\operatorname*{max}(0,{{F}_{T}}-K)$  

Cash payof to futures option $=\operatorname*{max}(0,K-F_{T})$  

# 28 December: Price rise  

On 28 December if you decide to exercise your (futures) option you face futures prices $F_{1}(\mathrm{Jan})=\$8.70$ and the spot price is also $S_{1}=\$8.70$  

# 28 December: Price fall  

On 28 December if you decide to exercise your option you face futures prices $F_{1}(\mathrm{Jan})=$ $\$70$ and the spot price is also $S_{1}=\$70$ .  

What are the outcomes after using the required futures or options contract in these two cases? Briefy comment.  

# Question 3  

In May, GasCorp has agreed to sell 10,000 mbtu per day of natural gas (NG) at $S(\mathrm{fix})=$ $10.5~\S/$ mbtu to customers in the Boston area for each of the months in the next year from January–June. GasCorp does not currently have the NG. GasCorp will buy the NG in the spot (cash market) in each of the months January–June and hedge these purchases using a NG-swap. The current NG swap rate quoted by CitiGroupEnergy is $X=10.0\S/\mathrm{{n}}$ mbtu.  

(a) How would GasCorp hedge its January–June purchases using a swap? (b) What is the payof to GasCorp from the swap each month, if spot-NG prices turn out to be:  

Spot out-turn, S   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Jan</td><td>11.85</td></tr><tr><td>Feb</td><td>11.87</td></tr><tr><td>Mar</td><td>11.65</td></tr><tr><td>Apr</td><td>9.69</td></tr><tr><td>May</td><td>9.49</td></tr><tr><td>Jun</td><td>9.6</td></tr></table></body></html>  

(c) What is the ‘efective average price’ GasCorp pays for its NG purchases in each month? (d) How might the swap dealer CitiGroupEnergy hedge its risk in the swap contract?  

# Question 4  

You purchase a large amount of natural gas at the current cash-market price, for heating in the winter months (November to March). In July how might you use futures contracts to hedge your price and volume risk over the winter months? Explain.  

# Question 5.  

Los Angeles: average temperatures in July and August  

<html><body><table><tr><td>84 °F August Av. High 29 °C</td></tr><tr><td>64 °F August Av. Low 18 °C</td></tr></table></body></html>  

In February, a large water park in Los Angeles, California owned by the DHockney Corporation called ABiggerSplash, knows that abnormally cool weather (between $65^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ and $70^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ average) over the summer months (July, August) leads to less customers and reduced pro!ts. The ‘normal’ average temperature in July/August is $80~^{\circ}\mathrm{F}.$ . The tick value for weather futures is $\$100$ per $^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ .  

How can the water park mitigate such losses using weather futures? Does it use futures on heating degree days (HDD) or cooling degree days $(C D D)?$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{H D D=m a x\left(65-T e m p,0\right)}}\\ {{C D D=m a x\left(T e m p-65,0\right)}}\end{array}
$$
