# The Futures Bond Basis: government bond futures and basis  trading  

# ABSTRACT  

Government bond futures contracts, traded on an exchange and representing a very  liquid product, are a key component of the global bond markets. The nominal value of  bonds represented by daily trading in the futures markets far exceeds the actual nominal  value of the cash bond market itself. The difference between the price of a cash bond  and its implied price as given by a futures contract, is the  basis . The basis has a  significant impact on the use of bond futures for both hedging and speculative purposes.  Given its importance, it is vital that market participants have a clear understanding both  of the basis itself as well as its dynamics.  

The objective of this serial is ation, in three chapters, is to describe and explain the basis  in non-technical terms. We do this by taking examples from the United Kingdom gilt  market, although the basic principles will be applicable in any bond futures market. As  such, we consider:  

   the futures contracts themselves, including contract specifications and the concept of  the cheapest-to-deliver;  

   price and delivery data for a sample of gilt contracts;  

   the drivers of the basis and its dynamics;  

   the mechanics of basis trading;  

   a detailed explanation of gross and net basis, and the implied repo rate.
