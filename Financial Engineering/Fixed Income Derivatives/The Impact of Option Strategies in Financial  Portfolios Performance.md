ABSTRACT:  This study employs the mean-variance (MV) criterion, Capital Asset Pricing  Model (CAPM) statistics and stochastic dominance (SD) analysis to investigate the  performance of option strategies, including writing out-of-the-money (OTM) covered call and  buying in-the-money (ITM) protective put, with that of the pure-stock investment by  analysing the French data in the entire 1999 year. Our results from MV criterion show that  none of these three strategies dominate one another but our CAPM statistics show that in  general buying ITM protective-put strategy obtains the highest performance, followed by the  writing OTM covered-call strategy while the naked stock obtains the smallest values. This  confirms the superiority of ITM protective-put strategy, followed by OTM covered-call  strategy by using the Beta coefficient, Sharpe ratio, Treynor and Jensen indices.

As the return distributions of these strategies are non-normal, the MV criterion and the  CAPM statistics may not be appropriate to assess the relative performance measurement of  the portfolios. We further investigate the performance by employing SD approach. Our SD  findings reveal that most of the buying covered-call and writing protective-put strategies are  superior to their corresponding pure-stock strategy, as in general the former stochastic ally  dominates the latter in the sense of first order SD. This infers that there may exist an anomaly  of the existence of an arbitrage opportunity in option trading that all types of non-satiated  investors will increase their wealth and utility by switching from the pure unhedged stock  strategy to their corresponding buying protective-put or writing covered-call strategies. In  addition, we find the dominance relationship between the two hedged positions is not as clear  as the comparison with their unhedged positions, but on average more buying ITM protective  put outperforms writing OTM covered call in the sense of the first-order SD. In short, our  results confirm that option introduction improve significantly the performance of unhedged  portfolios, especially buying ITM protective put.

# INTRODUCTION

The rapid growth of the use of options in portfolio management has been accompanied  by a variety of claims regarding option performance strategies. Many investors believe that  they can enhance the performance of their pure-stock portfolios by incorporating different  options strategies. Among them, the most popular strategies are covered-call writing and  protective-put buying. In theory, there is no clear evidence on whether a specific option  strategy is superior. According to the efficient market theory, an increase in returns should be  accompanied by an increase in risk. Adding options to stock portfolios may also create  problems of performance measurement homogeneity. Hedging is a financial transaction in  which one asset is held to offset the risk of holding another asset. Typically, a hedge is used to  offset price risk due to changes of financial market conditions. In this way, the development  of financial derivative instruments (options, futures, forward and swap) make hedgers simple  to use it to reduce risk. However, many portfolio managers use these derivative instruments to  speculate instead of hedging and, in turn, increase risk. The general framework suggested by  Hakanson (1978), Cox (1976) and Ross (1976) indicates that incorporating option enhances  the general efficiency of financial markets by increasing the number of investment  opportunities available to investors in terms of insurance and hedging, but not lead to any  arbitrage opportunity.

Several studies compare the performance between unhedged and hedged positions  with options or compare the performance among different hedged positions. For example,  Trennepohl and Dukes (1981) investigate the performance of option writing and buying  strategies using in-the-money (ITM) and out-of-the-money (OTM) options and conclude that  covered option writing lowers portfolio standard deviation and improves portfolio mean  returns. They also conclude that writing calls or buying puts goes along with reduction of both  risk and return, compared to the unprotected stock position. Employing simulation  approaches, Bookstaber and Clarke (1984) compare the performance of protective-put,  covered-call, and pure-stock strategies and conclude that call writing is better than put buying  as the former truncates the right-hand side of a distribution causing undesirable negative  skewness while put-buying truncates the left-hand side of a distribution causing desirable  positive skewness.
In contrast to the studies of Trennepohl and Dukes (1981) and Bookstaber and Clarke  (1984) using MV analysis, Dybvig and Ingersoll (1982) and Bookstaber and Clarke (1985)  comment that MV analysis is not appropriate because of the change in portfolio return  distributions when options are introduced. On the other hand, Booth, Tehranian and  Trennepohl (1985) suggest that stochastic dominance (SD) approach is more appropriate than  MV analysis in portfolio selection using option strategies and find that SD rules are useful in  raking portfolios of options combined with other assets.   Clarke (1991) applies the SD  algorithm developed by Bookstaber and Clarke (1983) to compare the performance of several  strategies (  $100\%$   stock,   $100\%$   calls,   $90\%$   T-bills and   $10\%$   calls, and covered-call writing and  protective-put buying). He concludes that the MV approach could not be used to measure the  option strategies performance and finds that option strategies do not dominate the pure-stock  buy-and-hold strategy when options are fairly valued by Black and Scholes (1973) model.  However, if options are somewhat mis-priced, second-degree dominance relationships appear  from covered-call or protective-put strategies to pure-stock strategy. Using Swiss stocks,  option and futures data,  investigating the performance of a diversified strategy with option, in  particular, writing covered-call strategy, Isakov and Morard (2001) reveal that option  introduction leads to an increase of return and simultaneously a decrease of volatility, and  their SD results show the superiority of covered to uncovered portfolios.

Nonetheless, the performance of incorporating option in stock could be due to other  factors or market conditions. For example, Benninga and Blume (1985) analyse the optimality  of portfolio insurance in a complete and an incomplete market. They find that buying put  option may be optimal only in an incomplete market, but not in a complete market. Brooks  and Hand (1988) examine the return characteristics of the new index futures contracts by  analysing the performance of a portfolio that incorporates these contracts. They find that both  return distribution and performance evaluation depend on the risk-free rate, the dividend rate,  the basis and the margins. Besides MV or SD approaches, other approaches could also be  useful  in  the  evaluation  of  the  performance  of  options  and  stocks.   For example, employing a Value-at-Risk approach, Castellano and Giacometti (2001)  compare the performance of protective-put and covered-call strategies to the performance of  holding an unhedged currency portfolio and conclude that the hedged strategies perform  better than the optimal naked portfolios and the protective-put strategy performs well for  different VaR models. In addition, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) statistics  developed by Sharpe (1964), Treynor (1965) and Jensen (1969) are also widely used in the  comparison of stock, option and futures performance.
The main purpose of this study is to understand the modification of the portfolio  characteristics when options are added to it. This study employs the MV criterion, CAPM  statistics and SD analysis to investigate the performance of option strategies, including  writing OTM covered-call and buying ITM protective put, with that of the pure-stock  investment by analysing the French data in the entire 1999 year. Our results in MV criterion  show that none of these three strategies dominate one another but our CAPM statistics show  that, in general, the buying ITM protective-put strategy obtains the highest performance,  followed by the writing OTM covered-call strategy while the naked stock obtains the smallest  values. This confirms the superiority of ITM protective put, followed by OTM covered-call  strategy by using the Beta coefficient, Sharpe ratio, Treynor and Jensen indices.

As the return distributions of these strategies are non-normal, the MV criterion and the  CAPM statistics may not be appropriate to assess the relative performance measurement of  the portfolios. We further investigate the performance by employing SD approach. Our SD  findings reveal that most of the buying covered-call and writing protective-put strategies are  superior to their corresponding pure-stock strategy as, in general, the former stochastic ally  dominates the latter in the sense of first order SD. This infers that there may exist an anomaly  of the existence of an arbitrage opportunity in option trading that all types of non-satiated  investors will increase their wealth and utility by switching from the pure unhedged stock  strategy to their corresponding buying protective-put or writing covered-call strategies. In  addition, we find the dominance relationship between the two hedged positions is not as clear  as the comparison with their unhedged positions, but on average more buying ITM protective  put outperforms writing OTM covered call in the sense of the first-order SD. In short, our  results confirm that option introduction improves significantly the performance of unhedged  portfolios, especially buying ITM protective put.
# I. Mean-variance approach versus stochastic dominance

Mean-variance efficient sets (Markowitz 1952) derived from a Von NeumannMorgenstern quadratic utility function and from a family of normal distributions have been  widely used in both economics and business to analyze choices among risky assets. However,  Baron (1977) shows that preferences can be stated over mean and variance alone only if an  agent has a quadratic Bernoulli utility function. On the other hand, Rothschild and Stiglitz  (1970) confirm that the preferences of an expected utility maximizing agent over different  distributions of wealth cannot always be consistently stated as preferences over mean and  variance alone. This can only be done if restrictive assumptions are made about either the  Bernoulli utility function of the agent or the specific class of distributions from which the  agent must choose. Nevertheless, Hanoch and Levy (1969) state the dilemma in which the  decision from MV choice criteria contradicts to that of the SD theory. Levy (1989) reveals  that the MV efficient set is different from the SD efficient sets. In addition, Michaud (2003)  argues that the principal limitation of classical mean–variance efficiency as a practical  framework for optimal portfolio is the estimation error insensitive. They recommend to use  re-sampled technique to control estimation error and  to use multi-period geometric mean  analysis as a practical alternative.

Besides using MV approach, contemporary finance also advocates the use of the  CAPM statistics developed by Sharpe (1964), Treynor (1965) and Jensen (1969) to compare  stock, option and futures performance. As these methodologies also depend on normal return  distributions and quadratic utility functions, they are not appropriate if return distributions are  not normal or investors’ utility functions are not quadratic.

To circumvent the limitation of the MV approach and CAPM statistics, academics  recommend to employ the SD criterion developed initially by Hadar and Russel (1969),  Hanoch and Levy (1969) and Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970) for decision-makers to compare  different prospects as the SD approach satisfies the general utility function and take into  consideration all distribution al moments in the comparison. In earlier financial economics  literature, some applications of SD have been noted (Porter and Gaumnitz (1972), Porter  (1973) and Joy and Porter (1974)). More recently, Post (2003) focuses on portfolio  diversification issues by comparing a given portfolio to a set of assets using SD efficiency in a  finite empirical panel data. He shows that diversification can obtain higher power of the SD  tests. More recently, Post and Levy (2005) analyse the SD efficiency classification of the  value-weighted market portfolio relative to benchmark portfolios based on market  capitalization, book-to-market equity ratio and momentum. They conclude that risk seeking  can help to explain the cross-sectional pattern of stock returns.
Early empirical studies examining dominance relationships in finance as a tool of  performance measurement of portfolios incorporating options include Brooks, Levy and  Yoder (1987) who use various discrete SD tests to check whether investors were better when  writing calls or buying puts on their portfolios. They find no SD relationships among option  strategies. Other articles applying SD to compare the performance among stocks, options and  futures include Booth, Tehranian and Trennepohl (1985), Clarke (1991) and Isakov and  Morard (2001).

In recent years, formal SD tests have been developed. For example, Beach and  Davidson (1983) propose a test of Lorenz Curve dominance to explicitly acknowledge the  distribution quantiles as dependent random estimates of the underlying distribution. Beach  and Richmond (1985) extend the work to adopt a multiple comparison framework in which  the distribution al properties follow the Student i zed Maximum Modulus (SMM) distribution  tabulated by Stoline and Ury (1979). Bishop, Chakraboti and Thistle (1989) apply the unionintersection techniques in a multiple comparison of the individual moment and provide  asymptotically distribution-free statistical inference procedures for the Generalized Lorenz  Curves.

On the other hand, without using Generalized Lorenz Curves, Anderson (1996, 2004)  proposes non parametric SD tests to compare the income distribution directly. He suggests an  alternative method to estimate cumulative distribution functions by applying the trapezoidal  rule to approximate the required integrals. McFadden (1989) proposes a generalized  Kolmogorv-Smirnov test for the first- and second-order SD among K prospects based on  independently and identically distributed (iid) prospects.

Most of the earlier SD tests (for example, Beach and Davidson (1983), Anderson  (1996)) are based on a multiple comparison approach. Partitioning the range of the random  variables into a finite set of  $\mathbf{k}$    exhaustive intervals, the multiple comparison approach assesses  the SD estimate on each of the intervals. These multiple hypotheses tests lead to a statistical  size bounded by Sidák’s inequality, a refinement of Bonferroni’s inequality. This inequality  states that a multivariate normal vector with mean zero and arbitrary correlations falls inside a   $\mathbf{k}$  -dimensional cube centred at the origin. In the special case where the correlations are zero,  the test statistic has the SMM distribution, an approach that Richmond (1982) applies in the  construction of simultaneous confidence intervals. Given that these tests are based on Sidák’s  inequality, and because the correlations may not be zero, the true size of such a multiple  comparison test is likely smaller than its nominal size.
These types of tests have been criticized because the assumption that compared  distributions are independently distributed and, thus, usually they are inappropriate. This  criticism is pertinent for income distribution comparisons and for financial prospects  comparison where different distributions are often conditioned on similar information sets  held by the economic agents. With this concern in mind, Klecan, McFadden, and McFadden  (1991) extend the Kolmogov-Smirnov test to obtain a new non-parametric SD test which does  allow some degree of statistical dependence across space and time. They derive an upper  bound on the size of the test but the test is likely inefficient because it does not explicitly take  into account the dependence structure between distributions. Linton, Maasoumi and Whang  (2005) further develop a more powerful SD test by relaxing the iid assumption.

On the other hand, Davidson and Duclos (DD, 2000) construct quantile estimates for  the asymptotic covariance structure over successive integrals of the probability distributions.  Zheng and Cushing (2001) derive a similar test, which is albeit more restrictive conditions on  testing income inequality indices. Using Monte Carlo simulation to compare the performance  of various non parametric SD tests, Tse and Zhang (2004) and Wei and Zhang (2003) reveal  that the SD test developed by Davidson and Duclos is one of the most powerful but yet least  conservative tests. Thus, our paper will apply DD test in our study. As the SD tests developed  by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005) and Barrett and Donald (2003) have their  advantages as well as their limitations, we further verify the DD test results by using the SD  tests developed by Linton, et al and Barrett and Donald for checking.
# II. Data and Methodology

This study investigates the performance of strategy by incorporating the corresponding  options in trading stocks or indices in the French market. We choose ten options (call and put)  and their underlying stocks or indices quotations over the period from January 4 to December  31, 1999 including the seven most well-established companies, namely: Elf Aquitaine (AQ2),  France Télécom (FT3), Lafarge (LG2), Michelin (ML2), Peugeot (UG), Thomson CSF  (HO2), Saint-Gobain (SG3) and three French index, namely: CAC40 (PXL), DJ Euro STOXX  50 (OEX) and DJ STOXX 50 (OSX). Daily option prices are obtained from the M.O.N.E.P.  (Marché des Options N go ci able s de Paris), and the corresponding daily stock prices are  obtained from Paris Stock of Exchange (Bourse de Paris). Options are selected according to  their types and moneyness degrees and are only restrained to OTM call option and ITM put  options due to the superiority of these types of options in performance enhancing.

The return,  $\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{t}}$   ,  at time t   for the unhedged individual stock or index is defined as

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{t}}{=}\frac{\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{t}}{-}\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{t-1}}}{\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{t-1}}}
$$

where   $\mathrm{S_{t}}$   is the stock price or index value at time t. We adopt the approaches in Morard and  Naciri (1990) and Isakov and Morard (2001) to define the hedged returns of both protectiveput and covered-call strategies to take into consideration the situations in which the options  are exercised when the options are ITM and the options are not exercised when the options  are out of the money 1 .

As the transaction volume in the options market has been increased dramatically after  the introduction of the options market, some academics and practitioners would believe that  incorporating options in trading stocks could outperform trading stocks alone. In this paper  we investigate this possibility and hence we compare the performance of adopting coveredcall writing and protective-put buying strategies with that of pure-stock (naked) position by  examining their correspondence returns. We first study whether the two hedged strategies,  writing OTM covered-call and buying ITM protective-put strategies, outperform the  unhedged pure-stock strategy and if both hedged positions perform better than the unhedged  pure stock, we then study which hedged strategy performs the better.
To fulfil our first objective, we set the following two hypotheses:

Hypothesis C0:  Writing OTM covered call does not outperform the unhedged pure-stock  strategy.

Hypothesis P0:  Buying ITM protective put does not outperform the unhedged pure-stock  strategy.

Rejecting Hypothesis C0 implies that writing OTM covered-call strategy outperforms  the unhedged pure-stock strategy while rejecting Hypothesis P0 implies that buying ITM  protective-put strategy outperforms the unhedged pure-stock strategy. When both C0 and P0  are rejected, we then test the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis CP0: There is no difference between the performance of writing OTM covered  call and that of buying ITM protective put.

Rejecting Hypothesis CP0 needs further examination on whether writing OTM  covered-call or buying ITM protective-put strategy performs better. Rejecting any of these  hypotheses will conclude that there is an anomaly in option trading that either trading call or  put or both perform better than stock alone. In this paper, we employ SD to measure  ‘outperform’ such that writing OTM covered-call (buying ITM protective-put) strategy  outperforms stock if the return of writing OTM covered-call (buying ITM protective-put  strategy) dominates that of stock. If this is true, then there exists an arbitrage opportunity  (Bawa 1978 and Jarrow 1986) and one will increase one's wealth as well as one's utility if one  shifts the investment from stock to writing OTM covered-call (buying ITM protective-put)  strategy. Hence, the rejection of these hypotheses will be an important finding in options  theory. To relax these strong hypotheses, we set the following weaker hypotheses:

Hypothesis C1:  Risk-adverse investors do not prefer writing OTM covered call to trading the  unhedged pure stock.

Hypothesis P1: Risk-adverse investors do not prefer buying ITM protective put to trading the  unhedged pure stock.

Hypothesis CP1: There is no preference in writing OTM covered call and buying ITM  protective put for any risk-adverse investor.
Rejection of Hypothesis C1 (P1) implies that risk-adverse investors prefer to write  OTM covered call (buy ITM protective put) than trade the unhedged pure-stock strategy. This  does not mean writing OTM covered call or buying ITM protective-put strategy outperforms  the unhedged pure-stock strategy, only the preference of risk-averse investors who will  increase their utilities but not wealth when they shift the investment from stock to writing  OTM covered call or buying ITM protective put. Similarly, rejection of Hypothesis  CP1 implies that risk-adverse investors prefer to write OTM covered call or buy ITM  protective put, does not mean that writing OTM covered call outperforms buying ITM  protective put or vice versa.

To test the above hypotheses, we first appoint the MV criterion (Markowitz (1952),  Tobin (1958)) to draw inference on the impact of both adopting call writing and put buying on  pure-stock trading. For any two investments with the variables of profit or return   $\mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{i}}$   and   $\mathrm{Y_{j}}$    with means   $\upmu_{\mathrm{i}}$   and   $\upmu_{\mathrm{j}}$   and standard deviations   $\upsigma_{\mathrm{i}}$   and   $\upsigma_{\mathrm{j}}$    respectively,   $\mathrm{Y_{j}}$   is said to dominate   $\mathrm{Y_{i}}$   by the MV criterion if   $\upmu_{\mathrm{j}}\geq\upmu_{\mathrm{i}}$   and   $\upsigma_{\mathrm{j}}\le\upsigma_{\mathrm{i}}$   . To apply the MV criterion, we first compute  the simple descriptive statistics including mean   $(\upmu)$   and standard deviation   $(\upsigma)$   to test the  hypotheses C0, P0 and CP0 or C1, P1 and CP1. In addition, we compute the coefficient of  variation   $(\upsigma/\upmu)$  , the skewness and kurtosis coefficients and the Jarque-Bera (JB) statistic for  the returns of all unhedged and hedged positions.

As contemporary finance advocates the use of the CAPM statistics for portfolio  construction and performance evaluation, we next apply the CAPM analysis including beta  components, the Sharpe ratio, Treynor’s index and the Jensen (alpha) index developed by  Sharpe (1964), Treynor (1965) and Jensen (1969) to measure performance degree of each  strategy. Not being reduced by diversification, Beta ( β ) of the portfolio measures the marginal  contribution of asset (portfolio) to total market portfolio and measures the sensitivity of its  return to the movements in the market portfolio returns. The estimation requires a numbers of  linear regressions for CAPM equation in the case of both hedged and unhedged portfolios for  stock i as follows:

$$
\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{i,t}}\!-\!\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{f,t}}\!\!=\!\!\upalpha_{\mathrm{i}}\!+\!\upbeta_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{m,t}}\!-\!\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{f,t}})\!+\!\upvarepsilon_{\mathrm{i,t}}
$$

where   $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i,t}}$    is the i.i.d (independent and identically distributed) residual. Three performance  indices; Sharpe ratio (S i ), Treynor index   $\mathrm{(T_{i})}$   and Jensen’s alpha index  $\left(\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)^{2}$   are then computed.
These methodologies depend on normal return distributions and quadratic utility  functions and are not be appropriate if return distributions are not normal or investors’ utility  functions are not quadratic.  As shown in next section, the results of the skewness and kurtosis  coefficients and the JB statistic conclude all returns being studied in this paper, including both  hedged and unhedged positions, are not normal. This violates the normality assumptions  required in the return distribution of option for all the portfolios and suggests using an  alterative approach for the analysis.

All the above statistics restricted to mainly the first two moments of the data will miss  some important information like higher moments in the data. To overcome this shortcoming,  we apply the Davidson and Duclos (DD, 2000) non parametric SD DD test 3  based on the  whole empirical distribution of the data to test any dominance from any of the two random  samples of the returns series, say   $\mathrm{Y}$   and   $Z$   with   $N_{y}$     and   $N_{z}$     observations and with the  corresponding cumulative distribution functions (CDFs),   $F_{y}$     and   $F_{z}$  ,  the corresponding  probability density functions (PDFs),   $f_{y}$    and   $f_{z}$  ,   respectively. Let   $D_{i}^{0}=f_{i}$   for  $\mathrm{i}{=}\,\mathbf{y},\,\mathbf{Z}$   and let

$$
D_{i}^{k}\left(x\right)=\intop_{-\infty}^{x}D_{i}^{k-1}(y)d y\quad\mathrm{~for~}k=1,2,3\mathrm{~and~for~i=y,z~}.
$$

For any integer   $k\geq1$  ,   $\mathrm{Y}$   is said to dominate  $Z$   stochastic ally at order  $\mathbf{k}$   (denoted by   $\mathrm{Y}\!\succ_{\mathrm{k}}\!Z$  ) if   $\mathrm{D_{Z}^{k}(x_{i}){\geq}D_{Y}^{k}(x_{i})}$   for all   $\mathbf{X}$  , with strict inequality for some x.  Modified from the Kolmogorov. Smirnov statistic, the DD statistic testing the null hypothesis   $\mathrm{H}_{0}$   of the equality of   $\mathrm{D_{y}^{k}(x){=}D_{z}^{k}(x)}$   is:

$$
\mathrm{T}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x}){=}\frac{\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x}){-}\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})}{\sqrt{\hat{\mathrm{V}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})}}
$$

where:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\hat{\mathbf{V}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})\!\!=\!\!\hat{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})\!\!+\!\!\hat{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})\!\!-\!\!2\hat{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{y},\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})}\\ &{\hat{\mathbf{D}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})\!\!=\!\!\frac{1}{\mathbf{N}(\mathbf{k}-1)!}\!\!\sum_{\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{I}}^{\mathrm{N}}(\mathbf{x}-\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{\mathrm{k}-1}}\\ &{\hat{\mathbf{D}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathbf{x})\!\!=\!\!\frac{1}{\mathbf{N}(\mathbf{k}-1)!}\!\!\sum_{\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{I}}^{\mathrm{N}}(\mathbf{x}-\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{\mathrm{k}-1}}\end{array}
$$
$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\hat{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})\!\!=\!\!\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}}\!\!\left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}((\mathrm{k}-1)!)^{2}}\!\!\sum_{\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{N}}\!\!(\mathrm{x}\!-\!\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{2(\mathrm{k}-1)}\!\!-\!\!\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})^{2}\right]}\\ &{\hat{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})\!\!=\!\!\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}}\!\!\left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}((\mathrm{k}-1)!)^{2}}\!\!\sum_{\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{N}}\!\!(\mathrm{x}\!-\!\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{2(\mathrm{k}-1)}\!\!-\!\!\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})^{2}\right]}\\ &{\hat{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{y},\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})\!\!=\!\!\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}}\!\!\left[\frac{1}{\mathrm{N}((\mathrm{k}-1)!)^{2}}\!\!\sum_{\mathrm{i}=\mathrm{i}}^{\mathrm{N}}\!\!(\mathrm{x}\!-\!\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{2(\mathrm{k}-1)}(\mathrm{x}\!-\!\mathrm{z}_{\mathrm{i}})_{+}^{2(\mathrm{k}-1)}\!\!-\!\!\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{y}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})^{2}\!\!\cdot\!\hat{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{z}}^{\mathrm{k}}(\mathrm{x})^{2}\right]\!.}\end{array}
$$

Note that  $\bf N_{y}\!=\!N_{z}\!=\!N$   as   $\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)$   are paired observations.

To test for stochastic dominance,  $\mathrm{H}_{0}$   has to be examined for the full support, which is  empirically impossible. A compromise is to test  $\mathrm{H}_{0}$   for a pre-designed finite number of values  of x. As multiple hypotheses are involved, test based on multiple comparison have to be  adopted. A multiple comparison procedure is proposed by Bishop, Formby and Thistle (1992)

 (BFT) by employing the union-intersection test. Following BFT, we consider fixed values of

$\begin{array}{r l}&{H_{0}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)=D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\mathrm{,~for~all~x_i\!~;}}\\ &{H_{A}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\neq D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\mathrm{,~for~some~x_i\!~;}}\end{array}$  ;                                                                                                        $H_{A1}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\leq D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)$   for all   $\mathbf{X_{i}}$     and   $H_{A1}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)<D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)$   for some  $\mathbf{X_{i;}}$  ;  $H_{A2}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\geq D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)$   for all  $\mathbf{X_{i}}$     and   $H_{A1}:D_{y}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)>D_{z}^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)$   for some  $\mathbf{X_{i}}$

To control for the probability of rejecting the overall null hypothesis, according to  BFT, we use the Student i zed Maximum Modulus (SMM) distribution with m and infinite  degrees of freedom, denoted by   $\mathbf{M}_{\infty}^{\mathrm{k}}$   The   $_{1-\upalpha}$   percentile of   $\mathbf{M}_{\infty}^{\mathrm{k}}$  denoted by   $\mathbf{M}_{\infty,\alpha}^{\mathrm{k}}$  , is  . ,  tabulated by Stoline and Ury (1979) and the following decision rules are adopted:

a) If   $\left|T^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)\right|<M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$  for  $\mathbf{i}=\!1,\dots,\!\mathbf{k}$  , accept  $\mathrm{H}_{0}$  .  b) If   $-T^{k}(x_{i})>M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$   for some i and   $T^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)<M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$  for all i, accept  $\mathrm{H_{Al}}$  .  c) If   $T^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)>M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$   for some i and  $-T^{k}(x_{i})<M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$   for all i, accept  $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{A}2}$  .  d) If    $T^{k}\left(x_{i}\right)>M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$   for some i and  $-T^{k}(x_{i})>M_{\infty,\alpha}^{k}$   for some i, accept  $\mathrm{H_{A}}$  .
DD test compares the distributions at a finite number of grid points. The choice of grid  points   $(\mathrm{k})$   is guided by the results of various studies. Barrett and Donald (2003) and Tse and  Zhang (2004) show that the reasonable choice of   $\mathbf{k}$   for reasonably large samples is from 6 to  15. Too few grids will miss information of the distributions between any two consecutive  grids (Barrett and Donald (2003), and too many grids will violate the independence  assumption required by the SMM distribution (Richmond (1982)). In order to make more  detailed comparisons without violating the independence assumption, we make 20 partitions  in each comparison to check the consistency of the magnitudes and the signs of the DD  statistics between two major consecutive partitions. Statistical inference is based on the SMM  distribution for  $\mathrm{k{=}10}$   and an infinite degrees of freedom 4 .

# III. Empirical results and implications

The simple descriptive statistics including mean   $(\upmu)$  , standard deviation   $(\upsigma)$  , the  coefficient of variation   $(\upsigma/\upmu)$  , skewness, kurtosis and the JB statistics for the returns of both  unhedged and hedged positions are reported in Table I   for each   stock or index.

Table I: Descriptive statistics of returns on unhedged and hedged stock or index
 ![500](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/model-mineru/prod/063f7fc7ca3cb19265f4e3721bff6bddcb1c7c3e438d03705cdbd89ab1344376.jpg)
 $^*\,p\,<\,5\%$  ,   $***p<l\%.$  ..  Note: the critical values for testing skewness at the 5 percent level are  $\pm0.153$   while the  critical values for testing kurtosis are  $3{\pm}0.615$  . \* and  $^{**}$   reported in the skewness and kurtosis are for normality  test.
The results in Table I show increase in both mean and standard deviation of the returns  for each stock or index from the unhedged to the two-hedged positions: writing OTM covered  call and buying ITM protective put. The increase in mean return for ITM protective-put  strategy can be explained by the combination of the leverage effect 5  and the exercise gain.  This gain is usually able to compensate negative changes of the underlying prices and the  premiums paid to buy option contracts. Comparing both ITM protective put and OTM  covered call with naked stock strategy, the average statistics show that the ITM protective put  obtains the highest mean return and the highest standard deviation (  $\upmu{=}0.1249$   and   $\upsigma=0.109\$  ),  followed by the OTM covered call   $\upmu{=}0.0785$   and   $\upsigma=0.081$  ) while the naked stock strategy  hold the smallest mean and the smallest standard deviation (  $\upmu{=}0.0021$   and  $\upsigma=0.018$  ).  Hence,  we conclude none of these three strategies dominate one another by the MV criterion.

In addition, comparing with the unhedged position, Table I shows that the optimal risk  return performance measured by   $\upsigma/\upmu$   coefficient decreases when adopting either hedged  strategies. This implies that the increase in mean return is higher than the increase in volatility  by introducing option in the trading strategy. To be more precise, the table shows that ITM  protective put reveals the lowest coefficient of variation; followed by the OTM covered call  while the naked stock strategy has the highest coefficient of variation. This infers that the  ITM protective put is preferred to the OTM covered-call strategy which, in turn, is preferred  to the naked stock strategy in the risk variation criterion.

After introducing ITM put option to pure-stock or index trading strategy, the table  shows that 80 percent of the skewness coefficients increase and 90 percent are positive, this is  consistent with the findings in Bookstaber and Clarke (1981, 1984) that introducing ITM put  option alters stock return distribution by giving more weight on the right-hand side of the  distribution. In addition, by introducing the OTM call option, 70 percent of the skewness  coefficients decrease but most of them still remain positive and the average coefficient  appears to be higher to that of the unhedged case. This suggests OTM call introduction may  also shift the stock return distribution to the right. Moreover, it is well known that options  introduction will make the distribution further away from normality. The skewness coefficient  reveals that 40 percent of the unhedged stocks remain normal but the OTM covered-call  strategy for all stocks and indices become non-normal except FT3, SG3, UG and PXL and   $80\%$   of the ITM protective-put strategies become non-normal. Hence, we conclude that the  options introduction makes the return distribution further away from normality. On the other  hand, the results of the kurtosis coefficient show that normality is rejected for all the OTM  covered call, but rejected only for 60 percent of the ITM protective-put strategy and for 70  percent of the unhedged position; this shows that the OTM covered call has relatively flatter  tails on average. Nevertheless, the results of the JB statistic in Table I show that normality is  rejected for all unhedged and hedged strategies with covered call and protective put, with the  JB estimates increase significantly for both hedge strategies, inferring that distribution  becomes more non-normal after introducing the call or put options in the trading strategies.
Table II exhibits performance by using beta coefficient, Sharpe ratio, Treynor and  Jensen indices for each strategy on each stock or index. Option introduction reduces the  systematic risk (beta) in 90 percent of the hedged positions. Among them, 30 percent of the  beta values are negative. These results corroborate the findings of Tren ne pot hl and Duke  (1982). In addition, the Beta coefficients are less than one or even become negative,  confirming the role of option on systematic risk minim is ation 7 . Both the Sharpe ratio and the  Treynor index increase and become positive for nearly all hedged positions, with the largest  Sharpe ratio and the Treynor index obtained by the ITM put strategy, followed by the OTM  call strategy. This implies that the ITM put is most preferable, followed by the OTM call and  then pure-stock strategy in terms of the Sharpe ratio and the Treynor index. These result is  due to the larger change in mean return then the change in the systematic risk by adopting call  or put in trading stock. Also, the Jensen index increases for both hedged strategies, with the  larger increase in the ITM protective put. This indicates that returns generated by hedged  positions are higher than market return with the ITM protective put being superior to the  OTM covered-call strategy, both are superior to the pure-stock strategy. From the results in  the average statistics, ITM put options attain the lowest   $\upbeta$   (0.25), followed by OTM coveredcall strategies (0.37). Similarly, the ITM protective put obtains the highest Sharpe, Treynor  and Jensen indices (0.89; 0.03 and 0.104 respectively), followed by the OTM covered-call  strategy (0.46; -0.04 and 0.06 respectively) while the naked stock obtains the smallest values.  This confirms the superiority of ITM protective put, followed by OTM covered-call strategy  by using the beta coefficient, Sharpe ratio, Treynor and Jensen indice.

Note that the results are read for the left toward the right. The dominance relationships test is applied between  strategies placed in left column and those placed in right column. For example, the most left entry for AQ2  means that the pure-stock strategy does not stochastic dominate writing OTM covered call strategy” while the  most right entry for AQ2 means that buying ITM protective put strategy dominates the pure-stock strategy in the  first order. ND: No Stochastic Dominance; FSD: First Stochastic Dominance; SSD: Second Stochastic  Dominance; TSD: Third Stochastic Dominance.

Table III reports the DD test results of all the unhedged and hedged positions for the  entire period being studied in this paper. The results in Table III show that nearly all (except  SG3   and HO2) OTM writing covered call and nearly all (except HO2) ITM protective put  dominate their corresponding pure-stock strategy in the first order SD at the   $1\%$   level. This  leads us reject both Hypotheses C0 and P0 and conclude that both hedged positions (OTM  writing covered call and ITM protective put) are superior to their corresponding pure-stock  strategy. This infers that there may exist an anomaly of the existence of arbitrage  opportunities in option trading that all types of non-satiated investors (prefer more to less)  will increase their wealth and utilities by switching from the pure-stock strategy to their  corresponding OTM writing covered-call or ITM protective-put strategies (Bawa (1978),  Jarrow (1986) and Falk and Levy (1989)).

Figure 1B:  The CDF of the Daily returns of AQ2 for ITM protective-put and naked stock  strategies and the corresponding DD statistics: the entire period

To illustrate the SD relationship, we plot the CDFs of the daily returns for the   $\mathrm{A}\mathrm{Q}2^{8}$    unhedged pure stock with either the corresponding OTM covered-call (as shown in Figure  1A) or ITM protective-put (as shown in Figure 1B) hedged positions together and plot their  corresponding DD test statistics. Figure 1A shows that in the entire period the empirical  cumulative density function of the unhedged position (CDF AQ2 S) is greater than that of the  OTM covered-call hedged position (CDF AQ2 CO). This implies that the cumulative  probability on any point is greater for the unhedged position than for the OTM covered-call  hedged position. Hence the covered-call position is preferred to the unhedged position in the  sense of FSD for any non-satiated investor with increasing utility function. The significant  dominance relationship is found in the return interval from  $^{-7}$   to 30 percent as all three DD  statistics (T1, T2 and T3) are negative in the entire range with some portion being significant  at the 1 percent level. Similarly, Figure 1B shows that any point in the CDF AQ2 S is greater  than that of ITM protective-put position (CDF AQ2 PI), revealing the dominance of the ITM  protective-put hedged position over the unhedged position in the sense of FSD, SSD and TSD  as all the corresponding DD statistics are negative in the entire range with some portions  being significant at the 1 percent level in the first three orders. These enable us to draw the  conclusion that both the ITM Protective-put strategy and the OTM covered-call strategy  outperform the unhedged strategy and all types of non-satiated investors with increasing  utility functions prefer both ITM protective-put and the OTM covered-call strategies than the  unhedged stock strategy as they will increase their wealth and utility by switching from purestock strategy to the corresponding ITM protective-put or the OTM covered-call strategies.

Refer to Table III on the notation and how to read the table.

For robustness checking, we further analyse the DD stochastic dominance  relationships for two non-overlapping sub-periods 9  between the hedged and unhedged  positions and the results are summarized in Tables 4A and 4B. The results in the tables lead  us conclude that hypothesis   $\mathrm{H_{Al}}$    is accepted for both hedged strategies in 90 percent of cases  in the first sub-period and accepted in all cases in the second sub-period. This reveals that the  dominance of the hedged strategies is consistent in the whole period as well as in any of these  sub-periods. From the unreported figures, we find that majority of DD values are negative in  the entire range with some portions being significant at the 1 percent level. This confirms the  same FSD relationships in both sub-periods as well as in the entire period. Similar to the  momentum puzzle found by Jegadeesh and Titman (1993, 2001), our results surprise us that  investors do not learn from the first sub-period that the hedged positions outperform the  unhedged position and hence this anomaly carries on to the second sub-period. In addition, we  also conduct the test on the two overlapping periods 10 , drawing similar conclusions 11 , which  implies the superiority of both covered-call and protective-put strategies to pure-stock  strategy. Hence, we can draw that the same conclusion on both first and second overlapping  sub-periods in the year of 1999 in French market.

The table must be read for the left toward the right. The dominance relationships test is applied between  strategies placed in left column and those placed in right column (strategy noted in left column dominates or not  the strategy noted in right column).    ND: No Stochastic Dominance; FSD: First Stochastic Dominance; SSD: Second Stochastic Dominance; TSD:  Third Stochastic Dominance.

As both Hypotheses C0 and P0 are rejected and both writing OTM covered call and  buying ITM protective put are revealed to outperform their unhedged pure-stock strategy, we  now turn to compare the performance between the two hedged strategies and report their SD  relationships for the entire period as well as for the two non-overlapping sub-periods in Table  V .  The table exhibits that ITM protective put is superior to the OTM covered call for the  entire period as the ITM protective-put strategy significantly dominates its corresponding  OTM covered call in the sense of the first order in   $50\%$   of cases but only one case shows the  significantly reversed dominance in the entire period. We also notice that among all the nonsignificant FSD cases on either direction, there exists one second-order SD for ITM put and  one for OTM call. This reveals that the dominance relationship between the two hedged  positions is not as clear as in the comparison with their unhedged positions, but on average the  ITM protective put outperforms the OTM covered call for all the significant first-order  stochastic dominance cases. A similar conclusion can be drawn in both non-overlapping subperiods as   $60\%$     $(50\%)$   of ITM put first-order stochastic ally dominate their OTM covered call  in the first (second) sub-period while   $20\%$     $(40\%)$   of ITM put second-order stochastic ally  dominate their OTM covered call in the first (second) sub-period but none of the OTM  dominates its responding ITM put in none of the first three orders. For robustness check, we  compare the dominance relationship in the overlapping sub-periods 13  and obtain the same  superior dominance from the ITM put over the OTM call on average.

Figure 2: The CDF of the Daily Returns of AQ2 for the OTM covered-call and the ITM  protective-put strategies and the corresponding DD Statistics in the entire period.

We illustrate the SD relationship by using AQ2 as example to plot the CDFs of the  returns for both the ITM put and OTM call in Figure 2 and their corresponding DD statistics  (T1, T2 and T3) 14 . The figure shows that in the entire period the empirical cumulative density  function of the OTM covered-call hedged position (CDF AQ2 CO) is greater than that of the  ITM protective-put hedged position (CDF AQ2 PI). This implies that the cumulative  probability of any point on the OTM covered-call position is greater than that for the ITM  protective-put position. This reveals that the protective-put position is preferred to the  covered-call position in the sense of FSD for any non-satiated investor with increasing utility  function. This is confirmed by all three DD statistics (T1, T2 and T3), which are negative in  the entire range with some portions being significant at the 1 percent level.
At last, we apply the SD tests developed by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005) and  Barrett and Donald (2003) for checking. The advantage of SD test developed by Linton,  Maasoumi and Whang (2005) is they relax the iid assumption while the SD test Barrett and  Donald (2003) has also been found to be one of the most powerful SD test besides the DD  test. As the results from SD tests developed by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005) and  Barrett and Donald (2003) are similar to those from DD test, we only report the DD test in  this paper.

# Conclusion

This study discovers new findings on the use of option strategies, including writing  covered-call and buying protective-put option strategies. We compare the performance of  unhedged to hedged positions for 10 main stocks or indices in French stock market. Our  results show that on average the ITM protective put obtains the highest mean and the highest  standard deviation, followed by the OTM covered call while the naked stock strategy hold the  smallest mean and the smallest standard deviation. Hence none of these three strategies  dominate one another by the MV criterion. However, our CAPM statistics show that the ITM  protective put obtains the lower beta coefficient and the highest Sharpe, Treynor and Jensen  indices, followed by the OTM covered-call strategy compared with the naked stock strategy.  This confirms the superiority of ITM protective put, followed by OTM covered-call strategy  by using the beta coefficient and other CAPM statistics.

Nevertheless, skewness and kurtosis coefficients and the JB statistic reveal that the  returns of most of the hedged and unhedged stocks/indices are rejected to be normal. Thus,  the conclusion drawn by MV criterion and CAPM statistics may not be reliable and hence we  further conduct SD tests in the study. Our SD findings reveal that both hedged positions  (writing OTM covered call and buying ITM protective put) are superior to their corresponding  pure-stock strategy as the former dominates the latter in the sense of FSD. This infers that  there may exist an anomaly of the existence of arbitrage opportunities in option trading that  all types of non-satiated investors will increase their wealth as well as their utilities by  switching from the pure-stock strategy to their corresponding writing OTM covered-call or  buying ITM protective-put strategies. We also find that the dominance relationship between  the two hedged positions is not as clear as in the comparison with their unhedged positions,  but on average more ITM protective put outperforms the OTM covered call. In short, our  results confirm that option introduction improve generally the performance of unhedged  portfolios, especially for the case of buying ITM protective-put strategy.

# Footnotes

1  Refer to Morard and Naciri (1990) and Isakov and Morard (2001) for the formula of the returns of the hedged  strategies.

3  We also apply the SD tests developed by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005)   and Barrett and Donald (2003)  for checking. The advantage of SD test developed by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005)   is they relax the iid  assumption while the SD test Barrett and Donald (2003) has been found to be one of the most powerful SD test  besides the DD test . As the results from SD tests developed by Linton, Maasoumi and Whang (2005)   and  Barrett and Donald (2003) are similar to those from DD test, we only report the DD test in this paper.  4  Refer to Fong, Wong and Lean (2005) for the reasoning. Critical values are: 3.691, 3.25 and 3.043 for   $1\%$  ,  $5\%$    and   $10\%$   level of significance tabulated in Stoline and Ury (1979).

5  Leverage effect corresponds to a negative correlation between post return and future volatility as the result of

stock and option combination.  6  On average, the skewness coefficient is 0.21 for naked stock and 0.93 for ITM protective-put strategy.   7  The smaller the beta is weak, the less the systematic risk is weak. Hence,  $\upbeta{<}1$   is preferably for risk averters.  8  The plots of other stocks or indices reveal similar conclusion. Hence, we skip reporting the plots, which are  available on request.  9  We choose two sub-periods: the first is for January to June and the second is for July to December 1999.  10  We analyse the results in the overlapping sub-periods, obtain similar results and draw the same conclusion.  We do not report the results for simplicity but they are available on request.  11  The same definitions of table III are used.  12  We analyse the results in the overlapping sub-periods, obtain similar results and draw the same conclusion.  We do not report the results for simplicity but they are available on request.  13  The results are available on request.  14  The plots of other stocks or indices are available on request. Most of other plots reveal the same dominance

relationships.
