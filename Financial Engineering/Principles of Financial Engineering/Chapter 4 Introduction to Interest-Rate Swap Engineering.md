# 4.1 THE SWAP LOGIC  

Swaps are the first basic tool that we introduced in Chapter 1. It should be clear by now that swaps are essentially the generalization of what was discussed in Chapters 1 and 3. We start this chapter by providing a general logic for swaps.  

It is important to realize that essentially all swaps can be combined under one single logic. Consider any asset. Suppose we add to this asset another contract and form a basket. But, suppose we choose this asset so that the market risk, or the volatility associated with it, is exactly zero. Then the volatility (or the risk) of the basket is identical to the volatility (or the risk) of the original asset. Yet, the addition of this “zero” can change other characteristics of the asset and make the whole portfolio much more liquid, practical, and useful for hedging, pricing, and administrative reasons. This is what happens when we move from original “cash” securities to swaps. We take a security and augment it with a “zero-volatility” asset. This is the swap strategy.  

# 4.1.1 THE EQUIVALENT OF ZERO IN FINANCE  

First we would like to develop the equivalent of zero in finance as was done in Chapter 1. Why? Because, in the case of standard algebra, we can add (subtract) zero to a number and its value does not change. Similarly if we have the equivalent of a “zero” as a security, then we could add this security to other securities and this addition would not change the original risk characteristics of the original security. But in the mean time, the cash flow characteristics, regulatory requirements, tax exposure, and balance sheet exposure of the portfolio may change in a desirable way.  

What is a candidate for such a “zero”? Consider the interbank money market loan as shown in Figure 4.1. The loan principal is 100 and is paid at time $t_{1}$ . Interest and principal is received at $t_{2}$ . Hence this is a default-free loan to be made in the future. The associated interest rate is the LIBOR rate $L_{t_{1}}$ to be observed at time $t_{1}$ .  

We write a forward contract on this loan. According to this, 100 is borrowed at $t_{1}$ and for this the prevailing interest rate is paid at that time. What is, then, the value of this forward loan contract for all $t\in\left[t_{0},t_{1}\right]^{.}$ ?  

![](a511147b7c4fe3ebb9b9e099e4b9f0856862e3314cbe811dc47d5296b92dbbe0.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.1  

An interbank money market loan.  

It turns out that one can, in fact, calculate this value exactly at time $t_{0}$ even though the future LIBOR rate $L_{t_{1}}$ is not known then. Consider the following argument.  

The $t_{2}$ cash flows are  

$$
+100+100L_{t_{1}}\delta
$$  

Discounting this value to time $t_{1}$ , we get  

$$
\frac{+(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta)100}{(1+L_{t_{1}}\delta)}\equiv+100\
$$  

Adding this to the initial 100 that was lent, we see that the total value of the cash flows generated by the forward loan contract is exactly zero for all times $t$ during the interval $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ , no matter what the market thinks about the future level of $\overline{{L_{t_{1}}}}$ .1  

Denoting the value of this forward contract by $V_{t}$ , we can immediately see that  

$$
\mathrm{Volatility}(V_{t})\equiv0\mathrm{\quad}\mathrm{for~all~}t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]
$$  

Hence adding this contract to any portfolio would not change the risk (volatility) characteristics of that portfolio. This is important and is a special property of such LIBOR contracts.2 Thus let $V_{t}$  

1Another way of saying this is to substitute the forward rate $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ for $L_{t_{1}}$ . As $\Delta$ amount of time passes, this forward rate would change to $F_{t_{0}}+\Delta$ . But the value of the loan would not change, because  

$$
\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)}=\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)}=-100
$$  

2For example, if the forward contract specified a forward rate $F_{t_{0}}$ at time $t_{0}$ , the value of the contract would not stay the same, since starting from time $t_{0}$ as $\Delta$ amount of time passes, a forward contract that specifies a $\boldsymbol{F}_{t_{0}}$ will have the value  

This is the case since, normally,  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{(1+F_{t_{0}+\Delta}\delta)}\neq\frac{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)100}{-(1+F_{t_{0}}\delta)}=-100\mathrm{~}\mathrm{\backslashfrac~\{+\backslashleft(1+L_{-}\{t_-}\{1\}\}~}}\\ {\mathrm{\backslashdelta\backslashight\1~100\}}\\ {\displaystyle\qquad\quad\{1+\mathrm{L}_{-}\{t_{-}\{1\}\}\mathrm{\backslash~delta\}=100}\mathrm{\backslash}}\end{array}
$$  

denote the value of a security with a sequence of cash flows so that the security has a value equal to zero identically for all $t\in\left[t_{0},t_{1}\right]$ ,  

$$
V_{1}=0
$$  

Let $S_{t}$ be the value of any other security, with  

$$
0<{\mathrm{Volatility}}(S_{t})\quad t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]
$$  

Suppose both assets are default-free.3 Then, because the loan contract has a value identically equal to zero for all $t\in\left[t_{0},t_{1}\right]$ , we can write  

$$
S_{t}+V_{t}=S_{t}
$$  

in the sense that  

$$
\mathrm{Volatility}(S_{t}+V_{t})=\mathrm{Volatility}(S_{t})
$$  

Hence the portfolio consisting of an $S_{t}$ and a $V_{t}$ asset has the identical volatility and correlation characteristics as the original asset $S_{t}.$ . It is in this sense that the asset $V_{t}$ is equivalent to zero. By adding it to any portfolio, we do not change the market risk characteristics of this portfolio.  

Still, the addition of $V_{t}$ may change the original asset in important ways. In fact, with the addi tion of $V_{t}$ :  

1. The asset may move the $\overline{{S_{t}}}$ off-balance sheet. Essentially, nothing is purchased for cash.   
2. Registration properties may change. Again no basic security is purchased.4   
3. Regulatory and tax treatment of the asset may change.   
4. No up-front cash will be needed to take the position. This will make the modified asset much   
more liquid.5  

We will show these using three important applications of the swap logic: but first some advantages of the swaps. Swaps have the following important advantages among others.  

Remark 1: When you buy a US Treasury bond or a stock issued by a US company, you can only do this in the United States. But, when you work with the swap, $S_{t}+V_{t},$ you can do it anywhere, since you are not buying/selling a cash bond or a “cash” stock. It will consist of only swapping cash.  

Remark 2: The swap operation is a natural extension of a market practitioner’s daily work. When a trader buys an asset, the trader needs to fund this trade. “Funding” an asset with a LIBOR loan amounts to the same scheme as adding $V_{t}$ to the $S_{t}$ . In fact, the addition of the zero asset eliminates the initial cash payments.  

Remark 3: The new portfolio will have no default risk.6 In fact with a swap, no loan is extended by any party.  

Remark 4: Finally the accounting, tax, and regulatory treatment of the new basket may be much more advantageous.  

# 4.1.2 A GENERALIZATION  

We can generalize this notion of “zero.” Consider Figure 4.2. This figure adds vertically $n$ such deposits, all having the same maturity but starting at different times, $t_{i},i=1,2,\ldots$ The resulting cash flows can be interpreted in two ways. First, the cash flows can be regarded as coming from a floating rate note (FRN) that is purchased at time $t_{i}$ with maturity at $t_{n}=T.$ . The note pays LIBOR flat. The value of the FRN at time $t_{i}$ will be given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{Value}_{t}[\mathrm{FRN}]=V_{t}^{1}+V_{t}^{2}+\cdots+V_{t}^{n}}&{{}t\in[t_{0},t_{1}]}\\ {=0}\end{array}
$$  

where $\mathbf{}V_{t}^{i}$ is the time $t$ value of the period deposit starting at time $t_{1}$ .  

The second interpretation is that the cash flows shown in Figure 4.2 are those of a sequence of money market loans that are rolled over at periods $t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n-1}$ .  

# 4.2 APPLICATIONS  

In order to see how powerful such a logic can be, we apply the procedure to different types of assets as was done in Chapter 1. In this chapter, we consider an equity portfolio and add the zerovolatility asset to it. This way we obtain an equity swap. A similar approach can be applied to currencies and we discuss cross-currency and FX swaps in Chapter 6. A commodity swap can be obtained similarly and we explain exactly how in Chapter 7.  

In Chapter 19, we do the same with a defaultable bond. The operation will lead to a credit default swap (CDS). These swaps lead to some of the most liquid and largest markets in the world. They are all obtained from a single swap logic.  

# 4.2.1 EQUITY SWAP  

Consider a portfolio of stocks whose fair market value at time $t_{0}$ is denoted by $S_{t_{0}}$ . Let $t_{n}=T$ , $t_{0}$ $\mathbf{<}\cdots<t_{n}$ , where $T$ is a date that defines the expiration of an equity-swap contract. For simplicity, think of $t_{n}-t_{0}$ as a 1-year period. We divide this period into equally spaced intervals of length $\delta$ , with $t_{1},t_{2},t_{3},...,t_{\mathrm{}\mathrm{}},=T$ being the settlement dates.  

Let $\delta=\textstyle{\frac{1}{4}}$ so that the $t_{i}^{\phantom{\dagger}}{}^{\phantom{\dagger}}{}^{\phantom{\dagger}}{}^{\phantom{\dagger}}$ are 3 months apart. During a 1-year interval with $\overline{{n=4}}$ , the portfolio’s value will be changed by  

$$
S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{0}}=[(S_{t_{1}}-S_{t_{0}})+(S_{t_{2}}-S_{t_{1}})+(S_{t_{3}}-S_{t_{2}})+(S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{3}})]
$$

# FIGURE 4.2  

n_l_ss-__uss \Delta S_{t_{0}}+\Delta S_{t_{1}}+  

A sequence of FRN purchases\.Delta  

This can be rewritten as  

$$
S_{t_{4}}-S_{t_{0}}=\Delta S_{t_{0}}+\Delta S_{t_{1}}+\Delta S_{t_{2}}+\Delta S_{t_{3}}
$$  

We consider buying and marking this portfolio to market in the following manner:  

1. $N=100$ is invested at time $t_{1}$ .   
2. At every $t_{1}$ , $i=1,2,3,4$ total dividends amounting to $\overline{{d}}$ are collected.  

3. At the settlement dates, we collect (pay) the cash due to the appreciation (depreciation) of the portfolio value.   
4. At time $t_{n}=T$ , collect the original USD100 invested.  

This is exactly what an equity investor would do. The investor would take the initial investment (principal), buy the stocks, collect dividends, and then sell the stocks. The final capital gains or losses will be $S_{t_{n}}-S_{t_{0}}$ . In our case, this is monetized at each settlement date. The cash flows generated by this process can be shown in Figure 4.3.  

Now we follow the swap logic discussed above and add to the stock portfolio the contract $V_{t}$ which denotes the time $t$ value of the cash flows implied by a forward LIBOR deposit. Let ${{g}_{t_{i}}}$ be the percentage decline or increase in portfolio value at each date, and let the initial investment be denoted by the notional amount $N$ :  

$$
S_{t_{0}}=N
$$  

Then,  

1. The value of the stock portfolio has not changed any time between $t_{0}$ and $t_{1}$ , since the forward FRN has value identically equal to zero at any time $t\in\left[t,~t_{0}\right]$ .  

2. But the initial and final $\ensuremath{N^{\prime}}\ensuremath{\mathrm{s}}$ cancel.  

3. The outcome is an exchange of  

$$
\overline{{L_{t_{i-1}}\delta N}}
$$  

against  

$$
(\Delta S_{t_{i}}+d)\delta N
$$  

at each $t_{i}$ .  

4. Then we can express the cash flows of an equity swap as the exchange of  

$$
(L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{i})\delta N
$$  

against  

$$
\overline{{\Delta S_{t_{i}}\delta N}}
$$  

at each $t_{i}$ . The $d_{i}$ being an unknown percentage dividend yield, the market will trade this as a spread. The market maker will quote the “expected value of” $\overline{{d_{i}}}$ and any incremental supply demand imbalances as the equity-swap spread. The buyer of the equity swap will need to pay LIBOR $L_{t_{i-1}}\delta N$ plus a spread while receiving the total return on the equity index, i.e., $(\Delta S_{t_{i}}+d)\delta N$ at each $t_{i}$ .  

5. The swap will involve no up-front payment. This construction proves that the market expects the portfolio $S_{t_{i}}$ to change by $L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{t_{i}}$ each period, in other words, we have  

$$
E_{t}^{\overline{{P}}}[\Delta S_{t_{i}}]=L_{t_{i-1}}-d_{t_{i}}
$$  

This result is proved normally by using the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and the implied risk-neutral probability.  

Now we move on to interest-rate swaps.

# FIGURE 4.3  

# 4.3 THE INSTRUMENT: SWAPS  

Imagine any two sequences of cash flows with different characteristics. These cash flows could be generated by any process—a financial instrument, a productive activity, a natural phenomenon. They will also depend on different risk factors. Then one can, in principle, devise a contract where these two cash flow sequences are exchanged. This contract will be called a swap. To design a swap, we use the following principles:  

1. A swap is arranged as a pure exchange of cash flows and hence should not require any additional net cash payments at initiation.8 In other words, the initial value of the swap contract should be zero.  

2. The contract specifies a swap spread. This variable is adjusted to make the two counterparties willing to exchange the cash flows.  

A generic exchange is shown in Figure 4.4. In this figure, the first sequence of cash flows starts at time $t_{1}$ and continues periodically at $t_{2}$ , $t_{3},...,t_{k}$ . There are $k$ floating cash flows of differing sizes denoted by  

$$
\{C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{1}}),C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{2}}),...,C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{k}})\}
$$  

These cash flows depend on a vector of market or credit risk factors denoted by $x_{t_{i}}$ . The cash flows depend also on the $s_{t_{0}}$ , a swap spread or an appropriate swap rate. By selecting the value of $s_{t_{0}}$ , the initial value of the swap can be made zero.  

Figure $4.4\mathrm{b}$ represents another strip of cash flows:  

$$
\{B(y_{t_{0}}),B(y_{t_{1}}),B(y_{t_{2}}),...,B(y_{t_{k}})\}
$$  

which depend potentially on some other risk factors denoted by $y_{t_{i}}$ .  

The swap consists of exchanging the $\{C(s_{t_{0}},x_{t_{i}})\}$ against $\{B(y_{t_{i}})\}$ at settlement dates $\left\{t_{i}\right\}$ . The parameter $s_{t_{0}}$ is selected at time $t_{0}$ so that the two parties are willing to go through with this exchange without any initial cash payment. This is shown in Figure 4.4c. One will pay the $C(\cdot)\mathrm{{^{\circ}s}}$ and receive the $B(\cdot)\mathrm{{^{\circ}s}}$ . The counterparty will be the “other side” of the deal and will do the reverse.9 Clearly, if the cash flows are in the same currency, there is no need to make two different payments in each period $t_{i}$ . One party can simply pay the other the net amount. Then actual wire transfers will look more like the cash flows as shown in Figure 4.5. Of course, what one party receives is equal to what the counterparty pays.  

Now, if two parties who are willing to exchange the two sequences of cash flows without any up-front payment, the market value of these cash flows must be the same no matter how different they are in terms of implicit risks. Otherwise one of the parties will require an up-front net payment. Yet, as time passes, a swap agreement may end up having a positive or negative net value, since the variables $x_{t_{i}}$ and $y_{t_{i}}$ will change, and this will make one cash flow more “valuable” than the other.  

![](ea247ef0d851b7508103eeb11ac0b0d0cc60b1455c51beb304068dc83884fbba.jpg)  

Adding vertically, we get a swap.

# FIGURE 4.5  

Exchange of net amounts in an interest-rate swap.  

# EXAMPLE  

Suppose you signed a swap contract that entitles you to a $7\%$ return in dollars, in return for a $6\%$ return in euros. The exchanges will be made every 3 months at a predetermined exchange rate $e_{t_{0}}$ . At initiation time $t_{0}$ , the net value of the commitment should be zero, given the correct swap spread. This means that at time $t_{0}$ , the market value of the receipts and payments are the same. Yet, after the contract is initiated, USD interest rates may fall relative to European rates. This would make the receipt of $7\%$ USD funds relatively more valuable than the payments in euro.  

As a result, from the point of view of the USD-receiving party, the value of the swap will move from zero to positive, while for the counterparty, the swap will have a negative value.  

Of course, actual exchanges of cash flows at times $t_{1}$ $,t_{2},...,t_{n}$ may be a more complicated process than the simple transactions as shown in Figure 4.5. What exactly is paid or received? Based on which price? Observed when? What are the penalties if deliveries are not made on time? What happens if a $t_{i}$ falls on a holiday? A typical swap contract needs to clarify many such parameters. These and other issues are specified in the documentation set by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).  

# 4.4 TYPES OF SWAPS  

Swaps are a very broad instrument category. Practically, every cash flow sequence can be used to generate a swap. It is impossible to discuss all the relevant material in this book. So, instead of spreading the discussion thinly, we adopt a strategy where a number of critical swap structures are selected and the discussion is centered on these. We hope that the extension of the implied swap engineering to other swap categories will be straightforward.  

# 4.4.1 NONINTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

Most swaps are interest rate related given the LIBOR and yield curve exposures on corporate and bank balance sheets. But swaps form a broader category of instruments and to emphasize this point, we start the discussion with one particular type of noninterest-rate swap, the equity swap. One of the most important recent innovations is the CDS, but we will examine it in detail in a separate chapter. Similarly we will discuss currency- and commodity-related swaps in separate chapters on financial engineering applications in foreign exchange and commodity markets respectively.  

# 4.4.1.1 Equity swaps  

Equity-swaps exchange equity-based returns against LIBOR as seen earlier. These swaps are sometimes also labeled as total return swaps.  

In equity swaps, the parties will exchange two sequences of cash flows. One of the cash flow sequences will be generated by dividends and capital gains (losses), while the other will depend on a money market instrument, in general LIBOR. Once clearly defined, each cash flow can be valued separately. Then, adding or subtracting a spread to the corresponding LIBOR rate would make the two parties willing to exchange these cash flows with no initial payment. The contract that makes this exchange legally binding is called an equity swap.  

Thus, a typical equity swap consists of the following. Initiation time will be $t_{0}$ . An equity index $I_{t_{i}}$ and a money market rate, say LIBOR $L_{t_{i}}$ , are selected. At times $\{t_{1},\ t_{2},...,t_{n}\}$ , the parties will exchange cash flows based on the percentage change in $I_{t_{i}}$ , written as  

$$
N_{t_{i-1}}\left({\frac{I_{t_{i}}-I_{t_{i-1}}}{I_{t_{i-1}}}}\right)
$$  

against LIBOR-based cash flows, $N_{t_{i-1}}L_{t_{i-1}}\delta$ plus or minus a spread. The $N_{t_{i}}$ is the notional amount, which is not exchanged.  

Note that the notional amount is allowed to be reset at every $t_{0},t_{1},...,.,t_{n-1}$ , allowing the parties to adjust their position in the particular equity index periodically. In equity swaps, this notional principal can also be selected as a constant, $N_{\astrosun}$  

# EXAMPLE  

In Figure 4.6, we have a 4-year sequence of capital gains (losses) plus dividends generated by a certain equity index. They are exchanged every 90 days, against a sequence of cash

flows based on 3-month LIBOR—20 bp. Figure 4.6a and b depicts the cash flows from the total return—associated with the equity index and the LIBOR payments, respectively. Figure 4.6c shows the payoffs of the equity swap.  

The notional principal is USD 1 million. At time $t_{0}$ , the elements of these cash flows will be unknown.  

At time $t_{1}$ , the respective payments can be calculated once the index performance is observed. Suppose we have the following data:  

$$
I_{t_{0}}=800
$$  

$$
I_{t_{1}}=850\quad L_{t_{0}}=5\%\quad\mathrm{spread}=0.20
$$  

Then the time $t_{1}$ equity-linked cash flow is  

$$
1m\bigg(\frac{I_{t_{1}}-I_{t_{0}}}{I_{t_{0}}}\bigg)=1,000,000(0.0625)=62,500
$$  

The LIBOR-linked cash flows will be  

$$
1m(L_{t_{0}}-s_{t_{0}})\frac{90}{360}=1,000,000(0.05-0.002)\frac{1}{4}=12,000
$$  

The remaining unknown cash flows will become known as time passes, dividends are paid, and prices move. The spread is subtracted from the interest rate.  

Some equity swaps are between two equity indices. The following example illustrates the idea.  

# EXAMPLE  

In an equity swap, the holder of the instrument pays the total return of the S&P 500 and receives the return on another index, say the Nikkei. Its advantage for the holder lies in the fact that, as a swap, it does not involve paying any up-front premium.  

Of course, the same trade could also be created by selling S&P futures and buying futures on another equity index. But the equity swap has the benefit that it simplifies tracking the indices.  

Later in this chapter, we will discuss several uses of equity swaps.  

# 4.4.2 INTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

This is the largest swap market. It involves exchanging cash flows generated by different interest rates. The most common case is when a fixed swap rate is paid (received) against a floating LIBOR rate in the same currency. Interest-rate swaps have become a fundamental instrument in world financial markets. The following reading illustrates this for the case of plain vanilla interest-rate swaps.  

# EXAMPLE  

The swap curve is being widely touted as the best alternative to a dwindling Treasury market for benchmarking US corporate bonds. . .. This has prompted renewed predictions that the swap curve will be adopted as a primary benchmark for corporate bonds and asset-backed securities.  

. . . Investors in corporate bonds say there are definite benefits from the increasing attention being paid to swap spreads for valuing bonds. One is that the mortgage-backed securities market has already to a large degree made the shift to use of LIBOR-based valuation of positions, and that comparability of corporate bonds with mortgage holdings is desirable.  

. . Swap dealers also point out that while the agency debt market is being adroitly positioned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as an alternative to the Treasury market for benchmarking purposes, agency spreads are still effectively bound to move in line with swap spreads.  

. Bankers and investors agree that hedging of corporate bond positions in the future will effectively mean making the best use of whatever tools are available. So even if swaps and agency bonds have limitations, and credit costs edge up, they will still be increasingly widely used for hedging purposes

This reading illustrates the crucial position held by the swap market in the world of finance. The “swap curve” obtained from interest-rate swaps is considered by many as a benchmark for the term structure of interest rates, and this means that most assets could eventually be priced off the interest-rate swaps, in one way or another. Also, the reading correctly points out some major sectors in markets. In particular, (1) the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market, (2) the market for “agencies,” which means securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, etc., and (3) the corporate bond market have their own complications, yet, swaps play a major role in all of them. At this point, it is best to define formally the interest-rate swap and then look at an example.  

A plain vanilla interest-rate swap initiated at time $t_{0}$ is a commitment to exchange interest payments associated with a notional amount $N.$ , settled at clearly identified settlement dates, $\{t_{1},t_{2},\},5,$ $\left({{t}_{n}}\right)$ . The buyer of the swap will make fixed payments of size $s_{t_{0}}N\delta$ each and receive floating payments of size $L_{t_{i}}N\delta$ . The LIBOR rate $L_{t_{i}}$ is determined at set dates $\{t_{0},t_{1},...,t_{n-1}\}$ . The maturity of swap is $m$ years.10 The $s_{t_{0}}$ is the swap rate.  

# EXAMPLE  

An interest-rate swap has a notional amount $N$ of USD 1 million, a $7\%$ fixed rate for 2 years in semiannual (s.a.) payments against a cash flow generated by 6-month LIBOR. This is shown in Figure $4.7\mathrm{a}$ . There are two sequences of cash flows. One involves four payments of USD35,000 each. They are known at $t_{0}$ and paid at the end of each 6-month period.  

![](a560d19575d0568d7d918aa0cac4eb96861a3ef7db88a1efad8587fb34bcb469.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.7  

Cash flows of fixed payer and fixed receiver in an interest-rate swap.  

The second is shown in Figure 4.7b. These cash flows are determined by the value of 6-month USD LIBOR to be observed at set dates. Four separate LIBOR rates will be observed during this period. The $L_{t_{0}}$ is known at the initial point $t_{0}$ . The remaining LIBOR rates, $L_{t_{1}},L_{t_{2}}$ ; and $L_{t_{3}}$ ; will be observed gradually as time passes but are unknown initially.  

In Figure 4.7, the floating cash flows depending on $L_{t_{i}}$ are observed at time $t_{i}$ but are paid-inarrears at times $t_{i+1}$ . Swaps that have this characteristic are known as paid-in-arrears swaps.  

Clearly, we have two sets of cash flows with different market risk characteristics. The market will price them separately. Once this is done, market participants can trade them. A fixed payer will pay the cash flows in Figure 4.7a and receive the one in Figure 4.7b. This institution is the buyer of the interest-rate swap.  

The market participant on the other side of the deal will be doing the reverse—receiving cash flows based on a fixed interest rate at time $t_{0}$ , while paying cash flows that become gradually known as time passes and the LIBOR rates $L_{t_{i}}$ are revealed. This party is the fixed receiver, whom the market also calls the seller of the swap.11 These cash flows of the fixed receiver are shown in Figure 4.7c and d. We can always make the exchange of the two cash flows acceptable to both parties by adding a proper spread to one of the cash flows.12 This role is played by the swap spread. The market includes the spread in the fixed rate. By adjusting this spread accordingly, the two parties may be brought together and accept the exchange of one cash flow against another. The agreed fixed rate is the swap rate. We have  

The benchmark rate is often selected as the same maturity sovereign bond in that currency.  

The final cash flows of an interest-rate swap from the fixed payer’s point of view will be as shown in Figure 4.5. Only the net amount will change hands.  

A real-life example might be helpful. In the following, we consider a private company that is contemplating an increase in the proportion of its floating rate debt. The company can do this by issuing short-term paper, called commercial paper (CP), and continuing to roll over the debt when these obligations mature. But a second way of doing it is by first issuing a 5-year fixed-rate bond and then swapping the interest paid into floating interest rates.  

# EXAMPLE  

A corporation considers issuing commercial paper or a medium-term fixed-rate bond (MTN) that it can convert to a floating-rate liability via a swap. The company is looking to increase the share of floating-rate liabilities to $50-55\%$ from $30\%$ .  

The alternative to tapping the MTN market is drawing on its $\$700$ million commercial paper facility.  

This reading shows one role played by swaps in daily decisions faced by corporate treasuries. The existence of swaps makes the rates observed in the important CP sector more closely related to the interest rates in the MTN sector.  

# 4.4.2.1 Basis swaps  

Basis swaps are similar to currency swaps except that often there is only one currency involved. A basis swap involves exchanging cash flows in one floating rate, against cash flows in another floating rate, in the same currency. One of the involved interest rates is often a non-LIBOR-based rate, and the other is LIBOR.  

The following reading gives an idea about the basis swap. Fannie Mae, a US government agency, borrows from international money markets in USD LIBOR and then lends these funds to mortgage banks. Fannie Mae faces a basis risk while doing this. There is a small difference between the interest rate that it eventually pays, which is USD LIBOR, and the interest rate it eventually receives, the USD discount rate. To hedge its position, Fannie Mae needs to convert one floating rate to the other. This is the topic of the reading that follows:  

# EXAMPLE  

Merrill Lynch has been using Fannie Mae benchmark bonds to price and hedge its billion dollar discount/ basis swap business. “We have used the benchmark bonds as a pricing tool for our discount/LIBOR basis swaps since the day they were issued. We continue to use them to price the swaps and hedge our exposure,” said the head of interest-rate derivatives trading.   
He added that hedging activity was centered on the 5- and 10-year bonds—the typical discount/LIBOR basis swap tenors. Discount/LIBOR swaps and notes are employed extensively by US agencies, such as Fannie Mae, to hedge their basis risk. They lend at the US discount rate but fund themselves at the LIBOR rate and as a result are exposed to the LIBOR/discount rate spread. Under the basis swap, the agency/ municipality receives LIBOR and in return pays the discount rate.   
Major US derivative providers began offering discount/LIBOR basis swaps several years ago and now run billion dollar books.  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1229).  

This reading illustrates two things. Fannie Mae needs to swap one floating rate to another in order to allow the receipts and payments to be based on the same risk. But at the same time, because Fannie Mae is hedging using basis swaps and because there is a large amount of such Fannie Mae bonds, some market practitioners may think that these agency bonds make good pricing tools for basis swaps themselves.  

# 4.4.2.2 What is an asset swap?  

The term asset swap can, in principle, be used for any type of swap. After all, sequences of cash flows considered thus far are generated by some assets, indices, or reference rates. Also, swaps linked to equity indices or reference rates such as LIBOR can easily be visualized as FRNs, corporate bond portfolios, or portfolios of stocks. Exchanging these cash flows is equivalent to exchanging the underlying asset.  

Yet, the term asset swap is often used with a more precise meaning. Consider a defaultable par bond that pays annual coupon $c_{t_{0}}$ . Suppose the payments are semiannual. Then we can imagine a swap where coupon payments are exchanged against 6-month LIBOR $L_{t_{i}}$ plus a spread $\overline{{S_{t_{0}}}}$ , every 6 months. The coupon payments are fixed and known at $t_{0}$ . The floating payments will be random, although the spread component, $s_{t_{0}}$ , is known at time $t_{0}$ as well. This structure is often labeled an asset swap.13 The reader can easily put together the cash flows implied by this instrument, if the issue of default is ignored. Such a cash flow diagram would follow the exchanges as shown in Figure 4.4. One sequence of cash flows would represent coupons, the other LIBOR plus a spread.  

Asset swaps interpreted this way offer a useful alternative to investors. An investor can always buy a bond and receive the coupon $c_{t_{0}}$ . But by using an asset swap, the investor can also swap out of the coupon payments and receive only floating LIBOR plus the spread $s_{t_{0}}$ . This way the exposure to the issuer is kept and the exposure to fixed interest rates is eliminated. In fact, treasury bonds or fixed receiver interest swaps may be better choices if one desires exposure to fixed interest rates. Given the use of LIBOR in this structure, the $s_{t_{0}}$ is calculated as the spread to the corresponding fixed swap rates.  

# 4.4.2.3 More complex swaps  

The swaps discussed thus far are liquid and are traded actively. One can imagine many other swaps. Some of these are also liquid, others are not. Amortizing swaps, bullion swaps, MBS swaps, quanto (differential) swaps, inflation swaps, longevity swaps14 are some that come to mind. We will not elaborate on them at this point; some of these swaps will be introduced as examples or exercises in later chapters.  

An interesting special case is constant maturity swaps (CMS), which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 14. The CMS swaps have an interesting convexity dimension that requires taking into account volatilities and correlations across various forward rates along a yield curve. A related swap category is constant maturity treasury (CMT) swaps.  

# 4.4.3 SWAP CONVENTIONS  

Interest-rate swap markets have their own conventions. In some economies, the market quotes the swap spread. This is the case for USD interest-rate swaps. USD interest-rates swaps are quoted as a spread to Treasuries. In Australia, the market also quotes swap spreads. But the spreads are to bond futures.  

In other economies, the market quotes the swap rate. This is the case for euro interest-rate swaps.  

Next, there is the issue of how to quote swaps. This is done in terms of two-way interest-rate quotes. But sometimes the quoted swap rate is on an annual basis, and sometimes it is on a semiannual basis. Also, the day-count conventions change from one market to another. In USD swaps, the day-count is in general ACT/360. In EUR swaps day-count is 30/360.  

According to market conventions, a fixed payer, called the payer, is long the swap, and has bought a swap. On the other hand, a fixed receiver, called the receiver, is short the swap, and has sold a swap.  

# 4.5 ENGINEERING INTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

We now study the financial engineering of swaps. We focus on plain vanilla interest-rate swaps. Engineering of other swaps is similar in many ways and is left to the reader. For simplicity, we deal with a case of only three settlement dates. Figure 4.8 shows a fixed-payer, three-period

Decomposition of an interest-rate swap.  

interest-rate swap, with start date $t_{0}$ . The swap is initiated at date $t_{0}$ . The party will make three fixed payments and receive three floating payments at dates $t_{1}$ , $t_{2}$ , and $t_{3}$ in the same currency. The dates $t_{1},t_{2}$ , and $t_{3}$ are the settlement dates. The $t_{0},t_{1}$ , and $t_{2}$ are also the reset dates, dates on which the relevant LIBOR rate is determined.  

We select the notional amount $N$ as unity and let $\delta=1$ , assuming that the floating rate is 12-month LIBOR:15  

$$
N=\$1
$$  

Under these simplified conditions, the fixed payments equal $s_{t_{0}}$ , and the LIBOR-linked payments equal $L_{t_{0}}$ , $L_{t_{1}}$ , and $L_{t_{2}}$ , respectively. The swap spread will be the difference between $s_{t_{0}}$ and the treasury rate on the bond with the same maturity, denoted by $\overline{{y_{t_{0}}}}$ .16 Thus, we have  

$$
\mathrm{Swap~spread}=s_{t_{0}}-y_{t_{0}}
$$  

We will study the engineering of this interest-rate swap. More precisely, we will discuss the way we can replicate this swap. More than the exact synthetic, what is of interest is the way(s) one can approach this problem.  

A swap can be reverse-engineered in at least two ways:  

1. We can first decompose the swap horizontally, into two streams of cash flows, one representing a floating stream of payments (receipts), the other a fixed stream. If this is done, then each stream can be interpreted as being linked to a certain type of bond.  

2. Second, we can decompose the swap vertically, slicing it into $n$ cash exchanges during $n$ time periods. If this is done, then each cash exchange can be interpreted similarly (but not identically) to an FRA paid-in-arrears, with the property that the fixed rate is constant across various settlement dates.  

We now study each method in detail.  

# 4.5.1 A HORIZONTAL DECOMPOSITION  

First we simplify the notation and the parameters used in this section. To concentrate on the engineering aspects only, we prefer to eliminate some variables from the discussion. For example, we assume that the swap will make payments every year so that the day-count parameter is $\delta=1$ , unless assumed otherwise. Next, we discuss a forward swap that is signed at time $t_{0}$ , but starts at time $t_{1}$ , with $t_{0}<t_{1}$ . During this discussion, we may occasionally omit the use of the term “forward” and refer to the forward swap simply as a swap.17  

The traditional way to decompose an interest-rate swap is to do this horizontally. The original swap cash flows are shown in Figure 4.8a. Before we start, we need to use a trick. We add and subtract the same notional amount $N$ at the start, and end dates, for both sequences of cash flows. Since these involve identical currencies and identical amounts, they cancel out and we recover the standard exchanges of floating versus fixed-rate payments. With the addition and subtraction of the initial principals, the swap will look as shown in Figure 4.8b.  

Next, “detach” the cash flows in Figure 4.8b horizontally, so as to obtain two separate cash flows as shown in Figure 4.8c and d. Note that each sequence of cash flows is already in the form of a meaningful financial contract.  

In fact, Figure 4.8c can immediately be recognized as representing a long forward position in an FRN that pays LIBOR flat. At time $t_{1}$ , the initial amount $N$ is paid and $L_{t_{1}}$ is set. At $t_{2}$ , the first interest payment is received, and this will continue until time $t_{4}$ where the last interest is received along with the principal.  

Figure 4.8d can be recognized as a short forward position on a par coupon bond that pays a coupon equal to $s_{t_{0}}$ . We (short) sell the bond to receive $N_{\astrosun}$ . At every payment date, the fixed coupon is paid and then, at $t_{4}$ , we pay the last coupon and the principal $N$ .  

Thus, the immediate decomposition suggests the following synthetic:  

Here the bond in question needs to have the same credit risk as in a flat LIBOR-based loan. Using this representation, it is straightforward to write the contractual equation:  

![](1455bf3e057f993319a239d0f241fb97ea4d8fba86f6d8c6a27f8bc35d5907ac.jpg)  

Using this relationship, one can follow the methodology introduced earlier and immediately generate some interesting synthetics.  

# 4.5.1.1 A synthetic coupon bond  

Suppose a AAA-rated entity with negligible default risk issues only 3-year FRNs that pay LIBOR—10 bp every 12 months.18 A client would like to buy a coupon bond from this entity, but it turns out that no such bonds are issued. We can help our client by synthetically creating the bond. To do this, we manipulate the contractual equation so that we have a long coupon bond on the right-hand side:  

![](d62a35df466cecad09cb50769f5f10879308528dd3ea8c833edd929e8e0e8e49.jpg)  

The geometry of this engineering is shown in Figure 4.9. The synthetic results in a coupon bond issued by the same entity and paying a coupon of $s_{t_{0}}-10$ bp. The $10\mathrm{{bp}}$ included in the coupon accounts for the fact that the security is issued by a AAA-rated entity.  

# 4.5.1.2 Pricing  

The contractual equation obtained in Eq. (4.35) permits pricing the swap off the debt markets, using observed prices of fixed and floating coupon bonds.19 To see this, we write the present value of the cash streams generated by the fixed and floating rate bonds using appropriate discount factors. Throughout this section, we will work with a special case of a 3-year spot swap that makes fixed  

![](7a737914106be80cd874a3f4625b4d19145b4af35317601388c47c1de3b23281.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.9  

Creation of a synthetic bond.  

payments against 12-month LIBOR. This simplifies the discussion. It is also straightforward to generalize the ensuing formulas to an $n$ -year swap.  

Suppose the swap makes three annual coupon payments, each equaling $s_{t_{0}}N$ . We also have three floating rate payments, each with the value $\begin{array}{r}{L_{t_{i-1}}N}\end{array}$ , where the relevant LIBOR $\overline{{L_{t_{i-1}}}}$ is set at $t_{i}-1$ but is paid at $t_{i}$ .  

# 4.5.1.3 Valuing fixed cash flows  

To obtain the present value of the fixed cash flows, we discount them by the relevant floating rates. Note that, $i f$ we knew the floating rates $\{L_{t_{0}},L_{t_{1}},L_{t_{2}}\}$ , we could write  

$$
\mathrm{PV-fixed}=\frac{s_{t_{0}}N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})}+\frac{s_{t_{0}}N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})}+\frac{s_{t_{0}}N+N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})(1+L_{t_{2}})}
$$  

where we added $N$ to date $t_{3}$ cash flows. But at $t=0$ , the LIBOR rates $L_{t_{i}},\ i=1,2$ , are unknown. Yet, we know that against each $L_{t_{i}}$ ; $i=1,2$ , the market is willing to pay the known forward, (FRA) rate, $F(t_{0},\ t_{i})$ . Thus, using the FRA rates as $i f$ they are the time $t_{0}$ market values of the unknown LIBOR rates, we get  

$$
+\frac{s_{t_{0}}N+N}{(1+F(t_{0},t_{0}))(1+F(t_{0},t_{1}))(1+F(t_{0},t_{2}))}
$$  

All the right-hand side quantities are known, and the present value can be calculated exactly, given the st0 .  

# 4.5.1.4 Valuing floating cash flows  

For the floating rate cash flows, we have2  

Here, to get a numerical answer, we don’t even need to use the forward rates. This present value can be written in a much simpler fashion, once we realize the following transformation:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\displaystyle{\frac{L_{t_{2}}N+N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})(1+L_{t_{2}})}=\frac{(1+L_{t_{2}})N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})(1+L_{t_{2}})}}}}\\ {{=\displaystyle{\frac{N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})}}}}\end{array}
$$  

Then, add this to the second term on the right-hand side of the present value in Eq. (4.33) and use the same simplification,  

$$
\frac{L_{t_{1}}N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})}+\frac{N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})(1+L_{t_{1}})}=\frac{N}{(1+L_{t_{0}})}
$$  

Finally, apply the same trick to the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (4.33) and obtain, somewhat surprisingly, the expression  

$$
\mathrm{PV~of~floating~payments~as~of~}t_{0}=N
$$  

According to this, the present value of an FRN equals the par value $N$ at every settlement date. Such recursive simplifications can be applied to present values of floating rate payments at reset dates.21 We can now combine these by letting  

PV of fixed payments as of $t_{0}=\mathrm{PV}$ of floating payments as of $t_{0}$  

This gives an equation where $s_{t_{0}}$ can be considered as an unknown:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\displaystyle\frac{s_{t_{0}}N}{(1+F(t_{0},t_{0}))}+\frac{s_{t_{0}}N}{(1+F(t_{0},t_{0}))(1+F(t_{0},t_{1}))}}\\ {\displaystyle+\frac{s_{t_{0}}N+N}{(1+F(t_{0},t_{0}))(1+F(t_{0},t_{1}))(1+F(t_{0},t_{2}))}=N}\end{array}
$$  

Canceling the $N$ and rearranging, we can obtain the numerical value of $s_{t_{0}}$ given $F(t_{0},t_{0}),F(t_{0},t_{1}).$ , and $F(t_{0},t_{2})$ . This would value the swap off the FRA markets.  

# 4.5.1.5 An important remark  

Note a very convenient, but very delicate operation that was used in the preceding derivation. Using the liquid FRA markets, we “replaced” the unknown $L_{t_{i}}$ by the known $F(t_{0},t_{i})$ in the appropriate formulas. Yet, these formulas were nonlinear in $L_{t_{i}}$ and even if the forward rate is an unbiased forecast of the appropriate LIBOR,  

$$
F(t_{0},t_{i})=E_{t_{0}}^{P*}[L_{t_{i}}]
$$  

under some appropriate probability $P^{*}$ , it is not clear whether the substitution is justifiable. For example, it is known that the conditional expectation operator at time $t_{0}$ , represented by $E_{t_{0}}^{P*}[.].$ , cannot be moved inside a nonlinear formula due to Jensen’s inequality:  

$$
E_{t_{0}}^{P*}\biggl[\frac{1}{1+L_{t_{i}}\delta}\biggr]>\frac{1}{1+E_{t_{0}}^{P*}[L_{t_{i}}]\delta}
$$  

So, it is not clear how $L_{t_{i}}$ can be replaced by the corresponding $F(t_{0},t_{i})$ , even when the relation in Eq. (4.48) is true. These questions will have to be discussed after the introduction of risk-neutral and forward measures in Chapters 12 and 13. Such “substitutions” are delicate and depend on many conditions. In our case, we are allowed to make the substitution, because the forward rate is what the market “pays” for the corresponding LIBOR rates at time $t_{0}$ .  

# 4.5.2 A VERTICAL DECOMPOSITION  

We now study the second way of decomposing the swap. We already know what FRA contracts are. Consider an annual FRA where the $\delta=1$ . Also, let the FRA be paid-in-arrear. Then, at some time $t_{i}+\delta$ , the FRA parties will exchange the cash flow:  

$$
(L_{t_{i}}-F(t_{0},t_{i}))\delta N
$$  

where $N$ is the notional amount, $\delta=1$ , and the $F(t_{0},t_{i})$ is the FRA rate determined at time $t_{0}$ . We also know that the FRA amounts to exchanging the fixed payment $F(t_{0},t_{i})\delta N$ against the floating payment $L_{t_{i}}\delta N$ .  

Is it possible to decompose a swap into $n$ FRAs, each with an FRA rate $F(t_{0},\ t_{i})$ , $i=1,...,n?$ The situation is shown in Figure 4.10 for the case $n=3$ . The swap cash flows are split by slicing the swap vertically at each payment date. Figure 4.10b d represents each swap cash flow separately. A fixed payment is made against an unknown floating LIBOR rate, in each case.  

Are the cash exchanges shown in Figure 4.10 d tradeable contracts? In particular, are they valid FRA contracts, so that the swap becomes a portfolio of three FRAs? At first glance, the cash  

![](a0a7286236c4eb57d3995a683a793c1d93e7b19f7e0d350df201d5e680c093b9.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.10  

Decompose a swap into FRAs.  

flows indeed look like FRAs. But when we analyze this claim more closely, we see that these cash flows are not valid contracts individually.  

To understand this, consider the time $t_{2}$ settlement in Figure 4.10b together with the FRA cash flows for the same settlement date, as shown in Figure 4.11. This figure displays an important phenomenon concerning cash flow analysis. Consider the FRA cash flows initiated at time $t_{0}$ and settled in arrears at time $t_{2}$ and compare these with the corresponding swap settlement. The two  

![](8167573aa06cb7720fe49f94eb5cf74978c3b52fbd2883d89d3bf2089a72a5a3.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.11  

Settlement differences between FRAs and swaps.  

cash flows look similar. A fixed rate is exchanged in the same fashion against LIBOR rate $L_{t_{1}}$ observed at time $t_{1}$ . But there is still an important difference.  

First of all, note that the FRA rate $F(t_{0},t_{i})$ is determined by supply and demand or by pricing through money markets. Thus, in general  

$$
F(t_{0},t_{i})\neq s_{t_{0}}
$$  

This means that if we buy the cash flow in Figure 4.11a and sell the cash flow in Figure 4.11b, LIBOR-based cash flows will cancel out, but the fixed payments won’t. As a result, the portfolio will have a known negative or positive net cash flow at time $t_{2}$ , as shown in Figure 4.11c. Since this cash flow is known exactly, the present value of this portfolio cannot be zero. But the present value of the FRA cash flow is zero, since (newly initiated) FRA contracts do not have any initial cash payments. All these imply that the time $t_{2}$ cash flow shown in Figure 4.11c will have a known present value,  

$$
B(t_{0},t_{2})[F(t_{0},t_{1})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N
$$  

where the $B(t_{0},t_{2})$ is the time $t_{0}$ value of the default-free zero coupon bond that matures at time $t_{2}$ , with par value USD 1. This present value will be positive or negative depending on whether $F(t_{0},t_{1})<s_{t_{0}}$ or not.  

Hence, slicing the swap contract vertically into separate FRA-like cash exchanges does not result in tradeable financial contracts. In fact, the time $t_{2}$ exchange shown in Figure 4.11c has a missing time $t_{0}$ cash flow of size $B(t_{0},t_{2})[F(t_{0},t_{1})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N$ . Only by adding this, does the exchange become a tradeable contract. The $s_{t_{0}}$ is a fair exchange for the risks associated with $L_{t_{0}},L_{t_{1}}$ , and $\overline{{L_{t_{2}}}}$ on the average. As a result, the time $t_{2}$ cash exchange that is part of the swap contract ceases to have a zero present value when considered individually.  

# 4.5.2.1 Pricing  

We have seen that it is not possible to interpret the individual swap settlements as FRA contracts directly. The two exchanges have a nonzero present value, while the (newly initiated) FRA contracts have a price of zero. But the previous analysis is still useful for pricing the swap since it gives us an important relationship.  

In fact, we just showed that the time $t_{2}$ element of the swap has the present value $B(t_{0},t_{2})[F(t_{0},t_{1})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N$ , which is not, normally, zero. This must be true for all swap settlements individually. Yet, the swap cash flows altogether do have zero present value. This leads to the following important pricing relation:  

$$
B(t_{0},t_{1})[F(t_{0},t_{0})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N+B(t_{0},t_{2})[F(t_{0},t_{1})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N+B(t_{0},t_{3})[F(t_{0},t_{2})-s_{t_{0}}]\delta N=0
$$  

Rearranging provides a formula that ties the swap rate to FRA rates:  

$$
s_{t_{0}}=\frac{B(t_{0},t_{1})[F(t_{0},t_{0})+B(t_{0},t_{2})F(t_{0},t_{1})+B(t_{0},t_{3})F(t_{0},t_{2})}{B(t_{0},t_{1})+B(t_{0},t_{2})+B(t_{0},t_{3})}
$$  

This means that we can price swaps off the FRA market as well. The general formula, where $n$ is the maturity of the swap,  

$$
s_{t_{0}}={\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}B(t_{0},t_{i})F(t_{0},t_{i-1})}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}B(t_{0},t_{i})}}
$$  

will be used routinely in this book. It is an important arbitrage relationship between swap rates and FRA rates.  

# 4.6 USES OF SWAPS  

The general idea involving the use of swaps in financial engineering is easy to summarize. A swap involves exchanges of cash flows. But cash flows are generated by assets, liabilities, and other commitments. This means that swaps are simply a standardized, liquid, and cost-effective alternative to trading cash assets. Instead of trading the cash asset or liability, we are simply trading the cash flows generated by it. Because swaps, in general, have zero value at the time of initiation, and are very liquid, this will indeed be a cost-effective alternative—hence their use in position taking, hedging, and risk management. What are these uses of swaps? We begin the discussion by looking at the uses of interest-rate swaps in this chapter. The uses of commodity, credit default, and FX swaps are somewhat different and we discuss their uses in detail in separate chapters on financial engineering applications to those asset classes. We will see that these swaps have convenient balance sheet implications. Regulatory and tax treatment of equity swaps are also relevant.  

# 4.6.1 USES OF EQUITY SWAPS  

Equity swaps illustrate the versatility of swap instruments.  

# 4.6.1.1 Fund management  

There is a huge industry of fund management where the fund manager tries to track some equity index. One way to do this is by buying the underlying portfolio of stocks that replicates the index and constantly readjusting it as the market moves, or as new funds are received, or paid by the fund. This is a fairly complex operation. Of course, one can use the S&P 500 futures to accomplish this. But futures contracts need to be rolled over and they require mark-to-market adjustments. Using equity swaps is a cost-effective alternative.  

The fund manager could enter into an equity swap using the S&P 500 in which the fund will pay, quarterly, a LIBOR-related rate and a (positive or negative) spread and receive the return on the S&P 500 index for a period of $n$ years.2  

The example below is similar to the one seen earlier in this chapter. Investors were looking for cost-effective ways to diversify their portfolios.  

# EXAMPLE  

In one equity swap, the holder of the instrument pays the total return on the S&P 500 and   
receives the return on the FTSE 100. Its advantage for the investor is the fact that, as a   
swap, it does not involve paying any up-front premium. The same position cannot be replicated by selling S&P stocks and buying FTSE 100   
stocks.  

The second paragraph emphasizes one convenience of the equity swap. Because it is based directly on an index, equity-swap payoffs do not have any “tracking error.” On the other hand, the attempt to replicate an index using underlying stocks is bound to contain some replication error.  

# 4.6.1.2 Tax advantages  

Equity swaps are not only “cheaper” and more efficient ways of taking a position on indices, but may have some tax and ownership advantages as well. For example, if an investor wants to sell a stock that has appreciated significantly, then doing this through an outright sale will be subject to capital gains taxes. Instead, the investor can keep the stock, but, get into an equity swap where he or she pays the capital gains (losses) and dividends acquired from the stock, and receives some LIBOR-related return and a spread. This is equivalent to selling the stock and placing the received funds in an interbank deposit.  

# 4.6.1.3 Regulations  

Finally, equity swaps help in executing some strategies that otherwise may not be possible to implement due to regulatory considerations. In the following example, with the use of equity-swaps investment in an emerging market becomes feasible.  

# EXAMPLE  

Since the Kospi 200 futures were introduced foreign securities houses and investors have been frustrated by the foreign investment limits placed on the instrument. They can only execute trades if they secure an   
allotment of foreign open interest first, and any allotments secured are lost when the contract expires. Positions cannot be rolled over. Foreigners can only hold $15\%$ of the $3$ -month daily average of open   
interest, while individual investors with “Korean Investor IDs” are limited to $3\%$ . Recognizing the   
bottleneck, Korean securities houses such as Hyundai Securities have responded by offering foreign   
participants equity swaps which are not limited by the restrictions.   
The structure is quite simple. A master swap agreement is established between the foreign client and an offshore subsidiary or a special purpose vehicle of the Korean securities company. Under the master   
agreement, foreigners execute equity swaps with the offshore entity which replicate the futures contract. Because the swap transactions involve two nonresident parties and are booked overseas, the foreign   
investment limits cannot be applied.   
The Korean securities houses hedge the swaps in the futures market and book the trades in their proprietary book. Obviously, as a resident entity, the foreign investment limits are not applied to the hedging trade. Once the master swap agreement is established, the foreign client can contact the Korean securities company directly in Seoul, execute any number of trades, and have them booked and compiled against the master swap agreement (Thomson Reuters IFR, January 27, 1996).  

The reading shows how restrictions on (1) ownership, (2) trading, and (3) rolling positions over can be handled using an equity swap. The reading also displays the structure of the equity swap that is put in place and some technical details associated with it.  

One of the strongest growth areas in the asset management industry has been the area of absolute return $\mathrm{UCITS}^{23}$ in Europe and $^{,}40$ Act funds in the United States as hedge fund techniques area applied in more traditional fund vehicles.24 However, some of the techniques used to implement hedge fund techniques in these retail structures are designed to circumvent regulatory restrictions and have generated controversy as the following example shows.  

# EXAMPLE  

In recent years some fund management companies have launched UCITS funds that use alternative investment strategies typically found in hedge funds. Some funds have succeeded in circumventing UCITS restrictions on eligible assets by using total return swaps (TRS). Typically UCITS funds cannot hold  

commodity futures, for example, but some funds have used TRSs with banks in which the fund receives the returns on a commodity futures in return for a swap rate paid to the bank counterparty. Some of the most active users of TRS were Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) that sometimes used TRS to create the majority of the funds return. CTAs are alternative investment funds that use long and short positions in liquid futures markets across all asset classes to express their investment views. Other examples of TRS use included long/short equity funds that use TRS structures to create short exposures since physical shorting is not permitted in UCITS funds. Such total return swaps can be used not just to hold assets that are not normally eligible in UCITS structures but also to raise leverage beyond levels prescribed by UCITS regulation as the following example illustrates: ‘The Dunn WMA Ucits Fund, for example, holds a total return swap on a proprietary index that can be up to 35 times leveraged $I\cdot\cdot\cdot J$ Industry figures described this figure as “horrid” [Source: Financial Times 13/11/2011]’ Such UCITS funds are the exception but leverage levels of this magnitude are clearly not in the spirit of UCITS regulation.  

Although the majority of UCITS funds do not use such TRS structures, there is a fear that poor performance by a UCITS fund that uses such structures could tarnish the brand. This is of particular concern as a result of European attempts to sell UCITS structures in different Asian jurisdictions. Asian regulators can be expected to take a dim view of UCITS funds if they do not protect retail investors that they are typically marked to.  

(Source: Financial Times, 13/11/2011).25  

One can distinguish two different types of total returns swaps. The first type is a so-called funded TRS, in which a fund, such as a UCITS fund, pays the swap counterparty, such as a bank, to finance the swap. The fund receives collateral from the (bank) counterparty and if the collateral is less than the value of the swap this exposes the fund to counterparty risk. Such a structure can be used by UCITS funds for example that try to replicate a CTA strategy or index. The second type is an unfunded swap, in which the assets are held by custodian. The custodian manages the payments between the counterparties. One counterparty can be a UCITS fund, for example, and the other a swap provider. The fund pays a fee or financing spread to compensate the swap provider for having to borrow to finance the swap. However, TRS are a rather imperfect way of replicating certain alternative investment strategies such as CTA or managed futures strategies as the following reading illustrates:  

Much of the expected tracking error in managed futures funds using a TRS is down to the additional costs imposed by the swaps, underlying hidden charges and [. . .] administering a bespoke index  

(Source: Financial Times, 13/11/2011).26  

These issues raise the question whether TRS are a cost effective tool for long-term investors to achieve their investment objectives.  

# 4.6.1.4 Creating synthetic positions  

The following example is a good illustration of how equity swaps can be used to create synthetic positions.  

# EXAMPLE  

Equity derivative bankers have devised equity-swap trades to (handle) the regulations that prevent them from   
shorting shares in Taiwan, South Korea, and possibly Malaysia. The technique is not new but has reemerged   
as convertible bond (CB) issuance has picked up in the region, and especially in these three countries. Bankers have been selling equity swaps to CB arbitrageurs, who need to short the underlying shares but   
have been prohibited from doing so by local market regulations. It is more common for a CB trader to take a short equity-swap position with a natural holder of the   
stock. The stockholder will swap his long stock position for a long equity-swap position. This provides the   
CB trader with more flexibility to trade the physical shares. When the swap matures—usually 1 year later—   
the shares are returned to the institution and the swap is settled for cash.  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, December 5, 2001).  

In this example, a CB trader needs to short a security by an amount that changes continuously.27 A convenient way to handle such operations is for the CB trader to write an equity swap that pays the equity returns to an investor and gets the investors’ physical shares to do the hedging.  

# 4.6.1.5 Stripping credit risk  

Suppose we would like to strip the credit risk implicit in a defaultable coupon bond. Note that the main problem is that the bond yield will depend on two risks. First is the credit spread and second is the interest-rate risk. An asset swap, where we pay a fixed swap rate and receive LIBOR, will then eliminate the interest-rate risk in the bond. The result is called asset swap spread.  

# 4.6.2 USING INTEREST-RATE AND OTHER SWAPS  

Interest-rate swaps play a much more fundamental role than equity swaps. In fact, all swaps can be used in balance sheet management. Balance sheets contain several cash flows; using the swap, one can switch these cash flow characteristics. Swaps are used in hedging. They have zero value at time of initiation and hence don’t require any funding. A market practitioner can easily cover his positions in equity, commodities, and fixed income by quickly arranging proper swaps and then unwind these positions when there is no need for the hedge.  

Finally, swaps are also trading instruments. In fact, one can construct spread trades most conveniently by using various types of swaps. Some possible spread trades are given by the following:  

Pay $n$ -period fixed rate $s_{t_{0}}$ and receive floating LIBOR with notional amount $N$ .   
Pay $L_{t_{i}}$ and receive $r_{t_{i}}$ both floating rates, in the same currency. This is a basis swap.   
Pay and receive two floating rates in different currencies. This will be a currency swap.  

As these examples show, swaps can pretty much turn every interesting instrument into some sort of “spread product.” This will reduce the underlying credit risks, make the value of the swap zero at initiation, and, if properly designed, make the position relatively easy to value.  

# 4.6.3 TWO USES OF INTEREST-RATE SWAPS  

We now consider two examples of the use of interest-rate swaps.  

# 4.6.3.1 Changing portfolio duration  

As we saw in the previous chapter, duration is the “average” maturity of a fixed-income portfolio. It turns out that in general the largest fixed-income liabilities are managed by governments, due to the existence of government debt. Depending on market conditions, governments may want to adjust the average maturity of their debt. Swaps can be very useful here. The following example illustrates this point.  

# EXAMPLE  

France and Germany are preparing to join Italy in using interest-rate swaps to manage their debt. Swaps can be used to adjust debt duration and reduce interest-rate costs, but government trading of over-thecounter derivatives could distort spreads and tempt banks to front-run sovereign positions. The United States and United Kingdom say they have no plans to use swaps to manage domestic debt.   
As much as E150 billion of swap use by France is possible over the next couple of years, though the actual figure could be much less, according to an official at the French debt management agency. That is the amount that would be needed if we were to rely on only swaps to bring about “a [significant] shortening of the average duration of our debt,” an official said. France has E644.8 billion of debt outstanding, with an average maturity of 6 years and 73 days.   
The official said decisions would be made in September about how to handle actual swap transactions. “If E150 billion was suddenly spread in the market, it could produce an awful mess,” he said  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1392).  

Using swap instruments, similar adjustments to the duration of liabilities can routinely be made by corporations as well.  

How can measures of interest-rate risk such as DV01 and duration discussed in the previous chapter be applied to swaps? In principle, the DV01 of receiving fixed in a fixed-for-floating interest-rate swap is equal to the DV01 of its fixed leg minus the DV01 of its floating leg. Thus the duration of a swap can be calculated like that of a fixed and a floating rate bond. However, for practical purposes, this is not very useful since the different legs of the swap are exposed to movements in different parts of the term structure of interest rates. The floating leg is more exposed to movements in long-term interest rates while the short leg is exposed to movements in the short leg. Therefore, market participants in practice use different approaches to hedge the short and the long legs of the swap. These more advanced methodological approaches involve multifactor risk metrics and address the weakness resulting from our assumption in the previous chapter that movements in the entire term structure can be described by one interest-rate factor.  

# 4.6.3.2 Using swaps to reduce a country’s debt level  

Although governments oftentimes fret about the use of swaps by companies, sometimes governments use swaps to achieve their own objectives. Italy and Greece, for example, were two countries  

that used swaps to mask and reduce their debt levels in the run-up to their membership of the European Monetary Union.  

# EXAMPLE  

The Goldman Sachs transaction swapped debt issued by Greece in dollars and yen for euros using an   
historical exchange rate, a mechanism that implied a reduction in debt, Sardelis said. It also used an off  
market interest-rate swap to repay the loan. Those swaps allow counterparties to exchange two forms of   
interest payment, such as fixed or floating rates, referenced to a notional amount of debt. The trading costs on the swap rose because the deal had a notional value of more than 15 billion euros,   
more than the amount of the loan itself, said a former Greek official with knowledge of the transaction who   
asked not to be identified because the pricing was private. The size and complexity of the deal meant that   
Goldman Sachs charged proportionately higher trading fees than for deals of a more standard size and   
structure, he said. “It looks like an extremely profitable transaction for Goldman,” said Saul Haydon Rowe, a partner in   
Devon Capital LLP, a London-based firm that advises global investors on derivatives disputes. [. . .] Cross-currency swaps are contracts borrowers use to convert foreign currency debt into a domestic  
currency obligation using the market exchange rate. As first reported in 2003, Goldman Sachs used a   
fictitious, historical exchange rate in the swaps to make about $2\%$ of Greece’s debt disappear from its   
national accounts. To repay the 2.8 billion euros it borrowed from the bank, Greece entered into a separate   
swap contract tied to interest-rate swings. Falling bond yields caused that bet to sour, and tweaks to the deal failed to prevent the debt from almost   
doubling in size by the time the swap was restructured in August 2005. Greece, which last month secured a second, 130 billion-euro bailout, is sitting on debt equal to about   
160% of its GDP as of last year.

# 4.6.3.3 Technical uses  

Swaps have technical uses. The following example shows that they can be utilized in designing new bond futures contracts where the delivery is tied not to bonds, but to swaps.  

# EXAMPLE  

LIFFE is to launch its swap-based LIBOR Financed Bond on October 18. Both contracts are designed to avoid the severe squeeze that has afflicted the Deutsche Terminboerse Bund future in recent weeks.   
LIFFE’s new contract differs from the traditional bond future in that it is swap-referenced rather than bond-referenced. Instead of being settled by delivery of cash bonds chosen from a delivery basket, the LIBOR Financed Bond is linked to the International Swap and Derivatives Association benchmark swap rate. At expiry, the contract is cash-settled with reference to this swap rate.   
Being cash-settled, the Liffe contract avoids the possibility of a short squeeze—where the price of the cheapest to deliver bond is driven up as the settlement day approaches. And being referenced to a swap curve rather than a bond basket, the contract eliminates any convexity and duration risk. The LIBOR Financed Bond replicates the convexity of a comparable swap position and therefore reduces the basis risk resulting from hedging with cash bonds or bond futures.  

An exchange-based contender for benchmark status, the DTB Bund, has drawn fire in recent weeks following a short squeeze in the September expiry. In the week before, the gross basis between the cheapest to deliver Bund and the Bund future was driven down to 23.5. The squeeze had been driven by a flight to quality on the back of the emerging market crisis. Open interest in the Bund future is above 600,000 contracts or DM15 billion. In contrast, the total deliverable basket for German government bonds is roughly DM74 billion and the cheapest to deliver account to DM30 billion. Officials from the DTB have always contended that there will be no lack of deliverable Bunds. They claim actual delivery has only been made in about $4\%$ of open positions in the past  

(Thomson Reuters IFR Issue 1327).  

In fact, several new cash-settled futures contracts were recently introduced by LIFFE and CME on swaps. CME launched EUR-denominated deliverable interest-rate swap futures (Euro DSF) on April 14, 2014.29 Swaps are used as the underlying instrument. Without the existence of liquid swap markets, a swap futures contract would have no such reference point and would have to be referenced to a bond basket.  

# 4.7 MECHANICS OF SWAPPING NEW ISSUES  

The swap engineering introduced in this chapter has ignored several minor technical points that need to be taken into account in practical applications. Most of these are minor and are due to differences in market conventions in bonds, money markets, and swap markets. In this section, we provide a discussion of some of these technical issues concerning interest-rate swaps. In other swap markets, such as in commodity swaps, further technicalities may need to be taken into account. A more or less comprehensive list is as follows:  

1. Real-world applications of swaps deal with new bond issues, and new bond issues imply fees, commissions, and other expenses that have to be taken into account in calculating the true cost of the funds. This leads to the notion of all-in-cost, which is different to the “interest rate” that will be paid by the issuer.  

We will show in detail how all-in-cost is calculated, and how it is handled in swapping new issues.  

2. Interest-rate swaps deal with fixed and floating rates simultaneously. The corresponding LIBOR is often taken as the floating rate, while the swap rate, or the relevant swap spread, is taken as the fixed rate. Another real-world complication appears at this point.  

Conventions for quoting money market rates, bond rates, and swap rates usually differ. This requires converting rates defined in one basis, into another.  

In particular, money market rates such as LIBOR are quoted on an ACT/360 basis, while some bonds are quoted on an annual or semiannual 30/360 basis. In swap engineering, these cash flows are exchanged at regular times, and hence appropriate adjustments need to be made.

3. In this chapter we mostly ignored credit risk. This greatly simplified the exposition because swap rates and corporate rates of similar maturities became equal. In financial markets, they usually are not. Issuers have different credit ratings and bonds sold by them and carry credit spreads that are different from the swap spread. This gives rise to new complications in matching cash flows of coupon bonds and interest-rate swaps. We need to look at some examples of this as well.   
4. Finally, the mechanics of how new issues are swapped into fixed or floating rates and how this may lead to sub-LIBOR financing is an interesting topic by itself.  

The discussion will be conducted with a real-life, new issue, explained next. First we report the “market reaction” to the bond, and second we have the details of the new issue (Table 4.1).  

# EXAMPLE  

South Korea’s Shinhan Bank, rated Baa1/BBB by Moody’s and S&P, priced its USD200 million 3-year bond early last week (. . .). The deal came with a $4\%$ coupon and offered a spread of 168.8 bp over the 2-year US Treasury, equivalent to 63 bp over LIBOR.   
This was some 6 bp wide of the Korea Development Bank (KDB) curve, although it was the borrower’s intention to price flat to it. Despite failing to reach this target, the borrower still managed to secure a coupon that is the lowest on an Asian bond deal since the regional crisis, thanks to falling US Treasury yields which have shrunk on a renewed flight to safe haven assets  

(Thomson Reuters IFR, issue 1444).  

Consider now the basic steps of swapping this new issue into floating USD funds.30 The issuer has to enter into a 3-year interest-rate swap agreement. How should this be done, and what are the relevant parameters? Suppose at the time of the issue, the market makers were quoting the swap spreads as given in Table 4.2. First we consider the calculation of all-in-cost for the preceding deal.31  

# 4.7.1 ALL-IN-COST  

The information given in the details of the new issue implies that the coupon is $4\%$ . But, this is not the true costs of funds from the point of view of the issuer. There are at least three additional factors that need to be taken into account. (1) The reoffer price is not 100, but 99.659. This means that for each bond, the issuer will receive less cash than the par. (2) Fees have to be paid. (3) Although not mentioned in the information in Table 4.1, the issuer has legal and documentation expenses. We assume that these were USD75,000.  

To calculate the fixed all-in-cost (30/360 basis), we have to calculate the proceeds first. Proceeds is the net cash received by the issuer after the sale of the bonds. In our case, using the terminology of Table 4.1,  

$$
{\mathrm{Proceeds}}={\mathrm{Amount}}\times\left({\frac{\mathrm{Price}}{100}}-{\mathrm{Fees}}\right)-{\mathrm{Expenses}}
$$  

Plugging in the relevant amounts,  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathrm{Proceeds}=200,000,000(0.99659-0.0020)-75,000}}\\ {{=198,843,000}}\end{array}
$$  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Table 4.2 USD Swap Index Versus 12 month LIBOR, Semi, 30/360</td></tr><tr><td>Maturity</td><td>Bid Spread</td><td>Ask Spread</td><td>The Bid-Ask Swap Rate</td></tr><tr><td>2 years</td><td>42</td><td>46</td><td>2.706-2.750</td></tr><tr><td>3 years</td><td>65</td><td>69</td><td>3.341-3.384</td></tr><tr><td>4 years</td><td>70</td><td>74</td><td>3.796-3.838</td></tr><tr><td>5 years</td><td>65</td><td>69</td><td>4.147-4.187</td></tr><tr><td>7 years</td><td>75</td><td>79</td><td>4.653-4.694</td></tr><tr><td>10 years</td><td>61</td><td>65</td><td>5.115-5.159</td></tr><tr><td>12 years</td><td>82</td><td>86</td><td>5.325-5.369</td></tr><tr><td>15 years</td><td>104</td><td>108</td><td>5.545-5.589</td></tr><tr><td>20 years</td><td>126</td><td>130</td><td>5.765-5.809</td></tr><tr><td>30 years</td><td>50</td><td>54</td><td>5.834-5.885</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Next, we see that the bond will make three coupon payments of 8 million each. Finally, the principal is returned in 3 years. The cash flows associated with this issue are summarized in Figure 4.12. What is the internal rate of return of this cash flow? This is given by the formula  

$$
198,843,000={\frac{8,000,000}{\left(1+y\right)}}+{\frac{8,000,000}{\left(1+y\right)^{2}}}+{\frac{8,000,000+200,000,000}{\left(1+y\right)^{3}}}
$$  

The $y$ that solves this equation is the internal rate of return. It can be interpreted as the true cost of the deal, and it is the fixed all-in-cost under the (30/360) day-count basis. The calculation gives  

$$
y=0.04209
$$  

This is the fixed all-in-cost.  

The next step is to swap this issue into floating and obtain the floating all-in-cost. Suppose we have the same notional amount of $\$200$ million and consider a fixed to floating 3-year interest-rate swap. Table 4.2 gives the 3-year receiver swap rate as $3.341\%$ . This is, by definition, a 30/360, semiannual rate.  

![](f4ec5749b7772db88cb7827a942c1f16cf39a5b46cc6975a0dc2d330bda74012.jpg)  

# FIGURE 4.12  

New issue and interest-rate swap cash flows.  

This requires converting the semiannual swap rate into an annual 30/360 rate, denoted by $r$ . This is done as follows:  

$$
(1+r)=\left(1+0.03341{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^{2}
$$  

which gives  

$$
r=3.369\%
$$  

With a $\$200$ million notional, this is translated into three fixed receipts of  

$$
200,000,000(0.03369)=6,738,000
$$  

each. The cash flows are shown in Figure 4.12.  

Clearly, the fixed swap receipts are not equal to the fixed annual coupon payments, which are $\$8$ million each. Apparently, the issuer pays a higher rate than the swap rate due to higher credit risk. To make these two equal, we need to increase the fixed receipts by  

$$
8,000,000-6,738,000=1,262,000
$$  

This can be accomplished by increasing both the floating rate paid and the fixed rate received by equivalent amounts. This can be accomplished if the issuer accepts paying LIBOR plus a spread equivalent to the 66 bp. Yet, here the 66 bp is p.a. 30/360, whereas the LIBOR convention is p.a. ACT/360. So the basis point difference of 66 bp may need to be adjusted further.32 The final figure will be the floating all-in-cost and will be around $60~\mathrm{bp}$ .  

# 4.8 SOME CONVENTIONS  

If you have a coupon bond and the payment date falls on a nonworking day, then the payment will be made on the first following working day. But the amount does not change. In swaps, this convention is slightly different. The payment is again delayed to the next working day.33 But the payment amount will be adjusted according to the actual number of days. This means that the payment dates and the amounts may not coincide exactly in case swaps are used as hedges for fixed-income portfolios. Most swaps involve terminology and documentation that have been standardized by the International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and involve a Master ISDA agreement in place before dealing.  

# 4.8.1 QUOTES  

Suppose we see quotes on interest-rate swaps or some other liquid swap. Does this mean we can deal on them? Not necessarily. Observed swap rates may be available as such only to a bank’s best customers; others may have to pay more. In practice, the bid ask spreads on liquid instruments are very tight, and a few large institutions dominate the market.  

# 4.9 ADDITIONAL TERMINOLOGY  

We would like to introduce some additional terms and instruments before moving on.  

A par swap is the formal name of the interest-rate swaps that we have been using in this chapter. It is basically a swap structure calculated over an initial and final (nominal) exchange of a principal equal to 100. This way, there will be no additional cash payments at the time of initiation.  

An accrual swap is an interest-rate swap in which one party pays a standard floating reference rate, such as LIBOR, and receives LIBOR plus a spread. But the interest payments to the counterparty will accrue only for days on which LIBOR stays within preset upper and lower boundaries.  

An extendible swap is a swap in which one party has the right to extend a swap beyond its original term.  

A power LIBOR swap is a swap that pays LIBOR squared or cubed (and so on), less a fixed amount/rate, in exchange for a floating rate.  

A LIBOR-in-arrears swap is a swap in which the interest paid on a particular date is determined by that date’s interest rate rather than the interest rate of the previous payment date.  

# 4.10 CONCLUSIONS  

Why buy and sell securities when you can swap the corresponding returns and achieve the same objective efficiently, and at minimal cost?  

In fact, selling or buying a security may not be practical in many cases. First, these operations generate cash which needs to be taken care of. Second, the security may not be very liquid and selling it may not be easy. Third, once a security is sold, search costs arise when, for some reason, we need it back. Can we find it? For how much? What are the commissions? Swapping the corresponding returns may cost less.  

Due to their eliminating the need to use cash in buying and selling transactions, combining these two operations into one, and eliminating potential credit risks, swaps have become a major tool for financial engineers.  

# SUGGESTED READING  

Swaps are vanilla products, and there are several recommended books that deal with them. This chapter has provided a nontechnical introduction to swaps, hence we will list references at the same level. For a good introduction to swap markets, we recommend McDougall (1999). Flavell (2009) and Das (1994) give details of swaps and discuss many examples. Serrat and Tuckman (2011) describe risk management and hedging involving swaps in greater detail than this chapter allowed for space reasons.  

# EXERCISES  

1. On March 3, 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a crucial player in financial engineering problems, published a series of important new proposals concerning the accounting of certain derivatives.34 It is known as Statement 133 and affects the daily lives of risk managers and financial engineers significantly. One of the treasurers who is affected by the new rules had the following comment on these new rules: Statement 133 in and of itself will make it a problem from an accounting point of view to do swaps. The amendment does not allow for a distinction to be made between users of aggressive swap hedges and those involved in more typical swaps. According to Thomson Reuters IFR, this treasurer has used synthetic swaps to get around [the FAS 133].35 a. Ignoring the details of swaps as an instrument, what is the main point in FAS 133 that disturbs this market participant? b. How does the treasurer expect to get around this problem by constructing synthetics?  

2. Read the following episode carefully. Italian Asset Swap Volumes Soar on Buyback Plans, Volumes in the basis-swap spread market doubled last week as traders entered swaps in response to the Italian treasury’s announcement that it “does not rule out buybacks.” Traders said the increase in volume was exceptional given that so many investors are on holiday at this time of year. Traders and investors were entering trades designed to profit if the treasury initiates a buyback program and the bonds increase in value as they become scarcer and outperform the swaps curve. A trader said in a typical trade the investor owns the 30-year Italian government bond and enters a swap in which it pays the $6\%$ coupon and receives 10.5 basis points over 6-month Euribor. “Since traders started entering the position last Monday, the spread has narrowed to 8 bps over Euribor,” he added. The trader thinks the spread could narrow to 6.5 bps over Euribor within the next month if conditions in the equity and emerging markets improve. A trader at a major European bank predicts this could go to Euribor flat over the next 6 months. The typical notional size of the trades is E50 million (USD43.65 million) and the maturity is 30 years (Thomson Reuters IFR, Issue 1217). a. Suppose there is an Italian swap curve along with a yield curve obtained from Italian government bonds (sovereign curve). Suppose this latter is upward sloping. Discuss how the two curves might shift relative to each other if the Italian government buys back some bonds. b. Is it important which bonds are bought back? Discuss. c. Show the cash flows of a 5-year Italian government coupon bond (paying $6\%$ ) and the cash flows of a fixed-payer interest-rate swap. d. What is the reason behind the existence of the 10.15 bp spread? e. What happens to this spread when government buys back bonds? Show your conclusions using cash flow diagrams.  

3. You are a swap dealer and you have the following deals on your book: Long  

2-year receiver vanilla interest-rate swap, at $6.75\%$ p.a. 30/360. USD $N=50$ million. 3-year receiver vanilla interest-rate swap, at $7.00\%$ p.a. 30/360. USD $N=10$ million. Short 5-year receiver vanilla interest-rate swap, at $7.55\%$ p.a. 30/360. USD $N=10$ million. a. Show the cash flows of each swap. b. What is your net position in terms of cash flows? Show this on a graph. c. Calculate the present values of each swap using the swap curve:  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Maturity</td><td>Bid-Ask</td></tr><tr><td>２</td><td>6.75-6.80</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>6.88-6.92</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>7.02-7.08</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>7.45-7.50</td></tr><tr><td>６</td><td>8.00-8.05</td></tr></table></body></html>  

d. What is your net position in terms of present value?  

e. How would you hedge this with a 4-year swap? Which position would you take, and what should the notional amount be?   
f. Where would you go to get this hedge?   
g. Can you suggest another hedge?
