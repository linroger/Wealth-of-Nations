# INTRODUCTION  

Your intellectual curiosity and patience are rewarded. The closing chapter, one of conjecture and surmise, is at hand. Though predictions about the future of banking maybe unavoidable, they are also often fraught with drama. With provocative titles like, “The Banks of Tomorrow: Think Google and Facebook”1 or “Banks Need to Take on Amazon and Google or Die,”2 scribblers raise the specter of existential threats. Overlooked is the possibility that banks of the future may look neither like Google and Facebook nor like contemporary banks. New kinds of intermediaries may emerge with the capability to eclipse existing banks as well as extant social media paragons.  

In this chapter, we begin with a discussion of the main drivers for change in the financial services industry. Three are especially compelling: governmental intervention/regulation, information technology, and customer preferences. As discussed in previous chapters, government regulation is ever-present in reshaping financial markets and institutions. Technology, however, may be even more powerful in driving change. It is indispensable for the deepening of financial markets, the emergence of new distribution channels, and for financial innovations, including those in payments systems. It may encourage disintermediation and disaggregation of the value chain. For example, specialized payments providers may emerge, and internet-based platforms may allow for open-source financial services like peer-to-peer (P-2-P) lending bypassing intermediaries. Changes in customer preferences play a key role as well. In part, technology is changing social attitudes and customer preferences. Witness how the development of hand-held mobile devices like smartphones has transformed consumer purchase and payment practices. How will banks and other intermediaries in the value chain respond to these developments, and what future scenarios are likely to be generated?  

While changes in customer preferences and payments technology may most directly affect retail banking, we will argue that major developments can be expected in corporate and investment banking as well.  

# CHANGE DRIVERS  

Public regulation, technology, and customer preferences are perhaps most disruptive and can be seen as the primary forces of change. Chapters 15 and 16 explained how the Great Recession led to a major expansion of regulation. This trend toward more intrusive governmental regulation is likely to continue with structural implications for the banking industry. Information technology is reshaping the financial services industry too. Shifts from credit and debit cards to mobile and digital means of payment are already in evidence. Social media and the internet create new challenges for extant business models as they reduce the cost of information and encourage its dissemination in unpredictable ways. Technology disaggregates the value chain and introduces new players, processes, and products. As this happens, new externalities and risks are likely to emerge, encouraging the development of new types of governmental regulations, for example, witness the recent push to regulate the internet in the United States and the discussion surrounding “net neutrality.” There is thus a natural dynamic in the interaction between technology and regulation; one that is continuously evolving and not easily understood.

FIGURE 18.1 Forces Affecting the Industry.  

Apart from regulation and information technology, we see a third force for change in the financial landscape – evolving customer preferences. Consumers desire empowerment and more control over their finances. Social media affect the process by which customers are engaged, and want to be reached. A more detailed discussion of each of these forces follows. Figure 18.1 displays the various forces. While information technology, regulation and customer preferences are identified as the key forces driving change, Figure 18.1 also recognizes the importance of privacy concerns and globalization. We discuss privacy concerns – particularly surrounding the use of data – in the following section on regulation. Globalization is not a force that is discussed explicitly, but obviously has an impact on the structure of the industry and the effectiveness of nation-based regulation. Geo-political developments (from Russia, Middle-East to concerns about foreign ownership of domestic assets) may impact the degree of globalization in the years to come as well as cross-border financial flows and the international scope of financial institutions.  

# Regulation  

Recent legislation in Europe, the United States and the rest of the world has empowered public regulators at the expense of shareholders and management (private interests). This incursion was responsive to:  

growth in global systemic risk with increasing integration of markets and institutions both within and across countries;   
growing complexity of regulations;   
social and political agendas assigned to banks and markets;   
other social and economic concerns.  

Following is a discussion of each.  

# Global Systemic Risk and Interconnectedness  

One aspect of the Great Recession that caught regulators by surprise was the violence with which shocks in one part of the financial system were transmitted to others. The subprime mortgage crisis in the United States – triggered a worldwide trauma. As we saw in Chapter 17  financial institutions and markets are increasingly integrated within and across national boundaries. Interconnectedness, globalization, and the proliferation of financial claims slowed a bit during the 2007–2009 financial crisis, but are likely to reassert their full force. Therefore, we expect financial system contagion to not only continue in the future, but possibly even become more pronounced.  

Intrafinancial sector linkages can be expected to mushroom as well. The linkages of shadow banks – which mostly escaped regulatory oversight prior to the 2007–2009 crisis – to other parts of the financial system may have been motivated by the economic demands of the system (including regulatory arbitrage), have also promoted opacity and fragility. In particular, the regulatory costs faced by legacy depository institutions spur the development of the shadow financial system that, in turn, renders regulation less effective. Not only will central banks need to track more voluminous flows of information that involve both traditional financial institutions as well as shadow banking and other forms of market-based finance, but they will need a better understanding of what all of these information flows imply about systemic risk. The effectiveness of the regulatory response (see Chapters 15 and 16) is still unclear.  

# Complexity of Regulations  

As global financial markets, institutions, and contracts become more complex, regulators strive to keep pace by enacting increasingly intrusive regulations. The Dodd–Frank Act weighed in at more than 2000 pages and it spawned many more thousands of pages of directives. However, more regulations lead to ever more circumventing innovation or regulatory arbitrage. Unintended consequences often engender costs that outweigh any conceivable benefits of the original regulation.  

While some have advocated simpler approaches to regulation,3 this dynamic of more regulations and innovative approaches to circumvent them is difficult to counter. Limiting the burden of regulation might encourage the industry to choose simpler and more transparent business models. But gaps in regulation are inevitable and there will always be the fringe players who exploit the public safety net. As these actions lead to visible problems and failures, regulators will step in with more intrusive regulation. The unintended consequences can be considerable. In particular, the resulting regulatory burden may deter entry into the industry and promote further activities “in the shadows.”4  

# Social and Political Agendas  

Politics has always played a role in the regulation of banks and financial markets. The allocation of credit is of enormous economic significance, so if it can be controlled by politicians, it can serve political and social agendas. As social movements – focusing on poverty, social discrimination, income and wealth inequality, diversity, global warming, etc. – or even sectoral preferences, such as housing and agriculture, gather momentum, the pressure on financial institutions grows.5 The financial system thereby becomes an instrument of social planning and the efficient provision of financial services is sacrificed.  

# Other Social and Economic Concerns  

A related social agenda seeks to strengthen the fiduciary responsibility of financial institutions. In several countries, financial intermediaries have been criticized for selling inappropriate products, providing misleading information, and/or failing to verify that their products meet the legitimate needs of customers. In the United Kingdom and The Netherlands, for example, major scandals involving insurance-related pension products are winding their way through the courts. In the United States, billions of dollars in fines have been imposed on banks for selling toxic investment products while allegedly misrepresenting information. The European watchdog for systemic risk – the ESRB (ESRB, 2014) – has declared that the “mis-selling” of products to customers is a financial stability concern and has recommended assessing business practices as an integral part of prudential supervision. For decades, investment advisers in the United States have been constrained by “suitability” requirements. The more recent Dodd–Frank Act has created a new consumer protection agency to further discourage misrepresentation of financial services.  

Privacy is yet another public policy concern. Ongoing initiatives across the world put increasingly stringent restrictions on financial institutions’ use of client data. Competition is another concern. Some countries – particularly the United Kingdom – have attacked monopolistic concentrations as banks have grown larger and fewer through mergers and acquisitions.  

These various concerns suggest an evolving regulatory landscape that will have a major impact on the financial services industry of the future. The ultimate financial system design will depend upon how the tension between private and public interests is resolved. Will the struggle between Wall Street and Main Street abate, or will the public backlash against the financial services industry continue? The intrusiveness of public regulation will depend on how the industry is publicly perceived and on this score there is quite a bit of fence mending that lies ahead for the global financial services industry.  

# Technology  

Information technology is the great enabler. Markets and institutions have become more integrated, and financial innovations have proliferated, particularly those that enhance the tradability of assets and the transfer of risks that previously resided on the balance sheets of financial institutions. Also, distribution channels, payments systems, and more generally the way the financial services sector provides services and interacts with potential customers, are all affected by information technology. This more fluid landscape creates regulatory challenges and reshapes the business of banking. Several related questions follow:  

Will technology firms displace banks in the provision of payments services? Can banks retain their retail customers? Will P-2-P lending, crowdfunding, and other alternative credit arrangements circumscribe the market for traditional banks? Will nondeposit financial institutions and nonfinancial businesses make further inroads in the business of banking?  Will traditional banks suffer disproportionally from rising costs owing to more intrusive public regulators giving rise to an ever-expanding shadow banking system? How will evolving debt and equity markets (both public and private) affect investment and commercial banks?  

We will address these questions later in the chapter.  

# Customer Preferences  

The rise of social media and the sought immediacy of consumer gratification will have implications for financial services firms. The digital and mobile economy alters customer service expectations and affects the way customers perceive their financial institution. The ability to effect transactions online instantaneously has not only made the multiday delays of traditional providers annoying anachronisms, but also made the interaction between bank and customers more anonymous. It also made it easier for customers to change providers and “shop around” for the best deal.  

The vast branch of networks will either evolve or disappear. Bank branches, like coffee shops, may become socialexchanges and entertainment-driven marketing vehicles. Traditional branch services are likely to be digitized and delivered remotely via the cloud. Millennials take pride in never setting foot in a bank branch, and if this should change in the future, it will be for a yet undetermined motive. Security concerns in the digitized world are somehow going to be resolved. Biometrically based security might become standard practice and intelligent software that uses retinal recognition or venous identification might discourage fraud.  

The connection between an increasingly digitized customer and the financial services provider of the future is yet to develop. What role will loyalty play? What kind of cross-selling will be obtained? Particularly in Europe, where the social welfare state retreats and distrust of financial institutions are widespread, consumers have a great desire for independence and empowerment. Trusted institutions do not hawk toxic financial products on their clientele, and if they do, serious consequences should ensue.  

Banks feel the pressure to connect to society, and be responsive to environmentally conscious citizens. Customers want their banks to behave in a socially responsible fashion and to be accountable. Possibly in response to these pressures, many banks have adopted mission statements emphasizing their commitment to the environment and the long-term well-being of people and society. Goldman Sachs emphasizes its “responsibility for environmental and social stewardship,” and Deutsche Bank emphasizes its “commitment to long-term environmental sustainability.” The extent to which these statements permeate the culture and business decisions of these banks remains to be seen. Are these PR gimmicks or authentic statements of purpose? We do not know. However, some banks even have centered their whole business model and decision processes around sustainability, and chosen an ownership structure that safeguards their environmental mission. Triodos Bank of The Netherlands is an example of that. See Figure 18.2 for illustrative statements of these banks.  

Building trust will be paramount. Transparency in the operations of financial institutions will be expected. To be successful, banks will need a better understanding of their customers and to tailor product offerings accordingly. To achieve this, banks will need a greater service ethic and show true commitment to their clientele. A profound change in banking culture and compensation practices will be required.  

# Interrelationships Between Drivers for Change  

The drivers for change are interrelated. For example, parts of social media that play a role in shaping customer behavior (and possibly customer preferences) are products of information technology. And technology may facilitate regulatory arbitrage, evoking a regulatory response. Social media may also elevate systemic risks through herding behavior that leads “We take seriously our responsibility for environmental and social stewardship and are committed to leveraging our people, capital and ideas to further effective market-based solutions that help address critical environmental issues.” See: http://www.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/environmental-stewardship-and-sustainability/ “Deutsche Bank has a commitment to long-term environmental sustainability. This includes reducing the Bank’s own impact (e.g., reducing waste and working towards becoming more carbon neutral) and supporting innovative new technology.” See: https://www.db.com/unitedkingdom/content/en/sustainability.html

to bank runs, bubbles, and manias. Change drivers all have a level of unpredictability that elevates uncertainty about th future of banking.  

# INITIATIVES THAT ARE CHANGING THE LANDSCAPE  

The proliferation of web-based services and data-processing capabilities is changing the financial services landscape. Major changes are evident in distribution systems and the way financial institutions interact with their clientele. In addition, there are new disruptive players on the periphery with business models that challenge existing practices and institutions.  

# Payments  

This core area of banking is being coveted by technology firms and payment specialists like Google, Apple, and PayPal; Bitcoin as a more fundamental innovation affecting payments processes is discussed later. A much discussed example is Apple Pay, announced as a payment system that will run on the iPhone obviating the need for debit or credit cards. (See Box 18.1 )  

# BOX 18.1 Apple on Apple Pay  

“Apple® today announced Apple Pay™, a new category of service that will transform mobile payments with an easy, secure and private way to pay. […] Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, issued by the most popular banks including Bank of America, Capital One Bank, Chase, Citi and Wells Fargo, representing 83 percent of credit card purchase volume in the US. In addition to the 258 Apple retail stores in the US, some of the nation’s leading retailers that will support Apple Pay include Bloomingdale’s, Disney Store and Walt Disney World Resort, Duane Reade, Macy’s, McDonald’s, Sephora, Staples, Subway, Walgreens and Whole Foods Market. Apple Watch will also work at the over 220,000 merchant locations across the US that have contactless payment enabled. Apple Pay is also able to make purchases through apps in the App StoreSM ”  

Press release, September 9, 2014, “Apple announces Apple Pay.”  

So far, banks have maintained their central role in payments because they control the infrastructure for settling payments, are perceived to be crucial for security, and have a strong hold on customers’ clearing accounts. Also, the payments innovators are not typically independent of banks, but have developed in joint ventures or other types of alliances with traditional banks. In some countries, banks themselves have managed to offer the leading on-line payments solution. For example, the Scandinavian (Nordic European) banks are providing mobile banking with high-growth user bases, and in The Netherlands, the payment firm Currence, owned by the leading Dutch banks, has a market share of approximately $60\%$ of online payments.6  

Payments are a highly contested area that may trigger major changes in the financial services industry. Should the new payments solution providers undermine the banks direct interface with customers, cross-selling opportunities might be lost. In any case, online platforms will be developed that could disrupt existing financial institutions. We turn to this next.  

# Online Platforms and Disaggregation  

Disaggregation of the value chain could follow from online platforms becoming the preferred customer interface. Online platforms could offer a supermarket type model facilitating access to various products and services of disparate providers along with record keeping. Technology firms such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, or Apple may use a payments solution such as Apple Pay as a platform and gain direct customer interface for related products and services. Legacy financial institutions then might be relegated to serving as the back office to the platform.  

Desired empowerment and autonomy dictate that customers feel in control and do not view themselves as being steered to goods for the benefit of the platform owner. Customers’ possible need for assistance in making informed decisions may provide an opportunity for existing financial institutions to adopt the role of financial advisors but possible conflicts arise when these institutions have their own products to sell. Conflicts of interest erode the credibility of institutions, but if financial institutions can find a way to maintain credibility as trusted advisors many new possibilities may emerge.  

The competition between banks and alternative providers for the payments business will not spare purveyors. The weapons of this contest will be technology and marketing savvy. The disruptive forces affecting banking – technology, regulation, and customer preferences – may also offer new opportunities for other businesses that have tried to enter banking. For example, Tesco, a large UK supermarket chain provides banking services to its customers under its own brand. There is also no reason why a platform should be limited to offering only financial services. A lifestyle oriented focus could integrate financial and nonfinancial offerings. What does this imply for banks as stand-alone entities? Would this transform them into back-office service providers, or can they remain in the lead and safeguard their turf as financial services providers?7  

The ultimate outcome may well turn on how the government intervenes. Public regulation may differentially tax, subsidize, or judiciously ignore various players. Here we see the complicated interplay of customer preferences, technological disruptions, and the restraining hand of government seeking to control financial services. Would banks continue to be special and protected by bank licenses? For now, governments seem keen to control their financial players and grant them special status (including providing them with implicit and explicit guarantees).  

# Direct Lending and Disintermediation  

The financial services platform might act as a market place where people interact directly and financial institutions serve the limited role of an advisor or broker. P-2-P lending has parties transacting directly without the benefit of a financial intermediary (except possibly for back-office services). The platform would reduce search costs and therefore serve as a broker. However, issues inhibiting direct lending have been asymmetric information and moral hazard which financial intermediaries mitigate rather effectively.  

New specialized lenders have arisen that seek to replace relationship lenders and traditional credit scoring with sophisticated algorithms based on Big Data mining (data analytics). While still in its infancy, such analysis predicts creditworthiness by analyzing buying habits, memberships, reading proclivities, lifestyle choices, and all manner of behavioral and demographic correlates. Similarly, the growing availability of inexpensive information allows for public certification of creditworthiness similar to the trustworthiness scores on eBay, or the client satisfaction scores on TripAdvisor. One could envision similar developments enabling P-2-P lending as well. Whether society will accept the widespread use of these data is a different matter. In any event, more and more potentially sensitive personal information can already be obtained with a few mouse clicks. Big Data may also facilitate crowdfunding, another form of direct lending involving multiple lenders and a singular borrower.8  

At the consumer level, we may see a (re)emergence of more community-oriented arrangements. As P-2-P lending and crowdfunding suggest, customers may take matters in their own hands, leading to consumer empowerment and disintermediation. Local arrangements may emerge where communities organize their financial affairs directly. Particularly in Europe, where social welfare states previously led to centralization, the trend is toward decentralization of services and private initiative. Whereas markets are becoming more global, people want more control over their own affairs and local initiatives and consumer empowerment may thrive.  

# Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies  

Bitcoin, a purely virtual currency, exists in a digital form exclusively.9 The highly publicized spectacular volatility in the value of Bitcoin has attracted much attention to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is just one example, albeit by far the most well known. There is disagreement as to whether Bitcoin represents an authentic currency in providing a stable store of value, but its potential as an alternative vehicle for transactions is less controversial. Bitcoin bypasses the existing institutional payments system by using a distributed ledger technology (called ‘blockchain’; see next section) that enables participants to transact with each other without the need for a central coordinating party like a bank. As such, it is P-2-P electronic cash that permits payment without the involvement of traditional financial institutions. A typical credit card transaction involves at least five parties (banks at both ends, a credit card company, a payment processor, and a clearing house) and takes days to settle. With Bitcoins, a transaction merely requires a transfer between Bitcoin accounts and an electronic verification process. Bitcoin (or lesser known cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Litecoin) is unlikely to replace major currencies as a medium of exchange anytime soon. However, it has demonstrated the viability of an electronic currency, privately created, absent government backing . It is an early-stage innovation; the institutional structure is still developing. A key question is what regulatory framework will be developed for such cryptocurrencies? While having Bitcoin as a purely private-sector developed currency is its major attraction, concerns about security and safety are inescapable. Can the technology safeguard the ownership and transaction infrastructure without government involvement? Major hacks have occurred at trading venues that serve as custodians and dealers in cryptocurrencies. And how will the public react if Bitcoins become the preferred medium of exchange for illegal activities? Another uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies is the high volatility of Bitcoin’s value relative to major currencies. For now, Bitcoin is a development in its infancy, yet showing progress. It has managed to be taken seriously. Few had expected that.  

# Blockchain (Distributed ledger technology)  

Distributed ledger technology (which is used in Bitcoin, but has much wider potential uses) is a method of verifying transactions and creating a sequential history of all (past) transactions. The technology consists of a digital database in which transactions can be verified with a system of blocks of records in a decentralized way. The database can be public, in which case we have a public Blockchain, as Bitcoin has. A large number of participating computers authenticate each transaction sequentially. Blockchains can also be private in which case access is limited. Such private blockchains might for example be used by companies in supply chain management or for record keeping. Pubic blockchains might replace existing structures like registrants of titles to land or other property. Also securities transactions might be a fruitful area for blockchain technology. Securities settlement often involves many intermediaries, making it slow and costly, and vulnerable to operational risks.10 Not surprisingly various exchanges are experimenting with blockchain.  

What this highlights is that blockchain technology has wide applications that go far beyond cryptocurrencies. For the financial sector the many potential applications of blockchain (and other new technologies that might come about) could well define the future financial services architecture.  

# Investment Banking, Trading, and Exchanges  

Much of the discussion thus far has involved commercial and retail banking. However, major changes in financial markets and investment banking are envisioned as well. Investment banks play an important role in bringing capital users and capital providers together. These banks are primarily engaged in public and private offerings of debt and equity claims and also maintain secondary markets in these securities thereby augmenting liquidity. In the run up to the Great Recession, investment banks were very active in securitizing home mortgages and in making a market for OTC derivatives, two of the financial instruments assigned greatest culpability. But this was not all: their trading activities across the board mushroomed.  

Investment banks also are subject to disruption by advances in technology, changes in public regulation and customer preferences. Two of the most prominent investment banks in the United States – Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns – failed in the Great Recession while others sustained embarrassing losses and severe devaluation of their equity. In retrospect, these banks processed too much risk and their losses had systemic implications. This latter observation prompted a major expansion in the public regulation of investment banks. Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the two bellwethers of U.S. investment banking, submitted to the regulation of the Federal Reserve in exchange for access to the discount window. Proprietary trading was curtailed and financial leverage was reduced from historically high levels. Major Wall Street institutions, previously relatively free of public regulation, were reigned in much like their cousins in commercial banking. Some believe the rigors of public regulation will be relaxed in time. The financial services industry is one of the best funded financial lobbies in both Washington, DC and state capitals. However, this is an agenda for the future.  

Technology affects investment banking and the capital markets by irreversibly lowering the costs of information, communication, and transportation.11 We expect new entry among capital providers. Hedge funds, pension managers, insurance companies, and private equity firms can all be expected to encroach on the traditional domain of investment banks further advancing integration and augmenting competition.  

Another uncertainty comes from the demand side for investment banking services. At the corporate level, firms may use variations on vehicles like trade finance to enhance capital availability to members of a production value chain without relying on commercial and investment banks. In industries with substantial investment needs involving deep uncertainties and dependence on a few customers, downstream and upstream financing for major investments (again circumventing banks and financial markets) may become more common. An example is Intel providing equity finance for ASML, a Dutch company that builds the machines that Intel uses for chip production. This may undermine the stronghold of investment banks in arranging securities offerings.  

Investment banks’ role in IPOs and secondary offerings also might be challenged by the internet-based platforms discussed earlier. If investors are easily reached and mobilized with targeted direct communication, one could envision a smaller role for investment banks, or at least one that makes them less indispensable and costly.12 Historically, however, investment banks have been adroit in moving from one business opportunity to another. Hence, rumors of their demise may be premature, and the competitive dynamics of the banking industry in relation to nonbank competitors have yet to unfold.  

# ARE BANKS DOOMED?  

What role will banks play in these developments? How will banks respond to payment solutions that Apple has enabled with its iPhones? Will we see an Apple Bank? These developments are not without risk for traditional banks. A major transition is going on in the industry, and the status quo may not be an option for incumbents.13  

This does not mean that banks are doomed. In the past, banking institutions have shown remarkable resilience, despite questions about their viability. As far back as 1994, prominent economists John Boyd and Mark Gertler commented on the predicted demise of banks in a well-known study titled, “Are Banks Dead? Or Are The Reports Greatly Exaggerated?”14 At that point, the discussion was about the banks’ role in lending. In particular, the question was whether securitization would undermine the banks’ lending franchise. They concluded that while securitization made banks less important for the actual funding of loans, the core functions of banks in the lending process – origination (including screening), servicing, and monitoring – would be preserved, as would the centrality of banks. Also, banks would typically play a role in the securitization vehicles by providing back-up lines of credit and guarantees of the commercial paper that funds many of the vehicles.  

The message of that article might still have some relevance today. With the mushrooming of the shadow banking sector, banks have not been entirely passive. They have broadened their scope and have successfully used the bank holding company structure to participate in the shadow banking system.15  

# Banks have Advantages  

Compared with threatened incumbents in other industries, banks benefit from the anxiety of people about the safety of their liquid wealth. The financial crisis of 2007–2009 may have created anxiety about the stability of banks, but banks are still seen as the place where money is safe. “In banks we trust” is not an empty slogan.16 The same cannot be said about all the new internet-based competitors. Whatever the popularity of Apple, will people trust technology companies in safeguarding their money? Being a bank with an implicit guarantee from the government has value.  

The perceived safety of banks and the special status that banks have in the financial system allow banks to have fundingcost advantages and earn extra rents vis-à-vis competitors. Interestingly, during and after the 2007–2009 financial crisis, investment banks assigned such a high value to a commercial bank license and access to deposits that the largest among them converted to bank holding companies. Indeed, being a bank, particularly a large bank, offers (subsidized) safety net benefits in addition to more stable short-term funding via deposits. This means that as long as banks manage themselves efficiently, invest intelligently, and avoid being stifled by public regulation they are unlikely to disappear any time soon. However, they do face serious challenges, particularly on the retail side, where banks will need to connect to their social-media-focused customers.  

# Size of Banks and the Financial Sector  

What about the scale and scope of financial institutions, and the size of the financial sector at large? Recent work suggests substantial scale economies in banking, particularly when it comes to back-office activities and payments.17 The message on scope – the span of activities – is less convincing. Typically, research has documented a “conglomerate discount,” which suggests that conglomeration is inefficient, but recent work shows that this discount largely disappears during crises, suggesting some benefits from “internal capital markets” during times of funding stress.18 More integrated banks may therefore coexist with more specialized players.  

![](images/7a6a07fca3e6a12e322e6fdf84e6dde97d95f30323afa58b7553eb319f283d5f.jpg)  
FIGURE 18.3 Financial Sector Share in GDP. (Source: McKinsey (2012), The Triple Transformation: Achieving a Sustainable Business Model. $2^{n d}$ McKinsey Annual Review on the Banking Industry, McKinsey & Company, October 2012, exhibit 13, page 27.)  

A related question is what needs to be under one corporate roof, and to what extent will services be offered in networks, alliances or joint ventures? Information technology has facilitated more complicated, larger organizations and hence augmented scale and scope economies.19 However, information technology has also facilitated smooth interfaces between independent firms, for example, insurance products could be offered through the distribution network of banks without banks owning the insurance company. Indeed, our earlier discussion on online platforms noted the ease with which products could be bundled in a distribution network.  

Apart from technological forces, regulatory and political developments will have a substantial impact on concentration. One could interpret the SIFI classification within Basel III (with its capital surcharges) as a size penalty. Whether this has a real impact in influencing financial institutions size and complexity remains to be seen. Another unknown is the degree to which banks will engage in cross-border banking. The 2007–2009 financial crisis has led to a retreat by institutions to home markets, but whether this is a temporary development is unclear. National supervisors have sought to strengthen their control over institutions operating within their countries. While developments like the Banking Union initiative in the EU may counter this somewhat, the recent trend is toward fragmentation along national lines. Clearly, cross-border banking, except for capital market activities, has experienced limited success. Cultural differences between countries expressed in terms of a more favorable attitude toward home-based institutions may explain this.  

What will happen to the financial sector as a fraction of the economy at large? We have documented in Chapter 17 that the financial sector has grown substantially over the last decades. But what will the future bring? Figure 18.3 shows that various crises in the last 35 years have only temporarily halted the growth of the financial sector as percentage of GDP.  

There are, however, reasons to envision a potential decline. The internet and information technology have resulted in declines in the number of bank branches. Together with an increasing automation of back offices, this may well reduce employment in the financial services industry. Investment banking may mirror what has already happened in the market for legal services where online research has reduced the demand for junior lawyers. A degree of commoditization can be expected as well in financial services which may reduce overall profitability.  

# CONCLUSION  

The interaction of technology, public regulation, and customer preferences will radically reshape financial institutions of the future. While there is considerable uncertainty about details, few deny that the online digital revolution will revolutionize banking. The consequent reconfiguration of institutions will have implications for economic and financial stability, but the key issue is how society will be served.  

Remember that the “real” economy is lubricated with elemental financial services. Thus, whatever the institutional arrangements, a growing and wealthier population will require liquidity (monetary services), credit, and risk redistribution services. These services will be produced with some combination of private and governmental inputs almost irrespective of institutional arrangements. However, the institutional arrangements will matter in so far as efficiency and the distribution of rents are concerned.  

The bigger picture is foretold by a colorful history. Advances in finance have moved steadily, inexorably from the physical to the virtual and from the simple to the complex. Flux and intangibility have been the companions of progress permitting finance to remain close to the center of economic activity while earning a not-so-modest profit for financiers.
