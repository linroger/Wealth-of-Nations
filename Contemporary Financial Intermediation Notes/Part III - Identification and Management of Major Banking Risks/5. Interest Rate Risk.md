# INTRODUCTION  

In this chapter, we take a deep dive into interest rate risk. Our focus is on how it is measured and how it is managed by financial institutions. Since the concept of interest rate risk is used in conjunction with fixed-income instruments, we begin with a review of how fixed-income instruments (like loans and bonds) are valued. Then we analyze the term structure of interest rates and discuss how the term structure is determined under certainty and uncertainty. This is followed by a discussion of duration and convexity  These concepts are basic to the notion of interest rate risk, so it is important to understand them before we discuss interest rate risk in detail, which we do next. Selected interest rate risk-management techniques are subsequently examined. A case study is provided to illustrate some practical issues in interest rate risk management.  

# THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES  

# Review of Fixed-Income Valuation  

What is the current value of a $\$250$ riskless cash flow to be received in 1 year? We solve this problem by using the principle of riskless arbitrage. In particular, to prevent riskless arbitrage – which is essential in an efficient capital market – the price of this riskless cash flow in equilibrium must be related to the prices of other riskless instruments. In particular, suppose we observe that a U.S. government bond that promises $\$100$ in 1 year is currently trading at $\$94.56$ . From this, we can deduce that the implicit 1-year return on riskless instruments is $5.75\%$ (since $\$94.56[1+0.0575]=\S100)$ . Thus, we should be currently willing to pay $\$250/[1.0575]=\S236.41$ for the riskless promise to receive $\$250$ in 1 year.  

But what if the riskless cash flow is promised to us 2 years from now? Well, then we have to find a riskless instrument of similar maturity (2 years) and payment characteristics (the only promised payment is 2 years from now and there are no interim payments). Suppose we observe that United States government “pure-discount” bonds with a 2-year maturity that promises a $\$100$ payment are currently trading at $\$88.58$ . Then we can deduce that the 2-year riskless yield, on an annualized basis, is given by, $i_{\mathrm{o}}^{2}$ , where $\$100/[1+i_{\mathrm{o}}^{2}]^{2}=\S88.58$ . Solving this equation implies an annual two-period yield of $i_{\mathrm{o}}^{2}=6.25\%$ . Thus, we get Figure 5.1  

That is, even though both the year 1 and year 2 cash flows are riskless, they have different discount rates applied to them. Why?  

The reason is that future one-period interest rates are expected to increase. In our example, we know that the 1-year riskless rate at date 0 is $5.75\%$ and the 2-year riskless rate at date 0 is $6.25\%$ . We can infer the 1-year riskless interest rate, $i_{1}^{1}$ , that is expected to prevail in the future at date 1. We can solve for it as follows:  

$$
\$221.45=\frac{\$250}
$$  

which yields $i_{1}^{1}=6.75\%$ . That is, the two-period rate of $6.25\%$ is the geometric average of the successive one-period rates, $5.75\%$ and $6.75\%$ .

# The Yield Curve  

What we have seen above is that interest rates on debt instruments of different maturities are related through investors’ expectations about future interest rates. A useful concept for this discussion is yield to maturity (YTM), which is defined as the internal rate of return that equates the present value of the future cash flows from a bond to the current market price of the bond. The annual two-period yield of $i_{o}^{2}=6.25\%$ that we derived above on a U.S. government bond is a YTM. The relationships among the yields on different bonds are summarized by the term structure of interest rates. We define the term structure of interest rates (or the yield curve) as the relationship between the YTM and the length of time to maturity for debt instruments of identical default risk characteristics. It is critical to equalize the default risk of the bonds whose yields we are comparing. For simplicity, we will confine our attention to bonds without default risk. Thus, the YTM on a bond with $m$ periods to maturity is defined as the annualized equivalent discount rate at which the cash flows from the bond must be discounted $m$ periods to arrive at its market price. Figures 5.2 and 5.3 show two different yield curves, each describing the yields of bonds that are identical, except in maturity. The yield curve in Figure 5.2 is for U.S. Treasuries and is upward sloping. It is the “on the run” curve, in which the implicit zero-coupon yield curve is interpolated from full-coupon bond prices. The yield curve in Figure 5.3 is for German government securities. It is cup shaped. For shorter maturities, this yield curve is “inverted,” that is, the YTM decreases with maturity. For intermediate maturities, it is virtually flat, that is, the YTM is almost independent of maturity in this range. And for longer maturities, the yield curve slopes upward, that is, the YTM rises with maturity.

FIGURE 5.3 Yield Curve for Government Securities in Germany as of March 22, 1993.  

What determines the shape of the yield curve? For simplicity, we will examine this question first in a world of perfect certainty. Uncertainty will be dealt with subsequently. In both cases, we assume that a financial market equilibrium precludes riskless arbitrage.  

# Yield Curve Determination Under Certainty  

The Basic Model  

Let $\mathbf{}P_{t}^{m}$ and $i_{t}^{m}$ be the price and YTM, respectively, at time $t$ of a bond of maturity $m$ years. We assume the unit of time is 1 year, and all bonds are traded, so that prices are available from the market. As an illustration, we will examine the yield relationship between two bonds, one with a maturity of 1 year and the other with a maturity of 2 years. For simplicity, we will assume that each is a zero-coupon (pure-discount) bond and has a face value, $F_{\mathrm{\bullet}}$ of $\$1$ . A zero-coupon bond makes a single promised payment (often called a balloon payment) at maturity, and no payments prior to that. Now, the YTM on the 1-year bond at the present time $(t=0)$ ), $i_{0}^{1},$ , is the internal rate of return that discounts the $\$1$ face value over one period to equal the current market price of the bond.  

$$
P_{0}^{1}=\frac{F}{1+\mathrm{YTM}}=\frac{1}{1+i_{0}^{1}}.
$$  

Similarly, the YTM on the 2-year bond at $t=0$ , $i_{0}^{2}$ , is the internal rate of return that discounts the $\$1$ face value over two periods to equal the current market price of the bond.  

$$
P_{0}^{2}=\frac{F}{\left(1+\mathrm{YTM}\right)^{2}}=\frac{1}{\left(1+i_{0}^{2}\right)^{2}}.
$$  

Now suppose we take $\$1$ today and invest it in the 2-year bond. Because it sells at $\S P_{0}^{2}$ we will be able to buy $1/P_{0}^{2}$ units of it. Then, 2 years from now (at $t=2$ ), our investment will fetch us a (sure) payoff equal to the number of bonds we have bought $(1/P_{0}^{2})$ times the face value of each bond $(\$1)$ . That is, our payoff at $t=2$ will be [using Equation (5.2)]  

$$
1/P_{0}^{2}=(1+i_{0}^{2})^{2}.
$$  

Another use of our $\$1$ would be to invest it in the 1 year bond right now. We will be able to buy $1/P_{0}^{1}$ units of it at $t=1$ , then our payoff will be the number of bonds we have bought $(1/P_{0}^{1})$ times the face value of each bond $(\$1)$ . That is, our payoff at $t=1$ will be [using Equation (5.1)]  

$$
1/P_{0}^{2}=(1+i_{0}^{1}).
$$  

What shall we do with this money at $t=12$ Invest it, of course! Suppose we invest in another zero-coupon, $\$1$ face value, 1-year bond that will be issued a year from now (or equivalently, a multiyear bond with 1 year left to mature). Since we are currently in a world of certainty, we should be able to forecast the price, $P_{1}^{1}$ , of this 1-year bond (issued 1 year from now) with perfect accuracy. With $\mathbb{S}(1+i_{0}^{1})$ to invest, we should be able to buy $(1+\dot{l}_{0}^{1})/P_{1}^{1}$ units of this bond. Note that the YTM, $i_{1}^{1}$ , of this bond is the internal rate of return that discounts the $\$1$ face value over one period to equal the current bond market price, and is thus  

$$
P_{1}^{1}=1/(1+i_{1}^{1}).
$$  

Since we have bought $(1+i_{0}^{1})/P_{1}^{1}$ units of this bond at $t=1$ , and the face value of each unit is $\$1$ , our payoff at $t=2$ will be [using Equation (5.5)]  

$$
[(1+i_{0}^{1})/P_{1}^{1}]\times1=(1+i_{0}^{1})(1+i_{1}^{1}).
$$  

# The Absence of Arbitrage and the Yield to Maturity Relationship  

Equilibrium in this market requires that there be no riskless arbitrage opportunities. That is, we should not be able to do better at $t=0$ with either the strategy of investing into the 2-year bond or investing in the 1-year bond and rolling over the  

proceeds into another 1-year bond. Both strategies should yield identical proceeds at $t=2$ since we started out in each with identical $\$1$ investments. That is, the expressions in Equations (5.3) and (5.6) should be equal. This gives  

$$
(1+i_{0}^{2})^{2}=(1+i_{0}^{1})(1+i_{1}^{1}),
$$  

or  

$$
(1+i_{0}^{2})=\sqrt{(1+i_{0}^{1})(1+i_{1}^{1})}.
$$  

Thus, the (annualized) YTM on the 2-year bond should be the geometric average of the YTMs on two successive bonds, each of maturity 1 year. This relationship is sometimes known as the expectations hypothesis, because it says that the yield on a long-term bond should be based on the expectations of investors about the yields on a sequence of short-term bonds. The general form of Equation (5.7) for any arbitrary number of years, $n$ is  

$$
(1+i_{0}^{n})=\sqrt[n]{(1+i_{0}^{1})(1+i_{1}^{1})(1+i_{2}^{1})(1+i_{3}^{1})...(1+i_{n-1}^{1})}
$$  

# Spot Rates and Forward Rates  

The future yields, $i_{1}^{1},i_{2}^{1},i_{3}^{1}$ are known as forward rates, whereas the current yields, $i_{0}^{1},i_{0}^{2},\ldots,i_{0}^{n}$ are known as spot rates. Note that the forward rate for any period in the future can be defined with the help of a ratio of bond prices. To see this, solve Equation (5.7) to obtain  

$$
i_{1}^{1}=\frac{(1+i_{0}^{2})^{2}}{(1+i_{0}^{1})}-1.
$$  

Now, substituting for $1+i_{0}^{1}$ and $1+i_{0}^{2}$ from Equations (5.1) and (5.2) respectively, we get  

$$
i_{1}^{1}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{0}}^{1}}{P_{\mathrm{0}}^{2}}-1.
$$  

Similarly, we can obtain $i_{2}^{1}=\frac{P_{0}^{2}}{P_{0}^{3}}-1$ , and so on. A one-period-hence forward rate can thus be thought of as the interest rate on a one-period loan starting at some future point in time. An $n$ -period-hence forward rate is the interest rate on an $n$ -period loan starting at some future point in time. The general formula for the YTM on a bond of maturity $n$ periods to be issued $t$ periods from now (i.e., the $n$ -periods hence forward rate for time $t$ ) is $i_{t}^{n}=\sqrt[n]{\frac{P_{0}^{t}}{P_{0}^{n+t}}}-1$ . We can see now how the shape of the yield curve is determined. If investors believe that short-term interest rates will keep rising, then $i_{0}^{1}<i_{1}^{1}<i_{2}^{1}<...<i_{n-1}^{1}$ , so that $i_{0}^{1}<i_{0}^{2}<i_{0}^{3}<...<i_{0}^{n}$ , and the yield curve will be upward sloping. On the other hand, if investors believe that shortterm interest rates will keep falling, then the yield curve will be inverted, or downward sloping. Given a set of bond prices, we can compute the implied forward rates in the market as we do in the example below.  

# Example 5.1  

Suppose there are three zero-coupon bonds that are identical in all respects except maturity. Each bond has a face value of $\$10$ million. One of them matures a year from now and is currently selling at $\$9,523,809$ . The other matures 2 years from now and is currently selling at $\$8,734,386$ . The third matures 3 years from now and is currently selling at $\$7,513,148$ . Compute the YTM for each of the three bonds, plot the yield curve (assuming that you can interpolate smoothly), and compute the available forward rates.  

# Solution  

We will solve this problem in two steps. First, we will use the specified bond prices to compute the various date-zero YTMs. Second, we will calculate the implied forward rates for different maturities by computing ratios of bond prices.  

Step 1 Using our previous analysis, we have $9,523,809=10,000,000/(1+i_{0}^{1}),$ which gives $\begin{array}{r}{j_{\mathrm{0}}^{\mathrm{1}}=0.05}\end{array}$ or $5\%$ .   
Similarly, $8,734,386=10,000,000/(1+i_{0}^{2})^{2},$ which gives $\dot{I}_{0}^{2}=0.07$ or $7\%$ . And, $7,513,148=10,000,000/(1+i_{0}^{3})^{3},$ , which gives $i_{0}^{3}=0.10$ or $10\%$ .  

Step 2 We will now compute the implied forward rates. The data given to us are that $P_{\mathrm{0}}^{1}=\$9,523,809$ , $P_{0}^{2}=\$8,734,386,$ and $P_{\mathrm{0}}^{\mathrm{3}}={\S\o7,5\o1\mathrm{3},14\mathrm{8}.\mathrm{Now}}$ ,  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle{{j}_{1}^{1}}={\frac{P_{0}^{1}}{P_{0}^{2}}}-1}}\\ {{\displaystyle{\phantom{\displaystyle-}}=\frac{9,523,809}{8,734,836}-1}}\\ {{\displaystyle=9.03809\%,}}\end{array}
$$  

and  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle i_{2}^{1}=\frac{P_{0}^{2}}{P_{0}^{3}}-1}}\\ {{\displaystyle~=\frac{8,734,836}{7,513,148}-1}}\\ {{\displaystyle~=16.25469\%}.}\end{array}
$$  

Notice that the geometric mean of $5\%$ , $9.03809\%$ , and $16.25469\%$ equals the current 3-year yield of $10\%$ . Likewise, the geometric mean of $5\%$ and $9.03809\%$ equals the current 2-year yield of $7\%$ . In addition, the geometric mean of the current 2-year yield of $7\%$ and the 1-year rate 2 years hence of $16.25469\%$ will equal the current 3-year-rate of $10\%$ . Thus, all possible 3-year investment strategies should produce identical returns. Our analysis so far has proceeded under the assumption of certainty. We now introduce uncertainty about future interest rates.  

# THE LURE OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT  

As we saw in our earlier examples, yields of bonds of different maturities can be different. In Figure 5.1 we depicted a case in which the 1-year yield is $5.75\%$ and the 2-year annual yield is $6.25\%$ . That is, if we buy the 1-year bond at date 0 and hold it until date 1, we get a return of $5.75\%$ and if we buy the 2-year bond at date 0 and hold it until maturity at date 2, it will give us a return of $6.25\%$ per year. The difference in returns, $6.25\%-5.75\%=0.5\%.$ , is called the term premium. We may define an m-period term premium as the difference between the expected return on holding for one period of a bond with maturity $m+1$ periods at the time of purchase and the return on a bond of a one-period maturity. If term premiums are positive, then longerterm bonds should have higher expected returns. In a world of certainty, the term premium reflects simply investors’ expectation that future interest rates will be higher than current rates. But in a world of uncertainty – in which interest rates fluctuate randomly – the term premium has two components: one reflecting expected changes in future interest rates, and the other reflecting a premium demanded by risk-averse investors for bearing the risk (in holding longer maturity bonds) that future changes in interest rates will deviate from what is expected (this can be viewed as a premium for bearing interest rate risk).  

The term premium is usually positive. This can be seen in Figure 5.4  which depicts the estimated 10-year term premium in the United States Treasury Bond market. This figure shows that term premiums have declined somewhat since 1990, but are highly volatile. If it does decline on average, it suggests a greater willingness on the part of investors to hold longer maturity securities. Given investor risk aversion, this may be indicative of a lower perceived macroeconomic volatility. Alternatively, risk aversion may have come down.  

The term premium is usually positive and creates a strong inducement for banks to mismatch their asset and liability maturity structures. By holding assets of longer maturities than their liabilities, banks can profit from a positive term premiums. This is the lure of interest rate risk. But this is risky too, as the following example shows.  

Example 5.2 Suppose a bank’s only asset is a 5-year United States government zero-coupon bond that promises to pay $\$100$ million in 5 years. Its only liability is a 1-year $\$70$ million certificate of deposit (CD). The YTM on 1-year riskless instruments is $5.75\%$ and on 5-year riskless instruments is $6.65\%$ .

This bank’s balance sheet in economic value terms will look like this: Economic Value Balance Sheet (in millions)

FIGURE 5.4 United States – Estimated 10-Year Term Premium in the U.S. Treasury Market, 1993–2012. Durham (2014)  More on U.S. Treasury Term Pre miums: Spot and Expected Measures, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Reports, no 658, revised, May 2014. – Exhibit 1  follows page 15 in that report.  

The economic value of the government bond is $\$72.48=\frac{\$100}$ whereas the economic value of the CD is $\S66.19={\frac{\S70}{1.0575}},$  

The economic value of the bank’s equity is a plug and it arises from the term premium represented by the difference in the ates or return on the bank’s assets and liabilities. As long as interest rates do not change, the bank will earn the term premium.  

Now what happens to the value of the bank’s equity if there is a parallel shift of the yield curve and all yields increase by 100 basis points (b.p.s)? The new economic value balance sheet now looks like this:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2"> Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Government bonds</td><td>$69.17</td><td>CD</td><td>$65.57</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Equity</td><td> $3.60</td></tr><tr><td> Total</td><td>$69.17</td><td> Total</td><td>$69.17</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The new economic value of the government bond is $\frac{\$100}{[1.0765]^{5}}=\S69.17$ and the new economic value of the CD is ${\frac{\$70}{[1.0675]}}=\S65.57.$  

The equity value, which is a plug, is value of assets – value of liabilities $=\S69.17-\S65.57=\S3.60.$ .  

So we see that even though there was only a modest and equal increase in all interest rates, the economic value of equity fell from $\$6.29$ million to $\$3.60$ million. Why? The reason is that the long-term cash flow represented by the bank’s asset has a value that is much more sensitive to interest rate changes than the short-term cash flow represented by the bank’s liability. Thus, banks that are typically mismatched in a manner similar to our hypothetical bank – with assets of longer maturity than liabilities – experience a decline in their equity values when interest rates rise.  

The existence of a positive term premium has profound implications for banks. On the one hand, it allows banks to profit from a maturity mismatch on their balance sheets. On the other hand, it imposes interest rate risk on banks. So, while the lure of profiting from maturity mismatching can be quite strong, the risk of mismatching can be ruinous.

FIGURE 5.5 Price Changes for one b.p. Change in Yields.  

Could the bank have hedged its shareholders against interest rate risk by matching maturities? Not necessarily. The reason is that the banks need to match the exact timing of their asset and liability cash flows. Shorter-term cash flows behave differently than longer-term cash flows. To hedge its shareholders against interest rate risk, the bank must understand something about how asset and liability values will change, given changes in market yields. That is, the bank’s shareholders will be protected against interest rate movements if, for a given change in market yields,  

Percentage Price Change in Assets $\mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{\tau}$ Percentage Price Change in Liabilities or

where $\Delta P_{\mathrm{{A}}}={}$ change in price of asset, $P_{\mathrm{{A}}}=$ price of asset, $\Delta P_{\mathrm{L}}=$ change in price of liability, $P_{\mathrm{{L}}}=$ price of liability, and $\Delta_{i}=$ change in interest rate.  

Let us now examine the value $\left.\frac{\Delta P}{P}\right|\Delta_{i}.$  

Consider first a flat term structure, with $i=10\%$ and a 10-year zero-coupon bond with $\$100$ par. How will the price of this bond change if yields (interest rates) change by one b.p.? (Figure 5.5).

$$  

# DURATION  

# The Inappropriateness of Maturity for Coupon-Paying Bonds  

We saw that relative price change $(\Delta P/P)$ is related to the yield change $(\Delta i)$ . A mathematical relationship between $\Delta P/P$ and $\Delta i$ given by duration, which is related to but different from maturity. The maturity of a bond tells the investor how long he must wait before receiving the terminal cash flow of the bond, or alternatively when the bond will mature or be redeemed. The maturity of a bond, however, does not give the investor all the needed information about the price volatility of the bond, unless it is a zero-coupon bond. This is because bonds of the same maturity can differ in their coupon payments through time. Moreover, in addition to coupon payments, bonds often provide other cash flows before maturity, such as amortizations. A bond that makes relatively large coupon payments early or amortizes rapidly has a shorter effective maturity than a bond that makes most of its large coupon payments late in the life of the bond. The reason is that the former generates much of its total cash flow well before its actual maturity date, whereas the latter skews its cash flows closer to its actual maturity date. We should, therefore, expect different sensitivities of the prices of these bonds to changes in interest rates. Note that we are now shifting our focus from zero-coupon bonds to bonds that may or may not pay coupons. All bonds we consider in our analysis are nonamortizing, that is, only coupon payments are received prior to maturity, and the entire principal is paid at maturity.  

# Duration is the Answer  

Duration, which is calibrated in the same temporal units as maturity, captures the timing of all cash flows generated by a bond, not just the terminal cash flow, and therefore is a more sophisticated measure.1 The duration of a bond is defined as the weighted average of the times to arrival of all scheduled future payments of a bond, where the weight attached to each payment reflects the relative contribution of that payment to the value of the bond. That is, each weighting factor is the present value of that payment divided by the present value of all payments of the bond. Consider a bond with $N$ years to maturity, coupon payments $C_{1}$ $C_{2},\ldots$ $C_{\mathrm{N}}$ where $C_{t}$ is the coupon paid $t$ years from now, and a principal (balloon) payment of $B_{N}$ made at maturity. Let the term structure be flat, with $i$ as the annual yield for all cash flows. Then the price of the bond at $t=0$ is the present value of future payments:  

$$
P=\frac{C_{1}}{1+i}+\frac{C_{2}}{\left(1+i\right)^{2}}+...+\frac{C_{N}+B_{N}}{\left(1+i\right)^{N}}
$$  

To see how $P$ is related to $i$ let us take a derivative  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{\mathrm{d}i}}={\frac{-C_{1}}{\left(1+i\right)^{2}}}+\left[{\frac{-2C_{2}}{\left(1+i\right)^{3}}}\right]+\ldots+\left[{\frac{-N[C_{N}+B_{N}]}{\left(1+i\right)^{N+1}}}\right]\quad
$$  

or  

$$
 \mathrm{d}P={\frac{-\mathrm{d}i}{1+i}}+\left[{\frac{C_{1}}{1+i}}+{\frac{2C_{2}}{\left(1+i\right)^{2}}}+...+{\frac{N(C_{N}+B_{N})}{\left(1+i\right)^{N}}}\right]
$$  

Dividing both sides by $P$ gives us:  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{P}}{=}{\frac{-\mathrm{d}i}{1+i}}{\left[{\frac{{\frac{C_{1}}{(1+i)}}+{\frac{2C_{2}}{(1+i)^{2}}}+\ldots+{\frac{N(C_{N}+B_{N})}{(1+i)^{N}}}}{{\frac{C_{1}}{(1+i)}}+{\frac{C_{2}}{(1+i)^{2}}}+\ldots+{\frac{(C_{N}+B_{N})}{(1+i)^{N}}}}}\right]}
$$  

We can write this as:  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{P}=\frac{-\mathrm{d}i}{(1+i)}\left[1\left\{\frac{\frac{C_{1}}{(1+i)}}{\frac{C_{1}}{[1+i]}+\frac{C_{2}}{[1+i]^{2}}+\ldots+\frac{[C_{N}+B_{N}]}{[1+i]^{N}}}\right\}+2\left\{\frac{\frac{C_{2}}{(1+i)^{2}}}{\frac{C_{1}}{[1+i]}+\frac{C_{2}}{[1+i]^{2}}+\ldots+\frac{[C_{N}+B_{N}]}{[1+i]^{N}}}\right\}\right.
$$  

The numerator in each term represents the time of arrival, $1,2,....N,$ of a payment that is weighted by the present value of that payment. In the denominator, we have the present value of the sum of all cash flows promised by the bond, which should be its current market price, $P$ Define  

$$
w_{t}\equiv C_{t}/(1+i)^{t}\mathrm{forall}t=1,2,...,N-1
$$  

as the coefficient attached to the payment to be received $t$ years from now.2 Let $w_{N}\equiv(C_{N}+B_{N})/(1+i)^{N}.$ Then, using Equation (5.12) and the definition of $P$ we can write Equation (5.11) as  

$$
{\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{P}}=-{\frac{\mathrm{d}i}{[1+i]}}\Biggl[{\frac{\left(w_{1}+2w_{2}+3w_{3}+\ldots+N w_{N}\right)}{P}}\Biggr]
$$

FIGURE 5.6 Duration  

This equation gives the relationship between prices and yields. A fixed-income instrument’s duration is its “price elasticity” and it relates percentage price changes to changes in yields. See Figure 5.6  

Duration is the negative of the slope of the relationship shown in Figure 5.6  Thus, if we know the duration of an asset, we can predict its price sensitivity to a given change in yield. We can write:  

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}P}{P}=-D\biggl[\frac{\mathrm{d}i}{1+i}\biggr]
$$  

where $D$ is duration. Defining $\hat{w}_{t}\equiv w_{t}/P$ , we can write:  

$$
D=\sum_{t=1}^{N}t{\hat{w}}_{t}.
$$  

Thus, Equation (5.14) says that, to arrive at the bond’s duration, we compute a weighted average of the times to arrival of its different promised payments, where the weight attached to each time to arrival is equal to the present value of the cash flow associated with that time to arrival divided by the price of the bond.  

We can think of the duration of a bond then as a metric for the average number of years a holder of that bond must wait before recouping his investment. For risk-assessment purposes, duration is a much more meaningful attribute of a bond than its maturity. The shorter the duration of a bond, the lower is its price volatility. Holding everything else (including the current value or price of the bond) fixed, an increase in coupon payments reduces duration, and an increase in maturity increases duration. A zero-coupon (pure discount) bond has the longest duration among bonds of the same maturity; indeed, its duration is equal to its maturity. These bonds have recently become very popular. One significant advantage that they offer is that the average annual return they offer over the maturity period (the YTM) is known with certainty (in absence of default) in advance; that is, since the cash flows they generate are at maturity, there is no reinvestment risk. With coupon bonds, the realized YTM will depend on the future interest rates at which the coupons can be reinvested. However, zerocoupon bonds are also very risky because of their longer duration and consequent higher price volatility. When interest rates are falling, the holder of a zero-coupon bond realizes a greater price appreciation than the holder of an otherwise similar coupon-paying bond. But when interest rates rise, the holder of the zero-coupon bond also experiences a greater price decline! Let us see the effect of duration at work in the following simple illustration.  

# Duration at Work: Some Numerical Examples  

The following key points about duration are worth noting:  

1. Duration is denominated in years. It is a measure of the “weighted average life” of the bond.   
2. Longer maturity assets have longer durations, ceteris paribus.   
3. For zero-coupon bonds, duration $\c=$ maturity. For all other bonds, duration $\prec$ maturity. Holding everything else fixed, an increase in the coupon decreases duration.   
4. The duration of a floating-rate instrument (“floaters”) where the coupon changes with interest rates is the time until the next repricing.  

# Example 5.3  

Consider an interest rate environment in which the one-period annual yield is $10\%$ and the two-period annual yield is $9.7824\%$ , and suppose we have two riskless bonds (each with a 2-year maturity) that are identical in all respects except that one is a zerocoupon bond that matures 2 years from now and promises a balloon payment of $\$123,40,$ where the other is a bond that will pay a coupon of $\$1001$ year from now and another coupon of $\$100$ plus a balloon payment of $\$9002$ years from now. Compute the durations of these two bonds.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in three steps. First, we compute the current prices of the zero-coupon bond and the coupon-paying bond using the yield data provided. We find that both are equally priced. Second, we calculate the duration of the coupon-paying bond, which is less than that of the zero-coupon bond. Finally, in Step 3 we compute the variances of possible price changes (due to random interest rate movements) and show that the variance is higher for the zero-coupon bond.  

Step 1 The discount rate for one period cash flows is $10\%$ and the discount rate for two-period cash flows is $9.7824\%$ . Thus the price of the zero-coupon bond is  

$P_{0}=1109.6/(1.097824)^{2}=\S920.64$ .  

Similarly, the price of the coupon bond is $P_{\mathrm{c}}=[[100/1.10]+[1000/(1.097824)^{2}]]=\S920.64.$ .  

Step 2 The above calculation shows that both bonds are equally priced. The duration of the zero-coupon bond is its maturity, which is 2 years. The duration of the coupon-paying bond is  

$$
D=\hat{w}_{1}+2\hat{w}_{1}
$$  

where $\hat{W}_{1}=[100/1.10]/920.64=0.09875$ and $\hat{W}_{2}=[1000/(1.097284)^{2}]/920.64=0.90125$ .  

That is, $9.875\%$ of the value of this bond is attributable to its first period coupon and $90.125\%$ of its value is attributable to the sum of its second period coupon and principal. Hence, $D=0.09875+2(0.90125)=1.90125$ years.  

5. The duration of a bank’s “core deposits” is typically taken as zero.   
6. The duration of a portfolio is the weighted average of the durations of all the assets in the portfolio.  

# Using Duration to Measure the Impact of Interest Rate Shocks on a Bank’s Equity  

Value  

Recall that a bank’s balance sheet can be expressed as  

$$
A=L+E
$$  

where $A=$ assets, $L=$ liabilities, and $E=$ equity. Then, given a change in yield $\Delta i$ the balance sheet changes can be expressed as:  

$$
\Delta A=\Delta L+\Delta E
$$  

Now:  

$$
{\frac{\Delta A}{A}}=-D_{_A}\left[{\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}}\right]
$$  

which implies  

$$
\Delta A=-D_{{\scriptscriptstyle A}}[A]\bigg[\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\bigg]
$$  

Similarly,  

$$
{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}=-D_{L}\left[{\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}}\right]
$$  

which implies:  

$$
\Delta L=-D_{_{L}}[L]{\left[\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\right]}
$$  

Assuming that the yield shock to the assets is identical to the yield shock to the liabilities, we can substitute Equation (5.15) and (5.16) in Equation (5.14) to obtain:  

$$
\Delta E=\left[-D_{{\scriptscriptstyle A}}[A]\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\right]-\left[-D_{{\scriptscriptstyle L}}[L]\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\right]
$$  

![](images/42d0252d674c778919613f1499025e8bedcf1f0d4aa63ba21b67c7c3123b8cfd.jpg)  
FIGURE 5.7 Asset and Liability Duration for Traditional Bank  

which implies:  

$$
\Delta E=\left[\{-D_{_A}[A]+D_{_L}[L]\}\left[{\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}}\right]\right]
$$  

or  

$$
\Delta E=-\Bigg[D_{{\scriptscriptstyle A}}-D_{{\scriptscriptstyle L}}\left\{\frac{L}{A}\right\}\Bigg]\left[A\right]\left[\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\right]
$$  

where $\Delta E$ is in dollars.  

So, when market yields change, what drives the change in the bank’s equity value? There are three main drivers:  

1. The size of the shock $\left(\frac{\Delta i}{1+i}\right)$  

2. The amount of the leverage the bank uses  

3. The mismatch between the durations of the bank’s assets and liabilities. The bank will be “immunized” when $D_{_A}=D_{_L}\left\{\frac{L}{A}\right\}$  

How does this matter to a bank or a savings institution? To address this question, note that a traditional bank or savings institution has assets of longer duration than liabilities. Thus, its durations look like those shown in Figure 5.7  

What this means is that if yields increase, the bank’s equity value declines (recall Equation (5.17)), which shows that when $D_{A}>D_{L}$ and $L<A$ the term $\left[D_{{}_{A}}-D_{{}_{L}}{\frac{\cal L}{{}_{A}}}\right]>0$ , so $\Delta E<0$ for any $\Delta i>0$ . If yields decrease, the bank’s equity value increases. Thus, when a bank mismatches its balance sheet in the traditional way, it accepts interest rate risk in this way. Immunization closes the “gap.”  

A bank can alter its degree of immunization by changing the durations of its assets and liabilities. It can do this in two ways: on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet. On-balance sheet initiatives include making new types of loans, seeking new liabilities, and changing its capital structure. Off-balance sheet initiatives include repurchase agreements, futures, options, and swaps (we will discuss these in a later chapter).  

# CONVEXITY  

If a bank is interested in protecting its net worth against unexpected interest rate changes, duration matching can help; matching terms to maturity cannot do this unless all investments are of the zero-coupon variety. Suppose now that a bank is immunized and yields subsequently change. Does the bank remain immunized? The answer is no. The reason is that duration is an approximation. In fact, it is a linear approximation of a nonlinear relationship between prices and yields. We can see this with an example.  

Example 5.4 Suppose we have a 10-year zero-coupon bond that is risk free, has a par value of $\$1000$ , and is priced to yield $10\%$ . What is its duration and how well will duration predict price changes if the yield moves up or down by 500 b.p.s?  

# Solution  

Note that because this is a zero-coupon bond, thus maturity $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ duration; so the duration here is 10 years. The current price of the bond i s: (\$1.100)10 = \$385.54. Now consider the prices of this bond in response to a 500 (b.p.) change in the yield.  

We see then that duration overpredicts price declines when interest rates rise and underpredicts price increases when interest rates fall. Moreover, duration makes greater errors when yields rise than when they fall. This means that the duration approximation makes values look worse than they truly are when interest rates change, and this bias gets stronger as convexity increases.  

Why does duration make such prediction errors? The reason is that the true relationship between price changes and yield changes is convex, not linear.  

When we first calculated the relationship between $\mathrm{d}P$ and ${\mathrm{d}}i,$ we took a first derivative, which gave us the slope of the function in a “local” area, that is, the slope of the curve, dP d  at ${\mathrm{d}}i=0$ . However, if we had gone further and computed the second derivative, we would have found $\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}P}{\mathrm{d}\mathfrak{i}^{2}}>0,$ that is, all fixed-income securities are convex.  

FIGURE 5.8 Price–Yield Relationship is Convex   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Prices</td><td colspan="2">Yield Change</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>+ 500 b.p.</td><td>- 500 b.p.</td></tr><tr><td>Duration-predicted Price:=-10[]=±47.62%</td><td>$385:54[1 - 0.4762] = $201.95</td><td>$385.54[1 + 0.4762] = $569.13</td></tr><tr><td>Actual price</td><td>$1.00 - $247.18</td><td>(1.05)0 .00=0$613.19</td></tr><tr><td> Error</td><td>-$45.23</td><td>-$44.78</td></tr></table></body></html>  

One implication of convexity is that duration will do a reasonable job in predicting price changes as long as interest rate changes are in the neighborhood of $\mathrm{d}i=0$ , that is, relatively small changes like, say, 1 b.p. But the larger the interest rate change, the more erroneous duration is in predicting price changes. See Figure 5.8 below.  

![](images/4f2cf0bac3db6e8afcf561a6f6e1ec1d413b5581de9c092dcd4e2eac712f8d34.jpg)  

# Implications of Convexity for Fixed-Income Securities and for Banks  

There are three important implications of convexity for fixed-income securities:  

1. The price decline given a rate increase is smaller than the price increase given a rate decrease of the same absolute magnitude as the rate increase.   
2. Duration changes as yields change.   
3. Greater convexity implies greater errors in the predictive ability of duration.  

There are two important implications of convexity for banks:  

1. Duration immunization is a dynamic process since asset and liability durations change as yields change. 2. If the bank’s asset portfolio is more convex than its liability portfolio, then properly done duration immunization never hurts the bank in the sense that the error associated with duration being an approximation tends to understate the value of the bank’s equity.  

# INTEREST RATE RISK  

# How Interest Rate Risk Can Affect a Financial Institution’s Net Worth  

The successful financial institution must understand its interest rate risk and manage the durations of its assets and liabilities. A pure broker need not worry about interest rate risk because its assets and liabilities are always more or less automatically duration matched. On the other hand, the asset transformer is often exposed to very subtle forms of interest rate risk. Consider the following simple example. A bank is borrowing and lending funds of two maturities: short-term (1 year) and long-term (2 years), all zero-coupon. Loans consist of $\$40$ million short term and $\$40$ million long term, while liabilities are $\$60$ million short term and $\$10$ million long term.3 All numbers are in market value terms as of October 30, 2012. Hence, the bank’s balance sheet is  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Bank's Balance Sheet as of October 30, 2012</td></tr><tr><td> Short-term loans</td><td>$40,000,000</td><td> Short-term liabilities</td><td>$60,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term loans</td><td>$40,000,000</td><td> Long-term liabilities</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>$80,000,000</td><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$70,000,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td> Equity</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Total equity and liabilities</td><td>$80,000,000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Assume that the yield curve as of October 30, 2012, is a flat solid line; Annual yields on assets and liabilities of all maturities are $10\%$ .  

Now suppose that on October 31, 2012, the yield curve shifts parallel such that all yields rise to $12\%$ .  

Each dollar of short-term assets (or liabilities) decreases in value to $\$0.9821428$ and each dollar of long-term assets (or liabilities) decreases in value to $\$0.9646045$ . The new balance sheet in market-value terms looks as follows  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="4">Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2012</td></tr><tr><td> Short-term loans</td><td>$39,285,712</td><td>Short-term liabilities</td><td>$58,928,568</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term loans</td><td>$38,584,180</td><td> Long-term liabilities</td><td>$9,646,046</td></tr><tr><td> Total assets</td><td>$77,869,892</td><td>Total liabilities</td><td>$68,574,613</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td> Equity</td><td>$9,295,279</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Total equity and liabilities</td><td>$77,869,892</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Thus, the market value of equity falls by $\$704,721$ or $7.047\%$ . The shift in the term structure affects the values of both the assets and the liabilities, but it has unequal effects on assets and liabilities due to unequal duration. To see this, note that the duration of short-term assets is 1 year and the duration of long-term assets is 2 years. The weights attached to the short-term and long-term assets are 0.5 and 0.5. Thus, the duration of the asset portfolio is $0.5\times1+0.5\times2=1.5$ years. Similarly, the duration of the short-term liability is 1 year and the weight attached to it is $\$60$ million $\$80$ million $=0.75$ , while the duration of the long-term liability is 2 years and its weight is $\$10$ million $\$80$ million $=0.125$ . Thus, the duration of the liability portfolio is $(0.75\times1+0.125\times2)=1$ year.  

While unequal duration is risky, it is also a service provided by an asset transformer. By funding short (acquiring shortduration liabilities), the intermediary reduces the duration of its clientele’s assets, thereby earning any term premium embedded in the yield curve. One simple way to eliminate interest rate risk altogether is to equalize the durations of assets and liabilities at all times. But then the institution forgoes duration/maturity transformation, a potentially profitable type of asset transformation.  

# A Case Study in Interest Rate Risk  

Banks and other depository institutions often deliberately mismatch the durations of their asset and liability portfolios to profit either from term premiums or from their own expectations (guesses) about where interest rates are headed. Depository institutions characteristically fund their longer-lived assets with shorter-term liabilities. For instance, S&Ls historically funded 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with deposits that were often subject to withdrawal on demand.4 Similarly, commercial banks would finance 5- and 7-year fixed-rate “term” loans with demand and savings deposits, both of which could be withdrawn at a moment’s notice. Such mismatches inevitably entail interest rate risk.  

As an illustration, consider NCNB Corporation, a North Carolina-based banking company, which later went on to become Nations Bank and then merged with Bank of America; the bank speculated that there would be an interest rate downturn in 1990.5 It thus lengthened the duration of its investment portfolio through 1989. At year end, the bank had a liability-sensitive balance sheet, largely because of its holdings of $\$6$ billion in long-term Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities. As of December 31, 1989, about $\$1.5$ billion more of NCNB’s liabilities than its assets would have repriced over the next 12 months. If interest rates had fallen, NCNB would have enjoyed a huge profit. Instead, interest rates rose. As of year end 1989, the yield on 30-year GNMAs was $9.49\%$ . By March 16, 1990, the 30-year GNMA yield was $9.95\%$ . NCNB consequently suffered a $\$180$ million unrealized loss in its bond portfolio. That news – plus disclosures in March 1990 that problem loans could rise by $25\%$ in the first quarter of 1990 – sent NCNB’s stock plummeting from $\$46$ in the first week of March 1990 to $\$40$ by March 19, 1990, a decline of $12\%$ .6  

# The Savings and Loan Experience and Other Episodes  

Another striking example of the consequences of interest rate risk is the experience of the U.S. savings and loan (S&L) industry in the 1980s. S&Ls have traditionally financed themselves with short-maturity deposits and invested in relatively long-maturity, fixed-rate mortgages. Consequently, their liabilities repriced more frequently than their assets. As long as the yield curve sloped upward, this was a profitable maturity transformation. But in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the yield curve inverted as yields rose to historic highs. S&Ls took significant losses. This dissipation of much of the industry’s net worth was the triggering event that led to the decimation of the industry years later. In particular, the loss of net worth meant that these institutions had much to gain and little to lose by pursuing risky investments. This led to further losses. The financial distress of Orange County in California in the 1990s is another example of the potentially devastating effect of interest rate risk.  

# Why Take On Interest Rate Risk?  

The immediate question is: Why do banks and S&Ls choose to accept such exposure? That is, we have seen that it is possible for the bank to avoid taking much of the interest rate risk it normally takes on simply by matching the durations of its assets and liabilities, so interest rate risk is largely an avoidable risk. To answer this question, we go back to the theory of the term structure of interest rates. The presence of a risk premium in the term structure invites those who are more risk tolerant than the “average” (or representative) investor to hold long-term assets and fund these assets with shorter-term liabilities. Their reward is the premium in the yield curve that reflects the greater risk aversion of the respective investor.  

Why should banks and other depository institutions be more risk tolerant than others? This is an issue we will take up in later chapters, but for now it suffices to note that deposit insurance may be one reason for a preference for risk on the bank’s part. Of course, not all banks will desire to take on the same amount of risk. As in the case of their borrowers, the risk-taking propensities of banks depend on their own capital levels. Banks with more capital may wish to make investments that are less risky than those desired by banks with less capital.  

The upshot of this discussion is not that an asset transformer should not take interest rate risk, but rather that such risk must be carefully assessed and managed.  

# CONCLUSION  

This chapter has examined interest rate risk and its role in the bank’s overall risk exposure. Next to credit risk, this has been the most important source of risk for banks historically. Interest rate risk is linked to the term structure of interest rates. Our analysis of the term structure both under certainty and uncertainty shows how yield and maturity are related. In both the certainty and uncertainty cases, the concept of riskless arbitrage plays a key role. Further, our analysis shows that the risk in holding a bond is more appropriately assessed in terms of its duration rather than its term to maturity. The definition of duration and the examination of its relevance in measuring the price volatility of bonds indicate how coupon-paying bonds should be analyzed. We also examined the concept of convexity and measures of interest rate risk exposure.  

# CASE STUDY: EGGLESTON STATE BANK  

# Introduction  

Mr. Edward Eggleston, CEO and primary stockholder of Eggleston State Bank, the bank he founded some 30 years ago in his hometown of Bloomington, OR, is worried. He has just gotten off the phone with an old friend of his, Fred Fisher. Fred had reported the difficulties he was having with his job search.  

Fred’s and Edward’s life stories were remarkably similar. College roommates, they had both founded small hometown banks in the years following college and had managed to be quite successful for a number of years. But now, Fred is effectively wiped out – his bank has been closed by regulators and his fortune, invested entirely in the bank, has evaporated. Currently, he is going through the process of looking for a new job, maybe in the sort of big city he had always prided himself on avoiding.  

Fred’s bank had been fairly small, with $\$30$ million in total assets, but had been consistently profitable as a small-town bank doing traditional banking – accepting deposits from individuals and small businesses in the short-term, while making long-term mortgage loans and business loans. But when state banking regulations were relaxed, allowing a branch of a major state bank to move into town, things got tighter. This competition, along with increasing volatility in interest rates and the bank’s traditional mismatching of its balance sheet, led the bank into a situation with increasingly deteriorating capital, with a drop in capital over a 3-year period from $\$2$ million to under $\$300,000$ . Finally, regulators moved in and took over the bank.  

Edward Eggleston sighs, and wonders to himself whether the same thing could happen to his bank. His bank is much larger than Fred’s with total assets of over $\$400$ million (see Exhibit A). But with the rise of several regional banks with assets in billions of dollars, Edward is beginning to feel like he may face the same kinds of problems that beset Fred’s bank, in the form of increased competition from larger, more sophisticated banks. He decides to meet with his executives to carefully investigate the exposure of Eggleston State Bank to interest rate risk, and to discuss the possibilities for hedging against changes in interest rates.

# The Meeting  

A week later, Edward Eggleston is sitting in his office with Carol Chipley and Douglas Date. Carol is a recent graduate of a top MBA program with strong analytical skills, hired in part to help modernize the bank’s approach to risk management. Douglas, on the other hand, has risen to his current position from within the bank, primarily due to his sharp eye for detail and sound common sense.  

Eggleston: O.K., gang. You both know our situation as well as I do. What I’m interested in is what options we have for action, and which you think we ought to pursue. Should we remain mismatched, or is it time for us to move into hedging?  

Date: Well, as you know, Ed, I’ve always been skeptical about us getting involved in the latest fads in banking. After all, I don’t see that we are so mismatched. Remember that article I showed you a while back, about a bank that started fooling around in the futures markets on the bad advice of a smooth-talking broker? I’m afraid that if we aren’t careful, we could wind up making a big mistake. Besides, we’ve been here for 30 years now, steadily profitable. Why should we mess with a good system?  

Chipley: I think that you are right, Douglas, when you say that we should be careful. But I think that for every story about banks losing money because a hedging program was poorly planned, we can find a dozen stories about banks that lost money, or even went under, because they weren’t hedged at all. Plus, the banking environment has changed significantly in recent years. So what worked for the last 30 years might be fatal to us over the next 30 years.  

Date: People are always saying that, but I don’t really see what has changed. We’ve gotten bigger, but this is still a small-town bank. Our borrowers and our customers are mostly individuals and small to medium-sized businesses. Carol, weren’t you just showing me the other day a chart showing how smooth our deposit flows have been over the past 5 years? (See Exhibit B). And the new administration seems committed to keeping Ft. Washington open, so it looks like the overall business outlook for the community is about the same as it ever was: stable and solid as a rock. This is a fairly prosperous area, after all. (See Exhibit C).  

Chipley: Well, I’m not so sure that we can count on any administration keeping promises about military bases. But anyway, closing Fort Washington isn’t the only risk that we face. I think that the increasingly competitive nature of banking means that world markets can affect what happens in our little town. Twenty years ago, our customers might not have worried so much about differences in interest rates; we were their hometown bank and we knew them and their business. But banking is more impersonal now, and we can’t just expect our depositors to stay with us if we don’t offer competitive interest rates. I think our investment and loan portfolios deserve a careful look (see Exhibits D and E).  

Eggleston: Well, those are the reactions that I expected to hear from you. But I think that now is the time for some hard-boiled analysis. Let’s sit down right now and come up with some likely interest rate scenarios. Then Carol can work with the figures and let us know exactly what would happen to the bank under a variety of circumstances (see Exhibit F).  

# The Numbers  

During the meeting, the bankers came to an agreement on the following probabilities for the following scenarios:  

# The Assignment  

Eggleston: Carol, I’d like for you to take these numbers and report back to me on some very specific questions. What exactly is the extent of our mismatching? What would happen to the bank under the various scenarios that we’ve talked about? What kind of hedging program, if any, should we use to protect the bank?

# Review Questions  

1. What is the term structure of interest rates?  

2. Under certainty, if the term structure is determined to preclude riskless arbitrage, what is the relationship between the yields on bonds of different maturities and why?   
3. What is duration and why is it a more valid metric to consider for coupon-paying bonds than maturity? What is the relation between duration and price volatility for bonds with the same maturity?   
4. What is convexity? Discuss its potential usefulness in evaluating bonds.   
5. Discuss the pros and cons of duration mismatching for a depository institution. Suppose there are three zero-coupon bonds, identical in all respects except maturity. Each bond has a face value of $\$1000$ . One of them matures a year from now and is currently selling at $\$855.66$ . Another matures 2 years from now and is currently selling at $\$835.33$ . The third matures 3 years from now and is currently selling at $\$775.85$ . Compute the YTM for each of the three bonds, plot the yield curve (assuming that you can interpolate smoothly), and compute the available forward rates.   
6. The annualized YTM on a single-period pure discount bond is $12\%$ and that on a two-period pure discount bond is $10.45\%$ . There are two bonds. One is a two-period, pure discount bond that promises a balloon payment of $\$1200$ at maturity. The other is a bond that will pay a coupon of $\$100$ one period hence, and a coupon of $\$100$ plus a balloon payment of $\$1000$ two periods hence. Compute the duration of these bonds and their possible price changes prior to maturity.   
7. Given below is an excerpt from a conversation between two people. Provide a critique.  

Moderator: So, what do you people think? Will we ever really understand what happened to the American banking industry well enough to know what should be done?  

Appleton: Well, I think banks and S&Ls were simply victims of the environment. We had an inverted yield curve – long rates were lower than short rates – for a while and this made it difficult for financial institutions to reap their normal profits from asset transformation; you know, I’ve never believed in the expectations hypothesis. It’s a theoretical nicety with no practical relevance. Of course, the increased interest rate volatility didn’t help. As if this wasn’t enough, there was an enormous increase in competition, both domestic and international. These institutions must have felt like they were being squeezed by a powerful vise.  

Moderator: By the way, Alex, I’ll give you another reason not to like the expectations hypothesis – it’s also wrong.  

Appleton: I didn’t know that. Are you sure? In any case, it’s good to know you agree with me, Mike. But frankly, I’m surprised. Knowing how you and Beth feel about this, I thought I’d get more of an argument.  

Moderator: Well, cheer up, Alex. My agreement with you is only partial. I agree that depository financial institutions faced a tough environment during the last 15 years or so. But I also think they could have managed their risks more intelligently. For example, they could have reduced the duration gaps in their asset and liability portfolios and made use of contemporary immunization techniques to hedge their interest rate risks. Like some of the investment banking houses, they could have been more innovative in brokerage activities, so that the resulting fee income would have made banks less dependent on the riskier asset transformation activities. Just look at the profits earned by some investment bankers who stripped Treasuries and sold zeros (pure discount bonds) like CATS (Certificates of Accrual of Treasury Securities) and TIGRS (Treasury Investment Growth Receipts). No, Alex! The real story runs much deeper than your “passive victims of the environment” explanation. I think banks and S&Ls exploited the system and ripped off taxpayers.
