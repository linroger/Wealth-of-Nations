# INTRODUCTION  

Risk is one of those concepts with a long history and diverse interpretations.1 Because the future is always shrouded, risk is fundamental to all human endeavors. It is, however, central to banking. Think in terms of the “core competence” of a business, its special skill, knowledge, or repute that enables it to earn an enhanced return in the service of its clientele. Without this edge, the service becomes commoditized by competitors who bid down prices to the point where profit vanishes  This core competence imparts to the producer an advantage in managing a risk inherent in the production of a particular service or economic good. These are the core risks that correspond to core competencies. For example, General Motors and Toyota presumably possess a core competence in the manufacture of automobiles, which corresponds to a unique skill in managing risks of auto safety and the provision of reliable transportation. This is why the failure of ignition switches in General Motors vehicles and accelerator and braking systems in Toyotas cost lives and exposed both to costly risk-management failures. Reputational capital was dissipated, sales were lost, and lawsuits proliferated.  

But what do we mean by risk? In the context of business, risk is the distillate of randomness in the process by which earnings are generated. This randomness may be mitigated through the application of a producer’s core competencies, in which case the risk is voluntarily accepted, even sought, as a business decision; hence a “businessman’s risk.” Alternatively, the risk may be unavoidable, as in the case of a force majeure or an “act of god.” In this case, the only protection may be insurance, if available, or leaving the industry. The risks in business are as varied as life itself. The businessman faces possible losses owing to flood, plague, fire, machine failure, worker alienation, sabotage, war, or capricious acts of government which destroy or appropriate property (sovereign risk). Shoe stores as well as financial intermediaries face all of these risks, but banks and other financial intermediaries specialize in financial contracting and thereby rely upon counterparties’ performance under their contracts. Counterparty performance is rarely assured, but it can be improved with the application of banker skills. Hence, the mitigation, control, even avoidance, of banking risks.  

This raises the question of which risks are retained by the institution and which are shifted to others via some form of insurance. Core risks, which firms manage at a profit are accompanied by ancillary risks, all the many other risks that arise in the business but for which the business possesses no special skills in processing. These ancillary risks will require management nonetheless if they are not to prove destructive. Ancillary risk will be shifted to others through various means – using capital or insurance markets, modifying operations, or in extremis avoiding lines of business. Not all ancillary risk is avoidable, however, if one is to remain in a particular business. A residual of ancillary risk will remain to be protected against with bank equity, but fortunately one firm’s ancillary risk is likely to be another’s core risk, giving rise to trade in risks that permit mitigation, enhance production and the general welfare.  

Risk is central to financial intermediaries in the sense that clients see these institutions as fundamentally providing a risk-abatement service. Using our automobile example, customers are motivated by a need for safe and convenient transportation services. In contrast, financial intermediaries are asked to provide credit, liquidity, interest rate certainty, and various types of insurance all of which alleviate risks for customers. Indeed, these special financial risks define categories of intermediaries. Credit risk is the sine qua non of commercial banking, mortality risk defines life insurers, market (price) risk is the core competency of investment banking, and property risk is the bailiwick of casualty insurers. Liquidity is provided by any financial institution that absorbs more illiquid claims than it emits. Hence, deposits in banking are withdrawable on demand, yet are invested in illiquid loans. But liquidity is a fleeting, some say ephemeral, trait of claims that is often guaranteed, either explicitly or tacitly, by central banks through their control of the supply of legal tender, the money supply. When confronted with excess withdrawals, banks can borrow from their central banks.  

Note that risk is not due to variability per se, but rather due to uncertainty. In an ex post sense, we often use the terms variability and uncertainty synonymously. However, in an ex ante sense, the two are quite distinct. We can have a cash flow, for example, that is known for sure ex ante to be 1, –100, 1,000, and 0 in years 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Here we have considerable variability, but no risk as all cash flows are known beforehand. By contrast, a cash flow that can be either $+1$ or $^{-1}$ with equal probability in each of the next 4 years has less variability but has risk.2 Risk, then, is related to uncertainty or unpredictability.3  

In the following pages, we will introduce three types of risk – credit, interest rate, and liquidity risk – that commercial banks are most noted for processing. Arguably, credit risk is core to banking and interest rate and liquidity risks are ancillary. Following the discussion of these quintessential banking risks, we will turn to the subject of managing risk from a more integrated or comprehensive viewpoint, the topic of Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM.  

# BASIC BANKING RISKS  

Banks are no different from other firms in their exposure to core and ancillary business risks even if details differ across industries. Indeed, the specific nature of these risks define the industry. A bank’s shareholders, or the shareholders of any other firm for that matter, bear risk when the firm’s “assets” differ in some economically relevant way from its “liabilities.”  

Consider the steel fabrication company in Figure 4.1  The risk to the fabricator’s shareholders arises substantially from the fact that the prices of raw and fabricated steel do not move in perfect unison. This exposes the fabricator’s profit to margin fluctuations and results in risk for its shareholders. Note that this risk arises from a mismatch on the fabricator’s balance sheet. Its liability (what it owes its suppliers for raw steel) differs from its assets (the present value of fabricated steel it expects to sell) because the prices of raw and fabricated steel are imperfectly correlated.  

Now suppose the fabricator purchases raw steel in Japan, paying its suppliers in Japanese yen, and sells fabricated steel in the United States, receiving dollars from its customers. In this case, we see that the fabricator’s balance sheet is further mismatched because of the different currencies involved. Consequently, its shareholders face currency risk (due to exchange rate variability in the yen and the dollar) in addition to the price risk they faced earlier. In general, liabilities are the present value of commitments to make payments where assets are the present value of expected receipts. Since the amount and timing of both positive and negative payments are uncertain, the net of the two gives rise to risk. Mismatches imply risks. This is a notion familiar from Chapter 2  Qualitative asset transformation involves mismatching the two sides of the balance sheet, which creates a particular form of risk.  

What are the major mismatches for banks? These are described in Figure 4.2 where we see that a bank’s representative assets (e.g., loans) and liabilities (e.g., demand deposits) are mismatched along three dimensions. First, the assets usually involve greater credit risk than the liabilities, that is, the bank’s claim against the borrower is more likely to default than the depositor’s claim against the bank. Second, the assets are usually of longer duration than the liabilities. For example, a loan may have a 1-year maturity, whereas demand deposits are withdrawable on demand (negligible maturity). This creates interest rate risk. Third, a bank’s liabilities are usually more liquid than its assets, that is, a depositor is able to withdraw funds at will, whereas the bank cannot call a performing loan at will, and the loan is unlikely to trade in an active secondary market. Hence, liquidity risk. We shall consider each of these risks in more detail as a prelude to subsequent chapters where we provide more technical detail.

FIGURE 4.2 Major Mismatches for Banks  

# CREDIT, INTEREST RATE, AND LIQUIDITY RISKS  

Default, Credit, or Counterparty Risk  

A party to whom you lend funds may fail to fully discharge the terms of the loan contract. For a bank, this is the risk that a borrower fails to deliver contractual payments on a timely basis. This risk is central to virtually all rental transactions, and as in the case of almost all insurance contracts, moral hazard is a key element of credit risk.  

Banks can avoid credit risk by purchasing assets with little or no default risk, such as government securities or the debt of other triple-A rated borrowers. However, such a strategy will provide very little return over the bank’s cost of borrowing and with other intermediation costs factored in, the bank’s profit may be negative. Thus, certainty is achieved, but only at the cost of losses. The bank thus chooses assets with nontrivial default risk, and in doing so exploits its special ability (core competency) to mitigate default risk by resolving moral hazard and other informational problems. In Chapters 2 and 3  we indicated that banks enjoy a special advantage in screening and monitoring borrowers.  

Cash flow variations arise from both physical and moral hazards. Banks screen borrowers in order to assess lending risk ex ante  This involves an analysis of the borrower’s financial statements and other relevant financial and operating information. In this capacity, the bank is similar to a bond-rating agency. The bank’s monitoring is designed to control moral hazard, which occurs after the loan is made. As we will see in some detail in the next chapter, the borrower is likely to have both an incentive and opportunity to take actions after a borrowing that increases the bank’s risk exposure. This is why restrictive covenants are included in loan contracts. However, bank monitoring of borrower compliance with these covenants is required to control moral hazard. Thus, the efficiency with which the bank performs its basic functions is key to determining its own credit risk.  

Moreover, loans are subject to management as a portfolio. A bank can further control its default risk by holding many loans with imperfectly correlated prospects and thereby diversifying. However, the bank’s assessment, monitoring, and contract design skills are usually somewhat specialized leading to diversification within a limited set of industries.  

# Interest Rate Risk  

If the firm’s assets and liabilities are traded, they are subject to being revalued by the market. Any such revaluation, due to changes in either the level or structure of interest rates, is described as interest rate risk. For example, suppose a bank makes a 2-year, $\$1$ million loan for which it charges $6\%$ interest. It faces the choice of financing the loan with a 2-year deposit at $4\%$ per annum, or with a 1-year deposit at $2\%$ per annum. The former choice will result in $\$20,000$ in interest earnings for each of the 2 years provided the loan performs as contracted. However, if the bank chooses the 1-year financing, it will earn $\$40,000$ in year 1, but its earnings in year 2 will depend on the currently unknown 1-year interest rate prevalent a year from now. Should the 1-year rate remain unchanged, the bank will enjoy a second year of earning $\$40,000$ . And if the 1-year rate were to fall to $1\%$ , management will do even better and record second-year earnings of $\$50,000$ . But interest rates may rise as well, as the S&L industry discovered to its chagrin in 1980–1981, and should the 1-year rate rise to, say, $6\%$ , the bank will merely break even in year 2. This example illustrates both the essence of interest rate risk and its discretionary aspect. The risk could have been avoided with the choice of 2-year financing, assuming of course that 2-year financing was available. If not available, or if available only at a rate exceeding $6\%$ , the bank need not have offered the borrower a 2-year, fixed-rate loan at $6\%$ .  

Indeed, the bank’s cost of 2-year funds would no doubt have played a role in pricing the loan at the outset. Whatever, the bank’s choice of loan pricing, it would have faced the choice of 1-year, 2-year, or $n$ -year funding and that choice would, to a first approximation, determine the interest rate risk underwritten by the bank. Notably, whatever the duration (im)balance chosen by the bank, it could use derivatives to mitigate or amplify its interest rate risk. We will explore this alternative in greater detail in Chapter 5  

Another aspect of interest rate risk arises from loan prepayment uncertainty. The duration of a loan can be shortened at the borrower’s discretion through premature repayment or through violation of loan contract terms, in which case the loan automatically “accelerates.” Apart from defalcation, if market interest rates drop precipitously, the borrower is likely to exercise its option to refinance, in which case the loan is prepaid and a new one issued. This prepayment phenomenon makes expected duration shorter than term to maturity and it also transforms duration (im)balance into a random variable.  

# Liquidity Risk  

The risk that an asset owner is unable to realize its full value at the time a sale is desired is the liquidity risk. In banking, the liquidity risk of a borrower is that the lender may choose not to renew a loan that a borrower wishes to renew. Similarly, the liquidity risk faced by a bank is that depositors may unexpectedly withdraw their deposits and the bank may be unable to replace them without impairing its net worth. This risk applies symmetrically to borrowers in their relationship to banks, as well as to banks in their relationship to depositors. Depositors are lenders to their bank. In general, liquidity risk is more than just withdrawal risk. It refers to the potential loss the seller of an asset incurs because the selling price falls below the fundamental value of the asset.  

The most extreme manifestation of liquidity risk is that the asset owner is simply unable to sell at any positive price, that is, the only feasible selling price is zero – a kind of market failure. In credit markets, this phenomenon is known as credit rationing, whereby a borrower is refused credit regardless of price. We shall have more to say about credit rationing in Chapter 8  but for now it suffices to say that this phenomenon has long perplexed economists because it indicates an apparent suspension of price as the arbiter of allocations.  

Liquidity risk has yet another interpretation. Asset markets vary widely in their development and level of activity. At one extreme, we have flea markets for “one-of-a-kind” items of dubious authenticity. At the other we have 24-hour around-theworld markets for currencies and government debt in which large quantities are traded at relatively low cost. More primitive and less active markets are typically characterized by large bid–ask spreads, defined as the difference between the price at which one can buy and simultaneously sell an asset at the same place. For example, you can buy a Treasury bill at an ask of $\$98$ and sell it at a bid of $\$981$ , in which case the bid–ask spread is $\$98!/_{2}-\$98!/_{4}=$ . Bid–ask spreads range from small fractions of a percent of the asset’s value for actively traded assets, to $6\%$ or $7\%$ for residential property. Still larger bid–ask spreads are evidence for infrequently traded, heterogeneous, and hard-to-value objects such as antique automobiles or works of art. Bid–ask spreads are often taken to reflect the liquidity in asset markets.  

Illiquid assets are those for which “full value” is not readily realizable. That is, time and effort are required to capture the full value of an asset that is relatively illiquid.4 Hence, a bank holding illiquid assets can find itself unable to redeem its liabilities on short notice, and the problem of managing the balance sheet against this eventuality is referred to as liquidity or cash management (cash is the asset with liquidity par excellence). The central bank, with its capacious lender-of-last-resort facility, was created to address those instances when the bank, having sound albeit illiquid assets, is unable to meet its withdrawals. The central bank provides other banks with crisis-avoiding liquidity by lending against illiquid but otherwise presumably sound earning assets. Indeed, the central bank was designed to socialize a portion of the bank’s liquidity problem.  

# ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT  

Earlier in this chapter, we took a first pass at explaining credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk as if they existed in distinct silos. That is how these risks are managed at many financial institutions. But in recent years, a more integrated approach to risk management has emerged. We now discuss this contemporary approach, beginning with a motivation for its adoption.  

The twenty-first century has become the Age of Risk Management owing to egregious business failures dating back to the 1980s. Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Continental Illinois Bank, the Savings and Loan industry, and more recently, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the nuclear meltdown at Fukushima-Daiichi, and the massive failures during the 2007–2009 global financial crisis were widely diagnosed as risk-management failures. Even in cases such as Countrywide Mortgage, where venality allegedly played a role, an effective risk-management structure might have averted disaster. The commonality of risk-management deficiencies prompted an elevation of the standards of risk management that were codified in legislation (The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Dodd-Frank Act are two American examples) and stricter public regulation in both Europe and the United States (see Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 2014). Moreover, the credit-rating agencies, especially Standard and Poor’s and Moodys, widely excoriated for their own conflicts and errors in evaluating toxic mortgage-backed securities, incorporated stricter risk management and governance standards among their assessment criteria. Various stock exchanges also added stricter governance and risk-management requirements.  

Elevated risk-management standards became part of corporate governance mandating more accountability from public company boards of directors. Less than pristine but nonetheless widespread board practices became unacceptable. Boards dominated by management with the CEO serving as chairman, interlocking arrangements, backscratching practices, casual attendance, and preparation for board meetings were all common but unacceptable with the recent elevation of corporate governance standards. The growing formality, granularity, and integration of risk management became a central part of this elevation of governance standards.  

Best practices in risk management came to be referred to as ERM. Put most simply, ERM unified and codified standards and practices of risk management. Earlier, risk management was common among large business organizations, but it was essentially fragmented and informal. Financial risk management involved capital budgeting and financing decisions with special attention to the debt–equity mix (financial leverage) and related decisions on hedging, diversifying, and shifting risk using the panoply of financial instruments including swaps, options, and futures. Other operating risks would be addressed elsewhere in the organization using insurance markets, hence, Errors and Omissions, Directors’ and Officers’, property, and life insurance. Still other operating risks were addressed by maintaining slack in the forms of inventory, inspection, and other seemingly redundant resources. Yet other bonds and guarantees would be exchanged to redistribute risks among the object organization, its customers, and its vendors. The fragmented nature of risk management within organizations was flawed in two ways. Its haphazard distribution within the organization was conducive to errors of omission and nowhere was risk integrated and pondered as a holistic challenge. Nowhere were all of the variegated exposures, mitigants, and residual risks aggregated to portray the overall risk of the business. This was the conundrum that ERM addressed.  

Initially, ERM sought to summarize all material risks with a view to presenting a single-valued index to describe the total risk of the enterprise. However, it was quickly recognized that this was impractical given the extreme variety of risks and more particularly the wide differences in their measurability, especially among larger, more complex financial institutions. Financial risks are sometimes measurable unambiguously but operating risks less so. Some hazards are very destructive, but fortunately they occur only infrequently. Think of the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill, for example. Estimated to have cost to the order of $\$50$ Billion, but ex ante this exposure might easily have varied by an order of magnitude, or more. Likewise, oil spills are not uncommon, but one of the Deepwater Horizon’s magnitude, and at sea, was unprecedented. Hence, its probability was de minimis  but difficult to evaluate with any precision. Its standard error of estimate might easily be an order of magnitude larger than its expected value! When many such risks are to be summed and compounded, errors magnify beyond the realm of practicality. This realization led ERM practitioners away from the idea that the summation of risks was merely a communication problem. Hence, the idea that ERM was to simply aggregate all business risks was superseded in favor of the more modest ambition to catalog and evaluate all material risks in order to focus on the most disastrous, the risks that threatened organizational sustainability. ERM would thereby reduce or ideally eliminate the errors of omission enabled by the fragmentation of risk management across the many venues within the organization.  

ERM therefore is nothing more than a comprehensive and systematic approach to the management of material risks facing the organization. The ultimate goal is to avoid errors of omission that threaten organizational sustainability and the attendant punitive costs of receivership and reorganization, so-called bankruptcy costs. The key points in ERM are the recognition and prioritization of all material risks. Improved communication is central. Only therewith can risks be managed effectively.  

Implementation of ERM varies across organizations and industries as risks vary according to environments. Thus, energy companies share a unique concern for environmental problems. Mining and construction companies tend to focus on worker safety issues. Social media issues are of particular concern to consumer-facing industries. Financial intermediaries are naturally inclined to give priority to financial risks, including credit (counterparty), liquidity, interest rate, and market risks. Global intermediaries tend to be exposed additionally to exchange rate risks.  

TABLE 4.1 The OCC’s Risk Taxonomy   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Credit risk</td><td>Risk of borrower's failure to comply with loan contract terms (a more detailed discussion appears in Chapter 7)</td></tr><tr><td> Interest rate risk</td><td>Exposure to losses arising from duration imbalances on assets and liabilities (a more detailed discussion appears in</td></tr><tr><td>Liquidity risk</td><td>Chapter 5) Inability to realize fullvalue on anasset owing to the need to monetize it on short notice (a more detailed</td></tr><tr><td> Price risk</td><td>discussion appears in Chapter 6) Risk of assets varying in market value</td></tr><tr><td>Operational risk</td><td> Risk of lossresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, orfrom external events</td></tr><tr><td>Compliance risk</td><td>Failure to adequately monitor and supervise, to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, both public and private, applicable to the organization</td></tr><tr><td>Strategic risk</td><td> Failure to achieve the goals of the enterprise's articulated strategy</td></tr><tr><td>Reputation risk</td><td>Risk of lossof brand equityor organizational credibility that jeopardizes the organization's ability to function successfully</td></tr></table></body></html>  

These special concerns are reflected in the way organizations categorize their risk concerns, the taxonomy of risk. Overarching risks will often warrant a standing committee of the board of directors. Mining and airline boards may have safety committees. Consumer brands companies may have social responsibility committees. Commercial banks will have credit committees and often ALCO (Asset, Liability committees), the latter to focus on interest rate and liquidity risks.  

To illustrate, the commercial bank risk taxonomy, shown in Table 4.1  is prescribed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the primary public regulator of nationally chartered banks in the United States.5  

The above is specific to commercial banking as regulated by the OCC. Individual banks may add granularity, and banks outside the purview of the OCC may have somewhat different risk categories. Virtually all commercial banks would cover these categories in one way or another. However, once we leave the world of commercial banking, one could expect some variation in the taxonomy of risks. For example, life insurers sell annuities (protection against elongated life), life insurance (protection against premature death), and health and accident insurance (protection against debilitation). These longer-term liabilities generate cash flows that tend to fund investment-grade securities, mostly longer term debt of governments and corporations. Life insurance companies consequently process relatively little credit or counterparty risk, but have major exposure to mortality, morbidity, and longevity risk owing to their liabilities. A life insurer’s major concerns would be the ability to predict life and morbidity expectancy among groups. Hence, pandemics, medical technology, and lifestyles would be major concerns. On the investment side, they are exposed to repricing in capital markets, but relatively little liquidity risk. Again, assets and liabilities are of relatively longer term and durations are better matched than among commercial banks. Life insurance company boards will be structured accordingly and Investment and Finance Committees will tend to replace the Credit and ALCO committees commonly found among commercial bank boards. Thus, public company board structures adapt to the hazards and exposures each find most threatening, quite as one might expect.  

In the realm of financial intermediation, the type of risk an intermediary processes as its specialty is defining. It gives the intermediary its identity and we therefore refer to such risk as a core risk. The core risk derives from the intermediary’s core competency. Thus, we have Table 4.2  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"> TABLE 4.2 The Core Risk is Defining</td></tr><tr><td>Institution</td><td>Core Risk/Competency</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial bank</td><td>Credit or counterparty credit risk</td></tr><tr><td> Investment bank</td><td>Market or price risk</td></tr><tr><td>Life insurer</td><td> Mortality/morbidity/longevity risk</td></tr><tr><td> Property/casualty insurer</td><td>Assorted physical or moral hazards</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr></table></body></html>  

# ERM and Tail Risks  

Financial intermediaries create value by processing core risks. They possess special skills and financial capital that permit them to accept specific types of risk at lower net cost than other economic agents and they therefore profit in doing so. The commercial bank, for example, possesses special skills in designing and administering credit contracts. It can therefore offer credit at a lower cost to the borrower than can other lenders without such skills. The bank will therefore be motivated to accept as much credit risk as it can. The limits on its ability to accept credit risk inhere in its stock of specialized human capital (lending officers and other credit specialists) and financial capital. At any moment, these resources are fixed (adjustments in human and financial capital are costly, especially in the short term) and this limits the amount of credit the bank will desire to extend. Readily available inputs fix the amount of credit risk the bank can profitably absorb. To be sure, even with additional lending capacity at its disposal, the bank will not be indiscriminate in absorbing credit risk. It will choose those risks with which it is thoroughly familiar so that it can price the risk appropriately and control the risk via design and monitoring of the credit contract. It will also seek to control risk concentrations by establishing a maximum loan size according to borrower and lender circumstances and may also limit total loans according to industry and/or geography, as well as individual borrower characteristics. A key part of the bank’s skills lie in discriminating among potential borrowers with a view to controlling credit losses.  

The insurer possesses comparable skills, but these relate to selection, pricing, and administration of liabilities rather than assets. The life insurer chooses its mortality risk exposure with the same discriminating skill that the banks deploy with regard to borrowers. It too will expect to earn a profit on each life insurance contract it sells and will therefore wish to sell as many as possible, but it too confronts limitations imposed by the short-term fixity of human and financial capital and it needs to be mindful as well of concentrations of risk, even core risks.  

In addition to the mundane management of core risk, the intermediary must be ever mindful of those special risks that are capable of overwhelming the organization, those referred to as existential or tail risks. They are existential because they threaten the organization’s sustainability. They are tail risks because their impact is mercifully infrequent and therefore these hazards reside in the tail of the probability distribution. For the larger commercial bank, a protracted and severe economy-wide recession of the type realized in 1929 or 2007 illustrates such a risk. In such an event, credit risk diversification implodes as all credit risks become correlated and depositors queue up to withdraw their funds. The bank is no longer viable. In the case of the life insurers, an avian influenza pandemic could impose mortality losses, which again become correlated via contagion and could easily overwhelm its claims-paying ability jeopardizing viability. Such tail risks are the overarching concerns of ERM. Because these risks portend overwhelming outcomes – consider the Fukushima-Daiichi meltdown or the BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill – and because their realization is so rare, they tend to be badly mispriced. They often are simply ignored.  

Psychologists and behavioral economists have spent long hours pondering these tail phenomena and a rich literature on behavioral biases has been produced. We discuss some of them which are particularly relevant for understanding how individuals and institutions deal with tail risks.  

# Overconfidence  

Overconfidence is said to be “the most robust finding in the psychology of judgment,”6 or simply the “mother of all biases.”7 Investors and executives often resort to rules of thumb eschewing careful analysis and readily available information. Kahneman refers to this in his famous book Thinking, fast and slow as “fast thinking.”8 Overconfidence is also manifest in group dynamics in the literature on groupthink where it subsumes both excessive optimism and certainty regarding estimates. The resulting congenital optimism leads to underestimation of negative tail risks.  

# Anchoring (Focalism)  

This decision-making bias stems from the undue impact of recency. Thus, a large loss suffered recently leads to overestimating the probability of a current loss and symmetrically the absence of a recent loss results in underestimation of current period exposure. In forming judgments, the decision maker is thus affected by the way in which information is presented and recency is one dimension of the presentation format. Taleb’s famous book Black Swan  which maintains that unprecedented events tend to be underpriced, is a type of anchoring.9 According to this hypothesis, extreme events, unless they occurred recently, tend to be underestimated or even ignored. As an extreme occurrence fades into the past its probability of occurrence tends to not only be diminished, but also becomes increasingly biased toward zero.  

# Groupthink  

Groupthink describes a particular group dynamics leading to a decision-making pathology. Occurring under widely observed conditions, groupthink can lead to a degradation of decision making whereby group members sacrifice their independence in favor of herding behavior.10 A minority, often of one, becomes the decision maker often with impetuosity and unwarranted rectitude. A variety of groupthink symptoms could lead to overestimation of the group’s power and morality, pressures toward uniformity of viewpoint and closed-mindedness. The conditions that give rise to groupthink include cohesiveness, isolation, lack of diversity, partiality of leadership, absence of procedural protocols, stress, recent failures, and moral dilemmas.  

Groupthink has special relevance for tail risk because ERM ultimately devolves to boards of directors which are vulnerable to the preconditions of groupthink. Corporate boards often make a virtue of collegiality that can be readily conflated with cohesiveness. Similarly, boards are rarely paragons of diversity and their insulation from shareholders and other stakeholders has been widely chronicled in the proxy access literature as well as legislative and regulatory deliberations. Board decisions are often taken under stressful conditions and moral dilemmas are not uncommon. Decisions from the Enron board room prior to its collapses would have served well in illustrating the pathologies of group decision-making. Groupthink and its symptomatic optimism relate directly to tail risk assessments. According to this frame of thought, the probability of calamitous events is routinely underestimated by groups like public company boards or partners’ committees.  

# Decision Biases and Discernibility  

The decision biases essayed by psychologists and behavioral economists illuminate the puzzle of mispricing of negative tail risks. The common neglect of existential risks challenge our understanding, but they may nevertheless be rational given their diminutive probabilities of occurrence. However, there remains the inescapable impression that in many cases, neglect reflects errors of omission. Hence, the resort to decision biases and even fanciful metaphors like the Black Swan. One interpretation of apparent neglect is that many of these existential risks have very small probabilities, and it is difficult to distinguish indefinitely small probabilities from zero. There are many analogies in nature. For example, unaided by special instruments small particles are invisible and high-frequency sounds are inaudible. We require particle accelerators, microscopes, telescopes, hearing aids to enable perceptibility. Closer to home, high-frequency trading occurs too quickly for unaided human response. In each case, human senses are simply too coarse and sluggish to perceive certain phenomena without the aid of special instruments. Likewise, we can think of ERM, a formalized set of risk-management tools and protocols, as an instrument for heightening the perceptibility of low probability events. Let us turn now to the organizational and communicative innovations and other tools that in sum comprise the best practices of ERM.  

# Organizing for ERM  

Implementation of ERM requires organizational adaptations with attendant costs. Adaptations are at the board and senior management levels as well as throughout staff and operating levels of the organization. Let us consider each of this triad of organizational changes.  

# The Board  

Much of the work of the Board of Directors of a public company is performed by standing committees. Although formally advisory in large part, these committees explore issues in depth and make recommendations that the board most frequently will affirm without challenge. This is the product of a pervasive culture that is widely described as collegial. The culture is essentially cooperative and collaborative by necessity because boards tend to be severely time constrained so that when they become contentious they tend also to become inefficient or even dysfunctional. Boards therefore tend to reconfigure their membership when disputes severely inhibit decision-making. Endless time is rarely available for the tedious discovery of consensus.  

Before the implementation of ERM, virtually all public company boards would have an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. In addition to these three, there would be company- or industry-specific committees to reflect overarching board concerns. However, the introduction of a standing committee of the board charged with the responsibility for integrative risk management is culturally transformational. First, other committees tend to have responsibilities that are nonoverlapping, but the risk-management committee is charged with intersecting responsibilities. Its integrative responsibility forces it to monitor other committee’s labors. Second, vetting business strategy is one of the few responsibilities of the board that tends not to be delegated to a subcommittee. It is so fundamental that it is commonly reserved to the committee of the whole. However, ERM is the functional complement to strategy. Whereas the latter seeks to discover organizational opportunities, the former explores hazards or constraints that limit opportunities. In this sense, risk management is the complement to strategy. Indeed, risk management in its integrative expression can be viewed as a facet of strategy and therefore the standing committee charged with ERM calls into question the nondelegability of the business strategy process. ERM enhances board accountability, but also subtly transforms corporate governance.  

# Executive Risk-Management Committee  

The introduction of a standing committee of the board charged with risk management prompted the creation of an officer’s risk-management committee, if only to dialog with the board on issues of organizational sustainability. When risk management was distributed among disparate operating units, operating risks might ultimately come to a Chief Operating Officer and financial risks might find their way to the Chief Financial Officer, but integration was lacking and errors of omission were too easily tolerated. Aggregation and prioritization of risks needed C-suite attention to organize, contextualize, and interpret information to be brought to the board. The board might monitor, supervise, and counsel, but execution and formulation remained a management responsibility. Thus, effective risk management requires a C-suite committee to support and complement the board’s risk-management activities.  

# Office of the CRO  

The final organizational innovation prompted by ERM is the Chief Risk Officer, along with the supporting staff. One aim of ERM is to facilitate the vertical and horizontal flow of risk information within the organization. Information is the lubricant of ERM and it falls to the CRO and staff to augment the communication of risk information. In addition to specialists and technicians, the CRO will often designate rapporteurs in each significant staff and operating unit within the organization. In addition to foster dialog, the CRO will have a basket of measurement and communication tools. Simulation and stress tests gauge the organization’s ability to withstand various shocks, both external and internal. Shocks that might be simulated include fraud, hacking, disruptive technological advances, economy-wide economic disturbances, or force majeure  such as hurricanes, fires, or floods. Simulations ask whether such exigencies would threaten solvency, liquidity, or operating continuity. Thus, the CRO collects and processes risk information on an organization-wide basis for transmission to both the board and C-suite committees for their analysis and dispositive actions.  

# The Communication Triad  

As in the case of the organizational triad, there is a corresponding triad of communication tools associated with ERM. They are the Risk Culture Statement, the Risk Register, and the Risk Appetite.  

# Risk Culture  

Definitions of risk abound. Hence, risk management has a variety of interpretations. The Statement of Risk Culture seeks to dispel the ambiguity surrounding thought and behaviors. It seeks to promote a common understanding within the organization of terms, values, and practices regarding risk and its management. It is about getting all organizational members on the same page or initializing. This may seem a simple, even pedestrian, task. But in large, complex organizations where workers have disparate incentives, not to mention languages and educational preparations, fostering a common vocabulary can be a formidable challenge. Fostering shared values is a still more ambitious challenge. The content of the Statement of Risk Culture therefore normally includes a glossary of risk vocabulary, a risk taxonomy, and a statement of organizational purpose, values, and aspirations. Sometimes these are described as mission, vision, and values.  

Culture is about shared values and the organization’s ultimate purpose revolves around collaboration and cooperation. Large, complex organizations are constantly striving to align individuals in order to foster a common understanding and motivation. Many risk failures derive from a misalignment of values, and the purpose of the culture statement is to combat behavior that is alien to the organization. All too common rogue behavior in banking is well illustrated by the “London Whale” event at J. P. Morgan Chase, by the trading scandals at AIG involving Credit Default Swaps, at Societe Generale involving Jerome Kerviel, and at Barings Bank in Singapore involving Nick Leeson. The recent LIBOR conspiracy among banks centered in London is still another example. Such antisocial behavior has brought huge costs as well as ill-repute to the banking community. The culture statement seeks to articulate organizational fundamentals, both positive and normative, to avoid misunderstandings among members and thereby reduce the probability of behaviors that add unwanted (ancillary) risk to the organization.11 At the outset, a common vocabulary and framework for thinking about risk is required. Only thereafter can categoricals and calibrations be established that will set boundaries on individual’s ability to accept risk on behalf of the organization. Only then can standards for supervision and monitoring of risks be effective.  

# Risk Register  

The Risk Register records all perceived risks facing the organization. Information is collected from correspondents throughout the organization. Each operational unit and each staff unit will routinely report to the Office of the CRO on issues as perceived on the front line. Employees, customers, vendors, investors, the general public, capital providers, labor unions, environmentalists, and still other stakeholders all pose hazards and risk for the organization. All need to be monitored and those doing the monitoring need to report the emerging and material risks to the Office of the CRO so that all material risks can be and are memorialized in the Risk Register, the diary of all organizational exposures. The aim is to be comprehensive and detailed; encyclopedic.  

The recording of exposures in the Risk Register will normally include a narrative describing each risk, its origin, imminence and idiosyncrasies. The narrative will normally be accompanied by calibration that estimates the gross risk (exposure) and its probability of realization, the steps taken to mitigate the risk, as well as a description of steps that might be taken to further mitigate (insurance, use of financial derivatives, and/or operational measures such as added supervision) and their costs, and finally an assessment of residual or remaining risks. The purpose is to record it all in order to minimize omission errors. This is a necessary first step toward managing material risks. Awareness is the antidote to all the decision biases and behavioral eccentricities – the groupthink, the congenital optimism, the anchoring – that predispose toward omission and even denial. Those who lead cannot claim ignorance if risks are systematically recorded and calibrated. The well-kept Risk Register will therefore compel managerial attention.  

# Risk Appetite  

The Communication Triad is completed with the Risk Appetite, a written statement of the organization’s risk preferences. The Risk Appetite is the normative counterpart to the Risk Register and is perforce the product of dialog between the board and senior management. The Risk Appetite statement is a detailed and granular interpretation of those risks that are core as well as those that are ancillary. Limitations on the acquisition of various types of risk are spelled out in detail. Those risks the organization will wish to absorb, mitigate, and minimize will be enumerated and calibrated. The Risk Appetite statement will thereby effectively configure the organization’s balance sheet. Indicated also will be the sanctioned use of risk mitigants including natural hedges that give rise to basis risk (think of the life insurance company selling annuities) or financial derivatives such as swaps, options, or futures contracts, or operating measures such as added safety and security equipment or slack productive resources including inventories, back-up equipment, and extra space or diversification among vendors.  

All of the available risk mitigants engender added operating costs and/or possibly new forms of exposure. Risk mitigation, like risk management more generally, is an often a subtle, nuanced process calling forth technical skills – financial, engineering, logistical, and scientific – that can challenge the mastery of both directors and managers. This knowledge void often leads to the employment of content specialists both within and outside the organization. When the need for granularity and detail confronts the limits of board and management mastery, consultants are often marshaled and the drafting of the Risk Appetite becomes an intellectual journey, an invaluable learning experience for both the board and senior management. A well-cast Risk Appetite statement not only distinguishes between core and ancillary risks, but also establishes absolute limits (tolerances) on various kinds of exposures. The Risk Appetite will likewise list those exposures that are to be avoided categorically (e.g., those that endanger customer or workers’ lives). Thus, each and every variety of risk must be acknowledged along with the organization’s willingness to tolerate it, given the culture, financial, and real resources of the organization. Each of the exposures enumerated will require quantification in both gross and net amounts, where mitigation intervenes. Moreover, covariation among risks must be acknowledged where these are material. Especially important can be the tendency for carefully constructed diversification to implode in times of economic stress or natural disaster. In the final analysis, the Risk Appetite is a comprehensive statement of risk preferences and tolerances which is ultimately confronted with the more positive or descriptive statement of extant risks enumerated in the Risk Register. These two statements, subordinate to the Risk Culture Statement, are counterparts and complements that shape organizational policy.  

# Other ERM Innovations  

The Organizational and Communications Triads can be said to define ERM, but a host of more operational tools are important for characterizing and quantifying specific risks. For example, scenario planning contemplates future states of the world. Political, economic, regulatory, environmental forces are pondered and their possible impacts on the organization are examined. Likewise, war gaming considers competitive and technological drivers that may give rise to disruptive forces such as product obsolescence, severe price breaks, a fundamental shift in consumer tastes owing to successful marketing efforts of rivals. Typically, outside experts are convened for such deliberations and Delphic forums are organized to present outside-the-box thinking in preparation for the organization’s uncertain future.  

Simulations and stress tests represent another more quantitative tool. Mathematical models of the organization, its balance sheet, income and fund-flow statements are formulated in computer language and then perturbed, typically by altering parameters or exogenous variables, one at a time or in combination, to see how endogenous variables of special interest are affected. Monte Carlo methods are often employed so as to evaluate how random disturbances of varying likelihood will affect earnings, liquidity, capital, and other measures of organizational performance. Stress tests have become de rigueur for bank public regulators and management as well. These simulations ask how 1, 5, 10, and $20\%$ credit losses might affect cash, income, and capital adequacy of the bank. Similarly, other variables such as demand deposits, investments, or fee income are perturbed to explore their implications for the key measures of bank performance. Simulations are based on mathematical models that incorporate simplifications and assumptions that are inevitably debatable. They have nevertheless proven enormously useful in guiding regulatory and management policy especially with regard to financial leverage, asset concentrations, and overall financial performance.  

Dashboards are often employed as yet another tool of ERM. These are detailed displays, typically on computer screens, that track a variety of risk and performance measures in real time and therefore provide information in a readily accessible, compelling, and efficient manner. One can easily understate dashboard importance, but the assembly and presentation of disparate and complex information in a convenient real-time fashion represents a substantive advance in communication and this is a central aspect of ERM. The dashboard is an enhancement in risk discernibility for those most responsible for its management.  

# CONCLUSION  

This chapter introduced the defining topic of risks in banking. The earlier half was devoted to an overview of the three types of risk that are fundamental to commercial banking. Credit risk, the risk that a borrower fails to fulfill the terms of a loan contract, we refer to as “core” in that it is the domain in which the bank most compellingly creates value and earns profit. In managing credit risk, the bank marshals its core competencies in attracting and screening loan applicants, designing, and administering loan contracts. These skills are quintessential in commercial banking and subsume qualifying customers, pricing, design of covenants, securing collateral, servicing payments, monitoring the borrower, enforcing terms, and renegotiating the loan when necessary.  

In addition to credit risk, the bank inescapably sustains interest rate and liquidity risks. By financing illiquid loans with liquid deposits, and other short-term claims, the bank provides its customers with liquidity. The bank thereby absorbs illiquidity for which it presumably is paid a premium embedded in the spread between loan and deposit interest rates. In the normal course of business, this illiquidity is both sustainable and profitable. However, in times of financial stress, either local or more general, provision of this liquidity service exposes the bank to en masse withdrawals (runs) that can threaten bank viability. The central bank, a social contrivance with the ability to print money limitlessly, is designed to address this problem. However, the challenged bank typically will need appropriate collateral to borrow at the central bank, and in any case the bank’s independence may be compromised if it requires central bank assistance. The liquidity service provided by the central bank is neither costless nor limitless.  

Interest rate risk results from the duration of bank loans exceeding the duration of the deposits with which they are funded. The nominal term of demand deposits is obviously zero, but they do not display infinite turnover. Consequently, their effective term exceeds their nominal term. Whenever the duration (effective term) of assets differs from that of the liabilities with which they are funded, the bank is subject to gains (losses) arising from shifts or twists in the yield curve. This interest rate risk is integral to the basic lending function since the effective duration of assets and liabilities is characterized by an inescapable randomness. Interest rate risk arises from the bank’s fundamental need to finance its credit extensions and both bank loans and deposits are terminated at the initiative of bank customers who are influenced by variations in market interest rates and a variety of other external events. It is the bank’s inability to forecast bank runs and interest rate movements that leads us to treat these risks as ancillary. Unlike credit risks which are core and produce a regular surplus, ancillary risks evoke no special competencies and produce no regular surplus attributable to the bank. Both liquidity and interest rate risks are nevertheless integral to banking and must therefore be managed. Some would aver that since banks provide a liquidity service and earn a premium thereby, this should be considered a core service as well. But, without the central bank lender-of-last-resort facility, this service would be unsustainable. Thus, any net earnings the banks earn should be considered a transfer payment from the central bank. The liquidity service is therefore core to the central bank, and not the borrowing commercial bank.  

The second part of our chapter on risk addresses ERM, a relatively recent innovation in response to spectacular business losses dating back to the mid-1980s that have been attributed to errors of omission in risk management. These oversights were ascribed to the traditional practices of risk management, particularly to their distributed, fragmented, and ad hoc design. Insurance was delegated to one locale, financial market hedging to another, operating decisions to yet another, and nowhere were these risks seen in their unity or totality. The traditional fragmentation of risk management encouraged neglect of interactions and other omissions.  

ERM sought to correct this apparent weakness by providing a set of protocols or best practices that enhance vigilance and promote disciplined coordination in the management of all material business risks. ERM prescribes an organizational infrastructure, the Organizational Triad, comprising the standing board committee, the parallel C-suite committee, and the Office of the CRO. Each has defined responsibilities that in sum lubricate the flow of risk information within the organization and provides accountability for risk management at the very top of the organization. A corresponding Documentary Triad, including the Risk Culture Statement, the Risk Register, and the Risk Appetite, provide discipline by spelling out both perceived risks and risk preferences in both narrative and quantitative terms according to a common vocabulary. A variety of other tools are deployed to facilitate the measurement and communication of various risks, but the two triads can be said to broadly define ERM. Ultimately, ERM seeks to reduce errors of omission by facilitating the flow of risk information and localizing accountability for risk management at the pinnacle of the organization.
