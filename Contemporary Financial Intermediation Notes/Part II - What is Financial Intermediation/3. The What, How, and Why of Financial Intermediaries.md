# The What, How, and Why of Financial Intermediaries  

“All essential knowledge relates to existence, or only such knowledge as has an essential relationship to existence is essential knowledge.”

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Securitization The act of converting an untraded (debt) claim, such as a bank loan, into a traded security by issuing claims against it and selling these claims to capital market investors. Essentially, securitization is a form of direct capital market financing with the bank acting as an originator and repackager of the loan.  

Fractional reserve banking A banking system in which banks must hold a specified fraction of their deposit liabilities as liquid assets.  

The market model A model that states that the return on a security can be partitioned into a fixed component (called “alpha”), plus a component which is a multiple (called “beta”) of the return on the “market” portfolio, plus a mean-zero residual term.  

Natural monopoly In some industries, due to economies of scale, the most economically efficient industry structure is to have only a single firm that is a natural monopoly.  

Capital requirements There are many types of regulatory capital requirements. One of these is what we typically think of as a capital ratio, which is how much equity the bank keeps as a fraction of total assets. This is called the “leverage ratio” (see Chapter 15). There are also risk-based capital ratios.  

Portfolio restrictions Restrictions on the assets that banks can hold in their portfolios.  

# INTRODUCTION  

As the following exchange between Levin and Sviyazhsky from Part III, Chapter 27 of Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina indicates, most people know what banks and other financial intermediaries do.  

“Then what’s your opinion? How should a farm be managed nowadays?” “What we have to do is to raise the standard of farming even higher.” “Yes, if you can afford it! It’s all very well for you, but. . . I’m not going to be able to buy any Percherons.” “That’s what banks are for.”  

As perceptive as this notion of banking is, we will need a deeper understanding of banks and other financial intermediaries in order to set the stage for the remaining chapters in this book. The simple view that banks exist to provide borrowing and lending services leaves us without answers to questions such as the following: (i) What does the financial system comprise and how does it work? (ii) Why do we need banks to intermediate between borrowers and lenders, that is, why do not individual borrowers and lenders transact directly and avoid the cost of going through banks?1 (iii) What, if any, are the economies of scale in the production of financial services provided by banks, or, how large should banks be? (iv) Why do we regulate banks and other depository institutions so intrusively? (v) If banks need to be regulated, how should they be regulated? (vi) How should borrowers choose whether they should borrow from banks, or venture capitalists, or directly from the capital market?  

To answer these and other questions, we need a framework that builds upon that provided in the previous chapter and illuminates the role of the financial system in promoting economic growth and the essential functions served by financial intermediaries. While we will not provide complete answers in this chapter to all of the questions posed above, our purpose is to provide a systematic way to think about these issues, so that we have a foundation for the discussions in subsequent chapters. The plan for this chapter is as follows. We begin by providing an overview of the United States financial system (which is qualitatively similar to that of most developed countries) and address the question of how the financial system functions. The focus is on the types of businesses that are involved in raising capital, and the types of financing sources available to them. This helps to provide an overall framework to understand the role that banks play in the financial system. We then provide an anecdotal discussion of how a fractional reserve banking system arises from a simple goldsmith economy. After this informal discussion, we provide a model of a bank that formalizes the goldsmith anecdote and helps us to understand the role of banks as well as the need to regulate them. These two sections provide answers to questions (i) and (iii) above, and a partial answer to question (iv). The next section introduces the fixed coefficient model (FCM) as an extension of the goldsmith anecdote and examines its implications for monetary policy. The issue of economies of scale in the production of financial intermediation services is then taken up. This provides an answer to question (ii) above. Following this, we proceed to explain how banks can make nonbank contracting more efficient, and then we review empirical evidence in support of the view that banks are special. The ownership structure of depository institutions is analyzed next. We conclude with an examination of a borrower’s choice of financing source to answer question (v) above.  

# HOW DOES THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WORK?  

# Overview  

In 2007, the financial services industry accounted for $40\%$ of total corporate profits in the United States, whereas this was $29\%$ in 2011. In the early 1980s, it accounted for only about $10\%$ . Statistics like this have prompted some to argue that financial services are becoming disproportionately important at the expense of other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and services that are obviously of tangible economic value. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Given the economic hardships we faced during the recent financial crisis, it is easy to overlook the fact that the growth in financial services over the past two decades was also accompanied by some of the most spectacular economic growth we have ever witnessed. In 1980s, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), the most commonly used measure of the size of the economy, stood at under $\$3$ trillion. In 2007, when the share of total corporate profits accounted for by financial services was four times as large as in the 1980s, the GDP stood at a towering figure of $\$14$ trillion. The U.S. financial services sector employed 5.87 million people in 2012 which is about $6\%$ of the total private nonfarm employment. This figure is expected to grow to $12\%$ by 2018. The wealth generated by the financial services industry contributed nearly $7.9\%$ $\$1.24$ trillion) to the U.S. GDP in 2012.2  

It was not a coincidence that the U.S. economy grew so rapidly during a time when financial services grew in importance. Financial markets, and the financial service firms that operate in those markets, channel money from savers to those with investment ideas and thus, help individuals and businesses raise capital of various sorts. The more well-developed the financial system, the better lubricated this channel, and the lower are the transaction costs and other obstacles to investment and economic growth.  

Indeed, the lack of developed financial systems is one of the main roadblocks to economic growth in the former easternblock Communist countries of Europe, such as Romania. Even within the United States, where the financial system is well developed, the primary reason for the failure of small businesses is the lack of access to funding. When small businesses do succeed and create employment and growth, an important factor in their success is access to the financing needed to support growth. The fact that the U.S. financial system is well developed and innovative has been a big boon to individuals and businesses alike, as they have been able to raise relatively low-cost capital to grow through a variety of financing sources. It has also been a significant factor in the creation of prominent new firms that have been launched in the past 25 years and have gone on to become global powerhouses. Starbucks, Yahoo, Google, and eBay are but a few examples.  

# The Role of the Financial System in Promoting Economic Growth3  

A rich body of research provides ample evidence that robust financial development is followed by healthy economic growth. Much of this evidence comes from a comparison of different countries. For example, in a study of 56 developing countries, the level of financial development in 1960 was a strong predictor of economic growth over the next 30 years, after controlling for a variety of economic and political factors.4 This section will discuss this research to develop an understanding of what the facts say and why they say what they say. However, before delving into that, it is useful to understand the basic economics behind how the financial system promotes economic growth.  

The Conceptual Link Between the Financial System and Economic Growth: Consider a simple example to see this link. Suppose we have an economy in which there are four people who own productive resources: Mary, Peter, Paul, and Sally. Mary has some money saved in a safe at her house. Peter owns an orchard and some apple seeds with which he can plant and grow trees from which he can harvest apples. Paul has a farm where he naturally produces fertilizer. Finally, Sally owns some farm equipment that is useful for farming the land.  

Unless otherwise paid upfront, neither Paul nor Sally is willing to sell any goods or services. Unfortunately, Peter does not have any money to pay either one of them now. Meanwhile, Mary is patient and would not mind lending her money in exchange for a larger future payment. However, she does not know Peter well and is concerned that he might be a crook.  

Without a financial system in this community, Peter would be limited to planting whatever apple trees he can using his own seeds and labor, but without any fertilizer or farm equipment. Suppose he can plant a few trees and harvest 1000 apples a year. That then defines his economic output.  

Now suppose that the economy has a financial system in place which includes a bank and financial market where financial securities are traded. As such, Peter can now go to the bank and apply for a loan that would be repaid from future sales of apples. Before the loan is approved, the bank will conduct a credit check and determine if Peter is a good credit risk. Moreover, once the loan is granted, the bank will also monitor Peter to make sure that he is not a crook who absconds with the bank loan. With the assurances provided by the bank, Mary will be willing to deposit her money in the bank in exchange for a higher payment in the future that will contain a $10\%$ interest for her. This option of earning an interest is better than keeping the money locked up in a safe and earn zero interest. With the bank loan, Peter can now afford to buy some fertilizer from Paul and some farm equipment from Sally on a cash-on-purchase basis. He now plants more trees and each tree produces more apples, so he ends up with 20,000 apples rather than 1000. The existence of a financial market has increased the economic output of this economy. A further increase in the economic output may arise from the fact that Paul and Sally may use the money received as payment from Peter to produce more fertilizer and farm equipment. This output may have applications in other parts of the economy which further increases the economic output, and so on. See Figure 3.1  

This simple example illustrates three key channels through which the financial system contributes to economic growth:  

it increases trade and the flow of goods and services; it increases the rate of physical capital accumulation; and it increases the efficiency of combining capital and labor in production.

FIGURE 3.2 The Basic Services Provided by a Financial System.  

The Services the Financial System Provides and How They Help Economic Growth: Figure 3.2 shows the four basic services that financial systems provide which help spur economic growth.5  

The Financial System Facilitates Trade: In primitive economies, much of the trade was based on barter, something that Peter and Paul/Sally were unable to do in our example because Peter did not have any apples in his inventory to trade. The invention of money minimalized the need for barter trade and thereby increased commercial transactions and trade. In modern economies, it is not enough to have money to facilitate transactions – this money needs to be moved around. With the appropriate hubs and spokes for recording and clearing multilateral financial transactions, financial systems help move money from one party to the other, often across national boundaries. In their absence, companies would be greatly impeded in their ability to do business with each other, and economic growth would suffer.  

The Financial System Facilitates Risk Management: An important service provided by financial systems is helping individuals and businesses improve their management of various sorts of risks. This is important for economic growth because an increase in risk reduces investment. In our example, Peter faces some risk when he buys fertilizer and farm equipment. A scarce rainfall may lead to a lean harvest and as such Peter may be unable to fully repay his bank loan. This may cause him to lose his farm to the bank. Or healthy precipitation might cause new apple orchards to come up in neighboring communities, increasing the supply of apples in the market, thus pushing down the price of apples. These risks may lead Peter to cut back on his investment in buying fertilizer and farm equipment. A financial system prices risk and provides mechanisms for pooling, ameliorating, and trading risk. It offers producers like Peter a way to manage risks. For instance, Peter could use the financial system to buy insurance against a poor harvest or he could hedge the apple price risk in the futures market. Investors like Mary can also benefit from the existence of the financial system by obtaining better risk management. For example, Mary may be worried about liquidity risk if she were to lend directly to Peter. Once the loan is made, Mary may not see any return to her investment until the apples are harvested and sold. But what if a medical emergency arises and Mary needs the money before then? In the presence of a financial system, Mary would simply withdraw her deposit from the bank when she needs it. Thus, a financial system, by facilitating improved risk management for both borrowers and savers, spurs long-run investments that fuel economic growth.  

The Financial System Mobilizes Resources: As pointed out in our example, Mary’s savings would have stayed locked up in her safe in the absence of a financial system. It took a financial system to mobilize those resources and get them to Peter who could put them to productive use. Almost 150 years ago, the famous economist Walter Bagehot described how the financial system helps to mobilizes resources and spur economic growth:6  

“We have entirely lost the idea that any undertaking likely to pay, and seen to be likely, can perish for want of money; yet no idea was more familiar to our ancestors, or is more common in most counties. A citizen of Long in Queen Elizabeth’s time…would have thought that it was no use inventing railways (if he could have understood what a railway meant), for you would not have been able to collect the capital with which to make them. At this moment, in colonies and in all rude countries, there is no large sum of transferable money, there is not fund from which you can borrow, and out which you can make immense works.”  

What Bagehot was referring to was the ability of the financial system to mobilize resources that would permit the development of better technologies that lead to economic growth.  

The Financial System Obtains and Processes Information and Allocates Capital: Individual savers, like Mary, may not have the resources or expertise to evaluate firms, projects, and managers before deciding whether to invest in them. On the other hand, financial intermediaries may have a cost and expertise advantage in collecting and processing such information, and then helping the capital-allocation process based on that information. This is a concept that is fleshed out later in this chapter. This, in turn, encourages investors to supply capital to these intermediaries, which channel the capital to businesses that make investments that fuel economic growth.  

To see this, imagine that a friend of yours comes to you and asks for a loan to finance a new restaurant. While you have the money to lend, you are not sure that this investment is the right one for you. However, if your friend goes to the bank, the necessary information can be gathered by the bank about potential future income and the assets purchased with the loan that can be used as collateral and conduct necessary credit analysis with this information to decide whether to lend and how to structure the loan. Such expertise is part of the bank’s business skill set. Knowing that banks will screen and monitor the lender before deciding whether to provide financing, you may be willing to deposit your money in the bank so that the bank can, in turn, use it to make loans.  

To recapitulate, the financial system provides four key services – facilitates trade, facilitates risk management, mobilizes resources, and acquires and processes information that helps in the allocation of capital. These key services help to increase the flow of goods and services, increase the rate of physical capital accumulation, and increase the efficiency of combining capital and labor in production. As a result, there is more economic growth.  

# An Overview of How the Financial System Works  

A well-developed financial system is a complex mosaic of institutions, markets, investors (businesses and individuals), savers, and financial contracts, which are all interconnected. See Figures 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5  

All three figures divide the financial system into three main parts: the users of capital, the investors who represent the sources of capital, and the financial intermediaries who facilitate the flow of capital from the investors to the users of capital. It is the flow of services provided by these intermediaries which represents the contribution of the financial system in linking the sources and uses of capital in a manner that enhances economic growth.

FIGURE 3.4 The U.S. Financial System: Businesses Raising Equity Financing.  

Before we can understand the role played by each part of the financial system, it is necessary to understand some key distinctions between the contracts by which financial capital is raised and the differences between individuals/consumers and businesses with respect to how these financing contracts are used.  

Debt versus Equity and use by Consumers and Businesses: The financial contracts by which individuals and businesses raise capital can be broadly divided into two main groups: equity and debt. With an equity contract, a business wishing to raise capital would sell an ownership stake in the company to investors willing to provide the external financing that the business needs. In the example discussed earlier, instead of taking a bank loan, Peter could go to Mary and offer her a $30\%$ stake in his apple business in order to raise the capital to buy fertilizer and farm equipment. The return to her investment would depend entirely on the profitability of the business. If Mary buys a $30\%$ stake in Peter’s business, then Mary is entitled to $30\%$ of profit the business generates, assuming all profit is distributed as dividends. For instance, if Peter makes a profit of $\$15,000$ in the first year, then Mary receives $30\%$ of that, which is $\$4500$ . However, if the business does not make any profit, then Mary would get nothing. Moreover, Mary’s investment has no stated maturity, which means Peter never has to return her initial investment. The only way for Mary to recoup her original investment is to sell her ownership stake to someone else.  

A debt contract is similar to a bank loan – the lender is promised as repayment the original loan amount plus some interest. A debt claim has both a stated maturity and priority over equity  “Stated maturity” means that the debt contract stipulates that the lender must be fully repaid by a certain date. “Priority over equity” means that debt holders must be fully repaid before shareholders can be paid. In our earlier example, if Peter finances with a loan, he must first use all of the profit from selling apples to repay the debt holder, even before he pays taxes. Only after that and paying taxes to the government can he keep what is left over as the owner of his business.

FIGURE 3.5 The U.S. Financial System: Businesses Raising Debt Financing.  

Consumers finance primarily with debt contracts.7 There is a good reason why equity is not used in consumer financing. Since a loan taken by a consumer is essentially a financial claim by the lender on the borrower’s labor income, it is relatively easy for the borrower to simply withhold the supply of this labor income – for example, by quitting work – and make the lender’s claim worthless. A debt contract, with a requirement to fully repay by a certain date and penalties for failure to repay, provides better incentives for the borrower to pay off the debt claim.  

Businesses finance with both debt and equity. In fact, the mix of debt and equity financing to use is an important decision for any business. The reason why equity financing is viable for businesses is that the financial system provides corporate governance to keep managerial actions roughly aligned with the interests of the financiers of the business, and businesses have powerful incentives to keep producing profits for a variety of reasons, so there are strong inherent incentives to not withhold the supply of productive inputs like labor.  

# Individual/Consumer Financing  

Consumers can tap a variety of sources for financing, most of which is in the form of debt. See Figure 3.3  

Friends and family provide a potentially significant source of capital. These loans often have vaguely defined maturity with specific purposes. A student loan that will be repaid sometime after graduation or a car loan are some examples of such financing. Many consumers rely on these sources of financing in emergencies or for purposes for which bank loans are difficult to get.

Credit card financing is a form of an unsecured debt – there is no specific collateral backing the loan. Since it is primarily used as a means of transaction financing, the issuer expects to be repaid from the borrower’s income within a relatively short period of time. To encourage prompt payment, the interest rates and late-payment fees tend to be high. The viability of credit card financing rests on a well-developed financial system where banks can raise financing by securitizing their creditcard receivables and selling the claims to investors. Since an advanced financial system and a high level of trust are crucial for credit card financing to be viable, the volume of credit card finance, and hence the enormous payment-transactions convenience afforded to consumers, both decline exponentially as one moves from well-developed financial systems to less-developed financial systems.  

Home equity loans are a convenient way for consumers to borrow against the price appreciation in their homes. For instance: suppose you need $\$50,000$ and your home is worth $\$300,000$ in the market today. You owe the bank $\$200,000$ . Then your home equity is $\$100,000$ $\$300,000$ minus $\$200,000$ ), and you can borrow $\$50,000$ you need against the home equity. Of course, you will have to make additional monthly payments on this new loan once you take the loan.  

Prior to the subprime financial crisis, home equity loans were a significant source of finance for many consumers. The average U.S. homeowner extracted 25–30 cents for every dollar increase in home equity during 2002–2006, and homeequity-based borrowing was equal to $2.8\%$ of GDP every year from 2002 to 2006.8  

Banks and other loans represent a very significant portion of the financing available to individuals. These loans include borrowing from commercial banks, finance companies, credit unions, the federal government, and so on. As of year-end 2010, consumer credit outstanding was $\$2.41$ trillion, having grown at an annual rate of $2.5\%$ in the fourth quarter of 2010. See Table 3.1  

Nonbank loans are provided by a wide array of lenders. Perhaps the biggest nonbank financial intermediary is the U.S. government. From Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to Sally Mae (the Student Loan Marketing Association), the amount of credit provision that involves the U.S. government dwarfs that by any bank.  

We will now turn our attention to business financing. While it is useful to create a clean separation between consumer and business financing for purposes of discussion, in practice, this dividing line is often fuzzy. In particular, many individuals will use their access to consumer financing to raise capital they need to invest in their businesses. For example, it is not uncommon for someone to charge a business purchase to his/her personal credit card, or use a home equity loan to make the investment needed to expand the business.  

# Business Financing: Equity  

Businesses can raise equity financing from a richly diverse set of sources. See Figure 3.4.  

# Internal Equity Financing  

Family and friends represent a very important financing source for start-up businesses. The typical family or friend investor is someone who has been successful in his/her own business and wishes to invest both to help a family member or a friend. For example, a health-care private equity firm was launched some years ago in St. Louis, MO with financial backing by family and friends because no Wall Street firm was willing to invest in a group of individuals who had operating experience in the industry but no private-equity experience. Similarly, Facebook was launched from a Harvard dorm room and eventually expanded with family and friends financing. Typically, family and friends will invest up to $\$100,000$ .  

Employee ownership is yet another way firms can raise equity financing. Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) give employees the opportunity to become shareholders in the company. Employees may experience increased pride and security as shareholders, which, in turn, may make them more productive. Employees can participate via stock purchases, by receiving a portion of their compensation as stock rather than cash, and sometimes by providing personal assets to the business. As of 2014, there are over 7000 ESOPs in place in the United States, covering 13.5 million employees (over $10\%$ of the private-sector workforce). The total assets owned by U.S. ESOPs were estimated at over $\$1$ trillion at the end of 2012.9 Some of the notable majority employee-owned companies are Public Super Markets, and Lifetouch, to name a few.  

Retained earnings represents a vital source of internal equity financing for businesses. A firm typically pays out a portion of profit as a dividend to its shareholders, once all its expenses, debt claims, and taxes are settled. What is then left over after the dividend payment is called retained earnings, and it augments the firm’s equity. Retained earnings may be viewed as a “sacrifice” made by the shareholders in the sense that they forgo some dividends in order to build up the firm’s equity. Companies generally retain $30\mathrm{-}80\%$ of their after-tax profit every year.  

# External Equity Financing  

Angel financing often provides the critical first funds needed by early-stage companies that have yet to establish a track record of revenues or earnings that would enable them to attract institutional financing from venture capital firms or banks. Such financing involves raising equity from individual investors, known as “angels.” These individuals look for companies with high growth prospects, sometimes have some synergies with their own businesses, and operate in an industry that the individuals have successfully worked in or are bullish about. In our earlier example, if bank loan is hard to get, Peter could turn to angel investors (typically investors who, unlike Mary, know him and something about his business) to provide the financing in exchange for an ownership stake in the business. Angel financing, however, is often quite expensive. Capital from angel investors can cost the entrepreneur anywhere from $10\%$ to $50\%$ of the ownership in the business. In addition, many angel investors charge a monthly management fee.  

It is also possible for businesses to raise equity financing from customers, suppliers, and sales representatives  These parties provide financing because they may believe that the business has growth potential that may not be realized without the financial support provided by the equity input, and also that the equity position may become a profitable investment down the road. For example, IBM once invested enough in Intel to own $20\%$ of Intel’s equity. It made this investment to financially bolster Intel, a key supplier whose microprocessors were used in all IBM personal computers.  

Corporate parents are yet another vital source of financing for some institutions. A holding company may provide its subsidiary with capital rather than incur the cost of raising external capital.  

# Intermediated Equity Capital  

Apart from these nonintermediated sources of equity capital, other forms of equity capital involve financial intermediaries that help to link the sources and uses of capital. Private equity, venture capital, and investment banks, are the major players, and have been covered in the previous chapter.  

# BUSINESS FINANCING: DEBT  

# Nonmarket, Intermediated, and Direct Debt  

Businesses raise large amounts of financing each year from debt from a variety of sources (See Figure 3.5). A traditionally important source of debt financing is commercial banks  For example, Avolon, an aircraft leasing group, announced in January 2011 that it had raised a total of $\$2.5$ billion in debt since May 2010, with the latest coming in the form of a $\$465$ million debt raised from a consortium of three leading U.S. banks: Wells Fargo Securities, Citi, and Morgan Stanley. Businesses use banks to obtain various forms of debt financing. This is both short-term, intermediate-term, and long-term debt financing.  

As discussed in the previous chapter, institutional lenders  such as commercial-finance companies (e.g., GE Capital) and insurance companies, have been a major source of long-term debt financing for U.S. businesses. They make loans that may be over 10 years in maturity and thus fill a need at the longer end of the debt maturity spectrum since bank term loans are typically under 10 years in maturity.  

The factoring of accounts receivables is another source of debt finance available to businesses. Every business that sells to customers on credit – the customer purchases the good or service but pays at a later date – generates “accounts receivables” when it makes sales. Similarly, account payable is a source of financing provided by the firm’s suppliers. We will revisit account receivables and account payables in Chapter 5  

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) provides yet another source of debt financing. The SBA offers long-term financing for purchasing fixed assets. Typically, these loans require a personal guarantee from any investor with a stake in the business exceeding $5\%$ .  

Now that we have seen how the entire financial system operates and facilitates economic growth, we will examine in depth the specific economic role that banks play and how they develop the special expertise to play that role and improve economic outcomes.  

# FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING AND THE GOLDSMITH ANECDOTE  

# Fractional Reserve Banking  

Chapter 2 explains what financial intermediaries do. We will now continue this discussion by examining how a rudimentary bank can evolve from a goldsmith, and how this leads to a theory of fractional reserve banking. What emerges too is a theory of bank regulation. According to this theory, regulation is an almost inevitable outgrowth of fractional reserve banking.  

Modern banks produce fiat money on the basis of fractional reserves. These two facts account for much of the romance, mystique, and confusion surrounding finance. Laymen have difficulty understanding that money has value solely because of its universal acceptance as money.10  

The fractional reserve aspect of banking is similarly vexing in that it seemingly involves sleight of hand. Fractional reserve banks fund themselves with liabilities that are convertible into cash on demand, but they hold only a fraction of such liabilities in the form of cash assets. Thus there is always some probability that withdrawals will exceed the available cash.  

The evolution of monetary systems from commodity money – gold, silver, or whatever – to more abstract forms of money parallels the evolution of banking systems from warehouses, or $100\%$ reserve banks, to modern fractional reserve banks. Both follow naturally from a collective desire to use scarce resources efficiently. However, these developments have side effects as well. The substitution of fiat for commodity money concentrates enormous economic power, for good or ill, in the hands of the monetary authority. Likewise, fractional reserve banking places enormous power in the hands of individual bankers, power to jeopardize the stability of the banking system in the pursuit of personal gain.  

In what follows, we shall explain the evolution of fractional reserve banking from its historical roots in warehousing.11 The explanation is stylized and anecdotal, and is meant to stress the natural aspects of the evolutionary process as well as the essential vulnerability of fractional reserve banking systems.  

# The Evolution of the Primitive Goldsmith into a Bank  

Think of a primitive setting in which gold is used as money – means of payment, or medium of exchange. By social convention, all debts are paid with gold and all purchases are made with gold. The system works well enough, but holding and transporting gold can be awkward. There is both a security problem and a convenience problem. The market response is to provide a warehousing service for gold. Hence the emergence of the goldsmith.  

For a fee, the goldsmith provided secure storage facilities for gold. The owner of the gold would receive a warehouse receipt in exchange for her gold, with the understanding that the owner could present the receipt at her convenience to redeem the gold from the goldsmith.12 The goldsmith’s was a simple business. Similar to the furniture warehouse, the goldsmith provided safekeeping service for a fee. Simplicity itself!  

Owners of gold gradually developed confidence in the goldsmith and gold flowed in and out of the goldsmith’s coffers with tedious and profitable regularity. Whenever a gold owner wanted to make a purchase, she would travel to the goldsmith, withdraw the necessary gold, and take it to the market. In the market, the gold would be exchanged for the desired goods and just as routinely, the seller of the goods would return the newly acquired gold to the goldsmith in exchange for a warehouse receipt.  

As these trading and payment practices became more and more pervasive, and as the goldsmith’s reliability became more and more established, repeated trips to the goldsmith were recognized as wasteful. Each time a purchase was desired, the buyer would need to run to the goldsmith for gold, only to have this trip repeated by the seller, who would return the gold from whence it came.  

Ultimately, the warehouse receipt passes from the buyer to the seller, and the only purpose served by the two trips is to test the goldsmith’s integrity. But as the goldsmith’s reputation for integrity grows with time and experience, the need for these trips seems increasingly unnecessary. Gradually, trade is effected with the exchange of warehouse receipts and the gold remains undisturbed in the goldsmith’s vault. But the willingness to accept warehouse receipts in lieu of gold rests on the belief that the gold is available on demand. Any suspicion of the goldsmith will undermine the use of the receipts as means of payment. But so long as the goldsmith can project confidence, there is a saving to be had by avoiding the trips to and from the goldsmith.  

Seen from the vantage point of the goldsmith, the growing use of receipts as means of payment means smaller flows of gold into and out of the coffers. One can imagine a time series of data points that describe the gold holdings of the smithy through time. As the use of receipts gradually replaces gold, the goldsmith’s gold inventory becomes less and less volatile. In the limit, as the receipts totally displace the gold, the goldsmith’s inventory remains practically unchanged through time, unless newly mined gold flows into the system, or other extraordinary occurrences take place. It gradually dawns on the goldsmith that it is not really necessary to have a unit of gold for each outstanding receipt. This idea must have come as a revelation, an epiphany. To be sure, the straitlaced would recoil at the idea of issuing more receipts than one had gold, but if no one ever withdraws the gold, then what possible harm?13 The naughty possibility of printing extra warehouse receipts changed the world. This discovery was the banking equivalent of the Newtonian Revolution, every bit as important to banking as gravity was to physics.  

# Instability of the Fractional Reserve Bank  

The extra receipts could not be distinguished from their more authentic counterparts and they consequently served as means of payment as readily as did the authentic (those whose issue was occasioned by a deposit of gold) receipts. The extra receipts were loaned to borrowers and earned interest. Assume that these loans are illiquid, that is, they cannot be redeemed on demand, but rather must be held to maturity in order to realize their full value. This means that the goldsmith is providing a key liquidity transformation service by issuing liquid claims to depositors that are backed by illiquid loans to merchants. The pedestrian goldsmith was thus transformed from a warehouse clerk into a banker! To see this, consider the following before-and-after balance sheets.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Goldsmith (Before)</td><td colspan="2">Goldsmith (After)</td></tr><tr><td>Gold 100 oz.</td><td>Receipts 100 oz.</td><td>Gold 100 oz. Loan 10 oz.</td><td>Receipts 110 oz.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Notice that after the goldsmith crosses the Rubicon (becomes a banker), his liabilities of 110 ounces exceed his capability to satisfy them in the unlikely event that all receipt owners should seek to convert to gold simultaneously. This potential failure is because loans are illiquid.  

Therefore, inherent in the lending is a potential catastrophe – insolvency of the goldsmith. Of course, if the receipt owners almost never withdraw their gold, the probability of insolvency is small, perhaps very small. However, and this is critical, the risk of ruin is endogenous. That is to say, the goldsmith chooses the probability of insolvency with his choice of how many extra receipts to print, or equivalently, with his choice of how many loans to make. Each extra receipt printed and loaned earns interest and so the temptation to print receipts is limited only by the goldsmith’s concern for remaining solvent. He walks the knife-edge between avarice and anxiety. Each extra receipt increases income, but at the same time increases the probability of insolvency; insolvency, of course, destroys the goldsmith’s reputation and with it his ability to circulate and lend warehouse receipts.  

Thus we see how the discovery of fractional reserve banking was a rite of passage, a loss of innocence. Notice, however, that conditional on the loans being repaid, the goldsmith holds assets equal to the value of his liabilities. Thus what we have here is a liquidity issue. The goldsmith can and will pay off all receipt holders, given adequate time and good loans. Nevertheless, the promise is to pay on demand  and this most assuredly cannot be done in all states of nature.  

This is the essence of fractional reserve banking and its essential vulnerability. Such a system evolves quite naturally given maximizing behavior on the part of rational economic agents.  

# Regulation as a Stabilizing Influence  

Left to its own devices, this kind of banking system is subject to periodic collapse. However, experience with fractional reserve banking eventually led to the discovery of a rather simple and straightforward remedy. Since the Achilles heel of the system is the illiquidity of the loans, bank runs could be averted if these assets could be liquefied. What was needed was a bank for goldsmiths that could lend against the collateral of a goldsmith’s loans during those infrequent occasions of extraordinary redemptions. Indeed, in the nineteenth century this was achieved in the United States through commercial bank clearing houses (CBCHs), which were private arrangements between banks that agreed to put their combined resources (the CBCH) behind each member in times of unanticipated liquidity drains. Of course, such a bankers’ bank would need virtually unlimited capacity, together with a commitment to the continuity of the system. The private arrangements did not possess such unlimited capacity, and this provided the rationale for a central bank to serve as a lender of last resort to the community of bankers. Since the central bank, which was typically government-owned, had the privilege of printing (or otherwise creating) money, the issue of limited capacity evaporated.  

One more point deserves emphasis in connection with the evolution of a fractional reserve banking system with a central-bank-based lender-of-last-resort facility. In the absence of the central bank, there will always be a self-imposed limit on the volume of extra receipts printed. The fear of failure, loss of reputation, and the consequent inability to continue to lend warehouse receipts will discipline the inclination to expand lending indefinitely. Whatever this self-imposed limit, however, the introduction of the central bank acting as a lender of last resort will weaken the goldsmith’s restraint. If the goldsmith knows that he can borrow against his otherwise illiquid loans, he will make more loans than if he could not use the loans as collateral. This is clear and obvious; and it is true even if the central bank charges a very high rate of interest for such emergency borrowings. Note that the interest rate for such loans is infinite in the absence of the central bank. Thus, the central bank introduces a kind of moral hazard, and this moral hazard is typically addressed by imposing cash asset reserve requirements that effectively limit the volume of a bank’s lending on the basis of its cash assets. This is perhaps the most basic of prudential regulation. The point is that regulation is endogenous. It is responsive to a moral hazard arising from the introduction of the central bank as a lender-of-last-resort, which in turn is a response to a vulnerability inherent in fractional reserve banking. In turn, fractional reserve banking is a natural response to the transport costs and security concerns in a laissez-faire world of commodity money.  

# A MODEL OF BANKS AND REGULATION  

That the very nature of banking necessitates regulation can also be seen in the perspective of a model in which money – rather than gold – is used as a medium of exchange. We will now develop in the box below a model that formalizes the anecdotal development of the previous section and also highlights some of the underlying informational assumptions in the analysis. The intuition is very similar to that in the earlier section.

saving in the first period) plus $\$\gamma$ (his income in the second period). Since the depositor is paid $\$6$ for depositing $\$5,$ the interest rate on his deposit is  

$$
\left(s-\phi-s\right)/s=-\phi/s<0
$$  

f a negative interest rate surprises you, remember that our bank cannot make any loans and is providing the depositor a costly service. Assume for now that the bank must keep $100\%$ reserves against deposits and that the depositor will fully withdraw at the end of the first period.  

The desirability of a $100\%$ -reserves bank: Suppose the probability of theft is $p$ and it would cost the depositor $\hat{\phi}>\phi$ to safeguard his wealth to the extent that the probability of theft is eliminated. Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for personal safeguarding to be optimal is that  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{s-\hat{\phi}>(1-p)s}\\ {\mathrm{or}\hat{\phi}<p s}\\ {\mathrm{where}\ 0<p<1.}\end{array}
$$  

We will assume that Equation (3.2) is satisfied. Clearly, since $\phi<\hat{\phi}$ , the depositor will prefer to have the bank safeguard his wealth.  

Note that in stipulating that the bank charges the depositor exactly what it costs the bank to safeguard, we have assumed that there is perfect competition17 between banks that can all safeguard $s$ at $\$\phi$ Suppose now that $n>1,$ so that there are possibly many depositors. It would be natural to assume that there are economies of scale in safeguarding, that is, it should cost less per dollar to safeguard $\$123$ as opposed to safeguarding $\$8$ For example, one armed guard may be able to safeguard $\$100,000$ just as easily as he can safeguard $\$1000$ . Indeed, if we were to assume that the cost of safeguarding $\$123$ is less than $\$123,456$ the case for a large bank would be compelling, and we could even assume that $\hat{\phi}=\phi$ , that is, no single individual is any more skilled than another in protecting wealth. But we will assume that there are no scale economies in safeguarding. In a sense, this makes our task harder, but it helps to reduce notation.

FIGURE 3.6 Sequence of Events.  

Suppose first that all the $n$ depositors will surely withdraw at the end of the first period. In this case, it is easy to see that the interest rate will still be $-\phi/s$ A more interesting and natural case, however, is one in which not all depositors will withdraw at the end of the first period. Suppose a fraction a (where $0<\alpha<1$ ) of depositors will withdraw at $t=1$ (the end of the first period) and the remaining fraction $\boldsymbol{1}-\alpha$ will withdraw at $t=2$ (the end of the second period). For simplicity, we assume that $\alpha$ is known with certainty.18 The sequence of events is described in Figure 3.6  

A bank that borrows and lends: If the bank cannot invest any of the deposits it receives, then funds will lie idly in the bank. Note, though, that there is an opportunity to invest in this case.19 At $t=1$ , the bank only needs to have $\$\alpha n(s-\phi)$ to meet deposit withdrawals. Suppose now that it is possible for the bank to make investments at $t=0$ , but that these investments will pay off only at $t=2$ . Let $r$ be the rate of return to the bank on these investments.20 We can imagine that the investments are loans to merchants who want to finance the setting up of shops, but do not have any funds of their own. Each merchant needs $\$M,$ where $M>s,$ so that if the merchant were to borrow directly from depositors, he would need to approach more than one depositor (in fact, he would need to approach M/s depositors). Further, there is a moral hazard problem in dealing with the merchant in that he has a preference for absconding with the $\$1$ he borrows rather than setting up a shop. If his actions are not monitored, he will abscond and the lender will not be paid back at all. However, at a cost of $\$6$ it is possible to monitor the merchant so that he indeed puts his borrowed funds to the stated use of setting up a shop that will generate some cash flow of $\$123,456$ at $t=2$ . As a start, let us suppose that $\$1$ is a sure cash flow. We will introduce uncertainty shortly.  

First consider the merchant’s problem if he approaches $M/s$ depositors directly. His net expected payoff will be  

$$
K-M\left(1+r\right)-\left(b M/s\right)
$$  

since, in addition to interest, he will be charged for monitoring. Each depositor will have to individually monitor the merchant since none can rely on his cohorts to do so.21 Now, if the merchant approaches a bank, which in turn acquires $\$1$ in deposits from $M/s$ depositors, we will have a different outcome. The bank’s monitoring cost will be $\$6$ If the bank charges the merchant exactly what it costs the bank to monitor, then the expected payoff to the merchant will be  

$$
K-M(1+r)-b.
$$  

Comparing Equations (3.3) and (3.4) we see that the merchant is clearly better off going to the bank.  

Since the merchant pays the bank only at $t=2$ , the bank will have to make sure that it will have enough money at $t=1$ to pay off depositors who withdraw then. Suppose there are $m$ merchants (borrowers) and $n$ depositors. Then, the bank loans out $\${m M}$ and takes in $\$123$ in deposits. Let $n s>m M$ (this will be shown to be necessary in a moment). Since $\${m M}$ are loaned out, the bank does not need to worry about safeguarding that money from outright theft (it just needs to monitor the merchants it lends to). Thus, $\$123,456$ must be safeguarded. The safeguarding cost is $(n s-m M)\phi/s,$ since it costs $\phi/s$ to safeguard $\$1$ .  

Hence, the bank promises to pay depositors  

$$
n s-(n s-m M)\phi/s
$$  

n the aggregate if it does not pass along to the depositors any of its profits from lending to merchants. Since a fraction a of deposits is withdrawn at $t=1$ , those depositors get $\alpha[n s-(n s-m M)\phi/s],$ which you will notice is more (by an amount $(m M\phi/{\mathsf{s}}))$ than what these depositors received previously. That is, the fact that part of the money is being loaned out instead of being kept in the bank’s vault itself economizes on safeguarding costs. Although the loaned money must be monitored, these monitoring costs are paid by borrowers, so that depositors realize a saving in safeguarding costs.  

To ensure that the bank will have sufficient funds to meet deposit withdrawals at $t=1$ , it must choose $m$ to satisfy  

$$
{\mathrm{'}}\left[n s-\left(n s-m M\right)\phi/s\right]=n s-m M-\left(n s-m M\right)-\phi/s-m b.
$$  

To understand Equation (3.6), note that the left-hand side is the amount the bank must pay out to those depositors who withdraw funds at $t=1$ . On the right-hand side, $n s{-}m M$ is the amount of money the bank has left over in reserves after it is through lending to the $m$ merchants. From this it must spend an amount $(n s{-}m M)\phi/s$ to safeguard its reserves and an amount $m b$ to monitor the $m$ merchants.22 Solving Equation (3.6), we get  

$$
m=(1-\alpha)n s(s-\phi)/\left\{M[s-(1-\alpha]+b s\right\}
$$  

Thus, as long as the bank lends to exactly as many borrowers as stipulated in Equation (3.7), there will be no risk of withdrawals exceeding the bank’s available cash reserves at $t=1$ .  

Note now that the bank makes an aggregate net profit of mMr on its lending activities. This is because it is being compensated exactly for its monitoring cost by borrowers, and its safeguarding cost by deposit interest rate, although higher than $-\phi/\varsigma$ (as in the previous case when all deposits were idle), is still negative. This positive profit will attract entry by competing banks, and the resulting competition for depositors’ funds will drive up the deposit interest rate. In a competitive equilibrium, each bank will earn zero profit. This will happen when the bank’s profit of $m M r$ is divided equally among the $n$ depositors, so that each depositor gets  

$$
\frac{n s-[(n s-m M)\phi/s]+m M r}{n s}
$$  

per dollar of deposits. Thus, the deposit interest rate is now  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\frac{n s-[(n s-m M)\phi/s]+m M r}{n s}-1}\\ {\displaystyle=\frac{m M r-[(n s-m M)\phi/s]}{n s}}\end{array}
$$  

f we assume that $r$ is high enough to ensure that the numerator in Equation  3.8) is positive, then the depositors get a positive rate of interest on their deposits.  

We have taken you through a sequence of steps to show how a bank, like the goldsmith in the previous section, can develop from a simple caretaker of other people’s wealth into an institution that borrows and lends money. As you must have noted, informational problems play a key role in bringing our bank to life. Banks solve two types of moral hazard problems in our simple world. First, they help to cope more efficiently with the “social” moral hazard problem of theft. Second, they also help to cope more efficiently with moral hazard in lending, which, as you know from Chapter 1, is a type of agency problem.  

Do We Need to Regulate This Bank?: So far, however, there has been no need for a regulator. But that is simply because we have made numerous strong assumptions. One of them is that it is possible to monitor merchants so efficiently that they will always repay their debts fully if they are monitored. Thus, we know that a bank can repay its depositors. If it were to choose not to do so, we know for sure that the bank is at fault. A court of law with sufficiently stiff penalties on a banker who does not repay would then be sufficient to remedy this. In reality, merchants may sometimes have poor cash flows even if they do their best. That is, suppose that, viewed at $t=0,$ , their cash flow $K$ is a random variable that is 0 with probability $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $K^{*}$ with probability $1-u$ We will assume that setting up a shop is a positive net present value (NPV) exercise for the merchant, so that  

$$
(1-u)K^{*}>M(1+r).
$$  

Suppose that this in itself does not affect the behavior of depositors in terms of their withdrawal policies. But at $t=1$ , depositors may learn something more about the likelihood that merchants may fail. For simplicity, assume for now that merchants have perfectly correlated prospects, so that they all either fail $(K=0)$ ) or succeed $\begin{array}{r}{\langle K=K^{*}\rangle}\end{array}$ . Let us refer to the updated probability of failure that depositors assess at $t=1$ as $u_{1}$ If there is good news, $u_{1}<u$ (the probability of failure they assessed at $t=0$ ) and if there is bad news, $u_{1}>u$ We can think of $\boldsymbol{u}$ as the expected value of $u_{1}$ assessed by depositors at $t=0$ . Suppose $u_{1}$ can take one of two values: $u_{1}=u_{\mathsf{h}}$ for bad news and $u_{1}=u_{1}$ for good news, where $u_{\mathrm{h}}>u_{\mathrm{l}}$ Suppose that those depositors who intended to withdraw at $t=2$ will in fact change their minds and withdraw at $t=1$ if they get bad news23  that is, if $u_{1}=u_{\mathsf{h}}$ If they get good news, they will withdraw at $t=2$ .  

The bank now faces a problem. If depositors get bad news, all depositors withdraw at $t=1$ . The bank will have insufficient funds to meet withdrawals (unless it keeps $100\%$ reserves and does not lend to any merchants). Suppose that in this case the bank is empowered to call back all of its loans prematurely and this forces merchants to liquidate their businesses prematurely. Let $\boldsymbol{L}$ be the liquidation value of the merchant’s shop at $t=1$ (which, for simplicity, is independent of the information received by depositors at $t=1$ ). Assume $\iota$ is a very small number (much smaller than $K^{*}$ ). So, if all depositors wish to withdraw funds at $t=1$ , and if the bank proceeds to lend exactly the same amount at $t=0$ as it did in the previous case, then there will only be $\S\alpha[n s-(n s-m M)\phi/s]+m L$ to pay depositors. Moreover, the premature liquidation of merchants’ shops will be socially inefficient if $\boldsymbol{L}$ is so small that $L<(1-u_{\mathrm{h}})K^{*}$ . This is similar to the illiquidity problem of the goldsmith.  

There is no way that the bank can prevent this unless it keeps all of its deposit funds idle, in which case it does not matter when depositors withdraw. However, this would not be fractional reserve banking; it would hardly be a bank as we know it. This is where a government regulator can help. Suppose it agrees to insure all deposits for the full promised payment by each bank. Then we see that those depositors who originally planned to withdraw at $t=2$ have no reason to change their minds since the value of $u_{1}$ is now irrelevant to them; the deposit insurer has made their claims risk free! That is, this form of regulation makes banking viable when it otherwise could not have been.  

This seems to be a wonderful solution and it definitely has its merits. But lest we get carried away with its virtues, let us pause and complicate things a bit more. Since banks are competitive and earn zero profits, they may wish to underspend on either safeguarding or on monitoring borrowers. Once the terms of their loan and deposit contracts are set, they could profit from spending less on safeguarding and monitoring than originally promised. This is key to the moral hazard created by introducing deposit insurance; we will discuss this in Chapters 15 and 16  In the absence of deposit insurance, depositors would not be willing to bring their money to the bank (and keep it themselves) unless they find a way to monitor the bank. Suppose that each depositor could spend a small amount of money, say $\$1$ to make sure that the bank expends the promised resources on safeguarding and monitoring. We can show, given appropriate assumptions $\$6$ being small enough), that depositors will find it in their own best interest to do so.  

Summary: Thus, one way to prevent bank runs and instability is for the government to provide deposit insurance, which is an alternative to the lender-of-last-resort (discount window) facility provided by the regulator (Central bank) in our earlier goldsmith example. But there is a fly in this ointment. When there is deposit insurance, why should any depositor care about whether the bank safeguards and monitors with the requisite vigilance? Each depositor’s payoff is guaranteed and independent of the bank’s actions. Hence, none will find it personally profitable to spend anything on watching over the bank to ensure that the bank expends the promised resources in safeguarding and monitoring the merchants it lends to. In other words, deposit insurance weakens or even destroys the private market discipline imposed on banks. The burden of keeping the bank in check shifts now from the market to the regulator. To achieve its objective, the regulator will have to come up with ways to dissuade the bank from exploiting the deposit insurance umbrella. In other words, the moral hazard engendered by one form of regulation, namely deposit insurance, creates the need for other forms of regulation (such as capital requirements, portfolio restrictions, and so on).  

We have now completed the story we set out to tell in this section. Regulation is not just the outcome of some political agenda. It arises quite naturally from the very forces that give rise to banks. Once regulation arises to instill public confidence in banking and make banks viable entities, it creates its own moral hazards that necessitate further regulation.  

# THE MACROECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING: THE FIXED COEFFICIENT MODEL  

In this section, we examine the implications of fractional reserve banking for monetary policy. The discussion developed here formalizes some of the macroeconomic implications of the goldsmith anecdote presented earlier.  

# The Fixed Coefficient Model  

The FCM is the standard textbook description of the banking firm and industry; it emphasizes the asset-transformation function of financial intermediaries. The bank’s effort to maximize its profit is captured only implicitly. Consider a bank’s balance sheet  

Bank Balance Sheet   


<html><body><table><tr><td>R</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>M</td><td>D E</td></tr></table></body></html>  

where $R$ is the reserves of the bank comprised of deposits held at the central bank, $M$ is the bank’s earning assets (loans to merchants), $D$ is the bank’s deposit liability (think of this as $n\times s$ in the context of the model in the previous section), and $E$ is the bank’s equity. We can now write the balance sheet identity for the bank as:  

$$
R+M=D+E.
$$  

Moreover,  

$$
R=r D,{\mathrm{with~}}0<r\leq1.
$$  

Equation (3.11) represents the fact that banks hold cash or liquid asset reserves proportional to deposits in order to insure against deposit withdrawals and/or to satisfy legal reserve requirements. The fixed coefficient, $r_{\mathrm{.}}$ can be interpreted either as a legal reserve requirement or a voluntary behavioral parameter (i.e., reserves that the bank chooses to voluntarily hold). Actually, it should be interpreted as the greater of the two. In any case, the parameter relates to liquidity or withdrawal risk. That is, it is the bank’s safeguard against a fraction ( $\dot{a}$ in the context of the model in the previous section) of deposits being unexpectedly withdrawn. Next, we have  

$$
E=e L,{\mathrm{with~}}0<e\leq1.
$$  

Equation (3.12) represents the fact that banks hold capital reserves in some fixed proportion, $e$ to loans in order to protect against insolvency or default risk. The parameter $e$ can be interpreted as a regulatory capital requirement and/or a voluntary behavioral parameter, or, more accurately, the greater of the two.  

# An Illustration of the FCM  

Let us now consider the FCM in a (competitive) banking industry with zero equity $(e=0)$ ) where banks have only two assets (reserves held in the form of deposits at the Federal Reserve and loans to the public) and one liability (customer deposits). We shall further assume a $20\%$ effective legal reserve requirement ${\mathit{r}}=0.2{\mathit{\Omega}}_{}$ ). The assumption that $e=0$ is an extreme representation of the assumption that the capital requirement is not binding.  

Now suppose Bank A receives a $\$1000$ deposit.  

# Bank A  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Required reserves 200 1000 deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Excess reserves 800</td></tr><tr><td>Total reserves 1000</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Since it has excess reserves of $\$800$ and since it earns nothing on either its required reserves or excess reserves, the bank seeks to eliminate its excess reserves by making a loan of $\$800$ :  

# Bank A  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Total reserves 1000 1000 deposits Loan 800</td></tr><tr><td>800 deposit</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The funds loaned by Bank A, although possibly initially deposited with Bank A, are soon withdrawn and deposited in another bank, say Bank B. This leaves Bank A with  

# Bank A  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Required reserves = total reserves 200 1000 deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Loans800</td></tr></table></body></html>  

But Bank B has  

Bank B   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Required reserves 160 800 deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Excess reserves 640</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

and Bank B now lends away its excess reserves, so that:  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">BankC</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Required reserves 128</td><td>640 deposits</td></tr><tr><td>Excess reserves 512</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

The $\$640$ loaned by Bank B is now deposited in Bank C. The process continues ad infinitum. At the Federal Reserve the initial deposit would be a credit of $\$1000$ to Bank A.  

Federal Reserve  

<html><body><table><tr><td>1000 deposit A</td></tr></table></body></html>  

What is the offsetting asset (liability) entry? When the $\$800$ is withdrawn from A and deposited in B, the Federal Reserve would show  

Federal Reserve  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>200A</td></tr><tr><td>800B</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

Notice that the original reserve creation (the $\$1000$ deposit received by Bank A) spurred deposit expansion, and the deposit expansion redistributes the reserves across the banking system. However, the deposit expansion does not affect the level of reserves in the banking system. In fact, deposit expansion absorbs reserves. What this illustration of the FCM shows is that the bank’s incentive to hold reserves – either voluntarily to protect against unanticipated deposit withdrawals or to satisfy a regulatory reserve requirement necessitated by the moral hazard created by the lender-of-last-resort facility – results in less lending than would be possible without reserve requirements. Moreover, it also affects the redistribution of liquidity throughout the entire banking system. This has macroeconomic implications that we explore below.  

# The FCM and Monetary Policy  

The FCM helps us to understand the basic elements of how monetary policy works. There are three major tools of monetary policy: (i) open market operations, (ii) reserve requirement changes, and (iii) discount rate changes. These three tools are used in varying degrees to influence the stock of money and interest rates.  

Open market operations are sales and purchases of government securities (Treasuries) by a special committee of the Federal Reserve. These sales and purchases affect the amount of reserves available to banks and thus, as indicated in previous subsections, the amount of lending. To see this, suppose the Fed buys $\$1000$ in Treasury securities from the nonbank public. Then the nonbank public’s balance sheet will be  

# Public  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Bonds - $1000 Deposits of cash in Bank A + $1000</td><td>Liabilities unchanged</td></tr><tr><td>and Bank A's balance sheet will be BankA</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Required reserves 200 Excess reserves 800</td><td>1000 deposits</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The $\$800$ is now available to Bank A for lending. This means that the initial open market operation of purchasing Treasuries leads to an increase in lending by banks. Another way to view this is that the government has reduced public debt (by buying back government securities) and facilitated an increase in private credit. The open market operation of selling government securities has the opposite effect.  

It is obvious that a change in reserve requirements will also affect bank lending. Any increase in reserve requirements will reduce the amount of deposits available for lending, and any reduction in reserve requirements will increase the amount of deposits available for lending. Thus, when the Federal Reserve desires to implement a contractionary monetary policy (to cool down inflation, for example), it can raise reserve requirements; similarly, it can lower reserve requirements when it wishes to stimulate the economy.  

Finally, the discount rate, which is the rate charged by the Fed to member banks for short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve, also affects monetary expansion/contraction. By raising the discount rate, the Fed makes it more costly for banks to borrow and build up reserves, and therefore effectively reduces the reserves available to banks. This reduces lending. Likewise, a lowering of the discount rate facilitates increased lending.  

This analysis is predicated on the “classical” assumption that the binding constraint on bank lending is the reserve requirements. If the capital requirements $e$ [recall Equation (3.12)] were binding instead, the effects of monetary policy can be very different indeed, as we will see in Chapter 10  

# LARGE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  

The theories from which we borrowed some of the ideas in the previous section suggest that financial intermediaries should be of sufficient size. These arguments are based on diversification. Similar intuition applies to nondepository financial intermediaries as well. In this section, we develop this argument. We focus on the basic intuition; the mathematics can be found in Appendix 3.1  It leads to a rationale for nondepository financial intermediaries like investment banks, Standard & Poor’s Value Line, credit rating agencies, financial newspapers, Moody’s check guarantee services, portfolio managers, econometric modelers, consultants, and accounting firms.  

What the theoretical research has shown is that FIs are optimally infinitely large regardless of whether they are brokers or asset transformers. That is, an FI is a “natural monopoly.” This argument, which we develop below, is based on the assumption that there are no incentive or coordination problems within intermediaries. Therefore, it should be interpreted cautiously. In real-world intermediaries, there are intrafirm incentive problems that increase with the size of the intermediary. These diseconomies will dominate the diversification benefits beyond a certain size.24  

Brokerage as a natural monopoly: Consider a broker that specializes as an information producer. One problem that the broker’s customers must be concerned about is that of information reliability. This is a key issue in information production. How do these customers know that the information the broker provides is accurate and reliable? One possible way to determine this is for customers to noisily assess the reliability of the information provided by the broker, and compensating the broker more when information is judged to be more reliable. This can be done either via reputational mechanisms – attaching higher reputation for reliability to a broker whose past information has turned out to be higher quality – or by comparing the broker’s information to that available from other sources.  

Now, if we are dealing with a single information producer, it can be quite costly to ensure that he will use reliable information, even if we can have a noisy assessment of this reliability. This becomes a little less costly if we are dealing with a producer who is a member of a team of information producers because then, by producing reliable information, each producer benefits not only himself (by making it more likely that he will obtain higher compensation) but also the team, and a share of the team’s benefits accrues to each individual producer. This is an effective mechanism as long as the team members can monitor each other to ensure that nobody gets a “free ride.” As the size of the team grows, more and more independent payoffs of individual producers are being pooled together before being divided equally among the team members, so that the resulting diversification reduces the risk in each member’s compensation. The risk-averse information producers are thus made better off and they demand less compensation on an expected value basis to produce information. This makes the buyers of information better off. And the benefit keeps growing as the broker gets larger. That is, brokerage is a natural monopoly.  

Another economic benefit from growing large comes from information reusability, which was discussed in Chapter 2 When information is cross-sectionally reusable, the larger the number of information producers in the intermediary, the greater is the benefit of information reusability. The reason is that information can be reused by a greater number of information producers within the intermediary, and yet the cost of acquiring information needs to be incurred only once.  

A strong implication of this analysis is that investment banks, financial newsletters, credit-rating agencies, and other information producers can benefit from growing large. A caveat is that individual members can continue to monitor (and trust) each other as the organization grows large. If not, “free rider” problems will crop up, and it may not be beneficial to grow beyond a certain size because of the difficulty of implementing effective internal controls.  

Asset transformation as a natural monopoly: Now consider an asset transformer like a bank. It borrows money from depositors and makes loans. Its advantage in being large comes from two sources.25 First, suppose multiple depositors are needed to finance a single bank borrower and the borrower’s creditworthiness has to be established through costly credit analysis. Then having a bank perform this credit analysis once conserves screening resources compared to a situation in which all the depositors engage in costly screening of the borrower. That is, a bank eliminates duplicated screening. Second, the depositors’ payoff is a debt contract, it is a concave function of the bank’s payoff as shown on the next page.  

Because the depositors’ payoff is concave, they behave as if they are risk averse. Hence, they can be made better off by reducing the risk they face, and the benefit of this is a lower interest rate on deposits. The bank can do this by diversifying its risk across many different borrowers. And, because the benefit of diversification keeps growing with size, the bank is a natural monopoly.

# HOW BANKS CAN HELP TO MAKE NONBANK FINANCIAL CONTRACTING MORE EFFICIENT  

We have spent quite some time examining the flow of services that banks and other FIs produce. These services essentially take the form of intermediating in different ways between the users and providers of capital and of reducing their costs of exchanging capital. It has been suggested that banks not only permit the capital that flows through them to be exchanged at lower cost, but they also lower the cost of capital exchange between other parties.26  

To understand this argument, let us examine the role of bank loans in a borrowing organization’s information process. It is worthwhile to draw a distinction between inside and outside debt. Inside debt is defined as a contract in which the creditor has access to information about the borrower not otherwise publicly available. The creditor may even participate in the borrower’s decision process. This could be achieved, for example, by the creditor having representation on the borrower’s board of directors. Bank loans are inside debt. By contrast, outside debt is defined as publicly traded debt in which the creditor depends on information about the borrower that is publicly available. Commercial paper and publicly traded corporate bonds are examples of outside debt.  

Bank loans offer a special advantage in this regard. They are usually of short maturities. This means they must be periodically renewed. These renewals are accompanied by bank evaluation of the borrower’s ability to meet fixed payment obligations. Thus, if the bank renews a borrower’s loan, it sends a positive signal about the firm to its other creditors. Note that credibility of this signal derives from the fact that the bank “puts its money where its mouth is” when it renews the loan. Given this credible and positive signal, other higher-priority creditors find it unnecessary to expend their own resources to duplicate the bank’s evaluation. Thus, bank loans help to reduce duplication in borrower evaluation by multiple creditors.27  

Banks may also have a cost advantage in making loans to depositors. The ongoing history of a borrower as a depositor communicates valuable information to the bank about the borrower’s cash-management activities. This permits the bank to assess the risks of loans to depositors and to monitor these loans at lower cost than other (competing) lenders. This consideration is particularly important in short-term loans that are rolled over because of the relatively more frequent borrower assessments. This hypothesis has empirical validity in the observation that most short-term debt is in the form of bank loans.  

# THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE: BANKS ARE SPECIAL  

It turns out that there is some interesting empirical support for the theories we have presented so far. The central question of empirical interest to us is whether bank loans are unique, that is, do they provide any special service with their lending activity that is not available from other lenders? To answer this question we can examine the stock price responses to announcements of bank loans and other types of debt such as private placements of debt and public debt issues. The empirical evidence is that there is a positive and statistically significant stock price response to a borrower’s acquisition of a bank loan. Further, the positive market reaction is not common to all private debt placements. There is, for example, a negative stock price response to debt placed privately with insurance companies. These findings seem to suggest that bank loans are unique.28  

To examine these results let us first look at Table 3.3  which gives the distribution of announcements of different types of debt contracts for NYSE and AMEX firms.  

Although there is no noticeable pattern in bank loans through time, there are two interesting observations. First, privately placed debt has been declining through time. Second, among all privately placed debt (bank loans plus other privately placed debt), bank loans dominate to the tune of $68.38\%$ .  

In Table 3.4 we provide descriptive statistics for different types of debt.

As this table shows, firms using private placements and bank loans are on average smaller than firms using public offerings of debt. The average firm size in both the bank loan sample and the private placement sample is about $25\%$ of the average firm size in the public debt sample. This evidence is consistent with the theory discussed so far. Problems of moral hazard and particularly of asymmetric information can be expected to be more severe for smaller, lesser-known firms. Hence, banks have a greater relative contribution to make in resolving these problems in such firms. Not surprisingly then, we find that bank loans are the dominant source of debt financing for small firms.  

Let us now see how the stock prices of borrowing firms react to the announcements of various forms of debt. This evidence is presented in Table 3.5  

The abnormal stock return here is defined in the usual fashion as the deviation of the realized rate of return from the expected rate of return given by the market model. That is, the abnormal stock return for $\mathrm{firm}j$ over day $t$ is defined as  

$$
R_{j t}-(\hat{\alpha}_{j}+\hat{\beta}_{j}R_{m t})
$$  

where $R_{j t}$ is the rate of return of security $j$ over day $t.$ $R_{m t}$ is the rate of return on the market portfolio over the same period, and $\hat{\alpha}_{\mathrm{j}}$ and $\hat{\beta}_{\mathrm{j}}$ are the ordinary least squares estimates of the market model parameters for $\mathrm{firm}j$  

The average abnormal stock return for bank loan agreements in Table 3.4 is positive and statistically significant at the 0.01 level. In addition, two-thirds of the abnormal stock returns are positive. The negative average abnormal stock return associated with the announcement of a public offering of debt is not statistically significant.  

If the positive response to bank loan agreements results from some benefit of inside debt not unique to banks, then one would expect to observe a similar response to debt that is privately placed with insurance companies. However, as Table 3.4 indicates, the response to the announcement of privately placed debt is $-0.91\%$ , which is statistically significant at the 0.10 level. Moreover, the difference between the average abnormal stock returns of bank loan agreements and privately placed debt is statistically significant at the 0.01 level.  

It is possible that the differences in abnormal stock returns across different types of debt agreements could be due to systematic differences in maturity and purpose of borrowing, that is, the data may not indicate anything special about bank loans per se. To check this possibility, we would like to know the share price responses to the announcements of bank loans, private placements, and public debt offerings, all with the same characteristics. The evidence on this score suggests that differences in abnormal performance across these different sources of borrowing are not solely due to differences in the characteristics of the loan or differences in the characteristics of borrowers (such as size, for example). That is, the results are robust. The overall conclusion to be reached from this empirical evidence is that banks are special.  

# OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF DEPOSITORY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  

Depository institutions have two types of ownership forms: stocks and mutuals. Agency theory predicts that ownership form has a significant effect on the incentives and the operating efficiency of the firm. In this section, we will review the theoretical bases for this prediction and also look at some empirical evidence.  

Commercial banks are exclusively stockholder-owned. Mutuals are common among insurance firms, MSBs (mutual saving banks), and S&Ls (savings and loan associations), although many mutual S&Ls have converted into stockholderowned organizations in recent years. We will proceed as follows. First, we will examine how mutuality affects the resolution of agency and other problems. Then, we will seek an explanation for why S&Ls were dominantly mutuals and what explains the recent wave of conversions to stock ownership. Finally, we will review some relevant empirical evidence. Most of our comments apply to the United States, but we will – in concluding – also focus on Europe where mutuals (actually cooperative banks) play an important role and represent a very large segment of the financial intermediation sector.  

# Mutual Versus Stocks  

The residual claimants in a mutual are customers. These are the policyholders of mutual life insurance companies, the depositors of MSBs, and the depositors of mutual S&Ls. For purposes of this discussion, we will limit ourselves to mutual S&Ls.  

There are two key differences between a stock and mutual S&Ls. First, the owners of a stock S&L are its stockholders, whereas the owners of a mutual S&L are its depositors (and possibly its borrowers). Second, a stock S&L can increase its capital by selling common stock, whereas a mutual S&L cannot.  

Consider the first difference. In a stock S&L, shareholders have a well-defined ownership right, which implies: (i) a claim to residual profits, (ii) a right to vote for the board of directors and change control of the organization, and (iii) a right to dissolve the organization. On the other hand, in a mutual S&L, the ownership rights of depositors are much weaker. As for (i), depositors in a mutual are much more like creditors than shareholders since they cannot force the mutual to pay them more than the promised interest and principal on their claims. Although in principle depositors have ownership claims to the mutual’s current earnings, these claims are not transferable, and the earnings can be retained indefinitely by the institution as net worth. As for (ii), while mutual S&L depositors have voting rights, these are quite limited and are often signed over to management at the time of opening of accounts.29 Finally, as for (iii), even though a depositor can withdraw his deposits and thereby partially liquidate the mutual fund, depositors have had little incentive to do so because of deposit insurance, especially when interest rate ceilings bounded the return to depositors.  

Thus, it is imperative to distinguish between de jure and de facto ownerships in a mutual. The de jure ownership (legal ownership) rests with the mutual’s customers. It is, however, largely vacuous. The de facto ownership [control of (i), (ii), and (iii)] rests with the managers and the government (which provides deposit insurance).  

Of course, the inability of owners to completely control the institution – and the resulting agency problem – is encountered in stockholder-owned institutions as well. Both stock and mutual S&Ls are administered by managers whose goals may differ from the goals of the owners. However, the two types of S&Ls differ with regard to the ability of the owners to monitor managers. Stockholders have greater control over the activities of managers because control can be consolidated through the purchase of stock.30  

# Choice of Ownership Structure by S&Ls  

Earlier studies viewed mutual S&Ls as either cooperatives, with depositors and borrowers working for a common goal, or benevolent associations organized to encourage saving and home ownership.31 This view was based partly on the observation that the first S&Ls were mutuals that served smaller depositors, leaving the larger ones to commercial banks and other institutions.32 These early community-based cooperatives, which gathered deposits from the community and offered mortgages to community members, had simple operations. The fair degree of homogeneity in mortgages made it relatively easy to assess the value of the S&L’s assets based on historical data. This was just as well since the absence of a secondary market for residual claims meant that existing and prospective owners could not rely on the information generated by capital market trading (and pricing) to assess the value of the mutuals’ assets. Whereas the simplicity of the operation of S&Ls made mutuality an acceptable ownership structure, the elimination of the classic conflict between creditors (who prefer less risk) and stockholders (who prefer more) made mutuality the preferred structure for many S&Ls.33 Moreover, the simplicity of the operation of S&Ls meant that managerial expertise was not a critical element in the success of S&Ls. In the early years, therefore, the S&L industry was dominated by mutuals run by managers who were not the most talented or efficient.  

Over time, however, operation became more complex, and mutuals began to choose managers on the basis of expertise. Moreover, the advent of deposit insurance eliminated the agency-cost-of-debt advantage of mutuals over stocks. Since their deposits are insured, depositors are indifferent to an S&L’s risk-taking behavior. The agency cost of debt was essentially absorbed by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).  

Along with these developments came deregulation and an increase in competition. Mutual S&L managers have found it increasingly difficult to compete with their more efficient stockholder-owned counterparts. And their inability to augment institutional net worth through additional equity issues has made the competitive disadvantage worse. Thus, the benefits of mutuality to owners have diminished significantly. Furthermore, these increased competitive pressures mean that the probability of bankruptcy – and hence the probability of unemployment for the manager – due to inefficient behavior has increased. This means that any given level of perquisite consumption on the part of mutual managers is now more costly. Given that managers were optimally selecting their perquisites prior to deregulation, the implication is that perquisites consumption in mutuals must be lower after deregulation, as managers weigh the benefit of perks against the elevated probability of unemployment. Thus, the benefits of mutuality to managers have diminished as well. Combined with this is the positive incentive managers have to convert to stock ownership, since they usually benefit in the initial stock sale. The reason is that managers typically receive rights to purchase the new stock, which is usually underpriced (as in other initial public offerings). When the benefits of conversion outweigh the benefits of the new optimal (and lower) level of perquisites consumption, one would expect the S&L to convert from mutual to stock. This could explain the increased number of conversions that have been witnessed in recent years,34 as the stockholder-ownership structure has become the preferred mode for both owners and managers.  

# Observations on Mutuals (Cooperative Banks) in Europe  

In several European countries (e.g., France, The Netherlands, and Germany), cooperative banks play an important role, and are often part of the largest segment of the financial services industry. They often are “layered” cooperatives consisting of multiple local (member) cooperatives that “own” the central cooperative (e.g. RABO Bank in The Netherlands, and Credit Agricole in France; the latter even has a third layer). The central cooperative may include professional services, a common treasury operation, and back-office facilities that facilitate economies of scale. Such a model may provide strong roots in local markets (via the local cooperatives), facilitating relationship banking, and simultaneously allow for scale and a matching of funding across the cooperatives.  

The efficiency of such cooperatives depends very much on the culture and professionalism of the organization. Some have been highly successful and have via internal benchmarking and common practices outperformed shareholder owned banks. But this is what we would expect. Ultimately, the performance of an institution depends on many factors; ownership structure is only one of them. As stated earlier, cooperatives/mutuals might have a control vacuum that invites inefficiencies, but some may have found ways to overcome this. Recent work shows that cooperatives in some European countries have been more resilient than the banking sector in general.35  

# THE BORROWER’S CHOICE OF FINANCE SOURCE  

We have seen that a borrower has access to a wide array of credit sources. How does he decide which source to approach? In Figure 3.7 below, we have sketched a hierarchy of financing sources that explains the borrower’s choice based on his own attributes and the resulting demand for intermediation services.36 The borrower’s financing choice in this figure tracks a typical firm’s “lifecycle.”  

When a firm is very young, it has two striking characteristics. First, the entrepreneur in charge may be unsure of his own management expertise, so that approaching a financial intermediary that can provide this expertise is beneficial. Second, the borrower has few tangible assets to offer as collateral. As we will see in Chapter 7  collateral is useful in controlling moral hazard whereby borrowers either stint on effort or take excessive risks. In the absence of collateral, the lender could use equity participation as a way of addressing moral hazard. Thus, it is in the borrower’s interest to seek a lender who can take an equity position and thus be able to offer capital at a “reasonable” price. Both factors suggest that such firms should go to venture capitalists.  

![](images/aed173cf3b741e80f7249b8ee3d9fbdab4d3b999020458ed42a74b28faf91494.jpg)  
FIGURE 3.7 Hierarchy of Financing Sources.  

As a firm grows and acquires tangible assets, it becomes capable of offering collateral to mitigate moral hazard. Banks, which are prohibited in the United States from taking equity positions, can now lend to such borrowers because they can offer collateral to secure their debt. Of course, all moral hazard will not be eliminated by collateral, so that there will be an important role for bank monitoring. Moreover, bank loans tend to be of short maturities, thereby generating periodic information through reassessments of the borrower. This information is reflected both in the bank’s decision to renew/terminate the loan as well as in the new contract terms offered, in combination with information produced by rating agencies. This helps to reduce duplication in information production by other creditors of the firm, thereby diminishing overall contracting costs. The firms in this group find it better to go to banks than to venture capitalists because banks can fund their loans with insured deposits, whereas venture capitalists cannot; hence, the borrower is able to obtain a loan at a lower price.  

Finally, when the firm is well-established and mature, it has a good track record for repaying its debts. This reputation can be valuable because it permits the firm to borrow at preferential rates. By taking undue asset risks, the borrower stands to lose this reputation, and thus has an incentive to limit risk-taking. Consequently, bank monitoring to combat moral hazard is less important for such borrowers, and this permits them to directly access the capital market where borrowing costs are lower; capital market access would mean that the borrower would not have to pay the bank its intermediation rents. Of course, such firms still confront problems of asymmetric information,37 so that nondepository financial intermediaries such as investment banks (or credit-rating agencies) play an important role in the transfer of capital from investors to such firms. This is because they make information about firms available to investors at a lower cost than they could acquire themselves. It is interesting to note that as one moves from left to right in the financing hierarchy shown in Figure 3.7  the intermediation services provided decline and so does the cost of credit. The venture capitalist provides financing, monitoring, and management expertise; the bank provides financing and monitoring; and the capital market provides mainly financing. Of course, this discussion is not meant to suggest that these financing sources are mutually exclusive. For example, borrowers often access the capital market for commercial paper and use banks to provide loan commitments to back up these commercial paper issues.  

# The Role of Capital in Bank Financing  

While banks are specialists in monitoring borrowers, two facts should be recognized. First, monitoring is costly, so banks need to be incented to do the monitoring. Second, there are limits to the effectiveness of bank monitoring, so there should be innate incentives for borrowers to make prudent decisions. This way, not all of the burden for ensuring such behavior falls on bank monitoring.  

For the bank to have sufficiently strong incentives to monitor borrowers, it should have enough capital.38 This is easy to see. The benefit of bank monitoring is that it increases the likelihood of the borrower repaying the loan, that is, it reduces the probability of default. Given that monitoring is costly, this benefit needs to be large enough to overcome the monitoring cost. Since borrower default creates a loan loss that is absorbed by the bank’s equity capital, the higher this capital the larger is the potential loss the bank’s shareholders absorb when loans default. Thus, the benefit of avoiding loan default is greater when the bank has more capital. In other words, the benefit of loan monitoring is greater when the bank has more capital. In Chapter 13  we further elaborate on a bank’s choice of capital structure.  

Similarly, borrowers too have stronger incentives to make value-maximizing decisions when they have more equity capital. To see this, suppose the borrower can choose one of three mutually exclusive projects: a good project (G) that maximizes the firm’s value and a bad project $(\mathbf{B}_{1})$ that has a present value of future cash flows that is less than the required investment (so it is a negative-NPV project) but produces some private benefits, $b$ for the borrower, and another bad project $(\mathbf{B}_{2})$ that also has negative NPV but produces even bigger private benefits, $\mathbf{B}>\mathbf{b}$ , for the borrower. One can think of these private benefits as either unobservable diversions of resources from the project that the borrower could make for private gain at the bank’s expense, or simply the benefit of having to work less hard to manage the project.  

Now suppose bank monitoring can eliminate borrower’s ability to choose project $\mathbf{B}_{2}$ but not $\mathbf{B}_{1}$ and that $b>0$ is large enough that the borrower would prefer $\mathbf{B}_{1}$ to $\mathbf{G}$ if the project was entirely financed with a bank loan and the borrower had no equity at stake. Then, it can be seen that if the borrower were required to invest sufficient equity in the project, it would prefer G over $\mathbf{B}_{1}$ Anticipating this, the bank will not lend to the borrower unless the borrower puts up enough equity.  

This theory has a number of important implications. One is that if borrowers do not have enough equity capital, they may be rationed. Having enough pledgeable assets to post as collateral will ameliorate this problem, so one should think of rationing as something that arises as a consequence of a combined shortage of collateral and capital. A second implication is that banks too will lend less when they have less capital. This is because insufficiently capitalized banks will not do costly monitoring, so lending will be limited to borrowers who do not need monitoring. Third, having enough capital in banks also enhances the borrower’s ability to obtain financing from other sources, as other financiers can be assured that the bank’s monitoring will result in the borrower making the right investment decisions. Fourth, when borrowers have so much capital that they would prefer G to either $\mathbf{B}_{1}$ or $\mathbf{B}_{2}$ even if there is no monitoring, then bank lending diminishes in importance as borrowers can directly access the capital market or other nonmonitored sources of finance. That is, bank lending is maximized at intermediate levels of firm (borrower) capital.  

# Blurring Distinctions between Bank Loans and Capital Market Financing: Transaction and Relationship Loans  

Although in our earlier discussion, we have characterized capital market and bank financing as distinct but sometimes overlapping choices, in recent years the distinction between these two sources of financing has become increasingly blurred. For example, banks made syndicated loans in which multiple banks participate, and these loans are often traded in a manner similar to capital market trading. Banks make mortgage and credit card loans and then package them into portfolios, issue securities against these portfolios, and sell these securities in the capital market where they are traded. This is called securitization and will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 11  

Of course, banks also make loans where they add considerable unique value and the loans are not traded. Examples are small business loans where the bank–borrower relationship has value.  

Research in banking has examined the difference between loans by classifying bank loans as transaction loans and relationship loans.39 Transaction loans include loans like credit card and mortgage loans. There is little monitoring by the bank and the loans can be repackaged and traded. The bank’s value added is limited mostly to its credit analysis and standardized credit analysis before credit is extended.  

Relationship loans are those where the bank generates additional value by learning about the borrower through its relationship with the borrower and providing business advice. Relationship loans offer numerous other advantages related to attenuating moral hazard and private information problems. These will be discussed in Chapter 8  

Another aspect of relationship lending that has only recently begun to be explored is that it creates the potential for differences of opinion. For example, a bank may judge a relationship loan to be creditworthy, but its judgment may be based on a lot of “soft,” nonverifiable information that is prone to multiple interpretations and disagreement. Such loans cannot readily be financed in the capital markets if investors have a different (collective) opinion about the creditworthiness of the loan. In such cases, a bank – backed by sufficient capital – can act as a “beliefs bridge” between depositors/ investors and borrowers and raise deposit financing to fund the relationship loan. The bank’s reputation/credibility is reliably processing soft information and this may convince depositors to extend funding they otherwise may not have. This would be another contribution of banks to relationship loans.40 That is, the bank becomes a more stable source of funding for entrepreneurs when these entrepreneurs cannot raise market financing from investors due to disagreement or behavioral biases.  

Thus, bank loans span a continuum from relationship loans at one end to transaction loans at the other. Relationship loans are the most different from capital market financing. Transaction loans are the most similar to capital market financing.  

# Shadow Banking  

So far we have discussed the activities of banks and other depository institutions. But the recent subprime crisis in the United States originated in what has been called “the shadow banking system.” This is the part of the financial system where short-term funding is carried out with arrangements other than deposits.41 The shadow banking system includes institutions such as investment banks, brokerage houses, and finance companies. A lot of the collateral securing the short-term borrowing in the shadow banking system is created by securitization structures like asset-backed securities and asset-backed commercial paper. There are various investors in the market, including money market mutual funds.  

A commonly used mechanism for short-term funding in the shadow banking system is the repurchase agreement (or repo). A repo is essentially a collateralized deposit. The way it works is that the borrower gives a security as collateral to the lender and borrows some amount that is a fraction $x$ of the value of the security, with $(1-x)\%$ being called the “haircut” on the repo. There is an interest rate paid on the borrowing and the collateral is returned to the borrower when the (short-term) loan is repaid. We will cover this in more detail in Chapter 8  

# CONCLUSION  

The process of financial intermediation is of central importance to the functioning of a modern economy. Some of the important conclusions to be drawn from our discussions are covered briefly below.  

First, the financial system has many components that interact to foster economic growth – banks are a crucial component. Second, regulation of banks and the raison d’etre for the existence of banks are intertwined. Regulation is not solely the outcome of a political agenda that is separate from the reasons why banks exist. To make banking a viable business in which there is public confidence, some form of regulation is necessary. We also discussed how this regulation then becomes a component of monetary policy. Third, the incentive problems that banks and nondepository financial intermediaries resolve are such that there are natural benefits to size. Diversification can reduce incentive costs in contracting among unequally informed agents, and information reusability is greater in larger intermediaries. Hence, financial intermediaries can derive economic benefits from being large. Fourth, inside (privately placed) debt has some inherent advantages over outside (publicly traded) debt because of superior access to information about the borrower that the former provides. Bank loans are inside debt. However, even within the class of contracts qualifying as inside debt, bank loans are special. The reaction of a borrowing firm’s stock price to the announcement of a bank loan agreement is more favorable on average than the stock price reaction to the announcements of other forms of inside debt. Fifth, the choice of organizational form – mutual versus stock – by a depository institution depends on the interaction between a variety of factors that include differences in the efficiency with which agency problems are resolved within mutuals as opposed to shareholder-owned institutions, the competitive environment, and the relative advantage a stockholder-owned firm has in raising capital and having complex assets priced in the capital market. This explains the initial prevalence of mutuality among thrifts and the recent trend of conversions of mutuals into stock.  

Finally, there is a natural hierarchy of financing sources. In its earliest phases of development, a firm has the greatest advantage in seeking venture capital, due to the (unique) ability of the venture capitalist to assist in management. At the next stage, when early survival has been accomplished, bank loans are preferred. Although banks do not assist in management to the extent that venture capitalists do, the monitoring provided by banks is of value to firms at this stage when they are still relatively small or medium-sized. Bank monitoring helps to control incentive problems within the borrowing firm. Moreover, bank loans tend to be of short maturities, thereby generating periodic information through reassessments of the borrower. This information, as well as that produced by nondepository financial intermediaries such as credit-rating agencies, helps to reduce duplication in information production by other creditors of the firm, and thus reduces overall contracting costs. Moreover, large firms go directly to the capital market for outside debt. Bank monitoring is of lesser marginal value to such firms. However, such firms still confront problems of asymmetric information,42 so that nondepository financial intermediaries such as investment banks (or credit-rating agencies) play an important role in the transfer of capital from investors to such firms. This is because they make information about firms available to investors at lower cost than they could acquire themselves.43  

What are the implications of our analysis for market efficiency? Clearly, if the capital market were strong-form efficient even without financial intermediaries, the role for financial intermediaries would be extremely limited; they would at best provide some minor transactional services like “lot-breaking” of securities, that is, buying large denomination securities and selling smaller denomination claims against such securities to investors with wealth constraints. However, the theoretical and empirical results discussed in this chapter suggest two conclusions. First, given the pervasive problems of private information and moral hazard, it is reasonable to expect that credit markets are no more than semistrong form efficient, so that financial intermediaries have an important role to play in resolving information-based problems. Second, the informational efficiency of credit markets is enhanced by financial intermediaries, since they possess privileged financial information that is then learned by others who observe bank–borrower transactions.

# APPENDIX 3.1 THE FORMAL ANALYSIS OF LARGE INTERMEDIARIES  

The Model Based on Ramakrishnan and Thakor (1984): Suppose we have assets whose owners wish to attract capital. However, there is asymmetric information about the values of these assets; the owner of each asset knows more about the value than others do. As we saw in Chapter 1  this can lead to market failure if the appropriate signals are unavailable to firms. Now suppose there are some individuals who specialize in producing information about firms at a cost. Let us imagine that there are groups of individuals, with each group specializing in producing information about a particular industry or a particular firm. The cost to an individual of producing this information is $c>0$ and each individual is risk averse, with a utility function of $U(\bullet)$ defined over monetary wealth, that is $U(\bullet)$ is increasing and strictly concave. We assume that c is a nonmonetary cost to the information producer (i.p.); it does not figure in his utility over wealth. Moreover, it is incurred only if the i.p. actually produces information about the firm he specializes in. Also, each i.p. has a minimum level of expected utility, a $\boldsymbol{\bar{U}}$ that must be guaranteed by his compensation package for producing information, or he will work in an alternative occupation.  

Now suppose that the firm that wishes to attract capital (or the investor who wants to decide whether he should invest in a   
particular asset) approaches an i.p. directly to produce information about it and release it to the market, that is, the i.p. plays   
the role of a rating agency. If the i.p. is just paid a fixed fee, we have a moral hazard problem in that he will avoid actually pro  
ducing information, thereby saving himself the effort-related cost c. He will simply make a quick guess, collect his fee, and   
send the firm on its way. Investors will recognize this and the firm’s price will not move. The firm will have wasted its money. Compensation Contracts of Individual Information Producers: But suppose the firm is able to monitor the i.p. to discover   
something about whether he actually invested $c$ This monitoring produces a signal that tells the firm about the i.p.’s effort.   
However, this signal is noisy. Even if the i.p. invests $c$ in information production, the signal says that he did only with prob  
ability $p$ With probability $1{-}p$ the signal is erroneous and indicates that the i.p. did not produce information. If the i.p. did not  

produce information, then the signal says that he did with probability $q$ and that he did not with probability 1–q  We assume that $p>q$ so that the signal is informative. Now let the i.p.’s compensation be as follows: pay him $\$4$ if the signal says he produced information and $\$4$ if it says he did not, with $H>L.^{44}$ If the i.p. does produce information, he gets an expected utility of  

$$
E U({\mathrm{produce~information}})=p U(H)+(1-p)U(L)-c.
$$  

If he does not produce information, he gets an expected utility of  

$$
E U({\mathrm{does~not~produce~information}})=q U(H)+(1-q)U(L). 
$$  

If investors are to believe that the i.p. is credible, his compensation schedule should be incentive compatible (should induce the i.p. to invest $c$ ). That is,  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{p U(H)+(1-p)U(L)-c\geq q U(H)+(1-q)U(L).}\end{array}
$$  

It also will be necessary to make sure that the i.p. is willing to work for the firm. This requires that  

$$
p U(H)+(1-p)U(L)-c\geq\overline{{U}}
$$  

We can solve Equations (3.15) and (3.16) to come up with $H$ and $L$ We can show that in equilibrium Equations (3.15) and (3.16) should hold as equalities, that is, treating them as equalities leads to a solution that minimizes the expected cost for each firm. To illustrate, suppose $U(x)={\sqrt{x}}$ for any number $x$ $\overline{{U}}=20$ (for simplicity), $p=0.8$ , $q=0.2$ , and $c=10$ . Solving Equations (3.15) and (3.16) as a pair of simultaneous equations with these numbers, we get $H=10{,}000/9$ and $L$ $=10,000/36$ . The i.p. earns an expected utility of exactly 20. The expected cost of information production for each firm is $0.8\:H+0.2L=944.44\$ approximately.  

The solution with an intermediary: Now suppose that there are two i.p.s, each like the i.p. in the preceding analysis, which coalesce and form a financial intermediary of two i.p.s. Each still deals with a separate firm. However, they now pool their payoffs to avail of diversification benefits. We assume that because the i.p.s are cooperating, they can costlessly observe each other’s actions. This means neither i.p. has to be concerned about his partner free-riding off his effort. So now each i.p.’s compensation becomes  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{2H/2=H\mathrm{if~both~signals~are~favorable}}\\ {(H+L)/2\mathrm{if~only~one~signal~is~favorable}}\\ {2L/2=L\mathrm{if~both~signals~are~unfavorable}}\end{array}
$$  

Assuming that signals across firms are uncorrelated, the probabilities of different compensations for each i.p. are given in Table 3.6  

Note that both i.p.s will act in concert. The firms that give them compensation contracts realize that the rules of the game have changed. They must now solve the following pair of simultaneous equations.  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{p^{2}U(H)+2p(1-p)U\biggl(\displaystyle\frac{H+L}{2}\biggr)+(1-p)^{2}U(L)-c}}\\ {{=q^{2}U(H)+2q(1-q)U\biggl(\displaystyle\frac{H+L}{2}\biggr)+(1-q)^{2}U(L)}}\end{array}
$$  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">TABLE 3.6 Probabilities of compensations</td></tr><tr><td>Probability of Compensation</td><td>Compensation of Each i.p.</td></tr><tr><td>p² if both i.p.s produce information and q2 if both do not</td><td>H</td></tr><tr><td>2p(1-p) if both i.p.s produce information and 2q(1-q) if both do not</td><td>(H + L)/2</td></tr><tr><td>(1-p)2 if both i.p.s produce information and (1-q)2 if both do not</td><td>L</td></tr></table></body></html>  

and  

$$
p^{2}U(H)+2p(1-p)U\left(\frac{H+L}{2}\right)+(1-p)^{2}U(L)-c=\bar{U}
$$  

Generally, the solution to this will be different from the previous solution. Suppose, however, that firms continue to use the old contracts where $H=10.000/9$ and $L=10.000/36$ . It can be checked in this case that Equation (3.17) is satisfied exactly and that the left-hand side of Equation (3.18) is about 20.43. That is, each i.p. in the financial intermediary enjoys a higher expected utility than he did before. Note that the expected cost of having information produced for each firm will be exactly the same as before. Thus, the formation of a financial intermediary makes i.p.s better off if firms do not alter their contracts. Of course, firms may wish to write different contracts to remove the excess utility enjoyed by the i.p.s. In this case, expected information production costs of firms are lowered.  

The reason why the formation of an intermediary helps is diversification. By pooling their payoffs, the i.p.s are able to reduce individual risks. This means that they can increase their expected utility and if at least some of the benefit of this increased utility is shared with the firms they are screening, the cost of information production will also decline.  

The Desirability of a Very Large Intermediary: This argument can be taken to the limit. Suppose the financial intermediary becomes infinitely large. Then, by the law of large numbers (roughly speaking) the probabilities become actual fractions. That is, if all i.p.s produce information, the intermediary knows that exactly $80\%$ of them will get $H$ each and $20\%$ will get Leach. Thus, the intermediary knows that its payoff will be  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{0.8H+0.2L}\\ {=0.8\left(\displaystyle\frac{40000}{36}\right)+0.2\left(\displaystyle\frac{10000}{36}\right)=944.44}\end{array}
$$  

per i.p. with probability one. Since the financial intermediary itself can monitor its own members, it does not have to worry about moral hazard. Thus, it can promise each of its member i.p.s a fixed payment of 944.44, knowing that even though on any given i.p., it could receive either more or less than this amount, the random fluctuations around 944.44 will cancel out for the intermediary as a whole. Thus, each individual i.p.’s expected utility in this intermediary is $U(944.44)-10=20.73$ , which is higher than with the two-i.p. intermediary passes along this gain to the firms it screens, then information production costs are lowest with a very large intermediary.  

That is, we have shown that a diversified information broker can lower the cost of information production and hence the cost of exchanging capital. Once again, the pivotal function served by a financial intermediary is that of providing a more efficient resolution of informational problems.  

Diversification in this model is achieved by letting each i.p. within the intermediary share the risk in the compensation of every other member i.p. That is, as we add to the size of the group, each individual compensation risk is shared by an increasing number of i.p.s. Due to the risk aversion of the member i.p.s, such diversification helps to improve welfare.45 We shall call this “diversification by sharing risks.” Another type of diversification is “diversification by adding risks.”46 In this case, a single i.p. bears $100\%$ of $N$ independent risks, with diversification occurring as $N$ increases. This is quite different from the first form of diversification because the total wealth of the i.p. is growing as he adds more risks. That is, instead of spreading a given amount of wealth over a larger number of independent gambles, we are spreading an increasing amount of wealth over a larger number of independent gambles. Noble laureate Paul Samuelson (1963) has called such diversification “the fallacy of large numbers,” because it is not generally true that, for all risk-averse utility functions, the individual’s risk aversion toward the Nth independent gamble is a decreasing function of $N_{\astrosun}$ In other words, while a risk-averse individual would wish to take advantage of the low number of large numbers to spread a fixed amount of wealth over an increasingly large number of independent gambles, he would not necessarily wish to achieve such diversification at the expense of exposing an increasing amount of his wealth to the gambles. However, there are sufficient conditions involving restrictions on utility functions that such diversification is beneficial.  

# APPENDIX 3.2 DEFINITIONS  

The Law of Large Numbers: Roughly speaking, a principle that says that if we have an infinitely large number of random variables in a sample, all of which are drawn from the same probability distribution, then the average realized value of the random variables in the sample will equal the statistical mean of the probability distribution from which they are drawn. Thus, if an individual divides his finite wealth equally across an infinitely large number of investments whose random payoffs are independent of each other, but are drawn from the same probability distribution, this individual’s payoff from his investments will become (almost) certain and equal to the statistical mean of the probability distribution from which investment payoffs are drawn. A risk-averse individual would prefer to do this because it eliminates risk.  

Event Study Methodology: A statistical approach commonly used in finance to evaluate the price impact of an event. The idea is to start with the assumption that the return on a stock can be described by the market model. Then, the next step is to estimate the values of alpha and beta by regressing the return on the stock against the return on the market for a sufficiently long time period prior to the event date and outside a two- or three-day time window around the event date. Given these estimated values, one can compute the average value of the residuals during the time window around the event date. If no new information was conveyed by the event, the average value of the residuals should be zero. If it is positive (negative), the event is interpreted as conveying good (bad) news.
