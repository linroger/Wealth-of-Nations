# The Nature and Variety of Financial Intermediation  

“Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone?”  

Joni Mitchell  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Euro: Common currency adopted by many member countries of the European Union.  

Yield curve: Relationship between yield to maturity and maturity on debt instruments identical in all respects except maturities (see Chapter 4). Duration: A measure of how long an investor must wait to receive payment on a bond. For bonds that repay only principal (zero coupon bonds), duration equals maturity. For coupon-paying bonds, duration is always shorter than maturity.  

Spot rate: The current yield to maturity on a bond of a given maturity.  

Liquidity premium: The amount by which the yield on a bond must be grossed up to compensate investors for their inability to convert the bond into cash at a moment’s notice and without loss relative to the bond’s true value.  

Consumer loans: Loans made to individuals and families. These are primarily installment loans.  

Commercial loans: Loans made to corporations. Often referred to as Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loan  

Contingent claims: Claims that may be made in the future, contingent on the realizations of some states.  

Federal funds: Funds in the interbank loan market. When a bank “sells” federal funds, it is lending (usually on an overnight basis) to another bank an amount that covers a part or all of that bank’s shortfall in reserves; banks are required to keep a certain fraction of their deposits as liquid reserves.  

rplus: Proceeds from the sale of equity and securities in excess of their par value, plus retained earnings.  

Cash and due: Coin and currency in the bank’s vaults, reserves on deposit with the Federal Reserve and with other banks, and checks deposited by customers on which funds have not yet been collected from the paying bank.  

Allowance for loan losses: An allowance made to absorb anticipated (expected) future loan losses. An allowance for loan losses is a charg against current income and it increases the bank’s loan loss reserve. Writeoffs of existing loans reduce the bank’s loan loss reserve.  

Undivided profits and reserves: Part of the bank’s net worth.  

Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act: The 1999 act that dismantled the Glass–Steagall Act restrictions separating commercial and investment banking.  

# INTRODUCTION  

This chapter focuses on the variety of services provided by financial intermediaries (FIs). Banks are members of an expansive industry that provides a dazzling variety of financial services. The broader financial services industry includes institutions as different as commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, all of which finance their assets with deposits, and government agencies, credit-rating agencies, pension funds, loan sharks, pawnbrokers, lotteries, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and private-equity pools. To this list we could add organized exchanges for trading stocks, futures, options, bonds and commodities, parimutuel betting institutions, credit-rating agencies, and the list can be extended almost effortlessly. Broadly speaking, these institutions can be classified into two groups: depository financial institutions and nondepository financial institutions. The former include institutions that finance themselves largely with deposits, whereas the latter fund themselves in the capital market. A subset of these nondepository institutions have come to be known as the “shadow banking system.”  

What all these financial institutions have in common is the processing of risk and its subtle complement, information. FIs produce information for two kinds of applications: (i) to match transactors like a marriage broker would, and (ii) to manage risks and transform the nature of claims as when a bank produces credit information to control a borrower’s credit risk. In producing information for application (i), the intermediary acts as a broker, whereas in producing information for application (ii), it acts as a qualitative asset transformer.  

Our plan in the rest of this chapter is as follows. First we define FIs and discuss brokerage and asset-transformation services. We also provide a list of the different types of services that intermediaries provide in each of these two basic groups. Next, we provide some key statistics about FIs. Then we discuss the main types of depository intermediaries: commercial banks, thrifts (savings and loan associations (S&Ls) and mutual savings banks (MSBs)), and credit unions. The next section discusses nondepository FIs: venture capitalists, private-equity firms, finance companies, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, and investment banks. We cover the role of the government next and then turn to “peripheral” FIs, including pawnbrokers and loan sharks.  

# WHAT ARE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES?  

Definition: As the name suggests, FIs are entities that intermediate between providers and users of financial capital. FIs are typically multifaceted, and their activities therefore can be understood from a variety of vantage points. For example, in contrast to nonfinancial firms, FIs hold relatively large quantities of financial claims as assets. Thus, whereas the manufacturing firm holds inventories, machines, and patents as assets, the FI holds contracts of the indebtedness of their clients as assets. Both finance their assets by selling their own debt and equity; there is no compelling distinction between FIs and others on the right-hand side of the balance sheet, except that FIs tend to be more leveraged. Here we have a balance sheet perspective on the uniqueness of financial intermediation. Whereas both FIs and other types of business finance assets with debt and equity, FIs tend to hold financial claims as assets whereas others are more committed to physical assets. In Appendix 2.1  we provide a further discussion of the balance sheets of FIs.  

Why Do We Have FIs?: This is tantamount to asking: What do FIs do that could not be done without them? The answer to this for any firm, financial or nonfinancial, is found in the flow of goods and/or services produced by the firm. After all, a firm not only selects its assets and liabilities but also manages them so as to assure the realization of the potential cash flows. That is, the (nonhuman) assets appearing on the balance sheet are combined with various kinds of labor inputs to produce the cash flows conventionally attributed to the assets. The manufacturer reshapes, transforms, and transports various raw materials and semifinished goods into more highly refined and more advantageously located goods. The services of machines and processes recorded on the balance sheet are combined with labor services to produce an inventory of more highly refined goods.  

What is the analog for the FI? How does it combine its resources to produce financial services? A facile answer is that FIs borrow on the one hand and lend on the other. But this answer is incomplete because it does not explain why we need FIs to bring borrowers and lenders together. That is, if I wanted to borrow some money, why do I simply not put an ad in the newspaper and invite people to lend to me at interest rates that I could negotiate with them? While this may seem to some like a foolish thing to do, the key is to understand why it is not (normally) done, rather than to dismiss it outright. After all, is it that different from a homeowner putting up his house “for sale by owner,” rather than through a real-estate agent? Why is the selling of a house different from the selling of one’s indebtedness (borrowing money)? Even in countries where there is no (explicit) deposit insurance, people deposit money in banks, which in turn lend this money to people like you and me. So, why are not those depositors willing to transact directly with prospective borrowers?  

The key to understanding this issue is that we live in a world of imperfect information. People would rather deposit their money in a bank than lend it directly to a stranger because they feel they “know” the bank better. It is this line of reasoning that we wish to explore further, with emphasis on the information-based financial services produced by an FI. In borrowing and lending, the FI is joining unfamiliar, but well-suited and complementary transactors, much like the marriage broker would. The FI is also allocating credit presumably to its highest and best uses while reconfiguring the attributes of the financial claims held by its clienteles.1 These activities are so fundamental to financial intermediation that they are accorded special labels, the former being referred to as “brokerage” whereas the latter is called “qualitative asset transformation” (QAT). Let us explain each in turn.  

The Brokerage Function of FIs: Brokerage activities of FIs involve the bringing together of transactors in financial claims with complementary needs. The broker is usually compensated with a fee for performing this service. The broker’s stockin-trade is information, and its special edge in performing this service derives from special skills in interpreting subtle (i.e., not readily observable) signals, and also from the reusability of information. That is, a broker has two advantages as an information processor. First, it possesses/develops special skills in interpreting subtle (not readily observable) signals. Second, it takes advantage of cross-sectional (across customers) and intertemporal (through time) information reusability. For example, a real-estate broker typically has better information than the average home buyer or seller about supply and demand conditions in a given market and is able to reuse this information on many transactions.  

For the broker, the matching of buyers and sellers does not involve the broker as a principal in the purchase (sale). Thus the used-car dealership typically goes beyond the broker’s role in that it will purchase used autos for resale. If it merely identified potential buyers (sellers) for counterparties, it would then be a broker. Likewise, the marriage broker fits our description of a broker, but the typical stockbroker does not. Once a broker serves as a principal and buys (sells) the asset for eventual resale (repurchase), it accepts the risk that the market may reprice the asset, and it therefore transcends the more limited role of the matchmaker.  

The broker helps resolve informational problems that exist before the two sides to the transaction enter into a contract, that is, the broker helps resolve precontract informational asymmetry. Moreover, the broker also helps resolve informational problems that may arise after the contract is entered into, that is, the broker helps resolve postcontract informational asymmetry.  

Precontract Informational Asymmetry and Brokerage: Precontract information asymmetry involves two kinds of information problems: adverse selection and duplicated screening. We will discuss each in turn.  

Adverse Selection and Brokerage: In transactions involving FIs, adverse selection problems abound. For example, a borrower will wish to overstate his credit worthiness to potential lenders in order to make himself look like a low-credit-risk borrower. And if the lender raises the loan interest rate in order to be compensated for the higher credit risk associated with borrowers, who misrepresent their creditworthiness, the borrowers most likely to drop out are the low-credit-risk borrowers who may either have better credit alternatives or be simply unwilling to borrow at the higher interest rate. Consequently, the lender is left with only the high-credit-risk borrowers.  

An FI such as a bank can help deal with this adverse selection problem by performing the brokerage function of credit analysis to sort out borrowers of different credit risks. That is, in this case, the broker specializes in credit analysis or develops the skills to process/interpret various types of credit information. This allows it to intermediate between borrowers and lenders and minimize adverse selection problems.  

Duplicated Screening, Information Reusability, and Brokerage: Duplicated screening refers to situations in which individuals can resolve adverse selection at a cost, but there is wasteful expenditure of costly screening resources because multiple individuals end up doing the same screening. An FI can help avoid such duplication by exploiting the power of information reusability. This can be illustrated through the example given below.  

Consider 100 men and 100 women searching for the “perfect” marriage partner. In order to become fully informed, each woman will need to evaluate each of the $100\ \mathrm{men}$ , and likewise for each of the men. Now suppose that each such evaluation (sampling) results in a fixed cost of say, $\$25$ . Then the total cost for all participants to become fully informed would be $\$500,000$ (i.e., $2(100\times100\times25)$ ). Or, if we let $x$ represent the size of the side of a square grid (100 people in this example), and $c$ the fixed sampling cost per unit ( $\$25$ in this example), we have the result that the total cost equals $2c x^{2}$  

Now enter the broker! To establish a level playing field and suppress consideration of the broker’s special skills, we assume the evaluation cost per unit remains unchanged at $\$25$ . However, the broker will need to examine each of the participants only once and hence its total cost of becoming informed is $2c x$ or $\$5000$ . Assuming the information is distributed at negligible cost, the saving due to the introduction of the broker is approximated by  

$$
S=2c x(x-1),
$$  

or $\$495,000$ in the example. To be sure, the broker will expect to earn a profit, but this cost is redistributive rather than dissipative (resource consuming), and potential competition can be expected to limit the profit in any case. Thus, the saving associated with having a broker increases exponentially (the square) with the size of the grid, and linearly with the sampling cost per unit. At the margin $\mathrm{{d}}S/\mathrm{{d}}x=2c[2x-1]\mathrm{{,}}$ ), the saving increases as the size of the grid expands.  

The savings, due to the broker, derive from a peculiarity of information: its use does not result in its consumption. Most goods and services are transformed into waste as a result of being used. This is not true with information, and this idiosyncrasy is the key to understanding the broker’s role. If the marriage broker composes a report on a particular candidate, I can use the information without in any way compromising your ability to use the same information. The same is true for a report written by a security analyst, or for a telephone book. This extraordinary reusability of information is what makes it compelling to have a broker, and the larger the grid, the greater the potential saving associated with reusing information.  

In this discussion, we did not assign the broker any special advantage or skill relative to the lay person in information evaluation. If such a relative advantage exists, then let $C_{\mathrm{b}}=$ broker’s evaluation cost and $C_{\mathrm{o}}=$ others’ evaluation cost, with $C_{\mathrm{o}}>C_{\mathrm{b}}$ Then the saving due to the broker is $S=2x[C_{\mathrm{o}}x-C_{\mathrm{b}}]$ , with $C_{\mathrm{o}}>C_{\mathrm{b}}$ and the saving attendant to using the broker grows with the gap, $C_{\mathrm{o}}-C_{\mathrm{b}}$ That is, higher information processing skill accentuates the broker’s relative advantage.  

Some Further Thoughts on the Power of Information Reusability and the Value of Brokerage: To cement our understanding of the power of information reusability, consider one more example. Think of a very large geographic grid in which each intersection represents a potential oil well. Now suppose there are many oil-drilling entrepreneurs, and further suppose that after drilling a dry hole the law requires that the landscape be restored to its initial condition. Thus, there is no way to know if a particular location has been drilled unless there is an operating well at a particular location. If a broker simply collects and disseminates information about the drilling activities of each explorer, the cost of redrilling dry holes can be eliminated. Without the broker, society will bear the unnecessary cost of searching for oil in locations known to be unproductive. This aspect of information is called cross-sectional reusability; the same information can be utilized across a number of different users. Information reusability also has an intertemporal aspect; it can be reused through time. For example, a bank that learns something about a borrower while processing its first loan application can use at least some of that information in processing future credit requests from the same borrower.  

A second aspect of brokerage relates to the observability of objects of search. When the object of search is trivially observable, as in the case of a person’s telephone number or the address of a dry hole, the skills of the broker are of little importance. But let us be a little more precise in explaining what we mean by “trivially observable.” Think of the problem of retaining an expert to assist you in the purchase of thoroughbred horses. Suppose that you are particularly interested in three traits of candidate horses – their racing records, conformation, and blood lines. Now imagine there are numerous experts available and suppose we ask each to report on the three traits of a sample horse. We then create a frequency distribution for each trait. What would we expect to observe among these frequency distributions? Because the racing records are welldefined and a matter of public record, deviations around the mean should be negligible. Observers will not dispute how many times a particular race horse has come in first, second, and so on, no more than they would dispute its age, weight, or height.  

However, breeding and conformation are a very different kettle of fish. With regard to these attributes, we would expect each agent to report a different description of the subject horse. Since the ideal against which conformation is judged is multidimensional and somewhat loosely defined, each observer’s characterization will be distinctive and the consequent frequency distribution will have considerable variance. Likewise for bloodlines. The facts relating to forebears may be indisputable, but the value of particular forebears is judgmental; the choice among observers thus becomes important.  

It is the subtlety, vagueness, or cost of observing the objects of search that elevates the importance of broker skills. To the extent that the objects of search are trivially observable, we should wish to employ less astute observers. If all observers produce the same description, clearly we should reserve the most astute brokers for those searches where judgments matter.  

The observability issue helps us to understand the striking hierarchy of brokers in society, ranging from phone books at one extreme to marriage brokers and investment bankers at the other. Indeed, investment bankers and marriage brokers have a good deal in common in that they both address the pairing of transactors on the basis of subtle attributes. If the investment banker were limited to pro forma financial statements and projecting cash flows, its role and compensation would both be diminished. But presumably the investment banker addresses more complicated issues of compatibility based on corporate cultures, strategic intent, succession, operating synergies, and similar nuances. Even the placing of securities requires a knowledge of buyers and sellers and how they view counterparties as well as the many details of securities’ attributes, such as sinking fund provisions, collateral, and stochastic duration considerations. This explains why the reputation of the investment banker is critically important, whereas the publisher of the Yellow Pages is virtually anonymous.  

To summarize, for a given attribute, the larger the grid, the more compelling the need for the broker. For a given size grid, the less readily observable the object of search, the more important the skills and reputation of the broker.  

An important aspect of brokerage is that it can be performed without processing substantial risk. Information can be purchased for resale without exposing the broker in the way QAT does. To be sure, if the broker produces information before it is sold, demand uncertainty can result in losses. But information can be presold, at least in principle. The broker also exposes its reputation whenever falsifiable representations are made in connection with its sale of information. But the risk is material only to the extent that objects of search are observable with difficulty. In principle then, brokerage services can be produced risklessly, and in any case the processing of risk is not central to the production of brokerage services. This is not the case with QAT.  

Postcontract Informational Asymmetry and Brokerage: In many transactions, one party to the transaction can take actions during the course of the contractual interaction that damage the interest of the other party. The reason why such behavior is possible is that these actions are “hidden” from the injured party and cannot be directly controlled or prevented. Such informational asymmetry is associated with moral hazard, discussed in Chapter 1  

Moral hazard is quite prevalent. It is encountered in insurance, where the insured may underinvest in costly efforts to prevent adverse outcomes because the insurer absorbs the resulting loss. It is encountered in banking, where borrowers may choose excessively risky projects because the bank bears a disproportionate share of the downside risk.  

The FI’s special skills in monitoring attenuate moral hazard. For example, banks monitor their borrowers by periodically examining the borrower’s business and its financial condition and intervening in operating strategy when necessary. Insurance companies design insurance contracts and use ex post pricing adjustments to deter moral hazard. Venture capitalists use the threat of transfer of control to ensure that the entrepreneur’s incentives do not stray too far from investors’ desires. Thus, moral hazard provides a powerful source of economic value for the FI to emerge as a broker that can help diminish the losses due to moral hazard.

FIGURE 2.1 Key Information Problems Addressed by FIs.  

Figure 2.1 summarizes the different informational problems that create a role for the broker.  

Qualitative Asset Transformation: Think of a world without intermediaries, as we did at the beginning of this discussion about the role of intermediaries. Suppose some individual wishes to borrow for the purpose of purchasing a house. The borrower must find a counterparty willing to hold a mortgage, which is a claim with a number of less desirable attributes. For example, there is no active secondary market in individual mortgages, with resultant illiquidity, and wide bid-ask spreads. The mortgage typically comes in large and irregular unit sizes. It typically has a long and uncertain duration, which is to say it may remain unredeemed for 30 years, but it can be repaid at virtually any time at the borrower’s discretion and typically without prepayment penalty. Moreover, the mortgage carries with it default risk, and in the event of default, managing the collateral can be expensive. In all, the mortgage is a homely claim.  

Enter the FI. It purchases the mortgage and finances the purchase with the issuance of a liability called a deposit. The deposit, in contrast to the mortgage, is almost infinitely divisible, highly liquid, and has little default risk. The FI effectively swaps deposits for mortgages, thereby modifying the claims held by its clientele. The FI is rewarded for this service with interest rate spread between deposits and mortgages.  

Among the asset attributes most commonly transformed by FIs are duration (or term-to-maturity), divisibility (or unit size), liquidity, credit risk, and sometimes numeraire (currency identity). Typically, the intermediary will shorten the duration of the claims of its clients by holding assets of longer duration than its own liabilities; it will reduce the unit size of the claims of its clients by holding assets of larger unit size than its liabilities; it will enhance the liquidity of the claims of its clients by holding assets that are more illiquid than its liabilities; and it will reduce credit risk by holding assets that are more likely to default than its liabilities. By holding assets denominated in a currency other than its liabilities, it alters the numeraire of the assets of its clients.  

QAT and Risk: Notice that every such asset transformation performed by the FI requires a mismatch with regard to that attribute on the FI’s balance sheet. For example, if the duration of the FI’s assets and liabilities are perfectly matched, it cannot have altered the duration of the assets of its clients. Only by absorbing the longer duration assets in exchange for shorter term liabilities can the FI reduce the duration of claims held by its customers. This is important because the mismatch on the FI’s balance sheet reflects an acceptance of some type of risk, at least initially, by the FI.  

If the FI holds Euro-denominated assets and US dollar-denominated liabilities, it will be exposed to variations in the dollar/Euro exchange rate. If it holds long-term assets financed with short-term liabilities, it will be exposed to interest rate risk, whereby changes in the shape and position of the yield curve will affect the FI’s cash flows. Even changing the unit size of claims cannot be done without a mismatch and a consequent acceptance of risk. If the unit size of assets is larger than that of liabilities, the purchase and sale of corresponding claims cannot be perfectly synchronized and hence the FI accepts a form of inventory risk.  

The case of duration transformation is particularly instructive. The yield curve is thought to be a “biased predictor’ of future spot interest rates owing to a (liquidity) premium attached to long-duration claims. That is, borrowers typically prefer to borrow long term and lenders typically prefer to lend short term. This theory of the term structure of interest rates is usually associated with Sir John Hicks, a British Nobel Laureate economist. But if we introduce FIs into such a world and assume that they are indifferent to the duration of a claim, they would be able to finance the purchase of long-term assets with short-term liabilities and profit from doing so. Indeed, absent other impediments, intermediaries would continue to perform this transformation until the liquidity premium is bid down to the marginal cost of intermediating. The existence of this form of asset transformation supports the Hicksian view of the yield curve. Without a liquidity premium at the outset, there would be no incentive for the FI to perform duration transformation. If the yield curve was an unbiased predictor of future spot interest rates, there would be no profit in performing duration transformation.  

Whatever the form of the QAT, a mismatched balance sheet is implied, and this in turn implies the acceptance of some form of exposure. This is the sense in which risk is integral to QAT. In managing this risk, there are basically three alternatives available to the FI. It can diversify the risk, it can shift the risk to others, or it can passively accept the exposure. The shifting of risk to others involves the use of claims such as swaps, forward contracts, futures, and options, and in principle, but rarely in practice, all of the exposure associated with the QAT can be transferred to others with the appropriate riskshifting instruments. However, in this case the QAT reverts to brokerage. The FI has merely transferred risk among its clients, no matter how convoluted the transactions. In the case where the risk is diversifiable, presumably the FI performs this diversification on behalf of clients whose wealth is too small relative to the unit size of claims to diversify on their own. It is widely believed that this is a major rationale for mutual funds.  

Although we distinguish between brokerage and asset transformation as distinct types of intermediation services, the truth is that both are performed by the same intermediaries and sometimes in combination. Take for example a duration-transforming FI that finds it is too mismatched for comfort and consequently proceeds to lengthen the duration of liabilities while simultaneously shortening the duration of its assets. In fact, it is changing the mix of its activities from more to less QAT and from less to more brokerage. In the limit, if the FI achieves a perfect duration match of its assets and liabilities, it will have become a pure broker.  

Or consider an investment banker with two types of underwriting contracts, the “firm commitment” contract and the “best efforts” contract. The form involves the banker purchasing a firm’s securities for resale. This is clearly a QAT contract. The banker provides the issuing firm with a prix fixé before the public has committed to purchase the securities. By contrast, the best efforts contract merely commits the bankers to make an honest effort to sell the securities for the best realizable price, without any further assurances. The best efforts contract commits the banker to provide brokerage services, and the banker will typically receive a fee without accepting any exposure relating to the price of the securities. Figure 2.2 lists the various services provided by FIs under brokerage and QAT. This list is suggestive, not exhaustive.

# THE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  

There are many ways to classify the many different types of FIs. In the previous section, we classified them based on the nature of the services they provide. We can also classify them based on whether or not they finance their activities with deposits.  

FIs that finance (at least partly) with deposits are called deposit-type or depository FIs, whereas those that do not finance with deposits are called nondepository FIs. Jointly, depository and nondepository FIs have at their command an enormous volume of assets. Table 2.1 lists the assets of the various types of FIs, and also depicts their growth during 1980–2010 and Figure 2.3 shows the shares of different financial institutions in total credit over that time period. It is noteworthy that the assets of all types of FIs, except savings institutions, have exhibited striking growth. By the end of 2017, U.S. commercial bank assets had grown to $\$17.3588$ trillion and their total liabilities were $\$15.4027$ trillion.  

The distinctions between depository and nondepository institutions have become blurred as the latter have increasingly offered products and services that compete with those of commercial banks. Consequently, individuals are increasingly turning to mutual funds rather than bank deposits for transactions and investment purposes. These developments can be seen in the data provided in Tables 2.2 and 2.3  

The shifting market shares of various institutions in the consumer loan market are reflected in the data provided in Table 2.4  Commercial banks are still the biggest players in the consumer loan market. Table 2.5 shows the 10 largest banks globally by the end of 2016, illustrating the changing nature of the global banking landscape. Having provided you with a glimpse of the market shares and sizes of the various types of institutions, we now move on to a description of each of these institutions in the next section.

# DEPOSITORY FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  

Depository institutions operate with high leverage, so that even a small return on total assets translates into a high return of equity. Figure 2.4 graphs the behavior through time of bank equity capital as a percentage of total assets. The figure illustrates the post-World War II upward drift in the net-worth-to-total-assets ratio through the 1960s then the long-run decline in the net-worth-to-total-asset ratio of banks until about 1980, followed by an increase in this ratio thereafter. But note these are book values and may not provide as comfortable a cushion as their levels would suggest. In Figure 2.5  we provide information on the return on assets and the return on equity at commercial banks. This figure highlights the effects leverage has on the translation from a return on assets to a return on equity. For instance, in 2004 return on assets for commercial banks was about $1.31\%$ , whereas return on equity was $13.82\%$ .

To highlight the problems with capitalization in banking that we have seen during the 2007–2009 financial crisis, Figure 2.6 presents the level of capital over time of the top four U.S. commercial banks and two pure investment banks; we will discuss investment banking shortly. Figure 2.7 shows the level of capital of the 10 largest European banks. And Figure 2.8 provides the average of capital ratios for the largest European and American banks. What is immediately apparent is that the European banks and the U.S. investment banks dramatically lowered their capital levels (“leverage ratios”) in the period leading up to the financial crisis. The same applies to Citigroup, but note that Citigroup, like the European banks, was heavily involved in investment banking as well.2 As we will discuss later, this development helped to fuel the financial crisis.

# Commercial Banks  

Commercial banks are widely considered the center of the financial intermediation universe because of their role in administering the community’s payments, and also because commercial banks are used to transmit monetary policy impulses originating with the central bank.3 Their sheer size and ubiquity provide yet another basis for according commercial banks special attention.  

TABLE 2.6 FDIC-insured Commercial Banks in 2012   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Asset Size</td><td>Return on Assets (in Percent)</td><td>Return on Equity (in Percent)</td><td>Equity Capital (in Percent of Assets)</td></tr><tr><td>Less than $100 million</td><td>0.74</td><td>6.34</td><td>11.66</td></tr><tr><td>$100 million to $1 billion</td><td>0.87</td><td>8.13</td><td>10.64</td></tr><tr><td>$1 billion to $10 billion</td><td>1.19</td><td>10.10</td><td>11.72</td></tr><tr><td>More than $10 billion</td><td>1.00</td><td>8.89</td><td>11.08</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1.00</td><td>8.92</td><td>11.11</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Source: FDlC Quarterly Banking Profile, December 2012.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Most commercial banks operate with considerable leverage. Table 2.6 shows that commercial banks in different size classes have a ratio of equity capital to total assets that averaged a little more than $10\%$ . As we have seen, these levels of capital look quite high, particularly compared to the numbers we showed for the largest banks, particularly in Europe, but also those for US investment banks and commercial banks with sizable investment banking operations (see Figures 2.6 and 2.7).  

The role of commercial banks in the payments system derives from their twin roles as distributor of currency (paper money and coin), and as producer and servicer of demand deposits. Currency and demand deposits are the community’s principal means of payment and media of exchange, and are the major components of the money supply. Commercial banks link the central bank with the many millions of money users.  

This nexus reflects on our second point, that commercial banks are central because of their role in monetary policy. The central bank seeks to stabilize economic activity by controlling the money available to support that activity. Hence, if inflation threatens, for example, the Federal Reserve will restrain the growth of money and drive up interest rates. Restricting growth of the money supply reduces the availability of bank credit to commercial banks, thereby lowering the volume of the loans they make and driving up the loan interest rates. This is the way commercial banks transmit monetary policy and fulfill their stabilizing role. We will revisit this issue in Chapter 3  

In playing this role in the conduct of monetary policy, a commercial bank acts both as a broker and as a QAT, providing all of the services listed in Figure 2.2 except management expertise. The consolidated U.S. banking sector’s balance sheet is shown in Table 2.7, and typical sources of revenues and expenses are shown in Table 2.8  

U.S. commercial banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Century (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) at the federal level and by state banking authorities at the state level.  

Commercial banks have many things in common with other depository institutions, but are distinguished by their abovementioned role in the payments system, by the diversity of their assets, and by their ownership structure. Other depositories, such as savings institutions (often called thrifts) and credit unions, have traditionally had more narrowly specialized asset portfolios – residential mortgages and consumer credit comprise the bulk of their assets, respectively, although these distinctions have been blurring and are almost irrelevant now for the most part. Commercial banks, as their name suggests, were also specialized lenders at one time, but they have evolved to the point that the largest of them holds a great variety of earning assets, including working capital, trade and term financing for businesses, residential and commercial mortgages, consumer loans, automobile loans, loans to sovereigns (governments), structured financing for corporate buyouts, and still more exotic credit instruments. In addition, commercial banks perform risk-shifting functions through their sale of standby letters of credit, swaps, and other financial guarantees. These are called “contingent claims” and have many of the attributes of ordinary insurance contracts.

The ownership structure of commercial banks is also notably different from other depository institutions. Commercial banks alone are all shareholder owned. Thrifts are substantially mutual, and credit unions are exclusively mutual, that is, they are owned by their depositors (a discussion of mutual organizations appears in the next chapter). In this era of galloping globalization, it is noteworthy that American commercial banking still reflects peculiarly American concerns. Interestingly, many of these idiosyncrasies are shared by the Japanese despite profound cultural differences. This is because Japanese banking was patterned after U.S. institutions following World War II. Indeed, our financial system probably shares more in common with that of Japan than with those of our other major trading partners in Europe and the Americas.

A few of the largest banks in Europe are cooperatives, effectively member-owned banks like credit unions, yet of enormous size (e.g., Credit Agricole in France and RABO-Bank in the Netherlands). In terms of total assets, both banks would rank among the top 10 banks in the United States. Commercial banks in the United States and Japan also historically tended to be more narrowly restricted in their activities (this distinction, like so many others, has eroded substantially under the pressures of global competition) and the consequent deregulation. For examples, Germany’s “universal” or “haus” banks are permitted to engage in all manners of insurance and investment banking, as well as the many activities traditionally permitted by American commercial banks. Such activities were traditionally proscribed for American commercial banks, but these restrictions have since been removed with the dismantling of the Glass–Steagall Act. While the major European and U.S. banks are privately owned (and publicly traded in most cases), the major Chinese banks are owned by the government.  

In addition to being more narrowly restricted functionally, commercial banks in the United States have also been geographically confined. For a long time, commercial banks in the United States could not operate in more than one state, with minor exceptions. Indeed, in many states, commercial banks could not operate from more than one office. This may seem quaint, but these Americanisms gave rise to over 30,000 independently chartered commercial banks at their peak, about 90 years ago. Markets were Balkanized and entry was restricted, reflecting America’s populist fear of economic power concentrations, especially when such power resided in the major eastern urban centers where the country’s largest financial institutions were headquartered. Also reflected in these policies (laws) was America’s fear of large-scale bank failures. Recall that these practices predate federally sponsored deposit insurance, which originated in the 1930s. Populist sentiments trace back to frontier America when the West sought cheap money, manufacturers, and transport. The Eastern establishment wanted sound money and sound banks, along with market-determined prices for railroad services and manufactured goods.4 While these sentiments now seem outdated, and deregulation in 1994 now permits interstate branching, the United States still had over 6900 banks in 2010. In Table 2.9  the banks are split up into community and noncommunity banks and various market share data are provided.  

The United States has far more banks than other countries. Even with the recent trend toward consolidation, the United States retains a relatively fragmented banking market with many independent, albeit a few large ones.  

# Thrifts  

S&Ls and MSBs, collectively referred to as thrifts, or savings institutions, are depository institutions that were specially chartered to extend residential mortgage finance. Traditionally their assets are primarily home mortgages, although their asset mix has been changing to include other assets in recent years. Thrifts have traditionally had even lower capital ratios than banks, as shown in Table 2.10  although regulation following the thrift failures in the 1980s has resulted in thrift capital ratios moving up, and actually being higher than the average bank capital ratio (in Table 2.6).

S&Ls were chartered for the purpose of specializing in consumer savings accounts and residential mortgage loans. They came into existence to encourage thrift and to allow people to purchase homes at a time when banks were loath to finance home mortgages. They started out as small informal mutuals, and despite the fact that many have converted into stockholder-owned institutions, mutual S&Ls abound. They were regulated by the independent Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) and insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). In 1989, the FHLBB was dissolved and replaced by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and Federal Reserve. The FDIC now provides federal deposit insurance for S&Ls. The financial intermediation services provided by S&Ls are similar to those provided by commercial banks, but with different emphasis.  

MSBs, as their name indicates, are cooperatively owned. Like S&Ls, they too invest mostly in mortgage loans and marketable securities. They are a few hundred in number and most are located in the Northeast and the Northwest of the United States. MSBs managed to distance themselves, at least for a time, from the savings and loan crisis;5 they were regulated by the FDIC rather than the now-defunct FHLBB and the FSLIC. The MSBs held less risky assets and operated with less financial leverage than the S&Ls, and had the good fortune to be located away from some of the worst real-estate markets of the 1980s – Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Colorado. MSBs were nevertheless damaged by the inflation-induced loss of core deposits, the consequent emergence of interest-rate risk, and the asset-quality problems of the later 1980s. Earlier proud pillars of the industry like The Bowery Savings Bank of New York and The Philadelphia Savings Fund Society were forced into humiliating restructurings, emerging as shareholder-owned shadows of their former selves.  

The 1989 FIRREA (Financial Institutions and Regulatory Reform Act) legislation, which did away with the FSLIC and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and folded the savings and loan federal deposit insurance fund into the FDIC, further weakened the distinctions between MSBs and S&Ls.6 As a practical matter, the distinction between MSBs and their cousins, the S&Ls, has been lost in a deluge of asset-quality problems. They are now less undifferentiated parties to the thrift industry implosion, estimated to cost taxpayers upwards of $\$250$ billion in present value terms as of mid-1990, although subsequent estimates put the cost at around $\$100$ billion.7  

The thrift fiasco was a large financial disaster. A whole industry with over thousands of firms and trillions of dollars was devastated. The industry seems to have recovered, however. Although their numbers have diminished, thrifts continue to operate successfully. Whether any will remain dedicated housing lenders for long is questionable, however. Table 2.10 provides further information on thrifts. It indicates that the financial condition of the industry is improving through time, although the numbers of thrifts have been declining through time.  

In diagnosing the thrift industry collapse, some point to flaws in the deposit insurance system, particularly the failure to relate deposit insurance premiums or capital requirements to the risk assumed by the thrifts. The deposit insurance contract provided inappropriate risk-taking incentives to thrift managers. Nevertheless, for four decades, it worked like a charm. These issues will be taken up in later chapters.  

# Credit Unions  

Like thrifts, credit unions specialize in consumer savings and are mutuals. Those forming a credit union must share a common bond  that is, they should be employed by the same organization. The credit union must be involved in borrowing and lending to its members. The homogeneity in borrower base facilitates the credit union’s control of credit risks, but limits potential diversification. As of 2012, there were 4272 credit unions in the United States.  

A credit union’s liabilities consist mainly of consumer deposits, and its assets are comprised mainly of consumer loans; real-estate mortgages to members; loans to other credit unions, MSBs, and S&Ls; and government and corporate securities. Federally chartered credit unions are regulated by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which also provides deposit insurance. State-chartered institutions can purchase NCUA deposit insurance as well. The services provided by a credit union include transactions services, screening, origination, monitoring, funding, guaranteeing, and liquidity creation. Like their other depository brethren, credit unions have low capital-to-total assets (stated as “reserves to assets”) ratios, as shown in Table 2.11

# INVESTMENT BANKS: KEY NONDEPOSITORY INTERMEDIARIES IN THE CAPITAL MARKET  

The primary focus of this book is deposit-taking FIs, and most specially commercial banks. Investment banks, like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, specialize in the design and issuance of financial contracts. They often perform the brokerage function of bringing buyers and sellers of securities together. The key intermediation services they provide are transaction services, financial advice, screening and certification, origination, issuance, and guaranteeing. The top 20 investment banks in the United States, ranked according to their underwriting and M&A advisory fees, are listed in Table 2.12  

An investment bank is an FI that specializes in: (i) raising financial (debt and equity) capital; (ii) advising on corporate mergers and acquisitions; and related transactions; (iii) wealth management; (iv) financial and economic research;  

![](images/74414e1ce1f5dd4938037af486c937f52d7852ded8d937704079901b16399d07.jpg)

(v) general financial advisory services; (vi) sales and trading; and (vii) other ancillary activities such as custodial services. Most of the major Wall Street investment banks are active in a wide variety of these activities. Smaller investment banks tend to specialize more narrowly. In Box 2.1  we further expand on these activities.  

# SEPARATION BETWEEN INVESTMENT BANKS AND COMMERCIAL BANKS UNDONE  

Legislation of the 1930s (Glass–Steagall Act) erected a wall of separation between commercial banks and investment banks. This legislation created investment banking in its singular American incarnation. No other major country, with the possible exception of Japan, had the kind of separation found in the United States. The European model is that of “universal banks” that bridge the chasm between the two forms and permit rationalization of structures dictated by the economics of the business. Glass–Steagall created two banking systems. Commercial bankers had subsidized deposits, but restricted asset choice. The investment banks were without deposit subsidies, but had great freedom on the asset side of the balance sheet, particularly with financial market linked activities (like underwriting).  

The investment banks’ marketing of equities complemented the commercial banks’ provision of loans. At the same time, however, the investment banks sold fixed-income securities, including bonds and commercial paper – which competed directly with commercial bank loans. Similarly, the investment banks aggressively marketed money-market funds in competition with commercial banks while at the same time they brokered deposits to the banks.  

# BOX 2.1 Services provided by investment banks (see also United States General Accounting Office (2003)).  

1. Raising Financial Capital: An investment bank can help a firm to finance a major investment project, acquire another company, restructure its balance sheet, expand operations, or other business purposes. Capital can include common equity, preferred equity, debt, as well as “hybrid” securities like convertible debt or debt with warrants attached. Investment banks raise capital through underwriting, private placements, venture capital, asset-based financing, and merchant banking. We briefly describe each below. Underwriting: Investment banks verify financial data and business claims, facilitate pricing of claims, and perform due diligence. Most offerings are “firm commitment” underwritings in which investment banks effectively purchase securities from the issuer for resale to the public. In the case of equities, they do this through Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) as well as secondary offerings. They also advise on debt issues to the public markets.  

Private Placements: As an alternative to a public offering, the banker may distribute newly issued debt or equity claims to a small number of larger, typically institutional buyers. These private placements are typically less costly to distribute because SEC registration requirements are less stringent on the supposition that the buyers are more sophisticated. Private placements are more common with debt than equity. Venture Capital: Investment banks also provide capital and strategic guidance to younger and smaller companies and may manage venture capital pools or even invest their own capital. Securitization and Asset-Based Financing: Investment banks help their clients use their existing assets to obtain additional financing without actually having to sell off these assets. The process by which this is done is called securitization, and the securities that are created in the process are called asset-backed securities. For example, a company might have (uncollected) receivables. It could then issue securities that permit the buyers of these securities to receive cash flows as these receivables are collected. Merchant Banking: These activities involve the investment bank committing its own capital to facilitate a variety of client transactions. That is, these are transactions involving QAT. Merchant banking transactions may include loan commitments, syndicated loans, highly leveraged transactions, bridge loans, and so on. A loan commitment is a promise by the bank to make a loan available in the future for a preidentified purpose such as an acquisition or a major project. A syndicated loan is one in which the bank is a member of a group making a loan to a borrower. A highly leveraged transaction is one in which the bank loan is part of a financing package for an acquisition or some other form of asset investment and the financing package involves a relatively high debt–equity ratio. A bridge loan is a temporary loan that serves as a bridge to more permanent future financings. Mergers and Acquisitions: Investment banks provide a variety of services to help their clients with mergers and acquisitions: (a) due diligence; (b) valuation; and (c) other advisory and transaction services. We describe each briefly below. Due Diligence: When a company is considering the acquisition of another company, it needs to examine the target company’s market and financial condition to ensure that it does not end up acquiring unforeseen problems or overpaying. The process by which the information relevant to this is collected and analyzed is called due diligence, and investment banks possess expertise in providing this service. Valuation: Any time a company is considering acquiring another company, it needs to establish the maximum price it is willing to pay. This is a blend of both the science of finance and an art form in evaluating information and making the right assumptions. Investment banks have developed expertise in valuation that they share with their clients. Other Advisory and Transaction Services: These include advising the client on the best type of transaction, preparing a selling memorandum, participating in negotiations, and assisting the client’s board of directors with discharge of its fiduciary duties.   
.  nvestment Management: Investment banks engage in investment management primarily of two types: (a) managing funds on behalf of institutional investors; and (b) managing the assets of wealthy individuals (private banking).   
. Research: Investment banks conduct research on companies, financial markets, and the economy. This research is sold directly or indirectly as part of a package of services.   
5. Corporate Advisory Services: Investment banks provide a host of advisory services to their corporate clients. These advisory services, include help with corporate reorganizations, resulting in recommendations about the sale of specific assets, the issuance of securities, and the possible negotiation of the sale of the entire company. In addition, banks offer advice relating to joint ventures, privatizations, spinoffs, tender and exchange offers, leveraged buyouts, and defense strategies against hostile takeovers.   
6. Security Sales and Trading: Investment banks are active in the sales and trading of various securities. They banks provide sales and trading services in principally three ways: (a) market making; (b) placing new offerings; and (c) brokerage services. We describe each of these briefly below. Market Making: As a market maker, an investment bank promotes price stability and continuity by holding inventories of the security, with a willingness and ability to step in and redress temporary imbalances in supply and demand. For example, an investment bank may stabilize prices during an IPO. Placing New Offerings: Investment banks actively market new securities either as an agent or a principal. Brokerage Services: Investment banks also engage in sales and trading for institutions as well as individuals.   
7. Other Ancillary Activities: This encompasses a variety of other activities like structuring transactions to manage risk. The term “structured finance” is used to refer to the mix of securities used in structuring “off-balance sheet” transactions, that is, transactions whose entire value does not show up on the clients’ balance sheet. Structured financing transactions generally isolate the firm’s assets and obligations in a “structure” that is apart from the main operations of the sponsor. The structure is typically called a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). Investment banks may also offer custodial and corporate trust services.  

With the dismantling of the Glass–Steagall Act and the passage of the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act in 1999, this separation between commercial and investment banking had been eliminated. While commercial banks used the deregulation to expand in security markets’ activities and occasionally acquired investment banking operations (e.g., Citi’s acquisition of Salomon Brothers via its merger with Travelers8), the main investment banks continued to exist as stand-alone businesses. This changed during the 2007–2009 financial crisis: several investment failed and/or were driven in the hands of commercial banks (Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch). Today only a few stand-alone large investment banks remain (in particular, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley).  

The massive failure of investment banks pointed at an inherent fragility in their activities and way of operating. Investment banks engaged increasingly in proprietary trading (i.e., trading for their own account: principal trading) and they added leverage to their balance sheet. These changes in their business model away from the typical client-oriented investment banking services were highly lucrative in the booming capital markets leading up to the financial crisis,9 but became deadly when the market turned.  

# Separation of Investment Banking Activities  

Because investment banks have potential access to significant amounts of proprietary information about their clients, they go to great lengths to specify to their employees rules and procedures to ensure that the bank neither trades on this proprietary information nor does it make buy/sell recommendations based on this information. That is, investment banks erect “Chinese Walls” that separate the banking part of their business from the marketing side of their business.  

Investment banks are general purpose FIs largely in the service of businesses. They perform a wide range of brokerage and asset transformation services, but at base their role is to mobilize financial capital in the service of businesses and other capital users including governments and not-for-profits. Notably, investment banks do not provide monetary services as these are the exclusive domain of commercial banks who enjoy the use of governmentally issued liabilities and access to the Federal Reserve discount window.  

# OTHER NONDEPOSITORY INTERMEDIARIES  

Commercial banks and investment banks are members of a vast and diverse financial services industry with overlapping markets and regulatory jurisdictions. These jurisdictional and competitive relationships condition behaviors with regard to pricing, output, attitudes toward risk, and just about every other facet of the business of financial intermediation. Therefore, we shall spend the next few pages sketching some of the more interesting members of this fascinating industry.  

# Venture Capitalists  

Most fledgling entrepreneurs are unable to obtain bank financing. They go instead to venture capitalists. Many prominent firms, including Apple and Federal Express, began with funding from venture capitalists. Venture capitalists typically provide both capital and expertise that allow entrepreneurs to convert ideas into commercial ventures.  

Venture capital funding is normally in the form of structured financing, including both equity and convertible debt, rather than just the loans that banks provide. The salient features of a venture capital contract are as follows:10  

1. The entrepreneur cannot “walk away” after obtaining financing and negotiate with another financier (no de novo financing).   
2. The entrepreneur may be relieved of control of the firm by the venture capitalist unless the firm’s performance meets some minimum requirement (“performance requirement”).   
3. If the entrepreneur is relieved of control, he is paid a fixed amount independent of his demonstrated skill and subsequent cash flows of the firm; that is, he is bought out by the venture capitalist (“buyout” option for the venture capitalist).   
4. If control remains with the entrepreneur, both the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur receive equity payoffs (“earnout” arrangement).  

Why do venture capital contracts have these features? To understand this, consider the parties involved in these transactions. First, the entrepreneur often is either an engineer (who knows the manufacturing technology of the product to sell)  

or a marketing expert, but he is often inexperienced in managing all facets of a business. Venture capitalists, while they are not necessarily intimately familiar with the production or marketing technique of the products their clients want to produce, usually have considerable management expertise and a nose for “troubleshooting” based on experience in financing and managing numerous ventures. Thus, venture capitalists possess two attributes that entrepreneurs need: financial capital and management expertise.  

Typically, when the partnership between a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur commences, neither is completely sure of the entrepreneur’s management ability. The initial period is one of learning for both parties. If the firm’s performance were to indicate that the entrepreneur lacked sufficient management ability, it would be efficient to replace the entrepreneur with the venture capitalist to avail of the latter’s managerial skills. Although such a passage of control may be the best thing for the firm, it is not obvious that the entrepreneur would be eager or even willing to relinquish control of the firm. That is, the entrepreneur’s attachment to the venture he thought of and started may stand in the way of implementing the best $e x$ post plan for the firm. To prevent this, both parties could agree ex ante to an explicit clause in the venture capital contract that allows for an orderly transfer of control. This would also benefit the entrepreneur ex ante, as the venture capitalist’s recognition of the possibility that he can buy out the entrepreneur and take control of the firm if things go really badly will improve the terms of the initial financing received by the entrepreneur. In this regard, it is also important for the venture capitalist to have an equity claim in the firm. This not only gives the venture capitalist a more active voice in management even when the entrepreneur is in control, but also provides the venture capitalist with all the ownership incentives to invest managerial expertise in the firm and to counsel the entrepreneur.  

We can now see why banks may be unwilling to lend to most entrepreneurs. Because banks do not possess managerial expertise in running young, nonfinancial firms, and also because regulation prevents them from doing so except during short, transitional periods following borrower default, the performance requirements and buyout options used by the venture capitalist are not available to the bank. Thus, if the entrepreneur turns out to be a poor manager and the business fails, the bank can do little to revive and nurture it back to success. It would simply be left holding the assets of the firm (assuming the entrepreneur defaults on his loan) as collateral of possibly dubious value. Hence, the same entrepreneur is generally more risky to the bank than to the venture capitalist.  

Why do not banks hire management consultants to assist entrepreneurs in their fledgling businesses? They could. However, a management consultant would be merely an agent of the bank and thus the bank would confront moral hazard in motivating the consultant. A venture capitalist avoids this moral hazard by combining management expertise and financing into one entity. Alternatively, banks could hire the talent needed to advise entrepreneurs, as do the venture capitalists. However, because of the short-term nature of the bank’s liabilities and their government guarantee, equity-type claims have traditionally been viewed as inappropriate for banks.  

Banks are at less of a disadvantage relative to venture capitalists in dealing with well-established borrowers. With this more stable clientele, the bank’s superior ability to access the capital markets and its ability to avail itself of deposit insurance and the discount window give it a distinct advantage. Not surprisingly, then, for firms where the manager’s ability to shepherd his organization through the more vulnerable early phase is not a critical issue, bank loans tend to be preferred to venture capital. Moreover, in these cases, managers will prefer to avoid the possibility of having to relinquish control to the venture capitalist at some future time. Thus, the intermediation services provided by venture capitalists include screening and certification, funding, monitoring, management expertise, and liquidity creation and transformation.  

# Finance Companies  

Most of the important finance companies originated as narrowly focused trade finance subsidiaries of large nonfinancial companies. Examples include General Electric Capital, General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC), and FOMOCO (Ford Motor Company’s finance subsidiary). Others have independent origins, including factoring specialists.11 Finance companies lend to consumers for auto and home purchases, as well as other purposes, and to businesses for a wide range of applications. These intermediaries usually specialize in processing riskier credits, and most of their lending is done on a secured basis, that is, with collateral, unlike commercial banks that lend on both unsecured and secured bases. There are three basic types of finance companies: sales finance companies that make car and appliance loans; personal finance companies, which make small personal loans (for example, for debt consolidation); and business finance companies, which make commercial loans and leases. The intermediation services provided by these finance companies include screening, origination, funding, and claims transformation.  

Finance companies typically fund themselves by selling commercial paper. Indeed, the most compelling difference between commercial banks and finance companies is in their primary sources of funding. Because the commercial banks are substantially funded by governmentally insured deposits, they are invested with a special public interest and are subject to pervasive regulation. The finance companies do not have access to subsidized funds and are not subject to regulatory restrictions, proscriptions, examinations, and supervision.  

The commercial paper sold by finance companies is an unsecured general obligation of the issuer and has a fixed maturity of less than 9 months. Most often, the maturity of commercial paper is shorter than 6 months at the date of issue. Commercial paper is typically sold in large denominations and is rated by specialized credit-rating agencies. Because the paper is unsecured, issuers are usually compelled to purchase a dedicated (back-up) loan commitment in order to obtain a favorable credit rating. Back-up loan commitments are sold by commercial banks expressly for the purpose of providing the commercial paper issuer with the funds to redeem its paper in case rolling over the maturing paper proves to be infeasible. The back-up commitment from the bank ensures the commercial paper issuer’s ability to redeem its paper, conditional only on the bank’s performance on its loan commitment.  

The commercial paper market is notoriously fragile. Macroeconomic shocks have been known to paralyze commercial paper issuance. In addition, the fortunes of a particular borrower may preclude use of the commercial paper market. Thus, the back-up loan commitments, or “back-up lines,” are critically important to the lender, especially in light of the unsecured status of commercial paper.  

Finance companies are an illustration of the evolution of competition between regulated and largely unregulated segments of the financial services industry. The captive finance subsidiaries, the most important players in this market segment, grew out of trade credit provided by larger, better-rated nonfinancial corporations. Having developed the expertise necessary to underwrite the credit of their customers and having established secure sources of funding, why would not one offer these financial services to the community beyond one’s customer base? This is the logic that drove GMAC from the exclusive financing of its own auto sales to becoming the largest home-mortgage servicer in the United States. It is the same logic that drove Ford Motor Credit into the savings and loan business and General Electric Capital into virtually every facet of banking (with the notable exception of deposit taking), including the ownership of Kidder Peabody, a failed major investment bank in the United States.  

Trade credit, the driver in this story of horizontal and vertical integration, arises moreover as the natural accompaniment to trade between parties with widely disparate access to the credit markets.12 Consider General Electric (GE), a large and well-rated company that sells industrial equipment to smaller, less well-known companies. In periods of credit stringency, GE’s customers are crowded (rationed) out of the credit market well before GE, and this reduces the demand for GE’s products. In order to smooth the cyclicality of demand for its goods, GE will borrow in order to provide its customer with uninterrupted access to credit. This will stabilize and also increase the demand for GE’s nonfinancial output. Enhanced revenues and decreased cost should ensue, the latter owing to more predictable production runs and smaller inventories.  

Trade credit is a natural complement to trade in nonfinancial goods and services whenever traders have different degrees of access to capital markets. It illustrates a very basic attribute of banking, namely the negligible natural barriers to entry. Thus, in the absence of regulatory restrictions, one would expect to see a steady flow of new FIs entering and others departing (failing or merging) as the industry adjusts to changes in the demand for its services. Hence, those that specialize in the provision of financial services can expect competition from their own clients who enjoy the advantage of being largely unregulated, but must therefore borrow in the open market without the benefit of government subsidies.  

The market share of finance companies, measured in terms of asset size, is a small fraction of that of commercial banks,13 but this probably understates the importance of finance company competition, especially for the money-center and super regional banks that typically serve the same customers, middle-market companies, and the larger consumer markets.  

# Insurance Companies  

Private sector life and health insurance companies manage trillions of dollars of assets. Property and casualty insurers control hundreds of billions of dollars in assets. Together, the insurers are slightly less than half the size of the commercial banking industry. As in the case of thrifts, many insurance companies are organized as mutuals (cooperatives) rather than as shareholder-owned institutions. Some key statistics pertaining to the life insurance industry in the United States are provided in Table 2.13  As is evident, life insurance firms invest the premiums they collect in a wide variety of assets, including real estate.

Insurance companies hold many of the same kinds of assets found on the balance sheets of commercial banks, but insurer assets are financed for the most part with contingent liabilities. That is, the insurance company’s liabilities become current (or terminate, in the case of annuities) upon the occurrence of some prespecified event, the timing or realization of which is inherently uncertain when the insurance contract is written. Insurance is written against a large variety of contingencies. Life insurance companies typically contract against the expiration of life or the realization of health care needs.14 Property and casualty insurers write policies against: (i) damage or loss of physical or intellectual property, including the loss of income or extraordinary expenses associated with the property damage or loss, (ii) liability, (iii) health care needs, and (iv) surety. Surety contracts guarantee third-party contractual performance. Examples include fidelity, construction and bail bonds, and also standby letters of credit that are a mainstay of the commercial banking business. Standby letters typically guarantee the repayment of third-party debt.  

For example, A might be vaguely interested in extending credit to B, but may not be entirely sure about repayment prospects. A then may request that B arrange a standby letter of credit with her bank, insurance company or other credible financial guarantor. In exchange for the payment of an appropriate insurance premium,15 the guarantor will accept the risk of repaying A’s loan to B in the event B fails to do so. This kind of financial guarantee is commonly written by commercial banks, property and casualty (multiline) insurers, and even “pure” financial guarantors (monoline insurers) who do nothing more than guarantee performance of third parties under debt contracts.  

The most striking differences between banks and insurance companies are found on the liability sides of their respective balance sheets. Wherever the liabilities of banks change, often instantaneously and at the sole discretion of depositors, insurance liabilities change on the occurrence of events largely uncontrollable by the claimant. In addition, the duration of life insurance liabilities, in particular, is much longer than that of commercial bank deposit liabilities. Thus, life insurers can and do hold longer-term assets than commercial banks. This difference in duration may be the most fundamental difference between banks and life insurers (the liabilities of property and casualty insurers tend to be shorter than those of life insurers). Life insurers and pension funds are allegedly the two largest private-sector pools of long-term money.16  

In order to distinguish insurance from the kind of risk-shifting that takes place through the purchase (sale) of a financial futures contract or an option or a “swap” contract, insurance is commonly defined as involving some application of the law of large numbers. Thus, insurance requires some pooling of risks among independent events to avail of diversification and make it easier to price such risks. It is difficult for investors to avail of such diversification themselves because of the bulky unit size of some claims. Again, a strong analogy between insurance and banking emerges: diversification enables banks to manage credit and withdrawal (interest rate) risks, and individuals’ limited wealth and access to credit markets limits the potential for “homemade” diversification. The intermediation services provided by insurance companies include screening and certification, origination, funding, monitoring, guaranteeing, and claims transformation.  

# Pensions  

Along with life insurance, private pension funds accumulate the long-term liabilities that are capable of funding the durable assets so critical to real capital accumulation. In earlier years, when bank deposits were subject to interest rate ceilings and competition was more restrained, banks and thrifts too were capable of making 7- to 10-year fixed-interest-rate business loans and even 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with acceptable levels of interest rate risk. The shortened duration of deposits, however, has rendered banks and thrifts less able to provide long-term credit. To be sure, banks and thrifts offer longerlived loans, but the interest rates on them are typically variable. These sequences of short-term loans provide the borrower with no certainty regarding future for longer-term credits, and this has elevated the importance of the pension funds and life insurance.17  

The liabilities of defined-contribution pension funds are actuated upon retirement or death of their members, at which time the member’s claim is paid out as a lump sum or used to purchase an annuity. In the case of defined-benefit plans, the retirement fund pays a prescribed annuity to the claimant upon retirement. In the time interval between contributions and the termination of the funds’ liability to the claimants, the contributions are invested in a wide variety of assets, everything from real estate and other equities to Treasury debt. These investments are constrained by federal legislation (ERISA), which defines the responsibilities of pension fiduciaries. The key intermediation services provided by pension funds are guaranteeing and claims transformation. The substantial asset liability management risks in defined-benefit plans have led to a migration to defined contribution plans where there is no prescribed annuity upon retirement and the ultimate pension depends on investment returns much like in mutual funds.  

Pension funds are being called upon increasingly to play a role in corporate governance as representatives of their millions of beneficiaries. Historically, the pensions have been passive investors, but issues like the composition of boards of directors, executive compensation, potential conflicts of interest of executives involved in buyouts and many other issues vitally affect current and future retirees with investments in corporate America. The problem is that the pension fund managers typically hold investments in many hundreds of corporations – indeed, many adopt consciously passive strategies of cloning the stock indexes (purchasing securities that behave like the averages) – and they are simply not staffed adequately to participate in the affairs of individual corporations. This, however, is increasingly unacceptable to pension participants and the community at large as more instances of corporate abuse are widely chronicled. It seems inevitable that the guardians of America’s pension assets will be forced to become more active in corporate affairs, and this will no doubt affect corporate governance in the future.  

# Mutual Funds  

Along with pension funds, mutual funds have been major market-share winners over the past 40 years. Essentially a postWorld War II phenomenon, mutual funds (including money market funds) have risen from an inconsequential share of the intermediation market in 1950 to achieve a $6\%$ market share in 1990, and a $25\%$ market share in 2010 (measured based on total assets). Its significant growth can also be gleaned from the penetration of mutual funds among U.S. households, which increased from $25\%$ in 1990 to $44\%$ in 2012 (see Table 2.2).  

Mutual funds come in two basic varieties: open- and closed-end. Closed-end funds have a preestablished number of shares and the fund’s initial resources typically are not augmented with the subsequent sale of shares. A closed-end fund is typically traded as a single security on organized exchanges, for example, the New York Stock Exchange, and its shares are priced directly in the market like the shares of any other company. As a consequence, the market price of closed-end fund shares can deviate, often widely, from the liquidation value of the securities they hold. Open-end funds operate on very different rules. Their shares are continuously liquidated and augmented by a specialized management company that offers shares for cash, and cash for shares at net asset value (NAV). NAV is the estimated liquidation or market value of the fund’s assets divided by the number of shares the fund has outstanding. Thus, unlike closed-end fund shares, the prices of open-end fund shares cannot deviate from the value of underlying assets.  

The open-end funds have given rise to large specialized fund management companies, like Fidelity, DWS Scudder, Vanguard, and Dreyfus. Each of these manages and markets a wide range of different funds, each of which is defined in terms of specific investment objectives. These investment companies earn their keep by levying fees against the funds it manages. The funds, of course, are owned by their investors. Were you to consult the financial pages of any major newspaper, you would find a section headed mutual funds wherein you could find the NAV of any of the numerous mutual funds managed by Merrill Lynch, or any of the very large number managed by Fidelity. These larger mutual fund companies typically have tens of billions of dollars under management. The key financial intermediation services provided by mutual funds include transactions services, screening, and certification.  

There is nothing terribly new about mutual funds, except their explosive growth in recent decades. There are at least three reasons for the current popularity of the funds. First, money-market mutual funds, which were introduced in the 1960s, rapidly became the instrument of choice for circumventing Regulation $\boldsymbol{Q}$ deposit interest rate ceilings. As inflation accelerated in the 1970s and market interest rates soared, the spread between these rates and deposit rates gaped ever wider. The bloated opportunity cost of holding bank deposits increased the appeal of money-market funds. The rest is history!  

Despite the competitive disadvantage of operating without a government guarantee, the mutual funds grew spectacularly, underscoring that there are limits to what the public is willing to pay for governmental deposit insurance.  

By and large, the money-market funds were managed conservatively, and some even restricted themselves to holding direct debt of the U.S. government. More commonly, the funds held negotiable large-denomination certificates of deposit of banks, commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, mortgage, and other asset-backed securities, and government agency debt. Almost all of these assets were less than 1 year to maturity, and the funds traded at a constant one dollar per share.  

Moreover, the money-market funds are sustained by implicit guarantees of their managers. In at least three cases, management companies made good on asset losses in order to protect their own reputations and the viability of the money funds they managed. For example, Value Line manages a money-market fund that held the commercial paper of Integrated Resources, a company that defaulted on its debt. Rather than reflect this loss in its money-market fund, which almost certainly would have meant the fund’s demise, Value Line management bought the Integrated Resources commercial paper from its money-market fund at par. Notably, there was no legal or even moral obligation to protect the fund’s investors, but the action was presumably motivated by the desire to maintain and build upon Value Line’s reputation in managing moneymarket funds. Clearly, the money-market funds offered a compelling package of substitutes for the governmental deposit guarantee. Low-risk investment strategies, combined with implicit guarantees of reputable management companies, and substantially higher yields permitted the money-market funds to ravage the bank and thrift deposit markets and enjoy meteoric growth. As we will see in Chapter 14  the low (or no) risk image got battered during the 2007–2009 financial crisis. Explicit government guarantees were needed to ensure the survival of money market mutual funds.  

The second and third reasons for the recent growth of mutual funds are less dramatic, but nevertheless noteworthy. In recent decades, the public has gradually become persuaded of the improbability of consistently “beating” the stock market. A sea of research, much of it academic, has demonstrated that over most extended spans of time asset managers do less well than the widely watched stock market indices, for example, Dow Jones, and Standard and Poor’s. The reasons are numerous and complex, but the facts seem plain. The widespread acceptance of this idea has had a profound effect on investment behavior, and in particular it has led to the idea that if you cannot beat the averages, you can do no better than to buy the averages. Buying the averages is known as passive investment. This is done by purchasing a portfolio of securities that behave like (clone) the averages. Since this strategy typically requires holding a substantial number of securities, it is often infeasible for smaller wealth holders, and uneconomic for most. However, mutual funds can provide such a service at low cost. Thus, the popularity of passive investment strategies provides a second reason for the recent growth of mutual funds.  

Finally, the past six decades have witnessed the much-heralded globalization of financial markets. Many investors believe it is as important to diversify across economies (currencies) as it is to diversify across industries. Furthermore, diversification across economies has been massively simplified in recent decades, as regulatory and tax barriers have been dismantled. However, information about foreign investment opportunities is still relatively expensive. Hence, the mutual fund has become the instrument of choice for investing abroad. Many “country funds” are closed-end and listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but there are also many open-end funds that specialize in countries and regions of the world. To mix a metaphor, as the pie of foreign indirect investment has grown larger, the bologna of specialization among funds has been sliced ever thinner.  

# Hedge Funds  

In contrast to most mutual funds, hedge funds are actively managed funds that pursue nontraditional investment strategies. A hedge fund is a private investment pool subject to the terms of an investment agreement between the sponsor of the fund and its investors. They take both long and short positions in a variety of instruments – equities, fixed income securities, currencies, etc. – to achieve the highest return commensurate with the fund’s objectives. Although the hedge fund industry has traditionally been far less regulated than mutual funds, that gap was partially closed in 2004, when hedge funds were required to register under the Investment Advisers Act. This act allows the SEC to inspect all hedge fund advisers for approval purposes. Moreover, hedge funds are now subject to many of the same requirements as mutual fund advisers.  

Differences between hedge funds and mutual funds persist, however. While mutual fund sales charges and fees are subject to regulatory limits, there are no limits on the fees hedge fund advisers can charge.  

Also, mutual funds are restricted in their ability to leverage against the value of securities in their portfolio, whereas leveraging and other higher-risk investment strategies are commonplace for hedge funds. In fact, hedge funds originally came into existence to invest in equity securities and use leverage and short selling to hedge the exposure of the portfolio to stock price movements. Finally, while any investor can open a mutual fund account with $\$1000$ or less, a minimum investment of $\$1$ million or more is typically required to become a hedge fund investor.  

# CREDIT RATING AGENCIES  

Credit Rating agencies (CRAs) provide a brokerage function as information processors. Typically, they provide credit ratings for a variety of debt securities: municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and the like. These credit ratings fall in 21 or 22 discrete categories and a rating signifies an assessment of the borrower’s ability to repay its debt obligations. Ratings are on an ordinal scale. For example, S&P’s highest rating is AAA and the lowest is D.  

CRAs are specialists in processing information that helps to arrive at an estimate of a borrower’s probability of default. In the United States and the EU, there are regulatory norms that the CRAs must abide by. One of these is that in the United States, CRAs must be approved as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) by the SEC.  

The credit rating industry is an oligopoly, with three CRAs dominating the market with about $95\%$ share.18 These CRAs are: Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch.  

CRAs produce credit ratings based on public as well as private information, and use both quantitative models and subjective judgment, based on inputs derived from financial statements as well as assessments of management quality, the firm’s competitive position, etc. These ratings are not intended to be buy/sell recommendations. Moreover, they are “coarse indicators” of credit quality, with most rating agencies using a litter over 20 ratings to describe credit qualities that lie in a continuum.19 But ratings are enormously important nonetheless, because for many institutions, capital requirements for holding debt securities, as well as which investments are considered permissible are often based on the credit ratings given to those debt instruments.  

Credit ratings are assigned to a wide variety of issuers, including corporations, municipal units, states, countries, and structured finance products created by securitization; in the case of securitized mortgages, these structured finance products are called MBS. Issuers who choose to be rated have to pay the CRAs. That is why this is called an “issuer pays” arrangement. While some issuers of debt securities have the flexibility to decide whether or not to acquire a rating, corporate issuers of bonds in the United States do not have this flexibility since Moody’s and S&P rate all taxable corporate bonds, even if issuers do not pay for those ratings.  

The economic rationale for CRAs to exist can be found in the theory of information brokers as diversified information producers.20 We will discuss this in Chapter 3  Moreover, credit ratings also serve a useful coordination purpose in financial markets, as they allow agents to converge to one out of many possible equilibria.21 Issuers can use good ratings to signal low-risk and high-quality governance, thereby reducing their cost of financing. Investors can use ratings and bond yields to determine whether to invest in those bonds at those yields.  

In the subprime financial crisis of 2007–2009, CRAs were blamed for having been overly generous in assigning ratings and thus not alerting investors about the risks in their investments. However, the problems of “ratings inflation” and ratings errors seemed to be confined to the ratings assigned to structured finance products and some sovereign bonds.22 In the case of MBS, especially those backed by subprime mortgages, the rating agencies were confronted with risks that were unlike those they had assessed previously.  

# THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT  

To this point, we have sketched the major players in the world of financial intermediation. Probably the most important intermediaries to add to this list are the vast government enterprises that routinely provide a wide variety of financial services. These would include the Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance, Workers’ Compensation, Medicare, the housing agencies (Federal National Mortgage Corporations of FNMA or “Fannie Mae,” Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or FHLMC or “Freddie Mac,” and the Government National Mortgage Association or GNMA or “Ginnie Mae”) Farm Credit Administration, Small Business Administration, Student Loan Marketing Association (or “Sally Mae”), and flood insurance programs of the Agriculture Department. And the list goes on!  

Annual payments to the federal government’s Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance, and Medicare programs are twice the assets of the largest commercial bank in the United States, and about one-sixth the assets of the entire commercial banking industry. Without doubt, the U.S. government is by far the largest financial services provider in the country and arguably in the world.  

# FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES ON THE PERIPHERY  

# Gambling  

Prominent on the periphery of the financial intermediation universe is the glamorous world of legal and illegal gambling. Some deny that gambling is a financial service, but this seems a quibble. The bookmaker is as much a broker as the trader of options and financial futures. The naysayers argue that gambling creates risk, whereas insurance dissipates and redistributes preexisting risk. But whether the gambling relates to a manufactured uncertainty (e.g., a horse race or roulette) or to some pre-existing natural process (e.g., the number of live pups your neighbor’s dog will whelp), seems incidental. The production of uncertainty is logically separable and incidental to the gambling.  

The more meaningful distinction between insurance and gambling is that the former involves the exchange of a certain cost (the premium) for relief from an uncertain liability, whereas the latter is the exchange of a certain cost (say the price of a lottery ticket) for an uncertain future receipt. The bookmaker would just as soon wager on tomorrow’s mean temperature as on the three-digit numbers generated by tomorrow’s horse races. It matters not whether the bet is hedging or speculating, nor does it matter what process generates the uncertainty.23 The bookmaker merely fills a market niche, one usually scorned or illegal. The difference between the bookmaker and the insurance agent may well be that one is legal and the other is not, but at a deeper level the insurer sells alleviation from risk to those ill-equipped to bear it, whereas the bookmaker sells risk to those who find it welfare-improving. In this latter sense, both are brokers, and possibly qualitative asset transformers too. The bookmaker is a FI in the same sense as the insurance agent or underwriter.  

# Pawnbrokers  

Also on the periphery we have “bankers” to the poor and the excluded (who perforce are high-risk borrowers). The major participants in these market niches are pawnbrokers and loan sharks, the former legal and the latter not usually. As of 1991, there were in the United States approximately three times as many pawnbrokers (about 6900) as S&Ls.24 Pawn loans are typically small, say $\$50–5100$ . Most of these loans are for a few weeks, sometimes months, and all are secured with merchandise (jewelry, electronics, musical instruments, guns, and the like) with a resale value roughly twice the debt. All-in interest rates range from high to astronomical, and can be as high as $25{-}30\%$ per month in states without interest rate ceilings. In 2004, it is estimated that there were 15,000 pawnbrokers in the United States.25  

Pawnbroking is a traditional form of asset-backed (secured) lending. The lender typically prefers to be repaid rather than taking ownership and liquidating the collateral (this is because the failure to repay usually ruptures a valuable customer relationship), but the creditworthiness of the borrower is rarely at issue (the pawnbroker rarely has the information necessary to form an intelligent judgment, except perhaps in cases of longtime customers). The loan is made entirely on the basis of the borrower’s collateral. Default rates between 10 and $30\%$ are common. The intermediation services provided by pawnbrokers include origination, funding, and market completeness.  

The pawnbroker industry began to stagnate in the late 1990s with the rise of payday and title lending alternatives, which are discussed below.26  

# Payday Lending  

Payday lenders did not operate as a formal industry until the early 1990s. Prior to this time, most payday lenders were check cashers who made payday loans as a casual extension of their core business. By 2004, there were 12,000 payday lenders in the United States,27 with major pawn chains having also entered the business.  

Payday lenders provide unsecured short-term loans to customers. The loan arises in one of two ways. One is the traditional payday loan transaction, in which the borrower writes a postdated (or undated) personal check to a lender, the lender makes a loan equal in amount to the check minus finance charge. The lender holds the check before either depositing it, or receiving cash repayment directly from the borrower, usually on the borrower’s payday. The second is a variant of the traditional transaction, in which no check is written, but the borrower signs an authorization that permits the lender to debit his bank account on a future date for the amount of the loan plus the finance charge. The typical loan term is 2 weeks.  

The payday lending industry has grown to approximately 12,000 firms in 31 states and DC. In 2000, payday lenders made about 65 million loans to 8–10 million households, totaling $\$8-914$ billion in loan value, and generating over $\$2$ billion in revenue. The industry reports gross margins of $30\%$ of revenue, with losses at $1-1.3\%$ of receivables, and return on investment of $24\%$ . Payday lending has increasingly become controversial particularly because of the high interest rates charged (the APR can be as high as a few hundred percent). Some states therefore have an outright prohibition of payday lending or seek to cap interest rates. Under the Dodd Frank Act – discussed in Chapters 15 and $16-$ further restrictions can be expected.  

# Title Lenders  

Title lenders are similar to payday lenders, the difference being that title lenders make secured loans rather than unsecured loans. That is, instead of holding a check or debit authorization until payday, title lenders hold collateral against the loan. Typically, $\$250$ to $\$1000$ , and the value of the associated collateral is typically three times as much.  

The title lending industry is essentially an extension of the pawnbroker industry. The two differences between them are as follows: First, a pawnbroker keeps physical possession of the collateral until the loan is repaid, whereas a title lender may permit the collateral to physically rest with the borrower during the loan term and repossess it only upon default. Second, title loans are typically larger than pawn loans. These two differences, however, are not economically important for distinguishing between these two types of lenders in terms of the brokerage and QAT functions served by them. That is, payday lenders and title lenders serve essentially the same economic functions as pawnbrokers.  

Like loans extended by pawnbrokers, payday loans and loans made by title lenders tend to have very high interest rates, often exceeding $25\%$ per month, for an annual percentage rate (APR) of $300\%$ . The title loan industry originated in the southeastern United States and has spread to other states like Missouri, Illinois, and Oregon. In some states, an upper limit of $30\%$ annual interest rate was imposed, which essentially eliminated the industry there.  

# Loan Sharks  

Whereas the pawnbroker lives on the edge of respectability (see the splendid movie of the same title, with Rod Steiger), loan sharks live beyond the pale. Dates on loan-sharking are understandably sketchy, but these FIs play a prominent role in providing credit in support of both legal and illegal enterprises.28 The President’s Crime Commission in 1967 asserted that loan-sharking was the second most important activity of organized crime.  

A definitional note will help to clarify much confusion. If by loan-sharking we mean all illegal lending, loan-sharking will include an amorphous hodgepodge of lenders who violate usury laws. More useful, it would seem, is to think of loan sharks as lenders who can credibly make illegal or socially unacceptable threats of violence and intimidation in connection with collections. The availability of this singular and extralegal collection technology explains why this financial service is provided by criminal elements, why interest rates on such loans tend to be high, and why their clientele are typically desperate borrowers with few alternatives. The legality of their activities aside, loan sharks serve economic functions that are similar to those of payday and title lenders. In fact, some refer to payday lenders as “legal loan sharks.”  

Reuter and Rubinstein describe three kinds of loans made by loan sharks. Short-term small loans of under $\$1000$ were made on a weekly six-for-five basis. Loans of $\$1000$ or more, called “knockdowns,” would call for 12 weekly repayments of $\$100$ . A third type of loan, usually for larger amounts, called a “vig” loan, would call for weekly interest payments of $1.5\mathrm{-}3\%$ with the principal returned in toto at termination of the loan.  

The same authors also describe the fairly common use of collateral, but this would seem to be an anomaly, unless the credit is to be used for illegal purposes. A properly secured loan would obviate the need for, or usefulness of extralegal intimidation. Hence, the borrower should be able to borrow from any asset-based lender such as a finance company or a pawnbroker at considerably lower interest rates than those quoted by loan sharks. However, legitimate lenders could be expected to avoid lending to felons, or for projects known to be illegal.  

Apparently, a substantial fraction of the loans made by loan sharks are to bookmakers down on their luck. It would not be surprising to learn that much credit also goes to finance illicit drug and stolen goods inventories. But the less glamorous side of loan-sharking must be lending to the fringes of society without the collateral to offer a pawnbroker or finance company. To these unfortunates, the loan shark offers a service that no law-abiding institution, short of a charity, can provide. Whatever the moral considerations loan sharks are nevertheless an indispensable part of the financial services industry. They are bankers to the poor, the forgotten, and to those living outside the law.  

# CONCLUSION  

This chapter has provided a selective survey of the major and more interesting members of the financial services industry.   
We used our description of commercial banks and thrifts to also sketch the financial environment.  

Major competitors for commercial banks and thrifts include insurance companies, finance companies, pensions, and mutual funds. The linkages among these segments, the cutting edge of competition, are described in the respective sections on each. The theme is one of commonality and similarity; differences among segments of the industry are seen as legal, artificial, and exaggerated. And of course, one can never forget the government (“… where does the gorilla sleep?”) as a member of this gigantic industry.  

Finally, we addressed a collection of important and often neglected FIs on the periphery of the industry. Included in this collection is the woolly world of gambling – public and private, legal and illegal – and the shadowy backwaters of pawnbroking, payday and title lending, and loan-sharking. All have their assigned roles, based on the law and technology, in processing risk and information and in allocating credit. Each serves as a broker and/or asset transformer, and the more bizarre actions associated with the criminal aspects of some of these activities are absent, each makes the market work more effectively, thereby increasing the economic pie available to be shared among all.  

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. Given below is an excerpt from a conversation. Who do you agree with? Provide a thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of your opinion. Appleton: Absolutely! I believe that when you cut through all the bull, the essential role of banks is to act as “lot breakers” and provide simple transactions service. I can’t write checks against a T-bill, so I need a bank. Butterworth: Alex, I couldn’t disagree more. Everything that I’ve read suggests that banks are special. Your proposal would destroy a key ingredient of the process by which society allocates capital from savers to investors. Moderator: It looks to me like we have a fundamental disagreement: Why do we have banks and what do they really do? Appleton: What’s to disagree? Ask anybody and they’ll say that banks are there to borrow and lend money. Moderator: That’s obvious, but it hardly settles the issue, does it, Alex? After all, borrowing and lending are not services in themselves, but rather the visible outcomes of banks’ production of financial services. The question is: What are these less transparent financial services that banks and other financial intermediaries produce? You say that the services are purely transactional, while Beth claims they are much more.   
2. Discuss what is meant by brokerage and asset transformation. What factors determine the value of brokerage services?   
3. List five distinct types of financial intermediaries, explain what they do, and provide a comparison/contrast of the basic intermediation services they provide.   
4. Find information on capital-to-total-assets ratios for several nonfinancial firms and compare them to those for financial firms. Why the differences?   
5. From the information in Table 2.6  what can you conclude about the risk in holding a representative bank’s equity compared to that in holding equity in a diversified market portfolio?  

# APPENDIX 2.1 MEASUREMENT DISTORTIONS AND THE BALANCE SHEET  

The balance sheet perspective on financial intermediation provided in the Introduction is suggestive but stylized and therefore incomplete.  

The balance sheet, for banks as well as other entities, is an accounting statement that states the values of the firm’s cash flows as of some specified date. In principle, the listing of assets is exhaustive and if the valuations are done properly, the remainder or net assets constitutes a sensible (unbiased) estimate of the firm’s capital or net worth. However, in practice, assets are occasionally omitted (arbitrarily valued at zero), while others are improperly valued. Indeed, the principles of valuation vary across categories of assets, so that the net worth is often difficult, if not impossible, to interpret.  

For example, if reputational capital is purchased, it is carried on the balance sheet at its depreciated purchase price. Called “goodwill,” this asset is usually written off according to some arbitrary schedule chosen by auditors and/or other interested parties such as governmental regulatory agents. If, on the other hand, the firm chooses to develop a reputation, as opposed to purchasing an existing one, generally accepted accounting principles will accord the reputational capital zero value. Accountants defend this inconsistent treatment with reference to their “conservatism.” However, from an economist’s viewpoint, the practice distorts or biases balance sheets. Moreover, in a world of costly capital and information, the incentive to develop reputation is weakened by the asymmetric accounting treatment.  

Now consider earning assets such as loans and securities. The accounting convention is that assets held for “trading” purposes must be marked to market, whereas those assets held for “investment” may be carried at adjusted historical cost. If the latter assets perform unexceptionally, the assets often are carried at original cost.29 Moreover, there is no unambiguous basis for distinguishing between trading and investment motives, so the auditors exercise their discretion. This notion of valuing assets at cost seems bizarre to those naïve enough to think of the balance sheet as a description of the firm’s financial condition, but many of the investment assets are not traded in active markets and it is therefore difficult to value them at arbitrary points in time, like December 31 and June 30. This is a systemic rather than an aberrant problem, in the sense that the raison d’etre of banks is to serve as repositories for those assets without active secondary markets. This is how the bank produces liquidity! But accurate point estimates of the values of such assets are inherently difficult to come by and auditors are understandably loath to oblige, given the litigious inclinations of their disparate clienteles.  

The issue of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) versus current (or market) value accounting has been at the forefront of the ongoing debate. However, it is difficult to know what current value accounting would mean in markets with wide bid-ask spreads. Forced to do current value accounting, the auditors might insist on interval rather than point estimates, or perhaps refuse to certify the accuracy of their estimates. Would the market then be better informed? Would managers display less pathological behavior? Perhaps! Noisy, unbiased estimates may well be superior to less noisy, but biased alternatives.  

The valuation problem, it should be noted, expresses itself on both sides of the balance sheet. Core deposits, for example, are treated as investment rather than trading assets, and they are carried at par, cost, or redemption value. Thus a dollar of deposits is invariably a dollar of liability. Note, however, that when banks are sold, their deposits typically command a premium. The buyer is willing to pay (typically between 1 and $6\%$ ) for the deposits. Why? Because deposits are inexpensive as a source of funding. They embody subsidy or “rent” deriving from underpriced deposit insurance and restricted entry into banking. But then, should not the valuation of deposits reflect these rents or subsidies? Does not the failure to account for them overstate the bank’s liabilities and understate its net worth? This dubious accounting practice may overstate the stability of the F.I.s net worth. This distortion gave rise to much of the “hidden” capital in banking, thought to be so important in reducing banks’ appetites for risk taking.  

In any case, the bank balance sheet reflects a complex mix of disparate valuation practices that confound the best efforts at interpretation. Some argue that current value accounting would do the community a disservice by adding volatility to reported financial results. The counterargument is that GAAP data knowingly mislead and compromise the integrity of the system that produces such data.
