# The Nature and Variety of Financial Intermediation  

“Don’t it always seem to go that you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone?”  

Joni Mitchell  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Euro: Common currency adopted by many member countries of the European Union.  

Yield curve: Relationship between yield to maturity and maturity on debt instruments identical in all respects except maturities (see Chapter 4). Duration: A measure of how long an investor must wait to receive payment on a bond. For bonds that repay only principal (zero coupon bonds), duration equals maturity. For coupon-paying bonds, duration is always shorter than maturity.  

Spot rate: The current yield to maturity on a bond of a given maturity.  

Liquidity premium: The amount by which the yield on a bond must be grossed up to compensate investors for their inability to convert the bond into cash at a moment’s notice and without loss relative to the bond’s true value.  

Consumer loans: Loans made to individuals and families. These are primarily installment loans.  

Commercial loans: Loans made to corporations. Often referred to as Commercial and Industrial (C&I) loan  

Contingent claims: Claims that may be made in the future, contingent on the realizations of some states.  

Federal funds: Funds in the interbank loan market. When a bank “sells” federal funds, it is lending (usually on an overnight basis) to another bank an amount that covers a part or all of that bank’s shortfall in reserves; banks are required to keep a certain fraction of their deposits as liquid reserves.  

rplus: Proceeds from the sale of equity and securities in excess of their par value, plus retained earnings.  

Cash and due: Coin and currency in the bank’s vaults, reserves on deposit with the Federal Reserve and with other banks, and checks deposited by customers on which funds have not yet been collected from the paying bank.  

Allowance for loan losses: An allowance made to absorb anticipated (expected) future loan losses. An allowance for loan losses is a charg against current income and it increases the bank’s loan loss reserve. Writeoffs of existing loans reduce the bank’s loan loss reserve.  

Undivided profits and reserves: Part of the bank’s net worth.  

Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act: The 1999 act that dismantled the Glass–Steagall Act restrictions separating commercial and investment banking.  

# INTRODUCTION  

This chapter focuses on the variety of services provided by financial intermediaries (FIs). Banks are members of an expansive industry that provides a dazzling variety of financial services. The broader financial services industry includes institutions as different as commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, all of which finance their assets with deposits, and government agencies, credit-rating agencies, pension funds, loan sharks, pawnbrokers, lotteries, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and private-equity pools. To this list we could add organized exchanges for trading stocks, futures, options, bonds and commodities, parimutuel betting institutions, credit-rating agencies, and the list can be extended almost effortlessly. Broadly speaking, these institutions can be classified into two groups: depository financial institutions and nondepository financial institutions. The former include institutions that finance themselves largely with deposits, whereas the latter fund themselves in the capital market. A subset of these nondepository institutions have come to be known as the “shadow banking system.”  

What all these financial institutions have in common is the processing of risk and its subtle complement, information. FIs produce information for two kinds of applications: (i) to match transactors like a marriage broker would, and (ii) to manage risks and transform the nature of claims as when a bank produces credit information to control a borrower’s credit risk. In producing information for application (i), the intermediary acts as a broker, whereas in producing information for application (ii), it acts as a qualitative asset transformer.
