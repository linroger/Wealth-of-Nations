# Contemporary Financial Intermediation Notes

## INTRODUCTION
- Financial markets and financial service firms channel money from savers to those with investment ideas,  helping individuals and businesses raise capital
- The more well-developed the financial system,  the lower the transaction costs and obstacles to investment and economic growth
- The financial system contributes to economic growth through three key channels:
	- Increases trade and the flow of goods and services
	- Increases the rate of physical capital accumulation
	- Increases the efficiency of combining capital and labor in production

## KEY SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
- Facilitates Trade
	- Financial systems help move money from one party to another,  often across national boundaries
	- Without appropriate hubs and spokes for recording and clearing multilateral financial transactions,  companies would be greatly impeded in their ability to do business with each other
- Facilitates Risk Management
	- Financial systems help individuals and businesses improve their management of various risks
	- An increase in risk reduces investment
	- A financial system prices risk and provides mechanisms for pooling,  ameliorating,  and trading risk
	- By facilitating improved risk management for both borrowers and savers,  the financial system spurs long-run investments that fuel economic growth
- Mobilizes Resources
	- The financial system mobilizes resources that permit the development of better technologies leading to economic growth
	- As described by Walter Bagehot,  in the past,  lack of transferable money and funds to borrow from made it difficult to collect capital for immense works
- Obtains and Processes Information and Allocates Capital
	- Individual savers may not have the resources or expertise to evaluate firms,  projects,  and managers before deciding to invest
	- Financial intermediaries have a cost and expertise advantage in collecting and processing such information,  helping the capital-allocation process
	- This encourages investors to supply capital to intermediaries,  which channel it to businesses that make investments fueling economic growth
	- Banks screen and monitor lenders before providing financing,  giving depositors confidence to deposit money that can be used for loans

## DEBT VERSUS EQUITY FINANCING
- Financial contracts for raising capital can be broadly divided into equity and debt
- Equity Contracts
	- Business sells an ownership stake to investors to raise capital
	- Return to investment depends on profitability of the business
	- No stated maturity; initial investment recouped only by selling ownership stake
- Debt Contracts
	- Similar to a bank loan - lender is promised repayment of original loan amount plus interest
	- Has a stated maturity and priority over equity
	- Debt holders must be fully repaid before shareholders

### INDIVIDUAL/CONSUMER FINANCING
- Consumers finance primarily with debt contracts (bank loans,  home mortgages,  credit card borrowing)
- Credit card financing is unsecured debt,  used for transaction financing,  with high interest rates and fees
	- Viability rests on a well-developed financial system where banks can securitize credit card receivables
	- Volume declines as financial systems become less developed
- Banks and nonbank loans (from government entities,  finance companies,  credit unions,  etc.) are a significant portion of financing available to individuals
- Home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against price appreciation in their homes

### BUSINESS FINANCING
- Businesses finance with both debt and equity

#### EQUITY FINANCING
- Employee Ownership
	- Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) allow employees to become shareholders
	- Can increase employee pride,  security,  and productivity
- Retained Earnings
	- Vital source of internal equity financing
	- Portion of profit left over after expenses,  debt claims,  taxes,  and dividends are paid
	- Viewed as a "sacrifice" by shareholders who forgo some dividends to build firm's equity
	- Companies generally retain 30-80% of after-tax profit annually
- Angel Financing
	- Provides critical early-stage funds to companies yet to establish track record to attract institutional financing
	- Can cost entrepreneur 10-50% ownership plus monthly management fees
- Financing from Customers,  Suppliers,  and Sales Representatives
	- Provided based on belief in growth potential and future profitability of the business
- Corporate Parents
	- Holding company may provide subsidiary with capital to avoid cost of raising external capital

#### DEBT FINANCING
- Commercial Banks
	- Traditionally important source of debt financing
- Institutional Lenders
	- Commercial finance companies and insurance companies are major sources of long-term (10+ years) debt financing
- Factoring of Accounts Receivables
	- Accounts receivables generated when a business makes credit sales can be factored
- Accounts Payable
	- Financing provided by a firm's suppliers
- U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)
	- Offers long-term loans for purchasing fixed assets,  typically requiring personal guarantees from investors with >5% stake

## FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING AND THE GOLDSMITH ANECDOTE
- Fractional reserve banks fund themselves with liabilities convertible to cash on demand but hold only a fraction in cash assets
	- Always some probability that withdrawals exceed available cash
- Evolution from Primitive Goldsmith to Bank
	- Goldsmith provided secure gold storage for a fee,  issuing warehouse receipts redeemable for the gold
	- Over time,  trade was conducted by exchanging receipts,  with gold remaining in the vault
	- Goldsmith realized not necessary to have a unit of gold for each outstanding receipt
	- Issued extra receipts loaned to borrowers to earn interest
- Instability of the Fractional Reserve Bank
	- Issuing extra receipts creates potential for insolvency if too many receipt holders demand gold
	- Probability of insolvency is endogenous,  chosen by the goldsmith based on how many extra receipts are issued
	- Each extra receipt increases income but also the probability of insolvency
- Regulation as a Stabilizing Influence
	- Fractional reserve banking system subject to periodic collapse if left unregulated
	- Central bank acting as lender of last resort can lend against collateral of goldsmith's otherwise illiquid loans during extraordinary redemptions
	- Introduces moral hazard - goldsmith will make more loans knowing central bank backstop exists
	- Moral hazard typically addressed by imposing cash asset reserve requirements limiting lending volume based on cash assets
	- Regulation is endogenous,  responsive to moral hazard from central bank backstop,  which responds to inherent vulnerability of fractional reserve banking
- Banks solve two types of moral hazard problems:
	- "Social" moral hazard problem of theft by helping cope more efficiently
	- Moral hazard in lending by screening and monitoring borrowers

## LARGE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
- Theoretical research suggests financial intermediaries (FIs) should be infinitely large ("natural monopoly") based on diversification benefits,  assuming no internal incentive or coordination problems
- Brokerage as a Natural Monopoly
	- Information producer's customers concerned with information reliability
	- Costly to ensure reliable information from a single producer
	- Less costly with a team of producers who benefit each other and can monitor for free riding
	- As team grows,  more independent payoffs pooled and divided,  reducing compensation risk via diversification
	- Risk-averse producers demand less expected compensation,  benefiting information buyers
	- Benefit keeps growing with intermediary size
	- When information is cross-sectionally reusable,  larger intermediaries benefit more from reusing at a single acquisition cost
	- Implication: investment banks,  financial newsletters,  credit rating agencies,  etc. benefit from growing large
	- Caveat: requires individual members to monitor and trust each other to avoid free rider problems as size grows
- Asset Transformation as a Natural Monopoly
	- Banks borrow from depositors and make loans
	- Advantage in size comes from:
		 - - 1. Conserving screening resources by performing credit analysis once vs. multiple depositors screening individually
		 - 2. Reducing risk to risk-averse depositors via diversification across many borrowers,  lowering deposit interest rates
	- Diversification benefit keeps growing with size,  making banks natural monopolies

## HOW BANKS CAN HELP MAKE NONBANK FINANCIAL CONTRACTING MORE EFFICIENT
- Banks lower the cost of capital exchange between other parties,  not just capital flowing through them
- Inside Debt vs. Outside Debt
	- Inside debt: creditor has access to non-public borrower information,  may participate in borrower's decisions (e.g. board representation)
	- Outside debt: publicly traded debt where creditor relies on public borrower information (e.g. [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  [[Class Notes 2 – Corporate Bond Contracts|Corporate Bonds]])
- Bank Loan Advantages
	- Short maturities require periodic renewal accompanied by bank evaluation of borrower's ability to meet obligations
	- Loan renewal sends credible,  positive signal to borrower's other creditors,  reducing their need to expend resources duplicating bank's evaluation
	- Ongoing depositor history gives bank information to assess and monitor loans at lower cost than competing lenders
	- Helps reduce duplicated screening by multiple creditors

## OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF DEPOSITORY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
- Depository institutions have two ownership forms: stocks and mutuals
- Agency theory predicts ownership form significantly affects firm incentives and operating efficiency
- Mutual vs. Stock Ownership
	- Mutual residual claimants are customers (policyholders,  depositors)
	- Stock S&L owned by stockholders; mutual S&L owned by depositors (and possibly borrowers)
	- Stock S&L can raise capital by selling common stock; mutual S&L cannot
	- Stock S&L shareholders have well-defined ownership rights:
		- - - 1. Claim to residual profits
		 - 2. Right to vote for board and change control
		 - 3. Right to dissolve the organization
	- Mutual S&L depositor ownership rights much weaker:
		- More like creditors; can't force payment above promised interest and principal
		- Ownership claims to current earnings non-transferable; earnings can be retained indefinitely as net worth
		- Limited voting rights,  often signed over to management
		- Little incentive to withdraw deposits and partially liquidate due to deposit insurance and interest rate ceilings
	- Important to distinguish de jure (legal) and de facto (control) ownership in a mutual
		- De jure ownership rests with customers but is largely vacuous
		- De facto ownership rests with managers and government (via deposit insurance)
- Agency problems exist in both stock and mutual S&Ls due to manager-owner goal misalignment
	- But the two types differ in owners' ability to monitor managers
	- Stockholders have greater control via consolidating control by purchasing stock

## CHOICE OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE BY S&LS
- Earlier studies viewed mutual S&Ls as either:
	- Cooperatives,  with depositors and borrowers working for a common goal
	- Benevolent associations organized to encourage saving and home ownership
- Early community-based cooperatives had simple operations
	- Gathered deposits from the community
	- Offered mortgages to community members
	- Fair degree of homogeneity in mortgages made it easy to assess asset value based on historical data
- Simplicity of S&L operations made mutuality an acceptable ownership structure
- Eliminating classic conflict between creditors (prefer less risk) and stockholders (prefer more) made mutuality the preferred structure for many S&Ls
- Simplicity of S&L operations meant managerial expertise was not critical for success
	- Early years,  S&L industry dominated by mutuals run by less talented/efficient managers
- Two key differences between stock and mutual S&Ls:
	 - 1. Stock S&L owned by stockholders; mutual S&L owned by depositors (and possibly borrowers)
	1. Stock S&L can raise capital by selling common stock; mutual S&L cannot
- Advent of deposit insurance eliminated agency-cost-of-debt advantage of mutuals over stocks
	- With insured deposits,  depositors indifferent to S&L's risk-taking
	- Agency cost of debt absorbed by Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
- Deregulation and increased competition made it difficult for mutual S&L managers to compete with more efficient stockholder-owned counterparts
- Inability to augment net worth through equity issues worsened competitive disadvantage for mutuals
- Benefits of mutuality to owners diminished significantly
- Increased competitive pressures raised probability of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] and unemployment for inefficient mutual managers
	- Made any given level of perquisite consumption more costly for managers
	- Benefits of mutuality to managers diminished as well
- Positive incentive for managers to convert to stock ownership,  as they usually benefit in initial stock sale
	- Managers typically receive rights to purchase underpriced new stock (as in IPOs)
	- When benefits of conversion outweigh benefits of new optimal (lower) perquisite consumption,  expect S&L to convert from mutual to stock
- Could explain increased number of conversions in recent years as stockholder-ownership became preferred for both owners and managers

## OBSERVATIONS ON MUTUALS (COOPERATIVE BANKS) IN EUROPE
- In several European countries (France,  Netherlands,  Germany),  cooperative banks play an important role
	- Often part of the largest segment of the financial services industry
- Often "layered" cooperatives consisting of multiple local (member) cooperatives that "own" the central cooperative
	- e.g. RABO Bank in Netherlands,  Credit Agricole in France (latter even has a third layer)
- Central cooperative may include professional services,  common treasury operation,  back-office facilities that facilitate economies of scale
- Model may provide:
	- Strong roots in local markets via local cooperatives,  facilitating relationship banking
	- Scale and matching of funding across cooperatives

## THE BORROWER'S CHOICE OF FINANCE SOURCE
- When a firm is very young,  it has two striking characteristics:
	 - 1. Entrepreneur may be unsure of own management expertise,  so approaching a financial intermediary that can provide this expertise is beneficial
	1. Borrower has few tangible assets to offer as collateral
		- Collateral useful in controlling moral hazard where borrowers stint on effort or take excessive risks
		- Without collateral,  lender could use equity participation to address moral hazard
		- In borrower's interest to seek a lender who can take an equity position and offer capital at a "reasonable" price
- Both factors suggest such firms should go to venture capitalists
- As firm grows and acquires tangible assets:
	- Becomes capable of offering collateral to mitigate moral hazard
	- Banks,  prohibited in U.S. from taking equity positions,  can now lend to such borrowers by securing debt with collateral
- Collateral will not eliminate all moral hazard,  so bank monitoring still important
	- Bank loans tend to be short maturity,  generating periodic information through reassessments of borrower
	- Information reflected in bank's decision to renew/terminate loan and new contract terms offered,  combined with information from rating agencies
	- Helps reduce duplication in information production by other creditors,  diminishing overall contracting costs
- Firms in this group find it better to go to banks than venture capitalists because:
	- Banks can fund loans with insured deposits; venture capitalists cannot
	- Borrower able to obtain loan at lower price
- When firm is well-established and mature:
	- Has good track record for repaying debts
	- Reputation valuable,  permits borrowing at preferential rates
	- By taking undue asset risks,  borrower stands to lose reputation,  incentivizing limiting risk-taking
	- Bank monitoring to combat moral hazard less important
	- Permits directly accessing capital market where borrowing costs lower
		- Avoids paying bank its intermediation rents
	- Still faces asymmetric information problems
		- Nondepository financial intermediaries like investment banks or credit-rating agencies play important role in transferring capital from investors to firms
		- Make information about firms available to investors at lower cost than investors could acquire themselves
- Venture capitalist provides financing,  monitoring,  management expertise; bank provides financing and monitoring; capital market provides mainly financing

## THE ROLE OF CAPITAL IN BANK FINANCING
- Two facts about bank monitoring of borrowers:
	 - 1. Monitoring is costly,  so banks need incentives to do it
	1. Limits to effectiveness of bank monitoring,  so there should be innate incentives for borrowers to make prudent decisions
		- Not all burden for ensuring prudent behavior should fall on bank monitoring
- Benefit of bank monitoring is increasing likelihood of borrower repaying loan (reducing probability of default)
	- Given monitoring cost,  this benefit needs to be large enough to overcome the cost
	- Since borrower default creates loan loss absorbed by bank's equity capital,  the higher this capital,  the larger the benefit of monitoring to the bank
- Similarly,  borrowers have stronger incentives to make value-maximizing decisions when they have more equity capital
- Example:
	- Borrower can choose one of three mutually exclusive projects:
		- Good project (G) that maximizes firm value
		- Bad project (B1) with negative NPV but some private benefits b for borrower
		- Another bad project (B2) with negative NPV but even bigger private benefits B-b for borrower
	- Bank monitoring can eliminate borrower's ability to choose B2 but not B1
	- b-0 large enough that borrower would prefer B1 to G if project entirely financed with bank loan and borrower had no equity at stake
	- If borrower required to invest sufficient equity,  would prefer G over B1
	- Bank will not lend unless borrower puts up enough equity
- Theory implications:
	 - 1. If borrowers lack enough equity capital,  they may be rationed
		- Having enough pledgeable collateral ameliorates this
		- Rationing arises from combined shortage of collateral and capital
	1. Banks lend less when they have less capital
		- Insufficiently capitalized banks will not do costly monitoring
		- Lending limited to borrowers not needing monitoring
	1. Enough bank capital enhances borrower's ability to obtain financing from other sources
		- Other financiers assured bank monitoring will result in borrower making right investment decisions
	1. When borrowers have so much capital they would prefer G to B1 or B2 even without monitoring,  bank lending diminishes in importance
		- Borrowers can directly access capital market or other unmonitored finance sources
		- Bank lending maximized at intermediate levels of firm (borrower) capital

## BLURRING DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN BANK LOANS AND CAPITAL MARKET FINANCING: TRANSACTION AND RELATIONSHIP LOANS
- Banks make [[Moody's Syndicated Bank Loans 2006 Default Review and 2007 Outlook|Syndicated Loans]] with multiple participating banks,  often traded similar to capital market trading
- Banks make mortgage and credit card loans,  package them into portfolios,  issue securities against portfolios,  sell securities in capital market where they are traded

## BANK RISKS
- Risk is fundamental to banking,  central to the "core competence" that enables a business to earn enhanced returns serving its clientele
	- Without this edge,  service becomes commoditized by competitors bidding down prices until profit vanishes
- Core competence imparts advantage in managing a risk inherent in producing a particular service or economic good
	- These are core risks corresponding to core competencies
- In business context,  risk is the distillate of randomness in the process generating earnings
	- May be mitigated through applying producer's core competencies - risk voluntarily accepted,  even sought,  as a business decision ("businessman's risk")
	- May be unavoidable,  as in force majeure or "act of god" - only protection may be insurance,  if available,  or leaving the industry
- Core risks accompanied by ancillary risks - all other risks arising in the business for which the firm has no special processing skills
	- Require management nonetheless to avoid being destructive
	- Shifted to others through capital/insurance markets,  modifying operations,  in extremis avoiding lines of business
	- Not all ancillary risk avoidable while remaining in a particular business
	- Residual ancillary risk remains,  protected against with equity
	- One firm's ancillary risk likely another's core risk,  enabling trade in risks permitting mitigation,  enhanced production and welfare
- Risk central to financial intermediaries - clients see them as fundamentally providing risk-abatement services
	- Asked to provide credit,  liquidity,  interest rate certainty,  various types of insurance alleviating risks for customers
- Special financial risks define categories of intermediaries:
	- Credit risk the sine qua non of commercial banking
	- Mortality risk defines life insurers
	- Market (price) risk the core competency of investment banking
	- Property risk the bailiwick of casualty insurers
- Liquidity provided by any financial institution absorbing more illiquid claims than it emits
	- Bank deposits withdrawable on demand yet invested in illiquid loans
	- Liquidity fleeting,  often guaranteed explicitly or tacitly by central banks controlling money supply
	- When facing excess withdrawals,  banks can borrow from central banks

## BASIC BANKING RISKS
- A bank's shareholders bear risk when the firm's "assets" differ in some economically relevant way from its "liabilities"
	- Liabilities are present value of commitments to make payments
	- Assets are present value of expected receipts
	- Amount and timing of both positive and negative payments uncertain
	- Net of the two gives rise to risk
	- Mismatches imply risks
- Qualitative asset transformation involves mismatching the two sides of the balance sheet,  creating particular forms of risk
- Three principal mismatches for banks:
	 - 1. Assets usually involve greater credit risk than liabilities
		- Bank's claim against borrower more likely to default than depositor's claim against bank
	1. Assets usually of longer duration than liabilities
		- e.g. 1-year maturity loan vs. demand deposits withdrawable on demand (negligible maturity)
		- Creates interest rate risk
	1. Liabilities usually more liquid than assets
		- Depositor able to withdraw funds at will
		- Bank cannot call a performing loan at will; loan unlikely to trade in active secondary market
		- Creates liquidity risk

## CREDIT,  INTEREST RATE,  AND LIQUIDITY RISKS

### DEFAULT,  CREDIT,  OR COUNTERPARTY RISK
- Risk that a party to whom you lend fails to fully discharge loan contract terms
	- For a bank,  risk that borrower fails to deliver contractual payments on timely basis
- Banks can avoid credit risk by purchasing assets with little/no default risk (government securities,  triple-A rated debt)
	- Provides very little return over bank's cost of borrowing; with other intermediation costs,  profit may be negative
	- Certainty achieved at cost of losses
- Banks choose assets with nontrivial default risk,  exploiting special ability (core competency) to mitigate default risk by resolving moral hazard and other informational problems
- Cash flow variations arise from physical and moral hazards
	- Banks screen borrowers to assess lending risk ex ante via analysis of financial statements and other relevant information (similar to bond rating agency)
	- Bank monitoring designed to control moral hazard occurring after loan made
		- Borrower likely has incentive and opportunity to take actions increasing bank's risk exposure
		- Restrictive [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] included in loan contracts
		- Bank monitoring of borrower covenant compliance required
- Efficiency of bank's basic functions key to determining its own credit risk
- Bank can further control default risk by holding many loans with imperfectly correlated prospects and diversifying
	- Bank's assessment,  monitoring,  contract design skills usually somewhat specialized
	- Leads to diversification within limited set of industries

### INTEREST RATE RISK
- When a firm's assets and liabilities are traded,  they are subject to revaluation by the market
	- Any revaluation due to changes in level or structure of interest rates is interest rate risk
- Another aspect arises from loan prepayment uncertainty
	- Duration of loan can be shortened at borrower's discretion through premature repayment or loan contract term violation (loan automatically "accelerates")
	- If market rates drop,  borrower likely to exercise refinancing option - loan prepaid and new one issued
	- Prepayment makes expected duration shorter than maturity and transforms duration (im)balance into random variable

### LIQUIDITY RISK
- Risk that an asset owner is unable to realize its full value at the time a sale is desired
- In banking:
	- Borrower's liquidity risk is that lender may choose not to renew a loan borrower wishes to renew
	- Bank's liquidity risk is that depositors may unexpectedly withdraw deposits and bank may be unable to replace them without impairing net worth
- Applies symmetrically to borrowers in relationship to banks and banks in relationship to depositors (depositors are lenders to their bank)
- More than just withdrawal risk - refers to potential loss seller incurs because selling price falls below fundamental asset value
- Most extreme manifestation is asset owner simply unable to sell at any positive price (market failure)
	- In credit markets,  known as credit rationing - borrower refused credit regardless of price
- More primitive,  less active markets typically characterized by large [[Class Note 9 Bid and Ask Prices With Private Information|bid-ask spreads]] (difference between price to buy and simultaneously sell an asset)
	- e.g. Treasury bill buy at ask of $98.50,     sell at bid of $98.25 - [[Class Note 9 Bid and Ask Prices With Private Information|bid-ask spread]] is $0.25
	- Range from small fractions of a percent for actively traded assets to 6-7% for residential property
	- Time and effort required to capture full value of relatively illiquid asset
- Bank holding illiquid assets can find itself unable to redeem liabilities on short notice
	- Problem of managing balance sheet against this is liquidity or cash management (cash is the most liquid asset)
- Central bank provides other banks with crisis-avoiding liquidity by lending against illiquid but presumably sound earning assets
	- Designed to socialize a portion of bank's liquidity problem

## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

## THE TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES

### REVIEW OF FIXED-INCOME VALUATION
- Current value of a $250 riskless cash flow received in 1 year solved using principle of riskless arbitrage
	- In efficient capital market,  price of riskless cash flow in equilibrium must relate to prices of other riskless instruments
- Example:
	- U.S. government bond promising $100 in 1 year currently trading at $94.56
	- Implicit 1-year return on riskless instruments is 5.75% (since $94.56 [1 + 0.0575] = $100)
	- Should be currently willing to pay $250/[1.0575] = $236.41 for riskless promise of $250 in 1 year
- For a riskless cash flow promised 2 years from now:
	- Find a riskless instrument of similar 2-year maturity and payment characteristics (only promised payment 2 years from now,  no interim payments)
	- Example: U.S. government "pure-discount" 2-year bonds promising $100 currently trading at $88.58
	- Can deduce 2-year riskless yield io2 where $100 / [1 + io2]2 = $88.58
		- Solving implies annual two-period yield io2 = 6.25%
- Even though both year 1 and year 2 cash flows are riskless,  they have different discount rates
	- Reason is future one-period interest rates are expected to increase
- Example:
	- 1-year riskless rate at date 0 is 5.75%
	- 2-year riskless rate at date 0 is 6.25%
	- Can infer 1-year riskless interest rate i11 expected to prevail at future date 1
		- 221.45 = 250 / [1.0575][1 + i11]
		- Yields i11 = 6.75%
	- Two-period 6.25% rate is geometric average of successive one-period 5.75% and 6.75% rates

## THE ROLE OF CAPITAL IN BANK FINANCING [Understanding Bank CapitalA Primer — Money,  Banking and Financial Markets](Understanding%20Bank%20Capital-%20A%20Primer%20—%20Money,  %20Banking%20and%20Financial%20Markets.md)
- In reality,  banks earn profits,  especially on borrowers about whom they possess private credit information
	- To the extent banks charge higher rates to less capitalized borrowers,  they may also earn greater profit margins on these borrowers
	- Can make prospect of lending to highly leveraged (low equity) borrowers enticing despite higher risk
- Banks can add highly leveraged loans to portfolios by lending for:
	- [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts]] ([[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]])
	- Acquisitions
	- Recapitalizations
- Yields on highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) are higher than other commercial loans
	- Higher yields compensate for higher risks,  so not necessarily implying higher expected profits
	- But borrowers often have few alternative credit sources,  allowing banks to extract higher risk-adjusted profits
	- Banks usually receive fees of 1-2% of principal committed
- Reverse [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts]]: firms reduce debt/equity ratios by issuing equity to retire LBO debt

## COLLATERAL
- Most commercial and consumer lending is secured with collateral
	- Lender has first claim to collateral asset in event of default
- Two types of collateral:
	 - 1. Inside collateral: assets owned by firm receiving loan
		- e.g. accounts receivables,  equipment,  machinery,  real estate,  inventory
		- Even if loan unsecured,  bank would have claim (but not necessarily first claim) against these assets
		- As general creditor,  bank's claim value ill-defined since it might be one among many unsecured creditors at mercy of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] court
		- If one of these assets pledged as collateral,  bank becomes primary claimant to that asset
	1. Outside collateral: assets bank would never have claim to unless specifically designated as collateral
		- e.g. personal assets of owner of borrowing corporation or limited partnership
- Using collateral is not costless
	- Borrower may take actions undermining collateral value to bank,  requiring ongoing monitoring
	- When collateral transferred to bank upon default,  there are liquidation costs (legal costs of ownership transfer,  bank's costs of carrying and selling collateral)
	- From borrower's standpoint,  using collateral makes subsequent borrowing more expensive since fewer assets available to general creditors
- Three reasons for popularity of secured lending:
	 - 1. Risk Reduction
		- Provides lender greater protection against loss in event of default
		- U.S. bankruptcy code "automatic stay" freezes creditor collection actions during [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] proceedings to give debtor breathing room
		- Stay takes effect upon filing [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] petition
		- Can be modified for a creditor if there is "cause",  including insufficient protection of secured creditor's collateral interest
		- e.g. If collateral assets depreciating,  court might require firm to set aside that amount monthly to protect bank's claim
		- Securing a loan reduces creditor's [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] risk
	1. Signaling Instrument
		- Collateral can convey valuable information to bank
		- Within a class of equally risky borrowers to the bank,  a borrower's willingness to offer collateral inversely related to its loan default risk
		- Bank can induce borrower to reveal hidden risk by offering choice of secured loan with lower rate or unsecured loan with higher rate
		- Less risky borrower will prefer secured loan because:
			- Lower risk means higher likelihood of repaying interest,  so lower rate more appealing
			- Lower risk means lower chance of defaulting and losing collateral,  so offering collateral less onerous
		- Riskier borrower will prefer unsecured loan
		- Requires loan contracts offered to be incentive compatible
	1. Moral Hazard
		- Using collateral can help resolve moral hazard problems:
			 - 1. Asset Substitution
				- Due to option nature of bank loan,  borrower has incentive to choose riskier project after obtaining loan
				- Collateral can deter such risk-taking similar to capital
				- Inside collateral deters asset substitution by ensuring specific assets will not be replaced by riskier ones
				- Reduction in asset substitution possibilities reflected in better debt price,  advantage accrues to firm's shareholders
			1. Underinvestment
				- Borrower may be unwilling to invest additional funds in a project even if it increases total NPV
				- e.g. Real estate worth $1.5M,  mostly bank financed
					- Spending extra $1M would enhance value by $1.1M
					- But if PV of repayment to bank is $2M,     not worthwhile for owner despite positive NPV of $0.1M overall
					- Owner's NPV is -$0.4M ($1.5M + $1.1M - $2M = $0.6M increase in PV of cash flows,     but $1M cost)
					- Investment passed up,  firm value sacrificed
				- Arises from actions privately optimal for borrower's shareholders ex post,  but they pay price ex ante as lender anticipates and adjusts credit terms
				- Precommitment not to underinvest is time inconsistent - lender knows borrower has reason to break promise
				- Loan [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] forcing investment difficult as lender typically doesn't "see" opportunities unless borrower exploits them
				- Secured debt can resolve underinvestment
					- Firm needs financing to purchase asset below market value (positive NPV)
					- Has risky unsecured debt,  would not purchase asset as enhancement to shareholder PV less than price
					- Issuing debt secured by new asset diverts cash flows to new secured creditors away from old unsecured creditors
					- New secured creditors pay fair market value,  so gains from diversion accrue to shareholders,  increasing investment incentive
			1. Inadequate Effort Supply
				- Borrower may expend insufficient effort managing firm when assets highly leveraged
				- Collateral can help resolve this moral hazard
- Type and amount of collateral used depends on which problems are dominant
- Using collateral can be costly due to:
	- Repossession costs
	- Need to appraise collateral quality prior to loan and monitor regularly over loan life
		- Variations in collateral quality across borrowers may be large
		- e.g. Accounts receivable collateral higher quality if due from well-capitalized triple-A companies vs. weak credit risks
		- e.g. Contract receivables riskier with volatility in business cycles
- Costs must be traded off against potential benefits in deciding how to use collateral in lending

## CONDITIONS
- Economic conditions affecting borrower's repayment ability
- Borrower's income generation depends on:
	- Selling prices of its goods
	- Input costs
	- Competition
	- Quality of goods and services
	- Advertising effectiveness
	- Management quality

## SOURCES OF CREDIT INFORMATION
- Information used in underwriting credit is inherently costly and of uneven quality
- Banker's critical skill in credit is assembling most germane information at lowest cost without violating legal or social norms
- Standard credit sources classified as internal (within the bank) and external (all other)

### INTERNAL SOURCES
 - 1. Interview with Applicant
	- Establishes uses of borrowed funds and conformity with bank's loan policies
	- Judges [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangibles]]  related to borrower's future repayment behavior
	- Provides loan officer opportunity to advise applicant about additional financial information needed
1. Bank's Own Records
	- Bank maintains records of depositors and borrowers to assess past behavior
	- Shows payment performance on previous loans,  checking/savings account balances,  overdrawing patterns
	- Central file may contain information on applicants previously solicited as potential customers

### EXTERNAL SOURCES
 - 1. Borrower's Financial Statements
	- Required of most borrowers
	- Audited statements common in commercial lending
	- Even in consumer lending,  applicant normally asked to list assets,  income,  expenses,  outstanding debts
1. Credit Information Brokers
	- Information agencies/credit bureaus systematically collect and sell financial information on potential borrowers
	- Most widely known is Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)
		- Collects information on over 3 million U.S. and Canadian businesses
		- Business Information Report provides data on:
			- Type of business
			- Nature of ownership
			- Composite credit rating
			- Payment promptness
			- Sales
			- Net worth
			- Number of employees
			- General firm condition (physical facilities,  customer base)
			- Balance sheet information
			- Usual size of deposit balances
			- Payments record under loan agreements
			- Biographical information on principals
1. Other Banks
	- Banks sometimes check with other banks that have had relationships with the loan applicant
	- May also check with firm's suppliers to learn how firm pays bills
	- May check with firm's customers to determine product quality and service dependability

## ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- In evaluating borrower's loan servicing ability,  bank focuses on firm's internal sources for future funds generation:
	 - 1. Net income
	1. Depreciation
	1. Reduction of accounts receivables
	1. Reduction of inventories

### EVALUATION OF THE BALANCE SHEET

#### ASSETS
 - 1. Accounts Receivables
	- Among shortest maturity assets,  typically seen as major source of cash flows to service short-term loans
	- Standard analyses focus on sizes,  sources,  aging of accounts,  extent to which actively managed and diversified
	- Diversification lowers risk
	- Bank may investigate financial attributes of those owing money to borrower as they indicate receivables quality
1. Contract Receivables
	- Borrower may be contractor engaged for future task
	- Official recognition may appear in chattel paper showing monetary obligations of party for whom task performed
	- These monetary obligations are contract receivables,  often serving as collateral for working capital loan
	- Riskier than accounts receivables as payment conditional on borrower's future performance
	- Double moral hazard:
		 - 1. Borrower may not successfully complete contracted task
		1. Third party may not pay borrower even if task successfully completed
1. Inventory
	- Issues in evaluating inventories:
		- Age
		- Liquidity
		- Price stability
		- Obsolescence
		- Shrinkage
		- Adequacy of insurance coverage
		- Stage of processing
		- Firm's inventory accounting method
1. Fixed Assets
	- Banks normally do not consider fixed asset sale as a loan repayment source
	- Surplus fixed assets can be occasional strategic cash flow sources
	- Main importance is in producing cash flows,  not resale value
	- Business restructurings often generate surplus fixed assets whose sale can be value creating
1. Intangible Assets
	- Include trademarks,  patents,  copyrights,  [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#IFRS AND US GAAP RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|goodwill]]
	- Normally accorded little value by bank due to illiquidity and measurement errors
1. Amounts Due
	- Banks often take dim view of firm's management if assets include amounts due from officers and employees
	- Creates suspicion of internal fraud and nepotism

#### LIABILITIES AND NET WORTH
 - 1. Accounts Payable
	- Borrower's accounts payable should speak volumes to its bank
	- If borrower does not pay trade creditors timely,  bank should not expect to be treated differently
	- Bank should ascertain whether payables are in notes,  may indicate firm denied trade credit
	- Bank should be alarmed if borrower asked for cash-on-delivery (COD) terms by suppliers
	- If borrower owes money to own shareholders or officers,  bank should demand explanation,  may ask such liabilities be subordinated to bank loan
	- Bank should review amounts accrued for taxes and other expenses
1. Long-Term Liabilities
	- Consist of term loans,  debentures,  notes,  mortgage loans,  other liabilities with maturities over 1 year
	- Bank should be concerned with nature,  maturity of these obligations and provisions made for required payments
	- [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] may be important for bank considering loan request
	- Important to know if outstanding debt is secured and which assets already pledged as collateral
1. Net Worth
	- Importance of equity capital to credit analysis is transparent
	- But accounting net worth is treacherous,  fraught with measurement errors
	- Residual of independently evaluated assets and liabilities,  each with errors,  so compounds all underlying errors
	- If all assets and liabilities could be marked to market,  net worth should be economic value of equity claims
	- With accounting distortions and measurement errors,  can be hard-to-interpret residual
1. Contingent Liabilities
	- Important due to potential to become actual liabilities
	- If realized,  could seriously impair borrower's debt-servicing capability
	- Assessing relevant probabilities and exposures may require considerable information and sophistication
	- Do not always appear in body of borrower's balance sheet
	- Even when footnotes reveal exposure (maximum liability),  PV of liability also depends on unspecified contingencies and probabilities

### THE INCOME STATEMENT
- Income statement analysis complements balance sheet analysis
- Bankers emphasize balance sheet for short-term loans,  but devote greater attention to income statement for longer maturities
- Looking at past and present income statements,  bank should learn about stability of borrower's cash flows
	- In determining cash flow trends,  bank should note possible changes in borrower's accounting practices that can obfuscate
- Bank often uses both balance sheet and income statement in [[Week 1 Ratio Analysis + Valuation Review|ratio analysis]]
- Key financial ratios convey information about firm's liquidity,  stability,  profitability,  cash flow prospects
- Four basic types of ratios:
	 - 1. Liquidity
		- Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
			- "Current" means duration less than 1 year
		- Quick ratio (or acid test ratio) = (current assets - inventories) / current liabilities
	1. Activity (or Turnover)
		- Inventory turnover ratio = sales / inventory
		- Average collection period (in days) = receivables / sales per day
		- Total assets turnover = sales / total assets
		- [[Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio|Fixed Asset Turnover]] = sales / net fixed assets
	1. Profitability
		- Profit margin on sales = net profit after taxes / sales
		- Return on total assets = net profit after taxes / total assets
		- Return on net worth = net profit after taxes / net worth
	1. Financial Leverage
		- Leverage ratio = total debt / total assets
- Two most important [[Leverage Ratio|leverage ratios]] used by lenders:
	 - 1. Pretax interest coverage = net income from continuing operations before taxes / reported gross interest expense
	1. Total debt to EBITDA
		- EBITDA = earnings before interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization

## LOAN COVENANTS
- Special clauses designed to protect bank and prohibit borrower from taking actions that could adversely affect repayment likelihood
- By agreeing to [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] limiting its actions,  borrower precommits to eschewing strategies that might expropriate wealth from lender
	- Reduces moral hazard faced by lender
	- Improves loan agreement terms for borrower
	- Reduces agency costs of debt,  benefiting borrower ex ante and lender
	- Makes possible loans that would not otherwise be made
- Limit to how restrictive [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] borrower will accept
	- Can make loan safe for lender but may deprive borrower of valuable investment options and strategies
- [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] normally depend on:
	- Borrower's financial condition
	- Borrower's investment opportunities
	- Track record of borrower's management
	- Bank's lending philosophy
- Four kinds of covenants:
	 - 1. Affirmative covenants
	1. Restrictive clauses
	1. Negative covenants
	1. Default provisions

### AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS
- Obligations imposed on borrower
- Common examples:
	- Requirement to periodically furnish bank with financial statements
		- Permits bank to track borrower's financial condition and take preventive steps if trouble indicated
	- Requirement to maintain minimum level of working capital
	- Requirement to maintain management acceptable to bank
		- If management changes due to resignation,  death,  etc.,  bank must approve replacement

### RESTRICTIVE CLAUSES
- Designed to impose limits on borrower's actions
- Common examples:
	- Limit on amount of dividends borrower can pay shareholders
		- Major creditor concern is borrower's inclination to divert liquidity and net worth to shareholders rather than keep in firm to protect creditors
	- Restrictions on salaries,  bonuses,  advances to firm's employees
	- Limits on specific types of investments like fixed asset purchases
		- Protects creditors against asset substitutions that may reduce firm's debt value
		- Purchasing fixed asset may replace cash on balance sheet with asset producing risky cash flows,  increasing creditor risk exposure

### NEGATIVE COVENANTS
- Prohibit certain actions outright,  absent bank's consent
- Common examples:
	- Negative pledge clause,  usually in unsecured loans
		- Prohibits borrower from pledging assets as security to other lenders
		- Also encountered in secured loans
			- If borrower defaults,  collateral value may be substantially diminished
			- For portion of bank's claim exceeding collateral value,  bank has same status as general unsecured creditor under [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] law

### NEGATIVE [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] (CONTINUED)
- Fewer assets pledged for other loans means greater share available to bank in event of bankruptcy
- Prohibitions regarding mergers,  consolidations,  sales of assets
	- These developments can alter firm's risk profile,  possibly to creditor's detriment
- Prohibitions on borrowers making loans to others or guaranteeing others' debts or performances
	- Borrower would assume additional credit risk on its account
	- Bank protects own claim by prohibiting such actions

### DEFAULT PROVISIONS
- Intended to make entire loan immediately due and payable under certain conditions
- Violation of covenant need not automatically empower bank to call loan as long as scheduled payments made
- Some [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] include acceleration clause specifying events of default
	- Violation leading to event of default automatically places loan in default,  full payment due immediately
	- Permits bank to take more timely actions than waiting for missed payment
- Acceleration clauses often triggered by:
	- Failure to make timely payments
	- Inaccuracy in representations and warranties
	- Violation of covenants
	- Bankruptcy,  liquidation,  appointment of receiver
	- Entry of judgment exceeding specified amount
	- Impairment of collateral,  invalidity of guarantee or security agreement
	- Failure to pay other indebtedness when due or perform under related agreements
	- Cross default
	- Cross acceleration
	- Change of management or ownership
	- Expropriation of assets
- Any of above may be considered event of default
	- Loan accelerated,  leading to renegotiation or default
- Loan agreement may provide borrower cure or grace period to correct default
	- If cured,  bank required to continue loan
	- If not cured,  bank may terminate lending relationship
- Bank may set off borrower's deposits against loan repayment obligation and foreclose on collateral,  even force borrower into receivership
- Cross-default provision gives bank right to declare default when borrower defaults on another obligation
- Though banks rarely exercise right to accelerate repayment,  having right substantially strengthens lender's position

### OTHER PARAMETERS OF THE LOAN AGREEMENT
- Loan agreements have many provisions beyond amount and price that must be negotiated
- Some important parameters:
	- Take-down schedule: timetable for withdrawing funds from bank
	- Installment schedule: timetable for repaying interest,  other charges,  principal
	- Compensating balance requirement: borrower's obligation to maintain deposits at lending bank (usually stated in terms of average deposit balance but may include minima)
	- Prepayment provision: possible penalty for repaying loan earlier than required

# CHAPTER 8: FURTHER ISSUES IN BANK LENDING

## LOAN PRICING AND PROFIT MARGINS: GENERAL REMARKS

### ASSESSING PROFIT MARGINS
- To assess loan profit margin,  bank should determine income sources from lending:
	 - 1. Interest on loan
	1. Noninterest fee income on loan
		- Closing fees for concluding loan agreement
		- Loan-servicing fees
		- Commitment fees for making credit lines or loan commitments available
	1. Income from fees for services borrower purchases due to lending relationship
		- Cash-management services
		- Trust services
		- If service purchase linked to taking loan,  net profit from service sales should be attributed to loan
- After assessing loan income,  bank should compute expenses to generate that income
	- Processing costs
	- Salaries
	- Postage
	- Advertising and marketing expenses
	- Occupancy expenses
	- Other loan-servicing costs
- Bank should compute costs of funding loan
	- Cost of demand and time deposit and nondeposit funds supporting loan
	- Costs of servicing deposits

### BENCHMARK OR REFERENCE LENDING RATES
- In practice,  banks set loan interest rates by relating them to a benchmark or reference rate
- Commonly used reference rate is prime interest rate
	- Traditionally,  rate posted by bank for short and intermediate maturity loans for most creditworthy ("blue-chip") customers
	- Nowadays,  most creditworthy customers pay less than prime
	- Prime is administered rate loosely linked to market rates,  tends to be more sluggish
- Each bank sets own prime rate,  but behavior of competing institutions is major influence
- Three major categories of market rates provide principal inputs in prime rate setting:
	 - 1. Rates on nonloan bank assets
	1. Rates on bank-acquired liabilities
	1. Rates on corporate debt claims that are close substitutes for bank loans
- Term structure of rates,  bankers' expectations of future rates,  expected deposit growth,  expected loan rate growth also important in setting prime

### COMPENSATING BALANCES
- Increased banking competition has reduced use of "compensating balances"
- Some banks still require minimum average deposit balances as partial compensation for loans and other services
- Bank's compensation results from not paying interest (or paying below-market interest) on compensating balances
- Frequently used with loan commitments or lines of credit
- Can be viewed as raising effective loan rate
- Usually stated as percentages of credit line amounts
- Many arrangements require additional balances when credit lines activated or used
- Nominal loan rates quoted in terms of loan principal
- If borrower must use part of loan to meet compensating balance requirements,  effective rate on funds available for borrower's use exceeds stated rate
	- Borrower paying loan interest on funds committed to remain in deposit account
- Bank can increase effective rates by increasing compensating balance requirements and leaving prime rate unchanged
	- Given prime rate affects bank's entire lending rate schedule,  bank may respond to market rate changes by leaving prime unchanged but changing nonprice terms (maturities,  collateral requirements,  compensating balance requirements) to selectively alter effective rates

### THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LENDING PROFIT AND DEFAULT RISK
- High-risk borrower has riskier projects than low-risk borrower
	- Bank's breakeven rate on high-risk borrowers is higher
	- High-risk borrowers must be charged relatively high rate even before considering bank's profit margin
	- Because repayment probability is lower,  high-risk borrowers must be charged higher nominal premium over breakeven rate for bank to earn given profit
- Higher the rate charged by bank,  greater the borrower's desire to switch to riskier project
	- High repayment obligation means even if project succeeds,  borrower's net payoff after repaying bank is relatively low,  perhaps negative
	- Makes gambling on projects with larger success payoffs but lower success probabilities more attractive
	- Bank rationally anticipates such behavior
	- To earn same expected profit on high-risk borrower as on low-risk borrower,  bank would have to charge high-risk borrower such high rate that borrower would be induced to choose greater risk than bank would like
	- Bank has less room to earn profits on high-risk borrower because rate increases discourage such borrowers from choosing desired relatively safe investments
- Deposit insurance has distorted incentives,  induced banks to pursue riskier investments than otherwise optimal
- To extent riskier borrowers are less well known,  intermediation rents banks can earn from servicing them may be greater
	- Creates incentives for banks to pursue riskier borrowers
- Interest rate incentive effects influence overall credit allocation,  not just loan pricing

### THE MATHEMATICS OF LOAN PRICING

#### THE BASIC COMPONENTS IN THE LOAN PRICING EQUATION
- Bank would like to set loan price so NPV ≥ 0 to the bank
- To ensure NPV ≥ 0,  expected loan revenues must exceed bank's "cost of funds" plus "institutional costs" of making loan:
	- Expected loan interest revenue ≥ Institutional cost of loan + [amount of debt financing in loan × cost of debt] + [amount of equity financing in loan × cost of equity]
- Since expected loan revenue = [loan interest rate × size of loan] – expected loss on loan

#### INSTITUTIONAL COSTS
- Institutional costs of making loan:
	- Direct cost of monitoring loan and collateral
	- Direct costs of screening applicant
	- Allocated overhead costs
		- Costs of using property,  plant,  equipment
		- Costs of regulation and management

#### EXPECTED LOSS ON A LOAN
- Formula: Bank's expected loss on loan = probability of default × expected loss given default

#### THE REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN ON THE BANK'S DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL
- Pretax cost of bank's debt is average cost of all bank's debt
	- Includes costs of various types of insured and uninsured deposits
	- Cost of various forms of nondeposit short-term borrowings like advances
	- Cost of subordinated debt
- Cost of debt = average pretax cost of debt × [1 - T]
	- T is bank's effective tax rate
- Cost of bank's equity capital is minimum expected return shareholders demand given risk in their investment
- Bank assets are unique as they are primarily debt claims
	- Bank's payoff on loan is fixed unless default occurs
	- In computing default risk,  bank must assess default risk of single asset and default risk single asset adds to diversified portfolio

#### DEFAULT RISK OF A SINGLE LOAN

## CREDIT RATIONING
- Credit rationing: lender refuses to extend credit to borrower at price posted by lender for that borrower class
	- Not a phenomenon where borrower refuses credit because price is "unfair" or too high
	- Essential point is credit denied at price selected by lender itself
	- Even if borrower offers higher rate than asked by lender,  loan is refused
- When credit rationed,  unsatisfied credit demand at price posted by bank (demand exceeds supply at that price)
- Conventional theory suggests bank could increase profits by increasing credit price
	- If supply function upward sloping and demand function downward sloping,  should bring usual equilibrium where demand and supply equated
	- Bank supplying more credit at higher price,  so profit should be greater
	- Seems irrational for profit-maximizing banks to ration credit

### WHY SHOULD WE BE INTERESTED IN CREDIT RATIONING?
- Two reasons to study credit rationing in connection with [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]:
	 - 1. With credit rationing,  [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] can be effective in influencing aggregate corporate investment even with little interest rate variation
		- If Fed feels inflationary pressures need abating by curtailing spending,  could cause economic slowdown without major rate changes
		- Achieved by reducing [[A Primer on Bank Liquidity|bank liquidity]],  leading to reduced lending due to credit rationing,  even if corporate investment demand unchanged
		- Effectiveness of [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] would not have been empirically documented
		- Implication: with credit rationing,  inducing higher rates through higher discount window rate and reducing credit through open market operations are not necessarily equivalent
			- Credit can be reduced even if investment demand insensitive to [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] manipulations
	1. Empirically found that more stringent [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] does not affect all borrowers equally
		- If credit rationing better understood with respect to identities of those rationed,  may better predict effects of restrictive [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]]

### WHY IS THERE CREDIT RATIONING?
- In world of asymmetric information,  credit rationing can be optimal for profit-maximizing bank
- Explanation turns on two types of information hurdles:
	 - 1. Precontract private information problem
		- Bank may not be able to perfectly distinguish borrowers with different credit risks,  even after analyzing each borrower's financial information
		- Even if bank knows average riskiness of borrowers within risk class,  may not identify individual risks
		- Bank will charge common price to all within risk class,  so some borrowers subsidize others
	1. Bank may not be able to completely control borrower's actions
		- Borrower may be able to increase project risk through choice of projects or effort without bank detection
- Imagine loan rate announced by bank for particular risk class,  and at that rate there is excess loan demand by borrowers in that class
- If bank chose to increase rate,  one possibility is adverse selection
	- Safer borrowers within class may be unwilling to borrow at higher rate
	- Mix of borrowers within pool becomes riskier
	- Bank's expected profit could be lower at higher rate
- Second possibility is increase in rate could worsen moral hazard problem
	- Borrowers within pool with latitude in investment decisions may choose riskier projects at higher rate
	- Could again mean lower expected profit for bank at higher rate
- Bank may conclude increasing rate not worthwhile since expected profit maximized at rate where credit demand exceeds supply

### BANK CAPITAL AND CREDIT RATIONING
- Bank's capital position may affect decision to ration credit since different loan categories have different capital requirements
- Consider bank with necessary deposits but needing to raise additional capital to satisfy loan request
	- Additional cost of raising this capital relative to raising money from other sources will be charge against bank's profit from loan
	- If cost sufficiently high,  bank may prefer investing available deposits in securities rather than loans
	- Alleged to have happened in 1990-1992,  led to U.S. credit crunch despite [[Lecture 7-Risk and Return of Bonds#7.6 Asset price reactions to monetary policy surprises|monetary policy]] aimed at reviving economy
- Another reason for link between bank capital and credit rationing is relationship between capital and incentive to monitor
	- Bank with insufficient capital may not monitor borrower at a cost
	- Economic value of bank loan diminishes with decrease in capital
	- Bank with sufficiently low capital will view default probability of unmonitored loan as so high that loan not worth making
- Empirical evidence of nonprice quality credit rationing
	- e.g. subprime mortgage borrowers cannot get mortgages without sufficient equity input (down payment)
- When banks experience negative shocks to capital positions,  they tend to reduce lending
	- May be interpreted as reduced loan demand or banks simply lending less (possibly due to credit rationing increasing as bank capital declines)

## THE SPOT-LENDING DECISION
- Bank must determine spot-lending policy under uncertainty about quantity and quality of loan demand,  within own capacity constraints
	- Constraints include limits on screening and monitoring resources
	- Bank may be unable to accommodate more than predetermined level of aggregate lending without significantly sacrificing loan quality
	- Loan quality deterioration may imply unacceptable elevation in bank's likelihood of ruin
- First step in lending policy may be for bank to establish upper bound L on aggregate lending for given period (0,  T)
- Loan applicants arriving after bank has reached loan maximum are presumably rejected indiscriminately ("rationing in the large")
- Before reaching loan maximum,  bank does not ration indiscriminately
	- Recognizes applicant attributes and rejects only less desirable ("rationing in the small")
- Decision to ration applicant in the small predicated on outcome of bank's credit analysis and lending prior to applicant's arrival
- Consider bank extending $1 credit to each randomly arriving customer over fixed planning period (0,  T)
	- If applicant arrives at time t (0 ≤ t ≤ T),  bank:
		- Conducts credit analysis to estimate borrower's repayment probability u
		- Takes into account cumulative loans made to date Lt
		- Takes into account remaining time until end of planning horizon T-t
	- Spot-lending decision can be viewed as optimal stopping problem
		- Bank must decide when to stop conducting credit analysis and make decision on granting or denying credit based on available information
	- At each step,  bank making two decisions simultaneously,  not sequentially:
		 - 1. Whether to acquire/process more borrower information at additional cost or stop information acquisition/processing
		1. Conditional on having decided not to process more information,  whether to extend or deny credit
	- Decisions affected by Lt and T-t
		- Larger the Lt (smaller the L-Lt),  more stringent the credit standard (higher estimated u needed for credit to be granted),  holding all else constant
			- Bank becomes more selective as it has less money to allocate to applicants arriving after t
		- Smaller the T-t,  more stringent the credit standard,  holding all else constant
- Once Lt = L,  all applicants rationed in the large without credit analysis
- Implications of this lending policy perspective:
	- Increase in L will decrease aggregate rationing
		- Does not necessarily mean each applicant faces reduced rationing likelihood
		- Bank will follow less selective policy from outset,  so loans granted by time t probably larger
		- But holding Lt fixed,  bank implements more lax credit standard at time t when larger L chosen at outset
	- Effect of L on probability of stockout (bank exhausting loanable funds inventory) at time t is ambiguous
		- Higher L increases lending capacity but leads to more lax credit standards
		- First effect diminishes stockout probability,  second effect increases it

## LONG-TERM BANK-BORROWER RELATIONSHIPS

### LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS AND MORAL HAZARD
- When borrower knows it may need to borrow in future,  it may limit current actions that would impose losses on bank
	- Borrower trades off current benefits from exploiting bank against future costs of poorer credit terms or rationing due to current actions

### NOTES ON DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION (DIP) FINANCING
- Bridge loan: typically made by commercial or investment bank to provide interim financing for takeover
	- Lender must support bridge loan with capital
	- Part of "merchant banking" - banks taking financial positions in corporate control activity (takeovers and acquisitions)
- Firms filing for [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] often face greater pressures after filing for protection under [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] laws
	- Pressures stem from suppliers and customers shunning bankrupt firm due to liquidity concerns
- 1978 Federal Bankruptcy Code set unified standards for how debtor could obtain new working capital so vendors,  suppliers,  customers would continue with company during bankruptcy
	- Debtor company protected by freez

## PROJECT FINANCE (CONTINUED)

### WHAT IS PROJECT FINANCE? (CONTINUED)
- Two interesting recent developments in project finance market:
	 - 1. Growing popularity of various forms of credit protection
		- Political risk guarantees
		- Credit derivatives
		- New insurance products helping financiers manage risks
	1. Project finance loans increasingly being securitized
		- Adds considerable liquidity to market
		- Lowers borrowing costs for sponsors
- Project financing has grown in response to two market forces:
	 - 1. Need for borrowers to obtain financing exclusively tied to project characteristics,  divorced from sponsor's other cash flows
		- Reduces informational and agency costs
		- Permits higher leverage
	1. Need for lenders to reduce credit risk exposure by breaking up large project loan into smaller pieces financed by numerous lenders
		- Possibility of "private-public partnerships" involving local government participation
- Project financing is an example of collaboration between commercial and investment projects to provide brokerage and qualitative asset-transformation services
	- Resolution of precontract informational asymmetries
	- Reduction of agency costs
	- Designing loan contract to permit borrower to obtain more leverage than otherwise possible

# PART V: OFF THE BANK'S BALANCE SHEET

# CHAPTER 10: OFF-BALANCE SHEET BANKING AND CONTINGENT CLAIMS PRODUCTS

## INTRODUCTION
- Off-balance sheet (OBS) items of U.S. banks now amount to trillions of dollars
	- Include contingent claims representing exposures across markets and credit risks
		- Standby letters of credit (L/Cs)
		- Interest rate and currency swaps
		- Note issuance facilities (NIF)
		- Options
		- Foreign currencies
		- Fixed and variable-rate loan commitments
		- Futures and forward contracts on Treasury bills to gold
- OBS banking refers to transactions not appearing on bank's balance sheet,  except possibly as footnotes
- OBS items divided into two groups:
	 - 1. Option-like contingent claims
		- Promise by bank to settle in future at prespecified terms at option of commitment holder
		- Imposes contingent liability on bank (seller)
		- Endows commitment buyer with an option
		- In competitive market,  bank should be paid fee at time of sale equaling value of option in claim
	1. Nonoption contingent claims
		- May involve fees for bank,  but do not necessarily impose contingent liability on bank due to symmetry in obligations of bank and customer
		- Even though future contingency determines contract settlement,  need not give customer an option
		- e.g. forward or futures contract
- Bank's customer faces two main types of risks:
	 - 1. Business risk
		- Routine (e.g. unpredictable shifts in demand for firm's output)
		- Strategic (e.g. defense firm facing lower demand after end of Cold War)
	1. Financial risk
		- Risk of being rationed in credit market
		- Risk of abrupt random movements in interest rates,  commodity prices,  currencies
- Banks offer:
	- Loan commitments simultaneously guaranteeing credit availability and interest rate insurance
	- Derivatives to hedge unpredictable price movements in volatile markets
- Two popularly cited advantages of OBS banking:
	 - 1. Since OBS banking does not involve deposit funding,  cash-asset reserves not needed,  implicit tax of reserve requirements avoided
	1. In past,  banks not required to maintain capital against OBS contingencies (although required since adoption of first Basel Capital Accord guidelines in 1987)

## LOAN COMMITMENTS: A DESCRIPTION

### DEFINITION AND PRICING STRUCTURE
- Loan commitment: promise to lend up to prespecified amount to prespecified customer at prespecified terms
	- Tenable for prespecified time period (not to be confused with loan maturity)
	- Terms usually specify how loan interest rate computed,  loan maturity,  use of borrowed funds
- Bank's compensation for selling commitment comes in various forms,  used in various combinations:
	- Commitment fee: percentage of total commitment paid up front by borrower when commitment negotiated
	- Usage fee: levied on unused portion of credit line (e.g. 25-50 basis points per year)
	- Servicing fees on borrowed amount to cover bank's transaction costs
	- Compensating balance requirements: deposit balances borrower must keep with bank during commitment relationship,  computed as fractions of total commitment,  bank pays below-market interest rates on balances

### USES OF LOAN COMMITMENTS
- Most business loans made under loan commitments
- Loans made under commitments include:
	- Construction and land-development loans
	- Loans to finance [[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|leveraged buyouts]] ([[Note On LBO Capital Structure Module Note|Note On LBO Capital Structure|LBOs]]) and mergers and acquisitions (M&A)
	- Backup lines of credit on [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (bank agrees to lend as alternative to issuing paper)
	- Note issuance facilities (NIF) (bank agrees to buy borrower's short-term notes if borrower unable to sell them in markets)

### KINDS OF LOAN COMMITMENTS
- Loan commitments classified by nature of interest rate insurance provided to customer
- Commitments vary in extent of interest rate insurance provided to borrower
- Fixed-rate loan commitment:
	- Gives customer right to borrow at known rate,  eliminating all interest rate and availability uncertainty
- More popular variable-rate (fixed formula) loan commitment:
	- Does not hold borrowing rate fixed
	- Determines rate by formula involving index rate
	- Two common formulas:
		 - 1. Additive: borrowing rate is index rate at takedown time plus fixed add-on
		1. Multiplicative: borrowing rate is index rate at takedown time multiplied by specified constant
	- Commonly used index rates: prime rate,  CD rate,   [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] ,  [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] rate
	- Customers may be offered choice of formula within given commitment (e.g. prime plus 10 basis points or 1.1 times CD rate at borrowing time)
- Relative to fixed-rate commitment,  variable-rate commitment does not protect customer against stochastic index rate fluctuations
	- But as long as there is an element of fixity in borrowing rate,  commitment has some insurance value to customer
	- In prime-plus commitment,  add-on held fixed
		- Customer insured against add-on increase due to possible increase in its credit risk during commitment period
	- In prime-times commitment,  multiple held fixed
	- In both cases,  customer's commitment borrowing rate at takedown may be lower than spot rate it would face without commitment
- Although loan commitment obliges bank to lend at rate below borrower's spot rate,  bank usually has latitude in determining whether to honor commitment
	- Latitude arises from "general nervous clause" or "material adverse change" (MAC) clause,  standard in virtually all loan commitment contracts
	- Allows bank to dissolve commitment if customer's financial condition "materially" deteriorated between commitment issuance and customer exercise time
	- What constitutes material deterioration can become legal issue if denied customer challenges bank's assessment through litigation
	- Introduces element of discretion into loan commitment contract
- Contract's contingency hinges on interest rate applicable to specific borrower at commitment takedown time
	- If spot rate higher than commitment rate,  customer will exercise commitment and bank will suffer loss (at least opportunity loss)
	- If spot rate exceeded by commitment rate,  customer will let commitment expire unused and borrow in spot market instead
	- Bank has obligation and customer has option
	- Bank has loss in states of nature where customer will exercise commitment,  loss contingent on occurrence of those states

## RATIONALE FOR LOAN COMMITMENTS

### SUPPLY-SIDE EXPLANATIONS
- Attempt to shed light on loan commitment popularity by examining incentives banks (suppliers) have to sell contracts

#### REGULATORY TAXES
- Some believe loan commitments popular because they permit banks to generate fee revenue while keeping only minimal additional capital to support commitments
- Until commitment actually taken down,  there is no loan,  so no funding has taken place
	- Bank needs no deposits until takedown,  so reserve requirements do not affect commitment until then
- If bank interested only in generating fee income related to loan commitment,  it could sell commitment and avoid funding potential loan altogether
	- Could be achieved by selling loan to another bank if and when customer decides to exercise commitment
	- Bank could securitize the loan

#### CONTRACTUAL DISCRETION AND REPUTATION
- Another supply-side explanation relies on notion that banks face trade-off between financial and reputational capital
	- Since contingent claims are promises to deliver something in future but invariably involve "escape clauses" introducing contractual discretion permitting bank to not honor promises under "extenuating" circumstances,  issuing such claims gives bank improved ability to manage overall portfolio of financial and reputational capital
- Consider bank that has built reputation for honoring contingent claims even when contract terms would give it latitude not to
	- Bank with sufficient financial capital may permit customer to exercise commitment to build reputational capital
	- Reputational capital is valuable as it enables bank to sell future contingent claims at higher prices
- Now suppose bank with substantial reputational capital but scarce financial capital faces same decision
	- May decide to invoke MAC clause and not honor commitment
	- Will result in some depreciation of reputational capital,  but will conserve scarce financial capital
	- Decision to not honor commitment can be seen as optimal trade-off between reputational and financial capital
	- Essentially an act of liquefying reputational capital (unlike financial capital,  reputational capital cannot be directly traded)
- Ability to introduce discretion into contract is predicated on contract involving promise of future delivery,  as contingent claim does
- Discretion in loan commitment contract is beneficial as it permits bank to trade off liquid against illiquid assets

#### DEMAND FORECASTING
- By participating in loan commitment market,  bank can obtain valuable information about future loan demand
	- Customers will purchase commitments for amounts related to expected future borrowing needs
	- Permits bank to plan funding and other activities accordingly

#### SCOPE EFFICIENCIES IN THE SALE OF LOAN COMMITMENTS FOR DEPOSIT-FINANCED BANKS
- Banks largely financed with demand deposits,  so have access to large amount of cash
	- Some loaned out,  but banks need to keep substantial liquidity on hand to meet deposit withdrawals occurring at moment's notice
- Once liquidity on hand,  there are scope economies from being able to use it to allow borrowers to borrow under loan commitments
	- Cash assets on balance sheet serve two purposes: backing up loan commitments and having liquidity to meet deposit withdrawals

### DEMAND-SIDE EXPLANATIONS
- Focus on benefits of loan commitments to purchaser
- Many benefits identified,  five discussed:

#### - 1. INTEREST RATE INSURANCE
- When bank sells fixed-rate loan commitment,  it accepts interest rate risk customer would otherwise bear if borrowing in spot credit market
	- Customer should be willing to compensate bank for taking this risk,  compensation reflected in price paid for commitment
- Borrowers more risk averse than bank should be willing to pay bank for taking interest rate risk on their behalf
	- Risk premium demanded by bank for bearing interest rate risk will be lower than that demanded by customer for bearing same risk if latter more risk averse than former
	- Disparity in risk preferences makes trade possible between bank and customer,  involving bank selling borrower loan commitment reducing uncertainty regarding customer's future borrowing cost
- With variable-rate loan commitment,  bank still bears some interest rate risk but less than with fixed-rate commitment
	- With fixed-rate commitment,  bank bears both risk of index rate changes and changes in borrower's credit risk premium
	- With variable-rate commitment,  bank bears only latter risk
- In either case,  risk-averse borrower transferring (some) interest rate risk to bank
	- To extent bank willing to participate at price acceptable to borrower,  explains why loan commitments demanded by bank's customers

#### 2. MORAL HAZARD
- Drawback of previous explanation is many loan commitment customers are large,  publicly owned firms with numerous shareholders
	- From portfolio theory,  even risk-averse shareholders should be indifferent to firm-specific (idiosyncratic) risk as they can diversify it away
	- Not clear why nonbank firm shareholders should collectively demand higher premium for bearing systematic risk than bank's shareholders
- So would like to know if there will be demand for loan commitments even when bank's customers not motivated by desire to purchase interest rate risk insurance
- One possibility is loan commitments effective in deterring moral hazard
	- Source of moral hazard may be incentive on borrower's part to undersupply productive effort (relative to self-financing case) or switch projects (undetected) to bank's detriment
- Intuition:
	- Loan interest rate is distortionary - higher the rate,  lower the net return to borrower,  greater the borrower's incentive to reduce effort and/or switch to riskier project
	- Consequences can be costly - borrower may need to post collateral or in extreme circumstances bank may ration credit
	- Loan commitment provides means for bank to circumvent distortionary effect of loan interest rate without relying on more costly alternatives
		- Can be achieved by lowering loan rate to level sufficient to eliminate (or significantly diminish) moral hazard
		- Will generally mean bank will suffer expected loss on loan made under commitment
		- Loss can be recouped through commitment fee paid by borrower at commitment time
		- Key is customer views commitment fee as sunk cost after paid,  so fee does not affect effort level or project choice
		- In this way,  loan commitment helps overcome moral hazard
- Similar argument works for "effort aversion" moral hazard
- Suggests loan commitments add value for borrowers
	- Has empirical support - firms purchasing bank loan commitments experience abnormally positive stock price reactions upon announcing purchases

#### 3. LIQUIDITY GUARANTEE FOR OTHER CREDITORS
- When firm purchases loan commitment,  input suppliers know firm will have access to liquidity equal to commitment amount
	- May reassure suppliers firm will have funds to service debt obligations to them
	- Suppliers may be willing to provide inputs to firm on better terms than without loan commitment
	- Result would be overall lowering of firm's cost of debt,  benefiting shareholders
- Borrowers often use loan commitments as assurance to other creditors
	- e.g. [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] borrowers routinely purchase dedicated bank loan commitments explicitly to back up [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] issues

#### 4. PROTECTION AGAINST FUTURE CREDIT RATIONING
- Borrower's future credit access threatened by three possibilities:
	 - 1. Deterioration in own credit rating
	1. Deterioration in general market credit availability
	1. Changes in bank-specific factors diminishing bank's ability to provide credit
- Loan commitment may protect buyer against first two possibilities
	- MAC clause limits usefulness of commitment as rationing insurance,  but empirical evidence suggests commitments still considered valuable
- Surveys of borrowers indicate most frequently mentioned reasons for commitments:
	- "General convenience and minimizing loan arrangement costs"
	- "Protection against general credit crunches"
- Next most frequently mentioned reasons:
	- "Ensure credit access against a creditworthiness deterioration"
	- "Lock in a fixed markup over a reference interest rate"

#### 5. REDUCING MARKET INCOMPLETENESS
- When capital market incomplete,  investors and firms lack all desired risk-sharing opportunities
- If market incomplete and loan commitment produces payoff stream for borrower that cannot be replicated by linear combinations of existing securities,  availability of loan commitment reduces market incompleteness
	- Investors now have access to expanded risk-sharing opportunities as they can invest in firms purchasing loan commitments (and those not)
	- Investors may be made better off by availability of loan commitments
- May be demand from investors for payoff patterns that can only be produced by firms purchasing loan commitments

## WHO IS ABLE TO BORROW UNDER BANK LOAN COMMITMENTS?
- Appears loan commitments available primarily to firms maintaining high cash flow
- Firms with low operating cash flow cannot count on loan commitments as liquidity source,  tend to rely more on own cash reserves in managing liquidity
- Reason is banks use financial [[Class Slides 2 Discussion of Loan Covenants Vs. Bond Covenants|Covenants]] with loan commitments,  firms must maintain high cash flow to remain compliant with covenants
- In addition to who is able to borrow under commitments,  also question of whether a borrower purchasing loan commitment is actually able to borrow under commitment
	- Due to MAC clause,  banks can refuse to honor commitments when honoring financially too expensive
	- During 2007-2009 financial crisis when liquidity scarce,  many banks did not honor commitments
	- Overall,  credit lines still helped mitigate negative effect of financial crisis on corporate spending

## PRICING OF LOAN COMMITMENTS

### THE MODEL

#### THE ANALOGY BETWEEN LOAN COMMITMENTS AND OPTIONS
- Approach for pricing loan commitments based on observation that payoff structure resembles that of common stock put option
- Major components of contract:
	 - 1. Identity of deliverable
	1. Option price
	1. Strike price
	1. Exercise date or period
- Loan commitment buyer pays commitment fee (option price) for right to put (sell) security to bank at prespecified price over pre-established time interval
	- Security is commitment owner's IOU (debt)
	- Strike price is face (par) value of loan (dollar amount of borrowing)
	- Time interval is life of commitment
- In selling loan commitments,  banks are writing put options where underlying deliverable is debt instrument of commitment buyer
- Commitment buyer will take down commitment (exercise put option) if value of debt instrument on exercise date is less than committed loan amount (strike price)
	- Difference between loan amount and debt instrument value at commitment exercise time represents customer's gain from exercising commitment
	- Present value of this gain at

## OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS: LETTERS OF CREDIT

### COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT AND BANKERS ACCEPTANCES
- Commercial letters of credit (L/Cs) used to facilitate trade,  most commonly international,  one of oldest banking contracts
- In typical transaction involving L/C:
	- Exporter has limited knowledge of importer's ability to pay and limited ability to enforce contracts across national boundaries
	- Exporter asks importer to arrange for its bank to issue L/C guaranteeing payment to exporter upon presentation of appropriate shipping documents
	- Exporter obtains bill of lading and other shipping documents when goods loaded on ship for export
	- L/C is promise by importer's bank to pay exporter,  given necessary shipping documents
	- Bank substitutes own creditworthiness for that of importer,  reducing default risk to exporter
- When exporter presents necessary documents to paying bank,  receives either:
	- Sight draft (immediate payment)
	- Time draft promising payment at future date (becomes bankers acceptance,  marketable and usually quite liquid)
- Bankers acceptance can be viewed as outcome of commercial L/C
	- Any draft "accepted" by bank in performance of obligation under commercial L/C is bankers acceptance
- Commercial L/C is essentially a performance guarantee
	- Promise to endorse or "accept" time draft conditional on prespecified terms being satisfied
	- Bank's acceptance implies bank's promise to repay replaces that of debtor from exporter's viewpoint,  creating negotiable security
	- Bank bears risk that debtor (importer) may default
- Figure 10.6 depicts steps leading to creation of Bankers Acceptances (for simplicity,  only importer's bank included; sometimes exporter's bank also involved as intermediary,  time drafts may be accepted by both banks,  giving rise to "two-name paper")
- If importer's (buyer's) bank accepts time draft and creates bankers acceptance,  it has two choices:
	 - 1. Hold the acceptance (ends up funding the credit,  essentially extending loan to importer)
	1. Sell acceptance in secondary market (holder of acceptance provides funding,  but bank guarantees payment)

### STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
- Standby L/C also guarantees performance of an "account party",  usually in commercial or financial transaction,  but does not necessarily involve funding transaction
- Standby L/C issued by "second party's" (buyer,  debtor,  party owing performance to "first party") bank obligates that bank to compensate first party if second party fails to perform
	- Second party then liable to its bank for disbursements made under L/C
	- Similar to commercial L/C in this regard
- With commercial L/C,  issuing bank usually advances payment and is repaid by customer
- With standby L/C,  bank makes payment only if customer fails to fulfill contractual obligation
	- Bankers acceptances associated with commercial L/Cs have no counterpart among standby L/Cs
- Standby L/Cs often used in international trade to facilitate transactions where seller has insufficient knowledge of buyer's creditworthiness
	- Seller must still rely on buyer's bank to "make good" on promise
	- Often a second bank (typically seller's) that augments issuing bank's guarantee with its own (known as confirmed L/Cs)
- Standby L/Cs also used to guarantee performance in more complex contracts than simple international trade
	- Through standby L/Cs,  banks now operate in areas once exclusive domain of bonding,  title,  insurance companies
	- e.g. Builder promises to deliver completed building by prespecified date or face predetermined penalty
		- Buyer could ask builder to obtain standby L/C to guarantee contract
		- If builder fails to keep promise,  buyer can collect penalty from issuing bank
		- Builder then responsible to pay bank penalty amount disbursed earlier
- In banking,  standby L/Cs used as:
	- Credit enhancements for securitizations
	- Backups for [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] when market gets skittish (replace loan commitments,  avoiding MAC clause risk)

### THE OPTION-LIKE FEATURE OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT
- Standby L/Cs can be viewed as put options,  like loan commitments
- With loan commitment:
	- Customer purchases option to sell bank a security (customer's indebtedness) that may be less valuable at exercise than strike price (loan amount)
- With standby L/C:
	- Bank agrees to purchase from creditor a claim (debtor's indebtedness) at par,  contingent on debtor's failure to "perform" (honor claim)
	- "First party" (creditor) has option to "put" debtor's debt claim to bank when debtor nonperformance renders claim value less than par
	- In exchange for writing option,  bank collects fee
	- Option feature implies bank conveying contingent claim to buyer and imposing contingent liability on itself
		- Becomes actual liability if debtor fails to perform under contract stipulations
- One important difference between loan commitments and standby L/Cs as put options is in random processes influencing market values of underlying claims and consequent trigger mechanisms for exercise
	- With loan commitment,  increase in customer's spot borrowing rate above commitment rate triggers exercise
	- With standby L/Cs,  debtor nonperformance depresses claim value below strike price (guaranteed value),  prompting option exercise
- Another important difference is enforceability
	- Unlike loan commitment,  standby L/C does not have MAC clause and is therefore more rigidly binding

## OTHER CONTINGENT CLAIMS: SWAPS

### WHAT ARE SWAPS?
- Swap: agreement between two parties to exchange exposure to a specific risk
	- Trade often involves intermediary acting as principal or broker
	- e.g. Firm with floating-rate liability and fixed-rate asset will suffer losses if rates rise sharply
	- e.g. Firm with fixed-rate liability and floating-rate asset will suffer losses if rates fall sharply
	- These firms could arrange swap to exchange interest payments and reduce interest rate risk exposures
- Interest rate swaps first used in Eurobond market in 1981
	- Large international banks (mostly floating-rate lenders) first to use swaps exchanging fixed-rate interest obligations on liabilities for lower-cost floating-rate payments on equivalent notional amounts
- Swap market migrated to U.S. in 1982 with first domestic swap between Sallie Mae and ITT Financial Corporation
	- Market has since experienced explosive growth,  now worth trillions of dollars of notional claims
- Typical swap involves exchange of fixed for floating rate over agreed notional amount for specific period
	- Floating rate typically indexed to  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] ,  prime,  or T-bill rate

### HOW A SWAP WORKS?
- Traditionally most common swap was "plain vanilla" swap involving dollar fixed-rate loan swapped for dollar floating-rate loan
- Recently,  different types of swaps have proliferated
- Floating-to-floating swap: parties agree to swap floating rates based on different index rates
	- e.g. Bank with floating-rate loans at prime plus 20 basis points and floating-rate CDs at  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  minus 40 basis points may wish to swap interest payments on liabilities with those of institution having liabilities indexed to prime rate
	- Known as basis swaps
- Currency swaps also popular
	- e.g. Bank with foreign loans financed by domestic deposits (loan interest payments in yen,  deposit interest payments in dollars) might wish to swap yen payments for dollar payments (perhaps with Japanese bank having dollar loans financed by yen deposits)
- Two common types of currency swaps:
	 - 1. Traditional fixed/fixed currency swaps
		- Involve fixed interest rates in each currency
		- Principal may or may not be exchanged
		- If principal exchanged,  transforms fixed coupon bond in one currency into fixed coupon bond in another currency
	1. Cross-currency interest rate swaps
		- Exchange fixed payments stream for floating payment stream,  as well as payments in different currencies
		- Occasionally combined in single transaction,  sometimes currency and interest rate components separated
- Other variations exist
	- e.g. Swaps exchanging yields on assets of different maturities or currency denominations,  rather than interest payments on liabilities
- Swap can be tailor-made to suit needs of swapping parties,  potential variety almost limitless

### SWAPS AND SWAP-RELATED INNOVATIONS
- Interest Rate Swap Variations:
	- Amortizing Swap: notional principal amount diminishes over swap life in specified manner (may match expected cash flows of financing project or mortgage prepayment schedule)
	- Indexed Amortization Swap: amortizing swap with notional principal amortization depending on stochastic value of some index (e.g. 3-month  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] )
	- Forward Swap: swap not beginning until designated future date,  fixed rate linked to spot rates,  swap must be executed on prespecified date
	- Step Up/Down: fixed-rate payment level varies,  increasing or decreasing over portion of swap term (e.g. fixed rate set below market for first 2 years,  above market for remainder)
- Swaps Involving Asset Payoffs Other Than Interest Rates:
	- Commodity Swaps: contracting parties agree to exchange payments based on value of particular physical commodity (e.g. gold,  oil,  silver)
		- One party pays fixed price for commodity,  receives spot price at future date
		- Relatively new contract appealing to commodity fund managers
		- Generally short (2-3 years) but maturities up to 7 years available
	- Indexed Returns Swaps: one payment linked to total return of market portfolio (e.g. S&P 500)
		- Return can be exchanged for payment stream based on fixed rate (e.g. current T-bill rate plus 30 basis points) or floating rate (e.g.  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] )
		- Interesting type is foreign indexed swap,  designed to capture relative performances of security types (e.g. U.S. vs. Japanese equities)
			- e.g. Investor owning 5-year U.S. floating-rate note yielding  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  plus 50 basis points wants to invest in Japanese government bonds but cannot trade securities directly and wants to manage foreign exchange risk
			- Can enter swap receiving dollar equivalent of monthly Japanese bond returns and paying  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]] ,  giving total return equal to Japanese bond return plus 50 basis points
	- Mortgage Swaps: replicates all or portion of return characteristics of mortgage securities
		- In most basic structure,  mortgage yield exchanged for floating-rate return,  notional balance amortized according to specified schedule or actual prepayment experience of underlying mortgage pool
		- Most recent innovation is indexed amortization swap
			- Fixed-rate payment exchanged for floating-rate payment
			- Notional balance amortizes according to schedule depending on movements in yield of prespecified security
			- e.g. If security yield falls 50-100 basis points,  balance amortizes by 7% over next period
- Derivative Securities Based on Swaps:
	- Swaptions: one contracting party has option to allow existing swap to be terminated or extended
		- Also called cancelable,  callable,  putable swaps
		- Can be American or European in options characteristics
		- Basically an option on a swap
		- e.g. A sells call swaption to B
			- At exercise date,  B can choose whether to exercise option
			- If B exercises,  enters swap to receive fixed-rate payment in exchange for floating-rate payment
			- Payment terms all prespecified,  as in regular swap
			- Only difference is one party has legal right to decide whether to execute swap at future date
	- Caps: swap contract where interest payments have option characteristics
		- Exercise (strike) price set at particular interest rate levels
		- e.g. Party A buys cap based on 3-month  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  from "cap writer" (party B)
			- A pays premium (price of options) to swap broker who subtracts fee and passes remainder to B
			- B obliged to periodically (on each reset date) pay A an amount equal to: notional principal × max{0,  3-month spot  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  – strike rate}
			- If 3-month spot  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  is 12% and strike rate is 10%,  B must pay A 2% of notional principal
			- If 3-month spot  [[A Guide to the Front End and Basis Swap Markets#London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)|LIBOR]]  is 9%,  B pays nothing on reset date
		- Cap is sequence of consecutive expiration options
			- Can be viewed as call options on specified interest rate or put options on underlying security
			- When rates rise,  security's price falls and option becomes more valuable
			- As with standard stock option,  cap value (and initial option premium) increases as interest rate rises
		- Cap market has developed numerous derivatives and customizations,  including:
			- Floors: B pays A notional principal × max{0,  strike rate – spot market rate on specific security} on exercise date (reset date)
			- Collars: B pays A notional principal × [{0,  (spot rate – cap strike rate)} – max{0,  (floor strike rate – spot rate)}]
				- A buying cap from B and simultaneously selling floor to B
				- e.g. Cap strike rate 15%,  floor strike rate 10%
					- If spot rate 17%,  spot rate minus cap strike rate is 2%,  A receives 2% of notional principal
					- If spot rate 9%,  floor strike rate minus spot rate is 1%,  A receives 1% of notional principal
					- If spot rate between cap and floor strike rates (e.g. 12%),  A receives nothing

### ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF A SWAP AS A HEDGING INSTRUMENT

#### SWAP VERSUS INTEREST RATE FUTURES

##### WHAT IS A FUTURES CONTRACT?
- Interest rate futures contract: exchange-based contract (as opposed to over-the-counter) to buy or sell particular financial asset (e.g. T-bill) for specific price at prespecified future date

##### HOW A FUTURES CONTRACT CAN BE USED TO HEDGE
- Consider S&L with long-term fixed-rate mortgage assets and short-term CD liabilities
- Suppose S&L shorts (sells) CD futures contract (promises to deliver/sell at fixed price)
	- If rates rise in future,  CD market value falls
	- S&L receives cash inflow equal to positive difference between fixed delivery price and CD market value
- If rates fall and CD market value rises,  S&L experiences loss
- Gain to S&L if rates rise offset by loss if rates fall
- S&L's interest rate exposure is hedged

##### ADVANTAGE OF A SWAP OVER A FUTURES CONTRACT
- Interest rate futures are standardized contracts with specific delivery dates and instrument types
	- If wish to hedge interest rate risk on financial claim not one of deliverable instruments futures contracts written on,  must choose futures contract on deliverable most closely resembling claim to be hedged
	- Resemblance will be imperfect,  so will bear cross-hedging risk
	- Even if resemblance perfect,  would bear basis risk (risk that spot-futures price relation will change randomly)
- Major advantage of swap over futures is swap can be tailored to suit customer's need as it is not standardized
	- Better interest rate hedging often possible with swap than futures
	- Note swaps increasingly becoming more standardized and similar to futures,  but with longer hedging periods

##### DISADVANTAGES OF A SWAP
 - 1. Imperfect standardization means not always easy to find counterparty to desired swap transaction
	- Futures more liquid than swaps
1. Related to (1),  highly customer-specific nature of swaps means search costs may be significant in some transactions
	- Costs passed on to swapping parties by swap broker as higher fee
	- Customers face higher transaction costs with swaps than futures
1. Greater risk of nonperformance (default) with swaps than futures
	- Exchange guarantees execution with futures
	- With swap,  one party could be left if other party reneges and there is no (backup) guarantee by swap broker
	- If backup guarantee by swap broker,  swap broker plays clearinghouse role
	- But even then,  possibility of nonperformance by swap broker

#### SWAPS VERSUS REFINANCING

##### HOW DO YOU HEDGE RISK BY REFINANCING?
- One simple way for firm to adjust interest rate exposure is to directly refinance
	- e.g. Firm with fixed-rate liabilities desiring floating-rate liabilities could repurchase fixed-rate liabilities,  financing repurchase by issuing floating-rate liabilities
- Why is this simple approach not always preferred to swaps and futures?

##### ADVANTAGES OF A SWAP OVER DEBT REFINANCING
 - 1. Swaps avoid many transaction costs of debt refinancing (legal fees,  advertising,  regulatory restrictions)
	- Swap not considered new borrowing or public offering,  only regarded as exchange of interest payments on existing liabilities
1. Swaps avoid many disclosure requirements of new financing as not considered new borrowing
	- May be important to firms wishing to protect confidentiality of strategic information
-. 3. Many low credit rating firms pay higher differential on fixed-rate debt relative to floating-rate debt than higher quality firms
	- Such firms may wish to borrow in floating-rate market then swap for fixed-rate liabilities,  perhaps avoiding some credit risk premium they would pay on newly issued debt
- Important reason for emergence of interest rate swaps (given availability of direct debt refinancing)

## DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECURITIZATION CONTRACTS (CONTINUED)

### ASSET-BACKED BONDS
- Second type of ABS
- Collateralized by portfolio of loans,  like static pass-through
- Main difference: originator sells assets to wholly owned subsidiary created solely for securitizing assets
	- Assets remain on originator's consolidated balance sheet
	- Instead of selling assets to trust that sells claims against assets to investors,  subsidiary itself issues claims (general obligation notes) to investors
	- Claims secured solely by subsidiary's assets and any credit enhancement obtained
- Figure 11.4 depicts typical ABB structure
	- Finance company (wholly owned subsidiary of originator) issues certificates/notes to investors,  usually through underwriting investment bank
	- Revenues collected by finance company from principal and interest payments transferred to trustee
	- Revenues added to credit enhancer's cash contributions,  then disbursements made to investors by trustee
- Important difference between pass-through and ABB:
	- Cash flows from collateral asset pool not dedicated to payments of principal and interest on ABBs
	- ABB maturity usually prespecified (normally 5-12 years)
	- Interest generally paid semiannually
- ABBs usually overcollateralized
	- Collateral evaluated quarterly,  augmented if value falls below amount stated in bond indenture
	- Two reasons for overcollateralization:
		 - 1. Increases safety for investors,  reduces required ABB yield,  benefits originator
			- Proceeds beyond what's needed to service ABB principal and interest accrue to originator but used to augment collateral pool value
			- Reinvestment of proceeds collected by originator from asset pool
			- By reinvesting to increase collateral,  originator reduces investor risk like borrower reducing lender's risk by using project cash flows to purchase additional collateral rather than increase dividends
			- Overcollateralization improves outcome by diminishing moral hazard
			- Other credit enhancements (e.g. insurance bond) also diminish moral hazard but work differently
				- e.g. With insurance bond,  bond provider expected to monitor originator to ensure sufficiently high asset quality
		1. Protects investors against collateral market value decreases between valuation dates
			- Simple risk-sharing argument
			- If originator more risk tolerant than individual investors (perhaps due to superior hedging ability),  provides investors value-fluctuation insurance in exchange for lower ABB yield
			- In this sense,  overcollateralization no different from other credit enhancement forms

### PAY-THROUGHS
- Third type of ABS
- Combines pass-through and ABB features
	- Similarity to ABB: appears on originator's balance sheet as debt
	- Similarity to pass-through: cash flows from collateral asset pool dedicated to servicing bonds

#### CMO
- In June 1983,  Freddie Mac issued pay-through bond called Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO)
- Each CMO issue divided into three "tranches" (maturity classes),  each receiving semiannual interest payments
- Tranches strictly prioritized for receipt of scheduled principal payments and repayments
	- Class A bondholders received first installments of principal payments and prepayments until Class A bonds paid off
	- After Class A paid off,  Class B bondholders began receiving principal payments and repayments
	- Class B had to be completely paid off before Class C could receive principal
	- Class A repaid within 5 years of offering date,  Class B within 12 years,  Class C within 20 years
- Class A would receive interest plus all principal payments passed through from underlying mortgages until entirely paid off (estimated no more than 5 years)
	- Classes B and C receive only interest during this time
	- While variability in repayment rate remains due to randomness in prepayment rates,  CMO structure reduces variability by "serializing" cash flows this way
	- CMO-holders receive "call protection" - can be reasonably confident bonds will not prepay (be called) prematurely
- CMOs facilitate management of prepayment risk
	- Routinely borne by financial institutions
	- Arises from borrowers tending to prepay debts when rates fall as they can refinance at lower rates
		- Especially true for long-term mortgages with no prepayment penalties
	- Institution does not fully benefit from decline in cost of funds relative to longer-maturity asset rates
	- When rates rise,  institution's cost of funds rises but asset returns do not,  as borrowers hold on to low-rate mortgages
- By investing in CMO tranche with sufficiently long effective maturity (e.g. Class C in Figure 11.5),  institution can reduce prepayment risk exposure
- Most CMOs have four tranches:
	- Three "regular" maturity classes
	- "Residual" class called "Z class"
		- Basically an accrual bond
		- Earned interest accrues to principal and is compounded while other classes earn interest
		- After first three classes paid off,  Z class receives regular principal and interest payments along with accrued interest
- CMOs can be used by financial institutions to facilitate asset/liability management
	- e.g. S&L with 30-year fixed-rate mortgage assets and shorter-maturity CD liabilities could reduce maturity mismatching by swapping mortgages for shorter CMO tranches
- Both public and private sector firms participate in CMO market
	- Issuers include investment banks,  federal agencies,  builders,  thrift institutions
- CMO issuance not an asset sale as debt obligation stays on originator's books
	- Structure adopted to comply with tax regulations stating trust could not qualify for grantor trust status if issuing multiclass claims dividing cash flows in not prorata fashion (as CMO does)
		- "Tax problem" does not arise with pass-throughs as certificate holders receive cash flows prorata
	- CMO had to tolerate "inefficiency" of keeping collateral assets on originator's balance sheet rather than selling to trust
		- Resulted in another tax disadvantage due to regulatory taxes (reserve and capital requirements,  deposit insurance premiums)
		- Limited CMO use

#### REMICS
- Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1986 authorized REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits)
- Main difference between CMO and REMIC is tax treatment
- REMICs can qualify as asset sales for tax purposes if following conditions satisfied:
	 - 1. REMIC must contain at least one regular class and no more than one residual class
	1. REMIC collateral must consist of "qualified mortgages" or "permitted investments"
		- Qualified mortgages include single and multifamily residential mortgage loans,  commercial mortgages,  mortgage-backed securities
		- Permitted investments include short-term interest-bearing securities used only for reinvesting monthly cash flows prior to scheduled transfer to bondholders,  investments to fund REMIC operating expenses,  properties acquired through foreclosure

### SECURITIZATION INNOVATIONS
- New types of securitization contracts continue to proliferate for three main reasons:
	 - 1. Lower rates have made mortgage prepayment options more valuable to investors,  who have become more sophisticated in dealing with prepayment risk
		- New securities facilitating prepayment risk management have been created
	1. Relatively uninformed investors about future payoff [[Lecture 1- Probability Distributions of Returns|probability distribution]]s on various securities at disadvantage dealing with better informed investors
		- Uninformed will demand relatively information-insensitive securities enabling trading without expropriation
		- Cash-flow stripping accompanying securitization often creates information-insensitive securities by partitioning composite,  information-sensitive security cash flows such that senior-most security is nearly riskless bond appealing to uninformed investors
	1. Innovations in securitization and cash-flow stripping have also facilitated creation of securities appealing to informed investors
		- Given security with private-information content can always be stripped into two securities,  one more information sensitive (greater private-information content) than original
		- Those able to acquire information at a cost will find information investment return greater with more information-sensitive security
		- More of these investors will become informed,  greater demand from them,  elevating price at which security trades and issue's revenue
- Similar argument can be made for altering other original security attributes through cash-flow stripping to appeal to specific investor clienteles
	- e.g. Investors may have different cash-flow preferences due to tax considerations and risk attitudes
	- Stripping security into components permits issuer to cater more effectively to clientele desires than issuing only single class of pass-throughs
	- Translates into higher revenue for issuer
- Investors desire low prepayment rate even when rates falling
	- Those wanting discount mortgage security with higher prepayment can purchase P/O ("principal-only" security)

#### STRIPPED SECURITIES
- Stripped mortgage security ("strip") involves two classes of pass-through securities receiving different portions of principal and interest from same mortgage loan pool
	- e.g. Mortgage loan pool with 8% average APR might be split into "premium" security with 12% coupon and "discount" security with 4% coupon
- When "stripping" process taken to logical extreme,  creates interest-only (I/O) and principal-only (P/O) securities
	- Known as I/O-P/O strip
	- I/O strip holders receive primarily interest payments from securitized pool
	- P/O strip holders receive nearly all principal payments
- Strips offer advantages to issuers and investors
	- Some investors may prefer information-insensitive securities,  others may prefer information-sensitive securities,  yet others may desire specific cash-flow pattern due to tax considerations
	- Strips can satisfy these different demands
- Financial institution can use I/O-P/O strips for hedging against interest-rate risk
	- I/Os useful in hedging fixed-rate mortgage loans and other fixed-income assets
		- Rate increase causes I/O value decline as with other fixed-income assets
		- But higher rates slow prepayments,  generating higher-than-expected cash flows for I/O holders,  increasing I/O value
		- In most rate scenarios,  rate increase causes prepayments to fall sufficiently to create inverse relationship between I/O strip value and bank's other fixed-income asset prices,  providing hedging
	- P/O strips can hedge fixed-income liabilities
		- Rate decrease increases P/O value as discount rate for computing PV of future principal payments decreases
		- Prepayments go up,  accelerating cash flows to P/O holders,  further increasing strip value
		- P/O value inversely related to fixed-income liability values,  hedging is possible

#### ASSET-BACKED [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] (ABCP)
- ABCP is [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] secured by designated corporate assets,  typically receivables
- Maturity typically 90-180 days
- Bank establishes "special purpose corporation" (SPC)
	- SPC purchases credit card receivables or other assets from corporation (seller) needing funding
	- To finance purchase,  SPC issues [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] secured by purchased assets
	- Bank provides credit enhancement enabling SPC to obtain high rating for [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]],  typically through overcollateralization and/or standby letter of credit
- ABCP market came into existence in 1983,  expanded rapidly to multibillion-dollar market within a decade
	- By mid-1993,  175 ABCP programs in operation,  representing $75 billion in outstanding [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] and $150 billion in commitments
	- By end of 2006,  ABCP outstanding in U.S. had grown to $1.1 trillion,  larger than unsecured (non-asset-backed) [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] outstanding and significant portion of U.S. "shadow banking system"
	- Following 2007-2009 financial crisis during which ABCP market under enormous stress and fell out of favor,  outstanding volume dropped below $400 billion by 2010,     slightly over $200 billion by end of 2014
- ABCP boom seen as one of contributors to 2007-2009 financial crisis
	- Used to fund off balance sheet special purpose vehicles (conduits)
	- Considered fragile as it supported long-term (often opaque) assets typically financed with very short-maturity liabilities
- On demand side,  ABCP offers some firms lower cost funding than either "regular" (unsecured) [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] or bank loan
	- Regular [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] may be unavailable or too costly due to high moral hazard cost owing to unsecured nature
	- Bank loan may be too costly due to capital and reserve requirements
	- One reason ABCP lowers firm's funding cost is credit enhancement provided by bank
		- Directly lowers investor's risk in holding paper
		- Signals bank's involvement in monitoring borrower and certifies borrower creditworthiness
		- Basic screening and monitoring services provided by bank play key role in ABCP market
- On supply side,  risk-based Basel II capital rules increased ABCP benefits to banks
	- If bank extended loan to borrower,  would need to keep reserves against deposit used to fund loan and set aside substantial capital (8% under Basel I)
	- With ABCP,  bank would need capital equal to 8% of only credit enhancement (typically fraction of total borrowing)
		- e.g. $1 billion bank loan would need $80 million in bank capital
		- With ABCP,  bank might issue letter of credit equal to 10% of total amount,  so only $8 million in capital set aside
	- As with other off-balance sheet products,  banks able to earn fee income without posting as much capital as with conventional funding
- 2007-2009 financial crisis took toll on ABCP market
	- While ABCP had become popular for regulatory arbitrage,  off balance sheet structures often did not reduce issuing bank's risk
	- Via liquidity guarantees much of risk would come back to haunt banks
	- In summer 2007,  ABCP outstanding began precipitous decline triggered by growing concerns about subprime and other mortgage default risks
- ABCP market collapse also created problems for money market mutual funds (MMFs) investing trillions on behalf of individuals,  pension funds,  municipalities,  businesses
	- MMF investments are close substitutes for bank deposits from investor standpoint
	- Many MMFs invested in ABCP,  met investor withdrawal demands by selling ABCP in liquid market prior to 2007
	- As liquidity drained from market during crisis,  difficult for MMFs to meet investor withdrawal demands
	- To help MMFs cope and preclude further downward pressure on ABCP prices due to MMF fire sales,  Federal Reserve established Asset-Backed [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)
- Important securitization goal is to enable borrower to raise cash now against PV of future cash flows,  rather than waiting for future cash flows to materialize
	- As long as [[Week 5 Accounting Recap- R&D, Intangibles, M&A & Goodwill#INTANGIBLE AMORTIZATION AND NON‐GAAP REPORTING|intangible]] asset has potential to generate future cash flows,  should be able to securitize it

## GOING BEYOND PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON ECONOMIC MOTIVATION: THE "WHY,  " "WHAT,  " AND "HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH" OF SECURITIZATION

### WHY?
- Purpose is to examine economics of securitization in more detail

#### THE SUPPLY SIDE OF SECURITIZATION: ISSUER'S PROSPECTIVE COSTS
- Primary issuer costs are administrative
	- Legal fees
	- Investment banking fees
	- Rating agencies' fees
- Other costs include:
	- Costs of communicating information to investors
	- Cost of credit enhancement

#### ISSUER'S PROSPECTIVE BENEFITS
- Numerous potential issuer benefits:
	 - 1. Management of Interest-Rate Risk
		- By securitizing some assets,  bank or thrift may better manage interest-rate risk
		- e.g. S&L holding fixed-rate residential mortgages with 27.5 year average stated maturity,  mostly time and savings deposit liabilities maturing in less than a year
			- Enormous maturity mismatch creates substantial interest-rate risk
			- To reduce exposure,  S&L could securitize mortgage pool using pass-through method
				- Takes assets off books,  shortens average asset maturity
				- Still allows S&L to service loans and earn servicing fee
		- Another form of interest-rate risk is prepayment risk,  also reducible by securitizing
			- Can replace portfolio mortgages with pass-throughs and CMOs for diversification
			- CMO helps protect against prepayment risk
		- S&L could also attempt to lengthen average liability maturity,  further reducing asset-liability maturity gap
			- Can do this by issuing mortgage-backed bonds and pay-throughs
				- Mortgage loans remain on S&L's balance sheet but average liability maturity effectively increased as mortgage-backed bond has 5-12 year average maturity
		- Of course,  S&L can hedge exposure through other,  more conventional means (swaps,  options,  futures)
	1. Increased Liquidity
		- Securitization can improve issuer's liquidity
		- Obvious reason: assets untraded prior to securitization are traded in active secondary markets after; issuer holds more liquid assets even if retaining any portion of securitized portfolio
		- Asset is liquid if it can be sold quickly without much loss relative to "true" value
			- Rules out large gap in seller's information about asset's future prospects and potential buyer's information about those prospects
		- Active trading improves asset's liquidity by providing profit incentives for potential buyers to produce information about asset

## GOING BEYOND PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON ECONOMIC MOTIVATION: THE "WHY,  " "WHAT,  " AND "HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH" OF SECURITIZATION (CONTINUED)

### WHY? (CONTINUED)

#### ISSUER'S PROSPECTIVE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)
1. Facilitates the Avoidance of "Adverse Selection" Costs (continued)
	- Key element of benefit of avoiding adverse selection costs is securitization through SPCs often achieves "bankruptcy remoteness" of securitized assets from borrowing firm
		- Claims of lenders providing financing to SPC cannot subsequently be diluted by claims of Debtor-in-Possession lenders to sponsoring firm should sponsor file for bankruptcy
	- However,  bankruptcy remoteness protection for SPC investors not perfect,  can be undermined in legal proceedings
		- Expect greater legal risk of [[Course Notes/HBR Notes/A Strategic Perspective on Bankruptcy|bankruptcy]] remoteness being undermined by courts,  higher interest rates demanded by SPC investors
1. Intermediation Taxes
	- Securitization permits depository institution to raise funds directly from investors rather than depositors,  helps avoid "intermediation taxes" (regulatory taxes) like reserve and capital requirements and deposit insurance premiums
	- Benefit obvious in case of pass-through as relevant assets removed from institution's balance sheet,  eliminating need to hold capital against those assets
	- Since pass-through sale proceeds not deposits,  no reserve requirements or deposit-insurance premiums involved
	- Many regulatory taxes (e.g. reserve requirements) traditionally flat taxes not depending on asset riskiness
		- "Pooling" of taxes across asset risk spectrum,  actual taxes correspond to some average
		- Low-risk assets (which should have lower-than-average taxes) "subsidize" high-risk assets (which should have higher-than-average taxes)
	- Bank can lessen impact of taxes by securitizing low-risk assets and leaving only high-risk assets on books
		- Would have higher-than-average risk assets on books,  but only pay taxes corresponding to average risk

#### THE DEMAND SIDE OF SECURITIZATION: INVESTOR'S PERSPECTIVE
- One way for investors to invest in bank's assets (e.g. loans) is to purchase bank equity
- Relative to that,  purchasing securitized claims offers possible advantages:
	1. Reduction in Market Incompleteness
		- Two ways securitization helps reduce market incompleteness:
			1. Improves quality of assets investors can hold,  increasing quality spectrum of available assets
				- Claims institution offers investors via securitization often of higher credit quality than institution itself due to:
					- Incentives for institution to securitize both lower risk and less information-sensitive assets
					- Credit enhancement improving quality of securitized asset pool
				- Not surprising most of asset-backed market is triple-A or double-A rated
				- Securitization provides investors access to higher credit quality claims than available otherwise
			1. Provides greater variety of cash-flow streams investors can hold
				- Because securitization combines pooling,  cash-flow partitioning,  credit enhancement,  does not merely produce linear combination of existing payoff vectors
				- Produces claims previously unavailable to investors through linear combinations of existing claims
				- Even for claims that could have been "home-manufactured" by investors willing to combine available securities,  securitization provides less-expensive alternative in terms of transaction costs
				- e.g. ABS have limited prepayment risk,  so effective maturity relatively insensitive to market yields
					- For given yield decline,  "positive" convexity and limited prepayment features may not be available in same configurations to investors in nonsecuritized alternatives
				- Securitization helps reduce financial market incompleteness
	1. Liquidity
		- Due to ABS market size and active trading,  investors assured they are buying liquid claim
		- Securitization may be viewed as alternative technology (to traditional funding) for producing liquidity

### WHAT? SECURITIZATION WITH RECOURSE VERSUS DEPOSITS AND RISK SHARING
- Concept of recourse key to understanding what securitization does for originator and investor
- When securitization without recourse,  investor has claim only against securitized asset pool,  no claim to originator's other assets
- Securitization with recourse closely resembles traditional balance sheet lending
	- Purchaser of security with recourse has option of trading claim for general bank claim like uninsured depositor should purchased asset default
	- If bank fails,  investor has option of keeping securitized asset
- Securitization benefits similar to those created by multiclass securities issuing sequential claims against same collateral pool
	- Better risk sharing achieved as most risk-averse investors can be sold most senior claims
- Under current law,  banks not allowed to issue multiclass or senior deposit claims against balance sheet assets (deposit claims cannot be prioritized)
	- From bank's perspective,  valuable opportunity to cater to "preference clienteles" among potential depositor base is lost
- However,  securitization with recourse gives bank opportunity to profit from selectively catering to depositors with different risk aversion degrees
	- Uninsured depositors can switch to contract giving them senior claim on part of bank's asset portfolio (securitized assets) and recourse to bank's other assets
- To see this,  consider following model:
	- Bank has $1 in deposits,     of which $d_i is insured and $d_u is uninsured
	- Bank has $1 in loans with stochastic payoff A(θ) at t=1,  where θ is a random variable representing the state of nature
	- Insured depositors are paid r_f,  the riskless rate
	- Uninsured depositors are promised B,  to be paid at t=1
	- Deposit insurance premium is zero
	- Bank maximizes expected profit at t=1
	- Uninsured depositors are risk averse and seek to maximize expected utility
- Bank's expected profit is:
	- E[π(θ)] = E[A(θ) - [1+r_f]d_i - D(θ)]
	- where D(θ) is what the uninsured depositors are paid in state θ
- Uninsured depositors' expected utility is:
	- E[U(D(θ))]
- Optimal contract between bank and uninsured depositors solves:
	- max E[π(θ)] subject to E[U(D(θ))] ≥ U_0
	- where U_0 is uninsured depositors' reservation utility
- Solution to this problem is:
	- D(θ) = B if A(θ) ≥ B + [1+r_f]d_i
	- D(θ) = A(θ) / [B + [1+r_f]d_i] otherwise
	- F(θ) = [[1+r_f]d_i] / [B + [1+r_f]d_i] × A(θ)
	- where F(θ) is what the insured depositors are paid in state θ
- To incorporate securitization into this model,  partition bank's assets into two portfolios:
	- Balance sheet portfolio A_b
	- Off-balance sheet portfolio A_o
- Loans in A_b funded with insured deposits and equity,  adding up to d_i + d_e dollars
- Loans in A_o funded with securitized bonds fetching bank $d_u
- Two portfolios combined give same payoff as before: A(θ) = A_b(θ) + A_o(θ)
- Assume bank continues to service loans' securities,  directing loan payment receipts to depositors
- Key feature of new arrangement is receipts from A_o(θ) committed to repay securitized bonds first
	- Only after these bonds fully paid off can revenues be directed elsewhere
	- Securitized bondholder has senior claim on A_o(θ) payment stream
- Adding securitized bond option gives holder additional protection by allowing him to change claim to balance sheet liability if A_o(θ) revenues inadequate
	- In this case,  exercises claim just like uninsured depositor,  as A_o(θ) and A_b(θ) pooled together
	- When securitized bondholder exercises recourse option,  limited to prorata claim on total portfolio A(θ)

### HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH?
- Three main factors explain why there are still assets that have not been securitized:
	1. Ease of Standardization
		- For asset to be profitably securitized,  should be relatively easy to "standardize"
			- Contract features should make it component of relatively homogeneous portfolio of other similar assets
		- Mortgage loans excellent example
			- Contracts standardized,  cash-flow patterns on average quite predictable (was not always the case,  possibility of securitization prompted standardization)
		- Loans with special contract features (e.g. HLT loans,  some LBO loans secured partly by managers' personal collateral) difficult to standardize,  would be difficult to securitize (although have witnessed securitization of LBO loans)
		- Reason for desirability of contractual homogeneity related to transaction and information-processing costs
			- When large number of individual loans pooled,  investor only has to evaluate portfolio return
			- Creates "informational diversification" and "statistical risk diversification",  so portfolio cash flows more predictable and less sensitive to individual asset peculiarities
			- Eases originator's/issuer's problem of designing specific securities based on total portfolio cash flow
			- Makes it easier for investors to evaluate securitized asset values
			- Attracts larger number of investors,  improves liquidity of securitized asset market
		- More heterogeneous and information-sensitive assets,  more difficult to standardize,  can be securitized but would require greater credit enhancements
			- Limiting case is "full-recourse" securitization
			- When portfolio assets very dissimilar and difficult to standardize,  portfolio cash flows quite sensitive to actual choice of securities in portfolio
			- More credit enhancement needed for such portfolio,  beyond some point may not be worthwhile for originator to purchase required credit enhancement
		- Without appropriate credit enhancement,  rating agencies and investors have to study individual portfolio securities more
		- Standardization can be viewed as conserving originator's capital in that high credit rating can be obtained for portfolio with less credit enhancement
	1. Extent of Private Information
		- Another important consideration is extent of private information about asset
		- If loan originator has substantial information about loan that others do not have,  information communication costs might deter securitization
		- Related to homogeneity in that information-sensitive assets more difficult to standardize
		- But even if loan portfolio homogeneous,  may be costly to securitize if each loan steeped in originator's private information
		- Truly "opaque" assets usually difficult to sell at anywhere close to true value
			- Steep discounts may be needed to entice investors to buy assets they do not fully understand
			- May not benefit originator to securitize such assets
		- e.g. Would be difficult to securitize and sell in U.S. a portfolio of consumer loans made by local Nigerian bank,  particularly if reliable historical repayment statistics unavailable
		- By contrast,  U.S. credit-card receivables relatively easy to securitize in U.S.
			- Only cursory initial screening of applicants,  so not much lender knows that others do not
			- Contract itself fairly standardized,  repayment patterns of credit card portfolios quite predictable
		- Similar argument holds for consumer mortgages
			- Screening procedures for determining who gets mortgage loan are standardized
			- Once person given mortgage contract,  falls in pool about which original lender knows little more than rating agencies and investors
		- One important implication of how private information affects assets chosen for securitization is quality of assets on bank balance sheets may deteriorate
			- Assets securitized are typically more liquid
			- Assets staying on books likely to be less liquid and have other problems
			- Bank may prefer to keep these lower-quality assets on books as may be able to sell them only at steep discounts relative to "true" values privately known only to bank
			- Since often inverse relationship between liquidity and risk,  bank's portfolio risk may increase due to securitization
			- Mitigating this concern is fact banks can diversify by buying securitized claims against loans originated by others
	1. Moral Hazard
		- With traditional lending,  original lender combines origination,  underwriting,  funding,  servicing of loan,  then has incentive to monitor loan
		- With securitization,  origination and funding separated,  weakening originator's incentive to monitor securitized portfolio loans
			- Reason is monitoring costly to originator,  benefits (improvement in securitized portfolio cash flows) accrue to investors purchasing securities,  not originator
		- In this context,  traditional bank can be seen as solution to moral hazard that can accompany loan decomposition
		- Obvious solution is to shift some credit risk back to originator by employing securitization with partial recourse,  placing exposure with party responsible for monitoring,  reducing moral hazard
		- However,  recourse raises other accounting/regulatory problems
			- Recall one strong securitization incentive comes from capital and reserve requirements,  deposit insurance premiums,  other costs adding estimated 125 basis points to deposit-takers' funding costs
			- If loans securitized with recourse,  not usually removed from books,  so none of regulatory costs avoided
		- Originator can utilize alternatives to recourse to deal with moral hazard without keeping loans on books
			- Senior/subordinated structures,  overcollateralization,  third-party guarantees can all provide credit enhancement to attenuate moral hazard
		- Credit enhancement deals with moral hazard in two ways:
			1. Directly improves securitized asset credit quality,  so investors less affected by originator's underwriting and monitoring quality
			1. Creates incentive for credit enhancer to monitor originator to ensure originator is underwriting and monitoring securitized portfolio loans
		- Can expect credit enhancer to be specialized in monitoring and thus monitor originator more efficiently than individual investors can
		- Just as bank saves on monitoring costs by centralizing monitoring activity and avoiding duplication of efforts,  credit enhancer can save on monitoring costs that would otherwise be greater due to duplicated monitoring by individual investors
		- However,  natural limits to gains from credit enhancement since marginal effectiveness of credit enhancer's monitoring will expectedly decline with more monitoring (diminishing returns to scale)
			- Will be reflected in fee charged to originator by credit enhancer
			- Depending on asset nature (particularly cash flow sensitivity to originator's monitoring) and level of credit enhancement sought,  point may be reached beyond which further credit enhancement not justified from originator's standpoint
		- There may be assets better for originator to fund with deposits than to securitize and credit enhance up to optimal limit,  due to moral hazard
		- Some types of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans unlikely candidates for securitization,  although anticipate this to be shrinking list
			- Loans whose values highly dependent on lender monitoring usually subject to great deal of moral hazard
			- Such loans difficult to securitize as required credit enhancement would be too costly
			- Unpredictability in originating lender's monitoring quality may lead to much unpredictability in cash flows generated by such loans
			- Would expect,  on moral hazard grounds,  such loans to be securitized infrequently
## STRATEGIC ISSUES FOR A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INVOLVED IN SECURITIZATION
- Securitization is technology for liquefying claims and diversifying funding sources management by banks and other financial institutions
### SECURITIZATION AS A BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT TOOL
- As already seen,  securitization can be used by financial institution to manage variety of risks:
	- Interest rate risk
	- Prepayment risk
	- Credit risk
	- Liquidity risk
- Most loan sales and loan participations involve sales without explicit recourse to originating lender,  so all risks listed above sold off together
- In ABS market,  recourse much more common,  so only some risks disposed of by seller
	- Reason for difference not hard to see
		- Loan sales and participations involve banks dealing with each other or other financial institutions quite capable of assessing risks involved and ensuring adequate monitoring,  so recourse with its associated regulatory costs avoided
		- But securitization involves financial institution dealing with smaller investors who must be reassured through recourse that adequate monitoring will be provided
- Management implication is financial institution must carefully balance gains from laying off risk through securitization (without recourse) against cost of securitizing
	- On one hand,  deposit funding (alternative to securitization) has interest cost plus regulatory cost
	- On other hand,  securitization involves fixed cost (legal costs plus distribution costs) plus credit-enhancement cost (function of asset pool heterogeneity and information sensitivity)
	- These alternative funding mode costs will determine institution's choices about which assets to securitize and how much recourse to offer buyers
	- As seen earlier,  very "opaque" assets may be hard to securitize
		- Institution may prefer to either involve other lenders in participation arrangement or fund entirely by itself
	- In other words,  balance sheet funding chosen when financial institution has comparative advantage in "piercing the veil" of "opaque" asset but finds it difficult to explain its value to investors

### SECURITIZATION AS A PRICING TOOL
- With easier entry into banking,  over past several years banks have had to come up with ways to cope with greater price competition
	- While banks must be competitive,  also must make sure pricing at profitable levels
	- Some banks attempt this by setting minimum interest rate at which they will originate loans ("minimum buy rate")
		- Set at estimated cost of funding loans plus spread providing minimum acceptable return
	- Unfortunately,  banks often cannot precisely determine real funding cost of any particular asset
		- Many use rough approximations based on average overall cost of funds
- Securitization can help bank improve pricing accuracy
	- If bank continually putting originated assets into securitized pool,  can base pricing directly on funding costs for that asset
		- Ensures consistent market-driven pricing and guarantees bank always originating assets at profitable spread
	- Since securitization helps originating bank avoid reserve and capital requirement costs,  may provide competitive advantage over nonsecuritizing bank competitors
		- Permits bank to either lower prices and increase market share,  or earn higher profit margins at current prices

### SECURITIZATION AS A STRATEGIC WEAPON FOR MARKET PENETRATION AND DIVERSIFICATION

#### MARKET PENETRATION
- Suppose after thorough analysis of comparative advantage in specific markets,  bank decides optimal strategy is to be price leader in given market and expand market share
	- But worried substantial risk that rapidly changing market conditions could mean net interest margin (difference between loan rate and bank's funding cost) fluctuates randomly,  sometimes falling below minimum required return on allocated capital
- Randomness in future interest margin means strategically motivated continuity may prove quite costly
	- Could force bank to suffer periodic losses to retain market foothold
	- Form of underinvestment problem - may be forced to forgo investment due to short-run costs,  even though continued presence may be best in long run
- Suppose bank has targeted market for high-quality,  low-margin auto loans
	- Could establish participation in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] program into which these loans can be periodically placed
	- Pricing on auto loans can be adjusted daily to be in tune with market conditions
	- Can determine margin on any loan at origination,  compute profitability of funding loan with deposits vs. through participation in [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] program
		- If loan unprofitable with either deposit funding or securitization alternative,  may want to let lending opportunity pass
		- If most profitable to fund loan with deposits,  could mark it to be held on bank's balance sheet
		- But if loan unprofitable to fund with deposits,  rather than pass up lending opportunity,  could examine whether profitable to securitize loan
			- Will be instances where securitization (at [[Class Note 12 - Commercial Paper#Class Note 12 – Commercial Paper|Commercial Paper]] cost) profitable even when balance sheet lending is not
- Thus,  bank can ensure greater continuity of presence in strategically chosen market segment by resorting to securitization
	- In essence,  an argument for maintaining numerous funding sources even when there is fixed cost to doing so
	- Such strategy could also be motivated for liquidity reasons

#### DIVERSIFICATION
- Yet there seems to be trend toward increased concentration in loan portfolios
	- Reason is increasing competition has forced banks to carve out competitive niches to maintain profit margins
	- Banks have specialized lending in markets where they have comparative advantage
		- Leads quite naturally to geographic or industry concentration,  or both
	- Conflict arises between specialization and diversification
- Securitization can rescue loan portfolios from underdiversification by permitting banks to overcome geographic limitations
	- Banks can originate and service loans to borrowers about whom they know more than others
		- Rewards for superior knowledge reflected in higher spreads and profit margins
	- But no need to sacrifice diversification by also funding these loans
		- Originating bank can securitize some loans,  free up capital to pursue other lending opportunities and diversify
		- Bank can also purchase loans securitized by banks specializing in other industries and geographical areas,  facilitating diversification

## COMPARISON OF LOAN SALES AND LOAN SECURITIZATION
- Loan sale,  considered in Chapter 9,  similar to asset securitization with three basic differences:
	1. Loan sale merely transfers part of loan portfolio ownership from originator to others,  whereas securitization alters cash flow patterns and other asset properties
		- Loan sale is brokerage function,  securitization involves qualitative asset transformation
	1. With securitization,  claims against asset sold as securities in capital market so original loans converted into market-traded securities
		- With loan sale,  asset merely transferred from one bank to other without material qualitative transformation
	1. Most loan sales made without explicit recourse to seller
		- Unlike securitization,  usually no guarantees,  insurance,  or other explicit credit enhancement
			- Although portion of loan retained by originator functions somewhat like credit enhancement in attenuating moral hazard
		- Loan sale usually removes loan permanently from seller's balance sheet
- One striking difference between loan sales and securitization:
	- With loan sale to another bank,  asset stays within banking industry
	- With securitization,  asset converted into capital market investment
- However,  loan sales and securitization provide bank with similar advantages in terms of strategic choices
	- Bank's ability to specialize in originating,  servicing,  monitoring loans to borrowers in specific regions and industries can be put to profitable use without compromising diversification objectives,  when bank designs and implements comprehensive loan sales and asset-securitization program
