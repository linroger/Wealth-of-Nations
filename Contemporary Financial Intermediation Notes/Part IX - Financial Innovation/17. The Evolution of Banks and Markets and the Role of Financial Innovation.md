# The Evolution of Banks and Markets and the Role of Financial Innovation  

“Finance is wholly different from the rest of the economy.”  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Bank-Based Economies Economies where funding (credit) comes primarily from banks in the form of loans, and investors allocate a large share of savings as deposits in banks.  

Commercial Letter of Credit A payment guarantee conditional upon successful delivery of goods or services by a seller. A financial institution that issues a commercial letter of credit guarantees that the seller of the goods and services is paid even if the buyer fails to make payment.  

Financial-Market-Based Economies Economies with a financial system that relies predominantly on the financial market for the allocation of credit. Compared to bank-based systems, corporations depend more on funding directly through the financial markets and investors allocate more of their savings to investments rather than bank deposits.  

Relationship Banking The provision of financial services by a financial intermediary that invests in obtaining customer-specific information with the expectation that this information will be used over multiple transactions. The bank develops a relationship with the borrower that often generates proprietary and qualitative (“soft”) information, and it leads the bank to evaluate the profitability of the customer across products and over time, as opposed to on a single product or transaction in a single time period.  

Securitization A process of pooling assets and then selling differentiated liquid claims against the cash flows generated by the asset pool.  

Soft Information Information that is more qualitative and based on judgment, hence difficult to quantify.  

Transaction Banking The provision of financial services with a focus on individual transactions based on readily quantifiable (hard) information.  

# INTRODUCTION  

In Chapter 3 we explained how a financial system fosters economic growth. This chapter further elaborates on the financial system and its links with the real economy focusing on the relationship between banks and markets. Financial innovations and the recent growth of the financial sector are central parts of this discussion. We also address the differences between the Anglo-Saxon market-based financial systems found in the United States and the United Kingdom and the bank-based financial system that is common in continental Europe.  

# FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT  

Why does financial development matter for economic growth? In a frictionless world in which there are no informational asymmetries or transaction costs, financial development is uninteresting in the sense that it has little effect on economic growth. In such a world, there are no impediments to optimal resource allocation, so real resources can be efficiently allocated without the assistance of financial institutions and financial markets. In a sense, this takes us all the way back to Chapter 3  where we discussed the conditions under which financial intermediaries add economic value. We need similar conditions for financial development to matter for economic growth. That is, financial development matters because of economic frictions, and financial development mitigates their effects by lowering the cost of capital and increasing access to capital for individuals and companies.  

# Financial Development and Economic Growth  

The empirical evidence shows that there is a strong positive link between economic growth and financial development. For example, a landmark study based on data for 1860–1963 concludes that periods of more rapid economic growth go hand in hand with an above average rate of financial development.1 An interesting question here is one of causality: does financial development drive economic growth, or does economic growth lead to better financial development, or do economic growth and financial development both tend to move in the same direction because they are both similarly affected by some other force such as climate, geographic location, the work ethic of its people or its sociopolitical system? Our interest in financial development is obviously greatest if financial development leads to economic growth. There has been some disagreement on this. Some have argued in favor of a causal relationship, meaning that financial development leads to economic growth,2 whereas others have maintained that financial development is largely a consequence of economic development.3  

Research leading up to the 2007–2009 financial crisis seemed to settle the issue, at least for the time being, in favor of financial market development causally affecting economic growth, with some nuances related to the causality running in both directions.4 This conclusion implies that a slow adjustment and development in the financial sector will hinder economic growth as a sluggish financial system may not meet the changing needs of the real economy. From this perspective, it would seem obvious that financial development is generally beneficial. Recent evidence, however, has shown that it is not necessarily the case that greater financial development is always unambiguously beneficial for the economy.  

# “Too much” Financial Development?  

Financial development is important for growth because financial instruments lubricate economic activity. For example, when banks reduced the availability of commercial letters of credit in 2007–2009, world trade shrank considerably.  

Nonet heless, some have wondered whether the pursuit of self-interest in the financial sector hurts economic growth by providing excessive liquidity to some sectors and causing price bubbles or crowding out of desirable economic activities.5 Recent decades, have seen a substantial increase in the percentage of GDP coming from financial services. The question then is whether this is crowding out other sectors or it is simply an inevitable consequence of economic growth. Figure 17.1 shows a marked growth in the financial sector in the years leading up to the financial crisis.

FIGURE 17.2 Relative Wage and Excess Wage in Finance in the United States. (Source: Philippon and Reshef (2012); the relative wage in finance is computed as the ratio of the average wage in finance with respect to the average wage in the nonfarm private sector; excess wage denotes how much the relative wage in finance exceeds the average skill-adjusted average wage).  

If crowding out plays a role, then this growth in the financial sector may have come at the expense of other sectors of the economy. Also more indirect types of “crowding out” are possible. For example, talented MBA students as well as physicists and mathematicians increasingly chose careers in banking during 2003–2007, thereby diverting talent from other sectors. Even within the financial sector, resources might have been diverted from more to less valuable activities, for example, from relationship banking to trading activities.  

Figure 17.2 shows that wages in the financial sector have outpaced those in other sectors. Figure 17.3 below shows the growth in credit intermediation in the United States.  

Many countries came to see the financial sector as a growth engine of their economies and chose to allocate scarce public resources to subsidizing this sector. To the extent that these investments were at the expense of other sectors, another crowding out took place.

# FINANCIAL INNOVATION  

What is financial innovation? It is the creation of a new financial claim, institution, market, business practice, or process for distributing financial services. Securitization is an example. It is an alternative way of selling assets to investors. In contrast to other forms of innovation, most financial innovations are not patented.  

The notion that financial innovation is good for economic growth is based on the idea that improvement in the allocation of capital or distribution of risk will follow. In the words of former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, “The increasing sophistication and depth of financial markets promote economic growth by allocating capital where it can be most productive.”  Hence, the growth in debt, equity. and derivatives markets should not be surprising. See Figure 17.4  

# Financial Innovation and Risk Sharing  

Financial innovations – like the introduction of interest rate futures or credit default swaps – make it easier for investors to fine-tune their risk exposures, that is, better match risk and return to preferences.7 This improved risk-management ability facilitates investment.  

Similarly, the tradability of debt and equity allows investors to liquefy their holdings and helps in diversifying risks. Firms therefore might improve their access to financing. The desire to liquefy claims also helps explain the introduction of limited liability contracts like equity – an innovation in itself. Limited liability facilitates trading, and therefore promotes the liquidity of claims.  

# Lemons Problem  

New types of securities are sometimes introduced to overcome information asymmetries. An ordinary debt claim might offer financing at lower cost than equity because it is less information sensitive. An equity claim might suffer from a “lemons problem” in that firms might have an incentive to sell overvalued equity to exploit less informed investors, and recognizing this, investors may price the equity accordingly that could then lead to a market failure.8 Note that this problem can be avoided if the true value of a firm can be verified at a reasonable cost, in which case low-cost equity financing might be available. The costly-state-verification literature has focused on ex-post verification in the presence of sizable verification costs. A debt claim may help since with debt (contrary to equity) verification is not always needed. That is, if debt is repaid, there is no need to verify. If not, one needs to verify whether there is indeed a lack of resources. Having a debt contract in conjunction with a third party, for example, a bankruptcy court that can impose a severe penalty on the firm if it falsely claims insufficiency of funds, can solve the misrepresentation problem. Note that in the case of external equity, there is no fixed payment and verification is always needed. The upshot of this is that a debt security can be seen as a valueenhancing financial innovation to help facilitate access to funding in an environment in which it is costly for investors to verify the firm’s actual cash flows.9

FIGURE 17.4 Nominal Amounts of World Equity, Bonds, and Derivatives Markets in USD Trillion. (Source: World Federation of Exchanges, http:/ www.world-exchanges.org/statistics).  

Various other approaches to mitigate problems of information asymmetry are available. For example, a rights issue could help solve the lemons problem. With a rights offering, existing shareholders get the right to buy newly issued shares, which are typically offered at a discount relative to the market price. If only existing shareholders buy the new shares, pricing is not that important. Why? Observe that in a nonrights secondary offering, when shares are publicly issued at a price that is too low, new shareholders get a windfall at the expense of existing shareholders. With a rights issue, the new shares are reserved for purchase by the existing shareholders, so it cannot trigger a wealth transfer. A rights issue may therefore allow the firm to raise new equity in circumstances in which a public equity issue would be subject to a lemons problem and may therefore have been infeasible.  

Still other financial innovations can resolve agency- and asymmetric information problems. For example, convertible bonds give bondholders protection against risk-seeking behavior by shareholders. The idea is that when a lot of debt exists, new debt financing might not be available because it might induce shareholders to favor excessive risk at the expense of the bondholders (see Chapter 1 for a discussion of moral hazard). That is, shareholders’ leveraged claim provides them an expanded upside potential if risks work out, while the downside is borne by the debtholders. Thus, debt may result in riskshifting moral hazard. With convertible debt, bondholders share in the upside if risks work out (because they can convert to equity). As a consequence, incentives are better aligned.  

# Regulatory Arbitrage  

Financial innovations are often motivated by regulatory and transaction costs. Regulatory arbitrage refers to innovations designed to circumvent the costs of public regulation. Innovations could also be aimed at reducing other transaction costs that impede trade. For example, credit default swaps (CDS) may improve the allocation of capital by improving the distribution of credit risk. However, from 2003 to 2008, the growth in OTC derivatives outpaced real investment by a factor of twelve.10 And after 2006, real investments stagnated while OTC derivatives continued to grow faster than ever (see Figures 17.5 and 17.6). While the outsized growth of OTC derivatives, especially credit default swaps, in the period preceding the 2007–2009 crisis (the Great Recession) may have continued to serve a useful risk sharing purpose, the growth of this market also contributed to the financial system’s fragility.

# THE DARK SIDE OF FINANCIAL INNOVATION  

Financial innovation, although mightily useful, has a dark side as well. For example, financial institutions have been known to introduce exploitatively complex products with obscure cost structures, and it is not clear that the buyers of these products fully understand their costs and benefits. For example, in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, life insurance companies offered policies with high profit margins for the insurance companies that had tax advantages for the buyers of the policies and low initial prices as inducements for purchase, but with complex cost-benefit tradeoffs that many retail buyers failed to understand. In such cases, financial innovations worsen the allocation of capital. The more recent innovations in securitization could possibly be interpreted in that way. As indicated in Chapter 11  securitization provides diversification benefits, reduces funding costs, and hence produces benefits for originating banks, borrowers, and investors. As long as originators retain some exposure, they have an incentive to screen and monitor loan applicants. However, if the loan originators do not retain a portion of the risk associated with making loans, lending standards may suffer, as we saw during the 2007–2009 crisis.11 (The housing boom in the United States created a large number of mortgages that were securitized, creating complex mortgage-backed securities that obscured the risk and enabled originators and those who sold the securities to distribute over-priced securities.)  

The most noteworthy innovations associated with the 2007–2009 financial crisis, for example, CDOs, SIVs, and CDS, enhanced marketability. Private benefits were striking, but so were abuses that increased market fragility (see Chapter 14). Moreover, banks, became more enmeshed with financial markets, and therefore got caught up in the boom-and-bust cycles that often afflict financial markets.12 Table 17.1 summarizes the costs and benefits of financial innovation.

# BANKS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS  

The theory of financial intermediation emphasizes the role of banks in screening and monitoring borrowers in the process of lending. Bank lending is typically contrasted with direct funding via the financial markets. Banks are thought to be better than markets at resolving informational problems. By screening, banks weed out the less creditworthy borrowers. Without screening, lenders might demand higher interest rates to compensate for the presence of these less creditworthy borrowers, but this can induce adverse selection (see Chapter 1). In particular, the high interest rate would eventually attract only the riskiest borrowers and discourage the safest.13 Lenders would then predominantly fund risky borrowers, precisely what the lemons problem predicts. In contrast, banks that carefully screen potential borrowers can tailor their credit contracts to borrower characteristics as discussed in Chapter 2  Banks also monitor their borrowers after loans have been granted. Without monitoring, borrowers might be tempted toward risk taking, especially if the risk can be shifted to the lender. Monitoring of borrowers by lending banks mitigates a moral hazard.  

# Relationship Banking  

The intricate involvement of banks in lending is often referred to as relationship banking. Relationship banking is defined as the provision of financial services by a financial intermediary that invests in obtaining customer-specific information, often proprietary (meaning that it is not available to competing lenders) and more qualitative (“soft information”) in the context of a long-term interaction with its customers. There are thus three key aspects of relationship lending: a more direct value-enhancing involvement of the bank with its customers, repeated interactions, and the bank’s assessment of the profitability of the relationship over a long time horizon rather than in a single transaction. This contrasts with transaction banking – and/or deal making in the financial market – that focuses on individual transactions.  

As discussed in Chapters 7 and 8  relationship banking provides several benefits.14 Intertemporal smoothing of contract terms that would entail lender losses in the short term can be recouped later in the relationship. Credit subsidies to young companies may reduce moral hazards and informational frictions that banks face in lending to such borrowers. Banks may be willing to provide subsidized funding if they can expect to offset the initial losses through the long-term. Without access to subsidized credit early in their business lives, borrowers might forgo worthwhile projects. Relationship lending makes these loans feasible because the proprietary information generated ties the borrower to the bank and enables the bank to recoup its early subsidies to the borrower through higher profits later in the relationship.15  

A second benefit of relationship lending is contractual flexibility unobtainable in the financial market. The proximity to customers that characterizes relationship banking generates and also allows the use of soft information. The intimate involvement with its customers gives the bank the ability to adjust contractual terms with the arrival of new information and hence encourages more fine-tuned contracts ex ante that also leave room for ex-post adjustments.  

# Value of Soft Information  

Soft information can be seen as more qualitative and nuanced and noncontractible information (e.g., information about “character” – see Chapter 7). Because it is costly, proprietary soft information is the bedrock or glue of the durable relationship between the bank and its borrower. Moreover, because soft information is not readily transferable, shifting banks can prove costly for the borrower. This allows for implicit – nonenforceable – long-term contracting. Proprietary information is thought to be more readily protectable in a bank–borrower relationship. Therefore, both the bank and the borrower may realize the added value of their relationship.  

The borrower–lender proximity and mutual dependence may also have a dark side. An important one is the hold-up problem that stems from the information monopoly the bank may develop due to the generation of proprietary borrower information during the relationship. Such an informational monopoly may permit the bank to exploit borrowers. The threat of being “locked in,” or informationally captured by the bank, may dampen loan demand ex ante  causing a loss of potentially valuable investment opportunities. Alternatively, firms may opt for multiple bank relationships. This may reduce the informational monopoly of any individual bank, but possibly at a cost in terms of the availability and cost of credit. Essentially, this introduces competition in the bank-borrower relationship. In the “Insight box”, we expand on the potential effects that competition has on relationship banking.  

# Insight:  mpact of competition on relationship versus transaction banking  

Since relationship banking is often profitable, it also invites competitive entry. This potential competition should impact the incentives for relationship banking. Two conflicting points of view have emerged. One is that competition among financiers encourages borrowers to switch to other banks or to the financial market. The consequent shortening of the expected “life-span” of bank– borrower relationships may induce banks to reduce their relationship-specific (informational) investments. It then becomes more difficult for banks to “subsidize” borrowers in earlier periods in return for a share of the rents in the future. Thus, the funding role for banks in the case of young corporations may no longer be sustainable in the face of competition.  

Alternatively, competition may actually elevate the importance of a relationship-orientation because it puts the bank in a stronger competitive position. Since competition pressures profit margins on existing products it increases the importance of differentiation. More intense relationship lending may be one way for the bank to differentiate. A more competitive environment may then encourage banks to become more client-driven and customize services, thus generating a stronger focus on relationship banking.16  

The impact of competition on relationship banking is complex; several effects need to be disentangled. However, empirical evidence seems to support the prediction that the nature of relationship banking adapts to increasing interbank competition, so higher competition does not drive out relationship lending.17 There is also evidence that in recent years, the geographic distance between borrowers and lenders has increased, and this has been accompanied by higher loan defaults.18  

The other dimension is related to the structure of the explicit contracts that banks can write. Because banks write more discretionary contracts, bank loans are more flexible and generally easier to renegotiate than bond issues or other public capital market contracts. This has obvious benefits in an environment in which information is changing rapidly. However, renegotiability may be a mixed blessing because it creates what has been called the “soft budget constraint” problem. This problem refers to the fact that the borrower, rationally anticipating that its loan will be renegotiated if it is financially distressed, has a weaker incentive to avoid excessive risk or to take the hard and costly steps to reduce the probability of such states of financial distress. This worsens the moral hazard in the bank–borrower relationship and increases the bank’s credit risk ex ante 19  

# Seniority and Bargaining Power  

If the bank has priority/seniority over other lenders, its bargaining position is enhanced. The bank can therefore more credibly intervene in the decision process of the borrower. For example, the bank might believe that the firm’s strategy is flawed, or a restructuring is long overdue. Without bank priority, the borrower may choose to ignore the bank’s wishes. To see this, note that the bank could threaten to call the loan, but such a threat may lack credibility if the bank has low priority because the benefits of liquidating the borrower’s assets are greater for higher-priority lenders and the costs from the termination of the borrower’s business are higher for lower-priority lenders. The borrower will therefore understand that without priority, the bank’s costs may outweigh the benefits of calling back the loan. When the bank loan has sufficiently high priority, the bank can credibly threaten to call the loan, and this may mitigate the negative effects of lender discretion in calling back the loan.  

This identifies a potential advantage of bank financing: timely intervention. Of course, one could ask whether bondholders could be given priority and allocated the task of timely intervention. However, bondholders typically have less borrower information than banks and relatedly hold smaller stakes. This makes them ill-suited for timely intervention.  

In Table 17.2  we have summarized the various arguments for and against relationship banking.  

TABLE 17.2 Advantage and Drawbacks of Relationship Banking Relative to Financial Markets Funding   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Advantages</td><td>Drawbacks</td><td>Solutions</td></tr><tr><td>Intensive information acquisition: · Monitoring contains moral hazard problem · Screening mitigates adverse selection problem</td><td>Soft budget constraint problem</td><td>Priority of claims (higher seniority for the bank) enables banks to intervene in a more timely (and credible) manner in case of financial distress</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term relationship allows for ·Intertemporal smoothing ·Flexibility · Confidentiality and proprietary information</td><td>Hold-up problem</td><td>Choose relationships with multiple banks and obtain easier access to alternative financing sources</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# BANK VERSUS MARKET: COMPLEMENTARITIES AND SHADOW BANKING  

In contrast to the standard view that banks and financial markets compete, the previous section suggests that there are also complementarities between bank lending and capital market funding. We argued that prioritized bank debt may facilitate timely intervention. This feature of bank lending is valuable to the firm’s bondholders as well. They might find it optimal to have bank debt take priority over their own claims because this efficiently delegates the timely intervention task to the bank. The bondholders will obviously ask to be compensated for their subordinated status. In other words, the priority and subordination features will be priced. Consequently, the borrower may reduce its total funding cost by accessing both the bank-credit market and the financial market.20  

Banks and markets compete to be sure, but the view now is that they exhibit two other forms of interaction: they complement each other, and they coevolve. We discussed competition and complementarity above. Coevolution occurs because a more developed financial market makes it cheaper for the bank to fund itself. Banks then have stronger incentives and resources to invest in intermediation technologies that then helps them evolve.21  

# Securitization Connects Banks and Markets  

Securitization connects banks and markets in various ways. A bank originates loans against which asset-backed securities are issued and sold in the market, so that market-based financing replaces deposit funding of the bank’s loans. The bank thus relies on the market to get these loans “off its books.” The market in turn relies on the bank to originate loans against which asset-backed securities are created to satisfy the demand for these securities from investors. This way, securitization fosters an interaction between banks and markets.  

# Fragility and Securitization  

Before the 2007–2009 financial crisis, securitization was rapidly gaining in importance. Securitization became prevalent for ever-wider types of credits including business credits which were previously thought to be difficult to securitize because of their opacity. Also, a new market for securitization involving asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits emerged as a significant force. But the subprime crisis of 2007–2009 and the accompanying Great Recession exposed some of the most striking vulnerabilities of securitizations. One of the major vulnerabilities that securitization exposed was how much fragility maturity mismatching can generate, especially when opaque assets are financed with very short-maturity market-based funding. Nonrenewal of short-term funding due to solvency concerns about opaque and risky assets creates liquidity risk. While this liquidity risk was mitigated to some extent by liquidity guarantees (standby letters of credit and refinancing commitments), the underwriting institutions often underestimated the risks involved and overstretched themselves.22 Unfortunately, a useful technology was seriously impugned because risks were underestimated and there were also incentive conflicts and abuses. In retrospect, it is clear that financial contracts needed to be better designed and incentive conflicts at virtually every stage in the securitization process needed to be better handled.23

The 2007–2009 financial crisis significantly impaired the market for securitization. However, the risk diversification that securitization can accomplish remains. Thus, we expect securitization to re-emerge, albeit in a form that entails lower levels of liquidity risk, as well as reduced moral hazard in screening and monitoring.  

# ROLE OF CREDIT-RATING AGENCIES  

In the intersecting world of banks and financial markets, credit-rating agencies have become indispensable. Credit-rating agencies assess the creditworthiness of debt instruments issued by companies, banks, nonbank financial institutions, and governments and sells this information (see Table 17.3 and our discussion in Chapter 2). The three main credit-rating agencies (CRAs) are Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s (S&P), and Fitch Ratings.  

To see why CRAs exist, we can revisit their roles as diversified information producers that we discussed in Chapter 2 Another role that rating agencies play is influencing the firm’s future credit quality. For example, by putting a firm on a “watch list” (which indicates that a rating downgrade may occur in the near future) the CRA may induce the firm to undertake actions that arrest the possible deterioration in its credit quality.24 This role of CRAs means that they serve a role similar to that of banks in affecting the credit risks of borrowers.25 As CRAs become more sophisticated and reliable, their role as certifiers of credit quality is elevated, and the certification role of banks diminishes in relative importance, permitting bank borrowers to migrate to the capital market. In this sense, CRAs intensify the competition between banks and markets. But CRAs also pull banks into the capital market. For example, banks originate loans that they securitize, and then seek ratings for the securitized pools from CRAs. The ratings, in turn, facilitate the sale of (securitized) asset-backed securities.  

# Credit-Rating Agencies under Fire  

This rather positive interpretation of CRAs is clouded by events of the early twenty first century. In the 2001 crisis surrounding Enron, CRAs were accused of being strategically sluggish in downgrading. More recently, CRAs have been blamed for the 2007–2009 subprime crisis in which they were allegedly too lenient in rating mortgage-backed securities.26 Standard and Poor’s agreed to a $\$1.37$ billion settlement in connection with alleged misdeeds in their ratings of various structured finance claims during the Great Recession. Allegedly, the CRAs have an incentive to overstate the qualities of asset-backed claims because of the “issuer-pays” model in which they are paid by the conduit/distributors who benefit from the exaggeration of the quality of their securities. Competition among CRAs for the rating assignments induces CRAs to overstate credit qualities, goes the argument.  

Apart from concerns about conflicts of interest, the role of CRAs in securitization transactions has introduced financial stability concerns. Of particular concern are the so-called “rating triggers.” For example, some debt contracts may dictate accelerated repayments when the rating is downgraded. The consequences of such accelerated debt repayments might, however, be so severe as to give pause to the rating agencies. Complications also arise from the role played by the so-called “monoliners.” These are insurers that guarantee municipal bonds and also the lowest-risk tranches in securitizations. Monoline insurers are critical to the viability of many securitizations. However, the ability of the monoliners to issue credible guarantees depends on their having AAA ratings. This generates an interesting concatenation. In rating (and monitoring) the monoliners, CRAs affect the viability of the securitization market. Thus, the impact of CRAs is both direct (rating securitization tranches) and indirect (rating the monoliners). The potential failure of such monoliners has serious implications for the value of various structured finance products.  

This further underscores the linkages and dependencies in the financial markets. Other concerns are the oligopolistic nature of both the rating and guarantee businesses, and their importance for structured finance markets.27  

Under the Dodd–Frank Act, the legal liability of CRAs has been elevated. Whether this will result in more accurate credit ratings is an open question.  

# CONCLUSION  

We have emphasized the three-dimensional interaction – competition, complementarity, and coevolution – between banks and financial markets. And the recent financial innovations have possibly strengthened these relationships. As a final observation, note that traditionally the financial systems were either bank-based (continental Europe) or financial market driven (US, UK). In the former, bank financing is dominant while direct funding from the financial market plays a more important role in the latter. The dichotomy between a bank-based system and a financial market-driven economy appears to have weakened in recent years, and the proposed changes in Europe (e.g. the Capital Markets Union Proposal) may move the EU financial system closer to the Anglo-Saxon model. In particular, innovations like securitization have made banks’ assets more marketable and increased the sensitivity of banks to financial market developments. Banks have thus become an extension of rather than a substitute for the financial markets.
