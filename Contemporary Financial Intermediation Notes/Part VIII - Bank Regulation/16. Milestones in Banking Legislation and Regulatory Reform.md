# INTRODUCTION  

In this chapter, we discuss milestones in banking legislation and review bank regulatory reform proposals. This chapter is complementary to Chapter 15  which primarily looked at the objectives of regulation and how these have been translated in various regulatory measures around the world. Here we examine first what has happened from a more historic point of view and include a more complete description of key banking acts (the legislative milestones in banking). Subsequently, we will review major problems of bank regulation, and examine the causes of and possible cures for these problems. In particular, we will discuss extensively the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991 and the Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 in the United States, and the recent European Union (EU) legislative agenda. The Dodd–Frank Act and the recent European legislative agenda are largely responses to the global financial crisis; FDICIA was a response to the massive Savings & Loans crisis in the 1980s. We will contrast these responses that followed crises to the deregulation agenda of the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act (“the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act”). The Basel Capital Accords (I, II, and III) have been discussed in Chapter 15  

# MILESTONES OF BANKING LEGISLATION  

Banking legislation has shaped the relationship between government and privately owned banking institutions from the earliest history of the United States. The first banks were chartered by the states, but the federal government reserved to itself the control of interstate commerce and the production of coin and currency.

FIGURE 16.1 The Major Eras of U.S. Bank Regulation.  

With growing governmental responsibility for stabilizing economic activity came increasing involvement with the banks. Failures and financial panics linked to banks preceded recessions, and many believed that banks were instrumental in producing financial panics and business cycles. Seven major eras of U.S. banking regulation are summarized in Figure 16.1  

# Early Bank Regulation  

Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century Banking  

The creation of the Bank of North America in 1781 was driven by the fledgling government’s need for a fiscal agent. Soon after the colonies won their independence, the Continental Congress gave a perpetual charter to the Bank of North America. Later, other banks emerged. However, criticism of lending policies and the ability to issue paper currency led to a repeal of the charter given to the Bank of North America.  

# The First and Second Banks of the United States  

With the active support of Alexander Hamilton, then Secretary of the Treasury, the First Bank of the United States was chartered in 1791 for a 20-year period. The bank was an embryonic central bank in that it issued notes, accepted deposits, transferred government funds through its eight branches, made public disbursements, and granted credit to the government as well as the private sector. However, the First Bank did not serve as a depository of bank funds, or as a clearinghouse, or as a creator of bank reserves. Nor did it act as an LLR. The bank was severely criticized for its “anti-South” bias, its inattention to agrarian interests, and its growing English ownership. With Congress not renewing its charter, the bank expired in 1811.  

In 1816, Congress chartered the Second Bank of the United States. This bank, initially a fiscal agent for the government, evolved into an embryonic central bank. It would, for example, redeem the bank notes of suspect institutions. The bank was seen, however, as a disciplinary agent representing eastern (lenders) interests at the expense of agrarian (borrowers) interests. When Andrew Jackson, representing the agrarian and frontier interests, was elected president, efforts to recharter the Second Bank of the United States were stifled. Its federal charter expired in 1836.  

The period from 1837 to 1864 is commonly referred to as the era of free banking. It was a period of minimal federal government involvement in banking. The states had virtual free rein. Colorful stories of “wildcat banking” circulated along with bank notes of heterogeneous value. These banks would open in remote locales in order to frustrate note redemption efforts.  

# National Bank Act of 1864  

The National Bank Act of 1864 marked the return of the federal government to banking. With the $5\%$ tax on state bank notes and licensing of national banks, the era of free banking was brought to a close. The National Bank Act established the Office  

of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to charter and supervise national banks and to regulate the national currency.   
With the tax on state bank notes, the largest and most reputable banks obtained national bank charters.  

The National Bank Act probably had more to do with financing the Civil War than with reforming banks; national banks were required to hold government securities to satisfy liquidity requirements. Moreover, the populist distrust of banks, which sought to avoid undue concentration of power, led to a fragmented banking industry structure.  

The period following the Civil War was characterized by periodic financial disruptions as banks’ liquidity would be tested by skittish note and deposit holders. Inevitably, some banks would be found wanting and contagious panics would occasionally ensue. Systemic risk arose from provisions that allowed banks to hold their reserves in the form of deposits at other banks. This pyramiding of reserves and attendant panics eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. In addition, the pre-Federal Reserve monetary system was inefficient with the notes of thousands of individual banks circulating as imperfect substitutes for one another. This was an era of not only private deposits, but also privately produced currency. There were as many media of exchange as there were banks.  

# The Federal Reserve Act  

Following a particularly disruptive financial panic in 1907, the Congress created the National Monetary Commission to recommend reform of the banking system. Their work led to the Federal Reserve Act in 1913 that established the Federal Reserve System.  

The United States was the last major western country to establish a central bank. Unique in its decentralized design, the Federal Reserve reflected the historical ambivalence about creating a powerful quasi-government banking institution. America’s deep-rooted populism recoiled at the notion of a centralized hegemony over banking. The genius of the system is that it has been able to function credibly despite its convoluted design. Nominally privately owned, it is a governmental institution. Nominally decentralized with 12 separate corporate entities, virtually all important decisions are made by the presidentially appointed Board of Governors in Washington, DC.  

Originally, the Federal Reserve had note-issuing authority, LLR powers, and performed clearing services. But with time, the Federal Reserve took on increasing responsibilities for monetary policy and bank regulation. Perhaps most important among the latter are its responsibilities for oversight of bank holding company (BHC) activities.  

# Legislation During 1920–1980  

# The McFadden Act of 1927  

The McFadden Act addressed the question of geographic expansion of national banks. Each of the states retained the power to determine the basis on which state-chartered banks could expand their facilities or branches. Thus, states like Illinois limited banks to having only one office (hence the term unit banking). Others, like California, placed no limits on the branching powers of their banks; California banks could establish offices anywhere in the state. Still others like New York permitted limitedarea branching. Similarly, some states permitted multibank holding companies whereas others explicitly forbade BHCs.  

A question arose about the powers of national banks. Prior to McFadden, some state banks had more expansive branching powers than competing national banks. The McFadden Act gave national banks exactly the same powers as state banks in the states where the national banks are domiciled. Thus, national banks domiciled in California would have the same branching powers as California’s state-chartered banks, and national banks located in Illinois would be restricted in the same way as Illinois’ state-chartered banks.  

This principle of devolution preserved the dual banking system and the fragmentation of banking markets.1 While it put state and national banks on an equal footing, it also prevented national banks from expanding nationwide, thereby limiting banks’ ability to diversify their funding and credit risks and to exploit economies of scale. This diversification problem would come back to plague the industry in the 1980s. The distress and failure of Texas’ major banks in the 1990s was in good part due to their undiversified exposure in energy-related industries. And Texas was not alone. The energy industry funk brought down major banks in Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Colorado, too. The subsequent difficulty of New England banks was similarly linked to a regional recession. And still more recently, cutbacks in defense spending and other local problems have stressed California’s banks.  

The McFadden Act and its litigation of interstate bank expansion was eventually mooted by the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which permitted well-capitalized banks to expand across state lines. Even with the rapid decline in the number of banks and complementary increase in market share of the top-10 banks there is still a paucity of banks in the United States with facilities that are distributed nationwide.

FIGURE 16.2 Significant Provisions of the Banking Act of 1933.  

# Glass–Steagall Act of 1933  

From 1919 to 1929, 6000 banks were suspended or liquidated, and another 4,000 merged with other banks. From 1929 to 1933, another 10,000 banks failed, as the number of banks declined from 25,000 to 15,000. In the depths of the nation’s worst economic recession (GNP dropped by $50\%$ , the money supply fell by $33\%$ and the unemployment rate reached $25\%$ in 1932), failing banks were a focal point of discontent. There was no more potent force transforming ordinary folk into revolutionaries than the loss of one’s liquid assets in some ostensibly mismanaged bank. (Recall there were no readily available risk-free assets other than currency. Mutual funds came much later and government securities were available only in large denominations.)  

This was the ambiance in which newly elected President Franklin D. Roosevelt set out to reform banking. The crisis was memorialized with the Bank Holiday of March 1933 that closed all banks. Congress then shaped legislation that ultimately reconfigured banking more fundamentally than any previous legislation in U.S. history.  

The 1933 legislation introduced federal deposit insurance despite President Roosevelt’s misgivings. This reform addressed the public’s need for a risk-free asset and stemmed the flight from bank deposits to currency. The legislation also capped deposit interest rates, providing banks with a new subsidy. Together with the follow-on Banking Act of 1935, Glass–Steagall took banks out of the securities business and imposed more intrusive supervision than ever before.2 The most significant provisions of the 1933 legislation are summarized in Figure 16.2  

This legislation was lauded as one of the most successful governmental intrusions into the private sector, ever. President Roosevelt’s misgivings about deposit insurance took a full 50 years to be realized. Until the inflation of the 1970s and 1980s, the premium charged for deposit insurance was less than 1/10 of $1\%$ of the deposit base per year. The deposit insurance fund grew steadily, and bank failures were inconsequential. Glass–Steagall, and more particularly the deposit insurance it established, was one of the most admired monuments of the New Deal. As pointed out in Chapters 10 and 11 the remarkable point about deposit insurance is not that it eventually came unraveled, but rather that it lasted as long as it did. President Roosevelt clearly foresaw the moral hazards in the deposit insurance system. What he could not be expected to understand was that these internal contradictions could be held in check for four decades.  

Two years after Glass–Steagall, the Banking Act of 1935 became law. It renamed the Federal Reserve Board as the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and extended its powers to regulate the discount rates of the district Federal Reserve banks and cash-asset reserve requirements, and impose margin requirements on securities lending. The committee coordinating open-market operations was renamed the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  

# Banking During 1940–1980  

The U.S. banking system came out of World War II with immense holdings of U.S. government securities and cash-asset reserves. Banks were well capitalized and credit risk was a minor problem. Indeed banks’ loan portfolios had grown very little during the greatest wartime mobilization in U.S. history. Much of the build-up was directly financed by government with the banks serving the secondary role of accumulating government debt. (Recall that the banking industry was still emerging from the trauma of the Great Depression.)  

All of this changed when the widely predicted postwar economic funk failed to materialize. Pent-up demand of returning veterans unleashed a sustained prosperity, and bankers sought ways to participate. This required re-examination of their bomb-shelter mentality and the development of methods to prudently process greater risk, principally credit and liquidity risk.  

Thus, the postwar period saw banks that had emerged from World War II with over $74\%$ of their assets in government securities replace government securities with business loans. Balance sheets grew, capital ratios fell, and so did cash-asset reserve ratios. It was in this climate that banks expanded their branch systems and began holding company powers more aggressively.  

# Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) of 1956 and the Douglas Amendments of 1970  

Although group (holding company) banking grew little from 1933 to 1948, activity picked up considerably from 1948 through 1956.3 Concern about the use of the BHC to expand geographically and functionally prompted the BHC legislation of 1956 and the Douglas Amendments of 1970. Prior to this legislation, the federal government had little power to regulate or supervise BHCs, the corporate parents of the banks. This was viewed as a loophole that needed to be addressed. The BHCA defined a BHC as any entity that owns or controls $25\%$ or more of the voting shares and controls the board of directors of two or more affiliated banks. The 1956 law required BHCs to: (i) divest ownership of businesses other than banking or furnishing services to affiliated banks, (ii) register with the board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and (iii) seek approval of the board for any bank acquisitions.  

Although the Federal Reserve was charged with primary responsibility for regulating BHCs, the focus was on bank acquisitions of holding companies and multibank holding companies. Thus, the 1956 legislation largely ignored questions raised by nonbank acquisitions of one-bank holding companies. This was because nonbank acquisitions were not yet an issue in 1956. But the relentless testing of the limits of banking, symptomatic of the segue away from banking’s depression mentality, brought this latter issue to the fore. The 1970 Douglas Amendments required all BHC acquisitions to have explicit Federal Reserve approval. The Federal Reserve developed a laundry list of approvable and prohibited activities, but these lists were merely presumptive, and each individual acquisition required explicit approval. The Douglas Amendment’s charge to the Federal Reserve was ambiguous – “[nonbank acquisitions] should be so closely related to banking to be a proper incident thereto” – and the Federal Reserve consequently has virtually boundless discretion in deciding on BHC acquisition applications.  

The importance of the BHC regulation, both extant and prospective, is clear in the current debate on reform. First, existing legislation clearly lodges almost boundless power in the Federal Reserve. Second, virtually all proposals to expand banking powers rely on the holding company and its questionable “fire walls” to protect the bank and its insured deposits. Almost certainly, the role of the BHC will expand as banking legislation is liberalized, and the Federal Reserve will be the regulatory focal point.  

# International Banking Act of 1978  

The International Banking Act of 1978 was designed to provide a more “level playing field” between U.S. banks and their foreign-bank competitors operating in the U.S. market. Foreign-bank branches were compelled to select one state as domicile for McFadden purposes. They also were required to satisfy capital and liquidity requirements comparable to those of their U.S. competitors.  

Incidental to this complex exercise in defining equivalence came the first explicit continuous capital requirement for banks.4 This was another testimony to the success of the 1930s legislation. The $5.5\%$ capital requirement of the 1978 legislation was almost an afterthought to defining equivalence between U.S. and foreign banks competing in U.S. markets.  

# Problems of the Thrift Industry  

The 1970s saw a significant increase in interest rate levels and volatility owing to high and volatile inflation rates. In addition, information technology improved dramatically. These two developments profoundly affected banks and thrifts. Interest-rate surprises led to crippling losses for financial institutions with mismatched balance sheets. The thrifts that were legally locked into long-term, fixed-rate mortgages suffered worse than banks that had gradually substituted floating-rate loans for fixed-rate term loans. Advances in information technology weakened barriers to entry and invited competition from a wide variety of nonbank providers of financial services, such as mutual funds, finance companies, and the capital markets. By 1980, the thrift industry was on the brink of insolvency, and banking failures were increasing in size as well as frequency.  

# Legislation of the 1980s  

The legislative developments in the 1980s have a distinct importance because they sought to address the cracks that had started to appear in the rather stable banking environment that had characterized the United States in the years after the Second World War. The more competitive environment of banking and the thrift crisis needed answers.  

Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act (DIDMCA) of 1980  

DIDMCA addressed two major issues: the disintermediation of deposits that was exacerbated by deposit interest-rate ceilings, and the attrition of Federal Reserve membership as more banks sought to avoid the cost of maintaining cash-asset reserve requirements.  

Deposit interest-rate ceilings introduced by the Glass–Steagall legislation had always been a mixed blessing for the banks. When market interest rates for deposit substitutes – government securities, money market mutual funds – were only moderately higher than the ceilings, the banks benefited owing to depositor inertia or convenience. But as the disparity between market and ceiling rates widened, depositors became restless and funds flowed out of the banks. The same deposit interest ceilings that were a major support of banking when interest rates were tranquil became a headache as interest rates became more volatile.  

This problem might have been addressed by indexing the deposit interest-rate ceilings to market interest rates, but this was never done. The regulators seemed to prefer unlimited discretion, but their efforts to make timely adjustments in the ceilings could not keep up with the fast-moving capital markets.  

DIDMCA addressed this problem by providing for the gradual elimination of all deposit interest-rate ceilings, except those on demand deposits.5 Banks became free to compete in deposit markets as they saw fit. Even the demand deposit interest-rate restriction was circumvented with consumer NOW accounts. What was not too clearly understood was how important the earlier deposit subsidies had been in discouraging high-risk strategies of banks. DIDMCA also raised the ceiling on federally insured deposits from $\$40,000$ to $\$100,000$ per account. This reduced the incentive of depositors to monitor their banks, further encouraging risk-taking by banks.  

The second major initiative of DIDMCA was to subject all insured banks to Federal Reserve cash-asset reserve requirements. This addressed the Federal Reserve’s problem of membership attrition. The opportunity cost of satisfying the Federal Reserve’s cash-asset reserve requirements increased with the level of market interest rates and declining Federal Reserve membership was yet another piece of the syndrome of the 1970s. Thus, DIDMCA eliminated an opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. Interestingly, since 1980 the Federal Reserve has lowered demand deposit reserve requirements from a maximum of over $16\%$ to $10\%$ . Thus, regulatory hegemony has been accompanied by a transference of the taxpayer’s seigniorage to the banks. A summary of the major provisions of DIDMCA appears in the box below.  

# Major Provisions of DIDMCA  

All depository institutions were permitted to issue interest-bearing checking accounts and required to hold cash-asset reserves as prescribed by the Federal Reserve. S&Ls were allowed to have up to $20\%$ of their assets in a combination of consumer loans, commercial paper, and corporate debt instruments. Federal S&Ls were allowed to offer credit-card services and engage in trust activities. • A statutory capital requirement for S&Ls of $5\%$ of deposits was replaced with a range of $3\mathrm{-}6\%$ to be set by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Deposit interest-rate ceilings were phased out over a 6-year period. Interest-rate deregulation was to be administered by the Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee (DIDC) with the Secretary of Treasury as chair and the heads of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and the National Credit Union Administration as voting members. The deposit insurance limit was raised to $\$100,000$ per account. Statewide branching was permitted for federal S&Ls. Earlier geographical limits on S&L lending – loans could only be made within a 50-mile radius of an office – were eliminated. Authority of federal S&Ls to make acquisition, development, and construction (ADC) loans was expanded.  

# Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982  

The Garn-St. Germain Act was directed at thrifts exclusively and sought to enhance their earnings potential by expanding their powers. The initiative was a response to the huge losses suffered by the industry due to the 1980–1981 spike in interest rates.  

The prime rate soared to over $21\%$ . The thrift industry was forced to fund its vast portfolio of loans and fixed-rate mortgages with very high cost liabilities. The losses sustained over an 18-month period eroded a significant portion of the industry’s capital.6 Much of the loss was attributable to thrifts having been legally confined to fixed-rate mortgages. In order to earn their way back, it was argued that thrifts needed more liberalized asset empowerments, including the authority to make adjustable-rate mortgages.  

Garn-St. Germain provided the expanded asset powers the industry sought. This permitted vastly increased credit risk, and those who had been most devastated by losses were the most eager to pursue high-risk strategies. A summary of the major components of Garn-St. Germain is given in the box below.  

# Major Provisions of Garn-St. Germain  

Asset powers of federal S&Ls were expanded by permitting:   
• $\mathsf{U p}$ to $40\%$ of assets in commercial mortgage loans.   
• $\mathsf{U p}$ to $30\%$ of assets in consumer loans.   
• Up to $10\%$ of assets in commercial loans.   
• Up to $10\%$ of assets in commercial leases.   
Elimination of the previous statutory limit on the loan-to-value ratio, allowing S&Ls to lend more relative to the appraised value of a project.   
Authorization of the FDIC and the FSLIC to issue “net worth certificates” that could increase an institution’s capital for regulatory purposes without any real infusion of capital.  

# Financial Institutions and Regulatory Reform Enforcement Act (FIRREA) of 1989  

FIRREA was the sequel to Garn-St. Germain. It created the machinery and procedures to dispose of insolvent and nearinsolvent thrifts. The regulatory agency for thrifts, the FHLBB, was disenfranchised. A new thrift regulator was created, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), within the Treasury Department. The thrift insurer, the FSLIC, was also reorganized and placed within the FDIC as the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The legislation also created the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) to dispose of failed thrifts and their assets.  

FIRREA laid the groundwork for more aggressive resolutions of impaired thrifts, and subsequently more than 1000 thrifts were restructured via government intervention. FIRREA sought to correct for the passivity and forbearance of earlier regulatory policies.  

FIRREA had two important provisions insofar as capital requirements are concerned. First, FIRREA stipulated three types of capital requirements: tangible capital, core capital, and risk-based capital. Tangible capital is common equity and perpetual preferred stock; the OTS required thrifts to keep tangible capital equal to at least $1.5\%$ of total assets. Core Capital was defined as tangible capital plus nonperpetual preferred stock and qualifying subordinated debt; the OTS required thrifts to keep core capital equal to at least $3\%$ of total assets. Intangible assets like goodwill could no longer count as part of core capital by 1994, with a phase-out schedule stipulating the rate at which intangible assets had to be phased out from consideration as regulatory capital. With the passage of FIRREA, the term “supervisory goodwill” was used to denote goodwill created in FSLIC-assisted acquisitions of insolvent thrifts in which there was a specific agreement by regulators to permit the goodwill to count as regulatory capital. It is this goodwill that was subject to a 5-year phaseout. All other goodwill was immediately disqualified as regulatory capital. The risk-based capital ratio had to exceed $8\%$ and was to be computed in the same way as the Tier-1 capital ratio under the Basel Accord.  

FIRREA mandated a study by the Treasury that would propose reform of the deposit insurance system. This resulted in a February 1991 proposal by the Treasury. The Treasury proposal was two-fold: limiting the risks in the deposit insurance system in combination with freeing up banking markets. In particular, it advocated limiting deposit insurance coverage in combination with risk-sensitive pricing and higher capital requirements. Simultaneously it advocated full interstate banking and allowing banks to affiliate with other financial institutions. In combination, the Treasury proposals were aimed at reducing the taxpayer liability, facilitating a better allocation of credit and strengthening the banking industry.7  The major elements of FIRREA are summarized in Figure 16.3 The Treasury’s bold reform proposals were rejected in favor of the FDICIA that we discuss later in this chapter.

# PROBLEMS OF BANK REGULATION  

# The Problems  

In Table 16.1 we summarize prominent problems among deposit-taking financial institutions, along with possible causes and commonly suggested remedies. Our perspective here is that of a taxpayer desiring a globally competitive banking system in which taxpayer exposure is minimized.  

# Causes and Possible Cures  

In this subsection, we briefly discuss each of the major issues and possible remedies listed in Table 16.1  Our discussion   
is organized around four issues: deposit insurance, regulatory uncertainty, market value accounting (MVA), and expanded   
banking powers.   
1. Deposit Insurance and the Bank’s Incentives: Our discussion in Chapter 12 highlighted problems associated with deposit insurance. It is commonly believed that these problems arise from: (i) the pricing of deposit insurance, (ii) the incentives of regulators, and (iii) the incentives of bank executives. We discuss each briefly in turn. a. Deposit Insurance Pricing: Insurance premiums that are risk insensitive or only weakly sensitized to risk shift the burden of restraining risk-taking to the regulators rather than allowing risk to be controlled by the discipline of a pricing mechanism. This problem was recognized in FDICIA as we discuss below. There are, however, numerous difficulties in implementing a risk-sensitive deposit insurance pricing scheme that effectively deters risk-taking. These include risk measurement8 and asymmetric information.9 Properly calibrated risk-based deposit insurance

pricing must depend on many variables, reflecting credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks. How do we measure these risks? Moreover, even if we could measure these risks, how should the deposit insurance premiums be linked to the measured risks? The asymmetric information problem arises from the bank having better information about its own risks than the regulator. Thus, in designing a deposit insurance scheme that accurately reflects risk, the regulator confronts the task of eliciting the bank’s private information.  

Risk-sensitive deposit insurance premiums were adopted under FDICIA, representing an important step in regulatory reform. b. Regulatory Incentives: Some believe that many banking problems are rooted in defects in political and bureaucratic accountability.10 Covering up evidence of poor regulatory performance and relaxing restrictions on regulated firms are common governmental responses to industry difficulties. Similarly, aggressive risk-taking by banks is a rational response to regulatory forbearance.  

This viewpoint recognizes a principal-agent problem at the level of the public regulator. Regulators and politicians are seen as agents of taxpayers, and as agents they possess well-defined objectives that commonly conflict with those of their principals. To understand this viewpoint, imagine a banking or thrift industry that consists of many impaired firms with negative net worths that are attracted to risky portfolio strategies.  

Regulators should expeditiously close such firms. But doing so usually upsets incumbent politicians. Moreover, resolute actions by regulators may signal their previous mistakes in allowing conditions to fester to the point where receivership or conservatorship becomes necessary. The larger the troubled firms’ hidden economic losses, the more a public acknowledgement of their insolvency threatens the regulators’ reputations, and the more inclined regulators will be to forbear. The hope may be that the insolvency can be reversed, or the problem can be passed on to a successor. The idea that the careers of regulators and politicians would be damaged by acknowledging insolvencies is enshrined in the ancient practice of killing messengers bearing bad news. FIRREA and FDICIA dealt with this problem by greatly limiting regulatory forbearance; an institution whose book net worth falls below $2\%$ of assets now has to be closed within a specified period of time.  

If we assume that insured institutions constantly develop new and partly unanticipated ways to shift risk to the deposit insurance fund, we can imagine three regulatory regimes as shown in Figure 16.4 11  

![](images/b098e0df7090491243efadbcef639f03fb06a69c84873a4e5983b3f52424a025.jpg)  
FIGURE 16.4 Sequential Regulatory Regimes.  

As shown in Figure 16.4  regulators start out as well-intentioned public servants. However, a “crossover point” is reached when they discover that actions taken by the firms they regulate have gone undetected and now threaten the solvency of the deposit insurance fund. The regulators recognize that the problems are so difficult to resolve that their career interests are better served by procrastination or denial. It appears that, in the case of the thrift industry, this transition to denial occurred in the late 1970s, and the denial continued through 1987. During this period, thriftindustry lobbying generated disinformation about the condition of the industry. Concern seemed limited to the possibility that public acknowledgement of the FSLIC’s insolvency could precipitate a crisis. The existence of serious problems and regulatory denial is indicated by the data in Table 16.2  

As this table shows, the industry was insolvent on average for a long time before there was a public awareness. Moreover, closures or resolutions by the FSLIC fell far short of actual insolvencies. Since this was also a period during which the industry was growing rapidly, many firms with negative net worths were not only allowed to stay in business but also to grow their assets.  

However, the longer a cover-up goes on, the harder it becomes to sustain the deception. The reasons are twofold. First, not acknowledging losses only defers accounting recognition. Second, allowing economically insolvent institutions to continue may increase losses over time given the bank’s increased incentive to assume risk.  

The above discussion takes as given the existing structure of federal deposit insurance. Many alternatives to this structure have been proposed, however. One is to privatize deposit insurance. This would provide a self-insurance program for the banking industry, in which banks insure and monitor each other. The difficulty is that, with a large number of banks, each member’s incentive to monitor is likely to be weak.12  

A second alternative is to limit deposit insurance to “narrow banks.” That is, only those banks that invest in the safest securities like Treasury bills would be able to offer insured deposit accounts. The remaining banks would invest in assets of their choice, but could finance these assets only with uninsured liabilities. This would limit taxpayers’ exposure while preserving federal deposit insurance.

FIGURE 16.5 Possible Solutions to the Deposit Insurance Problem.  

Finally, there are those who would reform deposit insurance by eliminating the deposit contract itself. As we saw in Chapter 12  the deposit contract creates the possibility of a bank run because of the sequential service constraint that entices each depositor to be the first at the teller window to withdraw his or her deposits as soon as trouble is suspected. While deposit insurance is one response to this potential disruption, another possibility is to do away with the sequential service constraint. This could be achieved if banks issued equity-like claims, such as those of mutual funds. Since any withdrawal from the fund would be commensurate with the fractional ownership of the investor in the fund, there would be no advantage to any investor/depositor in being first to withdraw. Such contracts could be endowed with the full range of transactions services. Individuals would be exposed to “market risk” since the value of the mutual fund would be subject to random fluctuations as market conditions change, but the threat of panic runs would vanish.13 The issue was also discussed in Chapter 12  Figure 16.5 summarizes possible solutions to the deposit insurance problem.  

c. Improving the Incentives of Bank Executives: If the bank’s top executives are somehow rewarded for failure, then the incentives to take risk are strengthened. One way that executives are rewarded is with golden parachutes when they leave troubled firms. The FDIC now has restrictions on such payments by troubled firms. This follows the OCC’s decision in 1991 to stop monthly payments of $\$42,000$ to Charles Zwick, former chairman of Southeast Banking Corporation. In February 1991, regulators forced Alan P. Hoblitzell, former chairman and CEO of troubled MNC Financial, Inc., to return $\$915,865$ in severance pay.  

The Bank Fraud Act of 1990 authorized the FDIC to set strict golden parachute rules in its role as guardian of the Bank Insurance Fund. The agency must approve any golden parachute offered to departing executives of troubled banks. To gain approval, the institution must demonstrate that the executive committed no fraudulent act, is not substantially responsible for the institution’s impaired condition, and has not violated banking and criminal laws. Moreover, all institutions must satisfy similar criteria before they are allowed to pay legal fees for directors and officers.  

2. Regulatory Uncertainty: Public regulation of banking is aimed in part at dealing with moral hazard problems growing out of the public safety net. This includes not only explicit guarantees, such as deposit insurance and the LLR, but also ill-defined governmental guarantees of the payments system and TBTF. Thus, the question transcends that of designing an optimal regulatory monitoring system. Rather, it calls for jointly designing the guarantee structure and the monitoring system so as to achieve social objectives while controlling moral hazard at minimal total social cost.  

An appealing approach is to minimize the need for regulation, but this means minimizing the span of the safety net. Indeed, this may be the most compelling argument for restricting the government’s safety net. However, since even the minimal safety net will entail some government exposure, some regulation/supervision is likely to be necessary. We are, therefore, forced to wrestle with the question of optimal regulatory design in the context of a minimally guaranteed system.  

In contemplating this issue, it is useful to distinguish between the discretionary and nondiscretionary aspects of regulation. The latter represent more or less well-defined rules, such as cash-asset reserve requirements, capital requirements, loans-to-one-borrower rules, and deposit insurance premium schedules. On the other hand, discretionary regulations involve greater ambiguity. Examples include the standards for BHC acquisitions contained in the 1970 Douglas Amendments, deposit insurance coverage under current practices, standards for access to the discount window, standards for intervention in cases of distressed institutions, and accounting standards in the banking and thrift industries.  

One benefit of ambiguity is that it gives the regulator a weapon against moral hazard.14 When a bank is not really sure whether the regulator will rescue it in a given set of circumstances, the bank may go to greater lengths to avoid jeopardy. However, ambiguity also has costs. As the probability and nature of regulatory intervention become more difficult to assess, investors begin to demand higher risk premia on the bank’s equity. This increases the bank’s cost of capital and reduces competitiveness relative to competitors in more predictable environments. To the extent that the regulator does not internalize the bank’s increased cost of capital, discretion transfers wealth from shareholders to taxpayers or regulators.  

3. MVA: It is widely believed that Regulatory Accounting Principles (RAP) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) have contributed to problems in the thrift and banking industries. RAP hid the magnitude of the crisis for some time because it deferred unrealized losses and thereby overstated capital even when economic net worth was negative. Given the risk-taking incentives of economically insolvent institutions, the crisis gathered momentum as thrifts sought ever-increasing risk. GAAP do not help much since they rely substantially on the historical cost (or book value) of transactions.15  

The alternative, MVA, requires that all assets and liabilities, including all off-balance sheet items (which would be brought on-balance sheet) be carried at current market value. The values of the assets and liabilities would be increased or decreased, as market conditions indicated. MVA can be useful in implementing risk-based capital requirements, risk-based deposit insurance premiums, and improved regulatory supervision. It could, thus, be an important part of the overall reform of the deposit insurance system.  

In principle, the case for adopting MVA is impeccable, but there are conceptual, measurement, and incentive problems with implementing MVA.16 The major problem is assigning market values to nontraded commercial bank loans and guarantees. Many of these instruments are nonmarketable or marketable only at steep discounts. Because of information and monitoring advantages that the bank has relative to potential buyers of these instruments, there is usually a divergence between the value of the asset to the bank and its value if sold, so that measuring value becomes difficult.  

Arguing that the system does not need a full-blown accounting system, but only a market-based measure of net worth, simplifies the measurement problem, but raises other issues that need further consideration. For example, it is possible that requiring banks to add capital when the market value of loans (and hence net worth) declines would induce banks to choose loans of shorter maturity, that is, loans that would “liquidate” with fewer possibilities for a market-based revision in value.17 The reason is that there may be an asymmetry in the effect of revisions on the bank’s capital. An increase in loan value would augment the bank’s economic net worth and permit it to support deposit and asset expansion, but the bank may be unable to profitably carry out such an expansion immediately.18 Thus, the bank may be unable to fully extract the benefit of an upward revision in loan value. But if the loan value drops, then MVA would force the bank to acquire additional capital or sell off some assets; both initiatives are likely to be costly.19 Such an asymmetry in the effect of loan value revisions on the bank could create an incentive to minimize potential value revisions, and hence a shortening of loan maturities. Despite these unresolved issues, valuing at market all those assets and liabilities that are actively traded in secondary markets and using best judgment to estimate the values of the remainder seems to be gaining favor among public regulators and the accounting profession.  

4. Expanded Banking Powers: Prior to the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999, both banks and thrifts have lobbied for expanded powers that would increase charter values and reduce failures. The principal objections to universal banks were that expanded powers make it more difficult to regulate and limit risk-taking at the expense of the deposit insurance fund, and that expanded powers can give rise to conflicts of interest. The potential conflicts include:20  

. The promotional role of the investment bank in selling securities may conflict with the commercial bank’s obligation to provide objective advice to depositors.   
ii. In order to avoid a loss on a loan, the universal bank may encourage the borrower to raise new capital through the bank’s securities subsidiary in order to repay the loan.   
iii. A universal bank may use its monopoly power to cross-sell services. Threats of credit rationing, refusal to renew loan commitments, and increasing the cost of loans could all be used to “tie” existing customers to other products of the universal banks.   
iv. A universal bank may avoid losses in underwriting by placing unsold securities in its trust accounts.   
v. Interlocks between the directors of universal banks and their customers may give rise to conflicts.   
vi. Banks may make imprudent loans to bolster a firm taken public through an initial public offering (IPO) underwritten by the universal bank.   
vii.The bank may lend imprudently to its securities affiliate, possibly transferring wealth from the deposit insurance fund to the securities affiliate.  

The seriousness of these conflicts of interest is widely disputed.21 Those favoring the separation of commercial and investment banking believe that conflicts are significant,22 and that the separation is necessary to ensure that the governmental safety net is not significantly expanded in scope. Those favoring expanded bank empowerment believe that market forces will provide the discipline necessary to control abuses.23 Others believe that moral hazard and other conflicts of interest can be controlled by limiting regulatory forbearance and forcing sufficiently early closure of troubled institutions.24  

If there are serious conflicts, then there should be evidence that banks in the pre-1933 period deceived investors into investing in securities that imposed losses on investors. A recent study tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance of securities underwritten by affiliates of commercial banks with those sponsored by independent investment banks.25 It found that securities sold by bank affiliates defaulted less frequently than similar securities sold by stand-alone investment banks. Strikingly, the difference in default rates was the greatest for relatively speculative (private-information-intensive) issues that, because they are the hardest for investors to judge, should have potentially imposed the largest losses on investors. This evidence calls into question the significance of alleged conflicts of interest. Investors with rational expectations will take into account potential conflicts of interest in pricing securities. Consequently, securities sold by bank affiliates with poor reputations for avoiding potential conflicts will sell at steep discounts. Issuers will anticipate this and gravitate to bank affiliates with good reputations, and these institutions will then be observed to underwrite the majority of issues accounted for by bank affiliates. Succinctly put, market discipline apparently worked well in resolving conflicts of interest prior to Glass–Steagall.  

An additional argument against expanded banking powers is that they may dilute financial innovation incentives. A universal bank that is considering a financial-market innovation will worry about cannibalizing the loan business of its commercial banking arm. A stand-alone investment bank has no such concerns and thus will have stronger financial-innovation incentives.  

The effect of expanded powers on banks is ultimately an empirical issue. Empirical research has provided interesting evidence. Using data on 107 countries, one study shows that restricting bank activities has an adverse effect on bank development and stability.26 This could provide some support for universal banking, which is common in Europe, Latin America, and other parts of the world.27 Note, however, that this does not provide support for having purely speculative activities become part of banks. The universal banking model works best when it is client-centric, and thus relationship based.  

# THE 1991 FDICIA AND BEYOND  

In 1991, the U.S. Treasury proposed sweeping regulatory reform of banking aimed at promoting the global competitiveness of American banking institutions, reducing taxpayers’ exposure deriving from deposit insurance, and promoting the safety and soundness of American financial institutions. The key elements of the proposal were: (i) limiting deposit insurance coverage, (ii) achieving regulatory consolidation, (iii) involving the Treasury as well as the Federal Reserve in TBTF decisions, and (iv) dismantling the Glass–Steagall and McFadden restrictions on banking activities.  

This initiative culminated in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) in December 1991. The main focus of FDICIA was on reducing taxpayer exposure deriving from deposit insurance and promoting the safety and soundness of American financial institutions. The key features of FDICIA are discussed below.  

# Bank Regulation  

FDICIA linked supervision to bank capital (Figure 16.6). Regulators were required to establish five capital compliance categories for banks and thrifts: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. Regulatory forbearance was restricted by requiring “prompt corrective action” as capital dissipated. In particular, regulators are required to close banks before they become insolvent. If capital declines to levels below positive trigger points, regulators must impose caps on growth, enforce reductions or suspension of dividends, instruct bank management to raise capital, and mandate management changes if necessary. Regulators are also permitted to close critically undercapitalized banks, where the ratio of tangible equity capital to total assets is less than $2\%$ . FDICIA also permits bank regulators to place a bank in receivership or conservatorship for other transgressions, including violation of a cease-and-desist order, concealment of records or assets, inability to cover deposit withdrawals, or failure to either develop or implement a required plan to raise capital. Moreover, FDICIA requires bank regulators to take action within 90 days of a bank becoming critically undercapitalized. The key principles of the supervisory review under FDICIA are summarized in Figure 16.6  

Prompt corrective action also requires an ex-post review of any bank or thrift failure that imposes material costs on the FDIC. If a material loss occurs, the inspector general of the appropriate banking agency must determine why and must provide recommendations for preventing such a loss in the future. This report must be made available to the Comptroller  

![](images/fda6899d2d8e8423cddf80d52d5beabcdd3736dc7c3d52e5a470b15e315601e3.jpg)  
FIGURE 16.6 Key Principles of Supervisory Review.  

General of the United States, to members of Congress upon request, and to the public through the Freedom of Information Act. Further, the GAO must do an annual review of the reports and recommend improvements in supervision.  

In addition to supervision, regulators were instructed to come up with a way to link bank capital requirements to interest-rate risk, credit risk of concentrations of credit, and the risk of nontraditional activities, and to draft a new set of noncapital measures of bank safety, such as underwriting standards. Regulators also are required to perform annual on-site bank examinations, place limits on real estate lending by banks and tighten auditing requirements.  

# Deposit Insurance  

FDICIA transferred to the FDIC the responsibility for insuring thrifts as well as commercial banks. (Credit unions continue to have a separate deposit insurance agency, the NCUA.) While the deposit insurance of thrifts and banks was consolidated into the FDIC, the two types of intermediaries retained separate insurance reserve funds – bank deposits are insured by the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and thrift deposits by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF).  

FDICIA also reduced the scope of federal deposit insurance. The most significant change is the restriction on the TBTF initiatives that provide governmental protection of deposits beyond the prescribed $\$100,000$ limit. The FDIC’s ability to reimburse uninsured depositors – those with over $\$100,000$ and those with foreign deposits – was severely limited. FDICIA, however, does permit TBTF initiatives if failure would “have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial stability.” This exception requires the agreement of a two-thirds majority of the directors of the FDIC, a two-thirds majority of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to document the need to invoke the systemic risk exception. The GAO must review any actions taken, and analyze the potential effect on the behavior of other insured depository institutions as well as uninsured depositors. The rest of the banking industry is required to pay the cost of any bailout through an emergency assessment by the FDIC that is proportional to each bank’s average total tangible assets.28 Only the best-capitalized banks will be able to offer insured brokered deposits (large CDs sold through brokerage firms) or accounts established under employee pension plans that offer pass-through insurance.29 FDICIA also required the FDIC to adopt risk-sensitive deposit insurance premia.  

# FDIC Funding  

The shrinking bank deposit insurance fund was bolstered with an additional $\$70$ billion in borrowing authority. The FDIC’s authority to borrow from the Treasury was increased from $\$5$ billion to $\$30$ billion. The loans were to be repaid with increased deposit insurance charges on the banks. The FDIC was authorized to borrow additionally for working capital needs. The money, about $\$45$ billion, and interest would be repaid as the FDIC gradually disposes of the assets of failed banks. The FDIC also was instructed to rebuild the BIF to $1.25\%$ of insured domestic deposits by the year 2006, which was achieved well before that.  

# The Discount Window  

FDICIA limits the Federal Reserve’s ability to use the discount window to support a financially troubled bank. Permitting discount window access to a failing bank allows uninsured deposits to be withdrawn prior to FDIC resolution, thereby increasing the exposure of the deposit insurance fund. FDICIA limits the amount of discount window lending to a bank’s capital, with restrictions applying to undercapitalized (capital less than $8\%$ of assets) and critically undercapitalized banks. Although the Federal Reserve retains considerable discretion in its discount window policy, it is liable to the FDIC for losses suffered by the deposit insurance fund due to discount window access provided to critically undercapitalized banks.  

Another significant change in the discount window is that FDICIA now permits all nonbank U.S. firms – brokerage and other financial services firms as well as nonfinancial firms – to borrow at the discount window for emergency purposes under the same collateral terms afforded to banks.  

# Corporate Governance of Banks  

FDICIA contains provisions aimed at strengthening the audit function of the boards of directors of banks and developing guidelines for the compensation of directors and officers. These provisions are designed to protect the deposit insurance fund by enhancing managerial and director accountability.  

Specifically, banks are required to have audit committees composed exclusively of “outside” directors who are independent of the management of the institution. Two additional requirements are imposed on large institutions. First, their audit committees cannot include large customers of the institution. Second, audit committee members must have banking or related financial management expertise, and they must have access to independent outside counsel of their own choosing. FDICIA prescribes that the audit committee shall review external audits with management and the independent accountants. These provisions are designed to increase the independence of the audit committee and its ability to monitor management. They in many ways anticipate the requirements of the Sarbanes–Oxley legislation of 2002 which applies to all publicly owned corporations.  

FDICIA’s impact on board compensation committees is less direct. FDICIA does not specify the composition of the board’s compensation committee, but it calls for federal banking agencies to prescribe guidelines for executive and board compensation that preclude employment contracts that could jeopardize the financial health of the institution.  

# Foreign Banks and Foreign Deposits  

FDICIA gives the Federal Reserve new authority to regulate foreign bank operations in the United States. The FDIC is generally prohibited from protecting foreign branch deposits of a failed bank. In cases where the agency determines offshore deposits must be repaid to protect the system, it is required to recover losses through an industry-wide assessment on an expanded base that has the effect of assessing foreign deposits.  

# Accounting Reforms  

The federal banking agencies must issue regulations requiring banks to report off-balance-sheet items on financial statements. In addition, the agencies must require disclosure of the fair market value of all assets, to the extent possible.  

# Restrictions on State Bank Powers  

FDICIA prohibits state banks from exercising powers not permissible to federally chartered institutions, including insurance underwriting. The bill “grandfathers” banks already lawfully engaged in underwriting insurance under state law. Another exemption permits state banks to invest up to $10\%$ of their portfolio in stocks listed on national securities exchanges, provided they are already in the business.  

# Consumer Provisions  

The principal consumer protection is the truth-in-savings provision, which requires uniform disclosure of the terms and conditions of savings accounts. A “greenlining” amendment provides incentives for banks to lend money in less affluent neighborhoods. The FDIC is required to start an affordable housing program and to give nonprofit organizations an opportunity to purchase residential properties acquired from failed banks.  

# Miscellaneous Provisions  

FDICIA also relaxes the “qualified thrift lender test” allowing thrifts to invest more of their assets outside of housingrelated areas.  

# An Evaluation of FDICIA30  

As we have seen in earlier chapters, banks must process risk if they are to serve as qualitative asset transformers. However, because of the regulatory safety net that is needed to foster banking stability, a moral hazard arises stemming from banks’ propensities to take excessive risks. The goal of bank regulation should be to address this moral hazard without stifling the intermediation function of banks.  

FDICIA focused on limiting the deposit insurance exposure of taxpayers.31 To this end, FDICIA provides banking agencies with a clear goal of minimizing deposit insurance losses and providing incentives to encourage compliance. The prompt corrective action requirements limit regulatory forbearance, and risk-sensitive capital requirements and deposit insurance premia may restrain risk-taking.32  

There are four main criticisms of FDICIA. First, while the principal thrust of FDICIA was to limit the size and scope of the federal financial safety net, the discount window access given to nonbanking firms potentially expands the safety net.33  

Second, FDICIA may impede desirable risk-taking function of banks as qualitative asset transformers. FDICIA was a reaction to perceived excesses in the industry and to failures of the regulators. However, FDICIA failed to address the question of optimal risk-taking by banks.34 Rather, it focused on recapitalizing the BIF and ensuring that future costs to the deposit insurance fund were better controlled. But this could deter banks from processing the kinds of risks that are also socially optimal.  

Third, FDICIA directs each federal banking agency to monitor banks’ operations, management, asset quality, earnings, stock values, and the compensation of executives and directors. This mandate could pressure regulators to “micromanage” banks and to discourage desirable risk-taking and innovation.  

Fourth, FDICIA failed to address the issue of the competitiveness of U.S. banks vis à vis foreign banks and nonbank competitors. The discretionary elements of regulation, including expanded powers to fine and dismiss directors and officers and to review executive compensation, raises potentially nondiversifiable investor risk and, therefore, increases banks’ cost of capital. This reduces banks’ competitiveness. Also, the increased exposure of directors and officers elevates the cost and difficulty of staffing these positions. While the Act will require greater care on the part of directors and officers, it will discourage those with reputational capital or other forms of wealth from serving as directors and officers of financial institutions.  

Another competitive weakness of FDICIA relates to Glass–Steagall and interstate branching prohibitions. When the 1991 Treasury proposal was being discussed, the financial health of banks was thought to be too precarious to permit expanded powers via repeal of Glass–Steagall. When the issue resurfaced in 1993, opponents of repeal argued that bank profits were at historic highs, so that expanded powers were unnecessary to bolster bank profitability. The key impediment to repeal of Glass–Steagall appeared to be the potential for increased taxpayer exposure. Further, the greater number of regulatory requirements (including requirements such as Truth-in-Savings that are unrelated to bank safety) could further damage banks’ competitiveness.  

While these criticisms might be well founded, in retrospect, one could come up with a very positive assessment of FDICIA that may prevail. Prompt corrective action and the focus on getting banks to keep more capital on the balance sheet – effectively through a leverage ratio – have become a central part of the Basel III Capital Accord, 20 years later.  

# THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 1999  

After a relentless weakening of its key separation provisions, the Glass–Steagall Act was finally formally dismantled in 1999 with the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act or the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act. This act repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass–Steagall Act. It also authorized BHCs and foreign banks that meet eligibility criteria to become financial holding companies, thus allowing them to engage in a broad array of financially related activities. In addition, the Act addressed the functional regulation of financial holding companies, the protection of nonpublic customer information held by financial institutions, the supervision of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), and other regulatory practices. A summary of the key elements of the act are provided below.  

Repeal of Glass–Steagall. Allows U.S. financial services providers, including banks, securities firms and insurance companies, to affiliate with each other and enter each other’s markets.   
Bank Holding Company Structure. Generally BHC affiliates will be the vehicles through which to engage in a broad range of financial activities.   
Qualification to Engage in Financial Activities. Requires all subsidiary insured depository institutions of the holding company to be well capitalized and well managed in order for the holding company to engage in broader financial activities. Divestiture and/or other restrictions and limitations may be required in the event of noncompliance.  

Operating Subsidiary Activities. Allows national banks with assets of $\$1$ billion or less to conduct financial activities through operating subsidiaries. In order to conduct such activities through a subsidiary, the national bank and all insured depository institution affiliates must be well capitalized and well managed and the national bank must receive the approval of the OCC based on those criteria. A national bank subsidiary engaging in such activities will be subject to affiliate transaction restrictions and to antitying prohibitions. The bank also must deduct from capital the amount of its investment in the subsidiary. National banks with assets exceeding $\$1$ billion must conduct financial activities through holding company affiliates. National banks of any size may engage in financial activities on an agency basis through an operating subsidiary. National banks lawfully conducting activities through operating subsidiaries as of the date of enactment will be permitted to continue such activities.  

Municipal Revenue Bond Underwriting. Authorized as a permissible banking activity. Therefore, this activity may be conducted by the bank directly or in an operating subsidiary. Previously, only the general obligations of municipalities could be underwritten by banks.  

 Functional Regulation. Relies on strong functional regulation of the banking, insurance, and securities components of the holding company, and establishes the Federal Reserve as the umbrella regulator.  

 Reduces Regulatory Burdens. Streamlines regulatory burdens by requiring the Federal Reserve as umbrella supervisor to rely on reports and examinations conducted by other functional regulators. Also requires sharing of information among affected regulatory agencies as necessary to carry out their official duties.  

Competition Protection Rules. Requires the federal banking agencies to issue joint consumer protection regulations governing the sale of insurance products by banks, their employees, or others who engage in such activities on behalf of the banks. The federal banking regulators must consult with the states in the process of formulating their joint rules. Provisions of federal rules deemed more protective will pre-empt state law or rules unless within three years of federal notification the state legislatures enact laws opting out of such coverage.  

 FICO Assessment. Freezes the BIF-member FICO assessment for 3 years, beginning 1999. This represents a saving of about $\$18,000$ per year for a bank with total assets of $\$100$ million. It is therefore important to smaller community banks. This freeze is important because it will give Congress time to consider other important issues such as the merger of the FDIC insurance funds, merger of banks and thrift charters, and consolidation of regulatory agencies such as the OCC and the OTS. Since 1980, there have been at least 13 congressional hearings on the soundness of the federal deposit insurance system. There have been 11 proposals introduced concerning consolidation of federal regulation of banks and savings and loan institutions; and five proposals to merge bank and thrift charters.  

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Establishes a rebuttable presumption of CRA compliance with respect to an insured depository institution that has achieved a “satisfactory” or better rating in its most recent CRA exam and in each of its CRA exams during the immediately preceding 36-month period. The presumption of compliance may be rebutted by any person presenting substantial verifiable information to the contrary.  

Banks and savings and loan associations with total assets less than $\$100$ million and located in nonmetropolitan areas are exempted from the provisions of the CRA. This exemption only applies to $38\%$ of all banks and savings and loans, which collectively control only $2.8\%$ of banking assets nationwide.  

Bank Securities Activities. While eliminating the broad exemption that banks enjoyed from registration as a broker or dealer under the securities laws, the bill makes clear that banks serving as custodians to self-directed IRAs will not be required to push these activities out of the bank and into a registered broker or dealer. Banks often function as service providers to pension, retirement, profit sharing, bonus, thrift, savings, incentive and other plans. The SEC, with the concurrence of the Federal Reserve Board, may determine by regulation those new products which, if offered or sold by a bank, would subject it to registration with the SEC. A bank may offer or sell “traditional banking products,” as defined in this section, without becoming subject to registration with the SEC.  

Federal Home Loan Bank Reforms. Includes provisions to modernize the operations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. As of June 1, 2000, membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System was made voluntary. Community banks (those banks with total assets less than $\$500$ million) will be able to become members without regard to the percentage of total assets represented by residential mortgage loans. Community banks will be able to use advances for small business, small farm and small agribusiness lending. It also allows community banks to collateralize advances with small business and agricultural loans, and modifies the governance structure of the System to give more authority to the regional banks.  

# THE DODD–FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT  

In a response to the global financial crisis, the US policymakers enacted The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd–Frank Act) in 2010. The Dodd–Frank Act presents a sweeping regulatory overhaul across several aspects of banking regulation and reshapes the banking regulatory and legal environment for years to come.35  

The Dodd–Frank Act consists of 16 titles. It creates several new regulatory agencies (e.g., the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), the Office of Financial Research (OFR), and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection) and merges or eliminates others (e.g., it abolishes the OTS). The regulatory reform aims at mitigating systemic risk to protect the US economy and consumers, businesses and investors alike. It focuses on the regulation and supervision of financial institutions that are too-big-to-fail with the idea to end the reliance on the tax payer. The Dodd–Frank Act provides mechanisms for orderly wind down of the systemically important institution (SIIs), defines the framework for consumer protection, regulates credit rating agencies, and provides rules on executive compensation and corporate governance.  

# Title I – Financial Stability  

Title I of the Dodd–Frank Act establishes a regulatory structure capable of identifying and mitigating systemic risk. The importance of addressing systemic risk was explained in Chapter 15  A more integral view of the financial system, focusing on the interconnectiveness across financial institutions and the macroprudential regulation needed to address it, has gained importance.  

# What Made Systemic Risk More Prevalent?  

As highlighted in Chapter 3  banks have become increasingly sensitive to financial market developments. This more intertwined nature of banks and financial markets has exposed banks to the boom and bust nature of those markets and possibly augmented instability.36 Moreover, (opportunistic) decision-making in momentum-driven financial markets may induce herding, and, as a consequence, banks may become more similar in terms of risk exposure. Systemic risk may then become paramount. Meaning, when all institutions make the same bets, risk exposures become more highly correlated and a simultaneous failure of institutions is more likely.37  

Title I sets the regulatory and supervisory framework for large BHCs and for nonbank financial companies that are deemed important for the U.S. financial stability. Title I also seeks to improve the regulatory standards for U.S. financial institutions and financial markets in general.  

Title I creates a new, independent regulatory body entitled the Financial Stability Oversight Council  In addition, it establishes the OFR as an independent department within the Treasury department. The FSOC’s tasks are to (1) identify risks to the financial stability of the U.S. and of the U.S. financial system, (2) promote market discipline by removing toobig-to-fail guarantees, and (3) respond to the threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The FSOC together with the OFR gather data to be able to assess risks to the financial system.  

The FSOC’s task is also to determine the significant non-bank financial institutions, defined as non-bank financial institutions whose failure may create repercussions for the stability of the U.S. financial system. In addition, the FSOC will make recommendations to the Federal Reserve on the implementation of the improved regulatory and supervisory framework to be applied to significant nonbank financial institutions and to BHCs with consolidated assets of $\$50$ billion or more.  

The areas for improved regulation and supervision include: capital requirements, liquidity requirements, resolution plans, credit exposure requirement, concentration limits, contingent capital requirements, improved public disclosure, short-term debt limits, and risk management-requirements. It also stipulates that the Federal Reserve needs to build a framework of early remediation requirements for large BHCs and significant nonbank financial institutions. More specifically, the Federal Reserve needs to define minimum capital and liquidity levels whose breach would trigger remedial actions that include limits on capital redistribution, mergers, and acquisitions and growth in total assets, but can also include forced recapitalizations, changes in management or asset sales. The Federal Reserve can also take remedial actions under the approval of the FSOC if a BHC or nonbank financial institution is determined to pose a grave threat to the U.S. financial stability. The framework for early remediation requirements reflects the Prompt Corrective Action provision under the FDICIA that applies to insured depository institutions.  

The authority over supervision and enforcement actions against large BHCs and systemically important nonbank financial institutions is put squarely in the hands of the Federal Reserve. The stringency of regulation increases with the systemic importance of the regulated BHCs and nonbank financial institutions.  

In the case where systemic risk is perceived to be imminently threatening the banking system or financial markets, the FSOC may recommend to any regulatory agency that stricter regulatory requirements are imposed on the relevant entities. In its recommendation, activities or practices that elevate systemic risk may be limited, regulated, or even completely prohibited. The regulatory agency may decide not to follow the recommendation of the FSOC but needs to explain the decision to the FSOC in writing. The FSOC needs to report to the Congress on its recommendations.  

The FDIC is granted examination and enforcement authority over BHCs whose subsidiary is an insured depository institution. An examination authority can be used to examine if a BHC is approaching the conditions for orderly liquidation under Title II of the Dodd–Frank Act. An enforcement authority can be used if the actions of a BHC may impose a loss on the Deposit Insurance Fund.  

Title I of the Dodd–Frank Act equips the regulator with powers to tackle SIIs, the so-called SIFIs – systemically significant financial institutions (either banks, BHCs, or non-bank financial institutions). Key issues that remain are how to identify SIFIs and whether too much focus on SIFIs would possibly distract from discovering systemic risk building up elsewhere.38  

# Title II – Orderly Liquidation Authority  

The global financial crisis showed that regulators had insufficient authority to orderly wind down large, nondepository financial institutions, such as investment banks or BHCs. Title II of the Dodd–Frank Act provides authority for orderly liquidation to the Federal Reserve and to the FDIC, mimicking the resolution process for the depository institution under the FDICIA.  

Under Title II, companies eligible for orderly liquidation (so-called covered financial companies) are BHCs, significant nonbank financial institutions, and companies predominantly engaged in financial activities (as determined by the Federal Reserve).  

The Federal Reserve or FDIC can make a proposal to the Treasury Secretary to appoint the FDIC as a receiver for the covered financial company (or the SEC for broker/dealers, or the Director of the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) for insurance companies). Such a recommendation must be approved by a two-thirds majority at the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC Board. The Treasury Secretary needs to determine in consultation with the President whether (1) the covered financial company is in default or is approaching default, (2) its failure will result in serious repercussions for financial stability, (3) there are no other private sector solutions, (4) the repercussions to shareholders, creditors, investors, and counterparties of the company are appropriate in light of the need to safeguard financial stability in the United States, (5) such repercussions should be minimized while considering financial stability, cost to the public funds, and potential future increase in risk taking, (6) convertible debt instruments are converted into equity, (7) the company is a financial company. If all conditions are met, the company is put under receivership (with judicial approval of the Court for the District of Columbia).  

The FDIC as a receiver must take actions to safeguard financial stability. In addition, it must assure that the unsecured creditors bear losses according to the priority of their claims, and shareholders are only compensated at the end after all other claimants if there are any proceeds left. The FDIC also must replace the management and the responsible directors of the failed institution.  

Under the receivership, the FDIC has far-reaching powers that largely mimic the rights of the FDIC in the case of a failure of a depository institution. The FDIC obtains all rights and powers of the company in receivership and needs to operate the company or liquidate its business. The FDIC can merge the company with another company and/or transfer assets and liabilities.39  

# Title VI – Improvements to Regulation of Bank and Savings Association Holding Companies and Depository Institutions  

Title VI provides for a variety of measures to strengthen the regulation of BHCs, saving and loan holding companies and depository institutions to ensure that these will not threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system. Title VI contains the Volcker Rule, which prohibits banks and BHCs from engaging in proprietary trading, and from investing in private equity funds and hedge funds (see Chapter 15 for a more detailed discussion of the Volcker Rule). It also contains other measures that give the Federal Reserve the power to evaluate mergers and acquisitions based on their impact on stability, and to prescribe countercyclical capital buffers when deemed necessary.  

# Title VII – Wall Street Transparency and Accountability  

Title VII regulates over the counter (OTC) derivatives markets. It requires various OTC to be cleared at the clearinghouses or exchanges. The aim of Title VII is to lower the interconnectedness of financial companies through the OTC market (eliminate counterparty risk) and to increase transparency in the OTC derivatives markets. Under Title VII of the Dodd– Frank Act, over-the-counter derivatives will be subject to robust regulation for the first time. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will be granted regulatory jurisdiction over interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives – swaps and futures primarily. Title VII instructs the CFTC to implement several regulatory mandates, including registration, business conduct standards, central clearing, trading, capital, margin, and reporting requirements.  

# Title IX – Investor Protections and Improvements to the Regulation of Securities  

Title IX devotes significant attention to investor protection and disclosure of relevant information in the securitization process in particular. It also addresses disclosures related to executive compensation.  

An important part of Title IX is the regulatory reform of credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies are companies that evaluate the creditworthiness of debt instruments issued by corporations or (semi) governments by assigning credit ratings; see Chapter 2  Credit rating agencies were widely criticized to have contributed to the global financial crisis by being overly generous in assigning ratings.40  

The criticism of rating agencies is not really new. In the 2002 Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX) that followed the spectacular demise of companies like Enron and Worldcom, rating agencies were criticized. SOX commissioned the SEC to perform a study to investigate “…the role and function of credit rating agencies in the operation of the securities market” (SOX, 2002, Section 702b). The study was conducted in early 2003 and focused on the privileged position of the three big rating agencies – Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poors (S&P) and Fitch Ratings – as Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO). This status effectively creates a substantial barrier to newcomers entering the credit rating business to compete with the NRSROs.41 The Credit Agency Reform Act of 2006 (SEC, 2006) abolished this classification in an attempt to open the rating business for new entrants. While other concerns, including potential conflicts of interest, were also on the table, no actions were taken until the Dodd–Frank Act.  

The Dodd–Frank Act seeks to address the conflict of interest within credit rating agencies. Its provisions relate to internal controls that govern the process of determining credit ratings, separation of marketing and production of credit ratings, search for (present and past) conflict of interests of their employees, and to the corporate governance of credit rating agencies.  

Title IX also broadens their potential liability and allows the SEC to charge higher penalties. In addition, Title IX asks for higher disclosure standards with respect to the characteristics of a debt instrument that has a credit rating. Greater disclosure of the rating process itself, including the information, procedures, and methodologies used, is also part of Title IX.  

# Title X – Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection  

Title X establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB is equipped with far-reaching powers from several Federal consumer protection laws. It has a broad rule-making authority to shape consumer protection in the United States. Its decisions may in a few instances be overruled by the FSOC.  

The CFPB must direct its activities to prohibit abusive, deceptive, or unfair financial practices. Its responsibilities with respect to the mortgage reform are further defined under Title XIV of the Dodd–Frank Act. Title X also sets limits on interchange fees for debit card transactions.  

# Title XI – Federal Reserve System Provisions  

Title XI sets higher limitations on when the Federal Reserve may use emergency assistance to financial institutions. The Federal Reserve may only provide emergency assistance if needed on a broad-based scale to provide liquidity to the financial system or part of it (under the approval of the Treasury Secretary). Emergency assistance should not be used to support failing institutions. The hope is that such a limitation may enhance its credibility, lower ex-ante risk taking of financial institutions and reduce the probability and severity of future crises.  

Title XI also provides the FDIC the possibility to guarantee bank debt. In the case of extraordinary financial distress (and upon the approval of two-thirds of the members of the board of the Federal Reserve and FDIC and the Treasury Secretary), the FDIC is to create a program of debt guarantees for solvent insured banks and BHCs. The maximum amount of guarantees is determined by the Treasury in consultation with the President and requires Congressional approval.  

# Title XII – Improving Access to Mainstream Financial Institutions  

Title XII aims to improve access to basic financial services and products for low- and medium-income citizens by offering three voluntary programs that the financial institutions may tap into. First, the Secretary Treasury should establish a program to provide low- and medium-income individuals with the incentives to open an account at a depository institutions. Second, the financial institutions should be supported in their offering of small dollar value loans under attractive interest rates. Such loans are intended to replace payday loans that were often offered by financial institutions under unreasonable and excessive interest rates. Third, additional financial assistance should be provided for community development and financial institutions that provide small dollar loan programs.

# Recent Changes to the Dodd-Frank Act  

In May 2018, numerous legislative changes were made to Dodd-Frank. The gist of these changes was to offer regulatory relief to all but the largest banks. Here is a brief summary:42  

Banks with Less Than $\$3$ Billion in Assets: They will be exempt from Basel III and have greater flexibility to use debt in acquisitions. They will have an 18-month regulatory examination cycle if well managed and well capitalized.   
Banks With Less Than $\$10$ Billion in Assets: They will be exempt from the Volker Rule and can opt into the leverage ratio applicable to community banks $8\%$ to $10\%$ ), which would replace all other capital and leverage ratios. Banks With Less Than $\$20$ Billion in Assets: Federal Savings Associations can choose to operate with the same powers as a national bank without converting their charters. They would then be able to do commercial lending in the same way as commercial banks. Banks With Less Than $\$50$ Billion in Assets: The SIFI (Systemically Important Financial Institutions) threshold for enhanced prudential regulation standards, including the CCAR stress tests and elevated risk management and liquidity standards, is increased from $\$50$ billion to $\$250$ billion. Company-run stress tests are only required now for banks with more than $\$250$ billion assets.  

# EU REGULATORY AND SUPERVISORY OVERHAUL AND THE DE LAROSIÈRE REPORT  

In 2008, the president of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso established a High-Level Group on financial supervision in the EU, chaired by Jacques de Larosière, to propose regulatory and supervisory overhaul in the EU. The so-called de Larosière Report reviews the causes of the global financial crisis, suggests changes to bank regulation, proposes a better EU supervisory framework, and discusses the regulatory/supervisory developments needed on the global level (de Larosière (2009)).  

One of the crucial findings of the de Larosière Report is that the European system of supervision and crisis management was fundamentally flawed and needed repair. The de Larosière Report proposes a number of recommendations. It recommends the establishment of a new regulatory body, tasked with the official mandate to assess macrofinancial risks, issue warnings, and propose recommendations on how to mitigate these risks. The de Larosière Report also proposes recommendations to improve microsupervision in the EU. It recommends further integration and synchronization of bank regulation across the EU and a bolder move toward a European system of financial supervision.  

The European policymakers have largely followed the recommendations of the de Larosière Report. They have established the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) to be in charge of spotting the systemic risks in the EU financial system. In addition, at the microlevel, existing coordination committees were replaced with three sector bodies: the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), each responsible for primarily pan-European coordination in their particular field. These EU-linked coordinating agencies have little real power. As indicated in Chapter 15  the development of a banking union, with strong supervisory powers in the hands of the ECB, may lessen the significance of these EU agencies.  

# Other EU Directives  

A single rulebook for regulation across the EU has been established by common capital regulation (Capital requirements regulation and directive $-\mathbf{CRR^{43}/C R D\ I V^{44}})$ , common rules on deposit insurance (Directive on deposit guarantee schemes45) and on bank recovery and resolution (Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation46 and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive47). Moreover, in November 2013, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) – conferring bank-supervisory powers on the ECB – came into effect. The SSM creates a new system of financial supervision comprising the ECB and the national supervisory authorities of participating EU countries. In tandem, the Single Resolution Mechanism and the SSM are referred to as the “Banking Union.”  

The Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) closely implement Basel III regulatory standards on capital, liquidity, and leverage ratio across the EU. Even though the capital requirements under the CRR remain unchanged at $8\%$ of risk-weighted assets, what qualifies as of bank capital has changed. In particular, banks need to hold at least $4.5\%$ of risk-weighted assets in the form of common equity  so “lower quality” forms of capital (e.g., intangibles) are now disallowed. The CRD IV defines additional capital buffers for SIIs, a countercyclical capital buffer (i.e., macroprudential buffer), and a capital conservation buffer (see Table 16.3). Bank supervisors can also increase a bank’s capital requirement to compensate for deficiencies in the bank’s risk-management practices that are uncovered by the supervisory process under the Pillar II of Basel III. The CRR also puts a floor on a bank’s capital (being effective as of 2017): bank capital cannot fall below $80\%$ of capital requirements under Basel I.  

TABLE 16.3 The Components of Capital Regulation   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Share of Risk-Weighted Assets (%)</td><td> The Type of Bank Capital</td><td> The Groups of Bank Capital</td></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td> Bank's own buffer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0-2</td><td> Pillar 2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0-5</td><td>Higher of systemic risk, G-Sll and O-Sll buffers</td><td rowspan="3">Combined buffer (all in the form of Common equity tier 1 capital)</td></tr><tr><td>0-2.5</td><td>Countercyclical capital buffer</td></tr><tr><td>2.5</td><td> Capital conservation buffer</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Tier 2</td><td rowspan="3">Basic requirement (8%)</td></tr><tr><td>1.5</td><td>Additional Tier 1</td></tr><tr><td>4.5</td><td>Common Equity Tier 1</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note  See European Commission (2013)  

The CRR also implements liquidity regulation following Basel III liquidity standards: the Liquidity Coverage Requirement (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Requirement (NSFR). The requirement that the LCR is at least $100\%$ was phased in gradually and fully implemented in 2018.  

The leverage ratio (i.e., the ratio of tier 1 capital over nonrisk weighted on- and off-balance sheet items) is currently not being implemented under the Pillar I and is therefore not included as a binding capital requirement. Rather, it is a part of Pillar II. However, banks are required to publically disclose their leverage ratios from 2015 onwards, and will be subject to ongoing evaluations. The implementation of the binding minimum leverage ratio is still ongoing. An implementation of a binding leverage ratio and net stable funding ratio has been proposed in the Amendments of the capital requirement directive/capital requirements regulation, the so-called CRD-V package.48  

Directive on deposit guarantee schemes harmonizes deposit insurance across the EU. The coverage limit of deposit insurance is set at $\notin100,000$ per depositor per bank but can be temporarily raised. Individual deposits and deposits of nonfinancial companies are covered (regardless of their currencies). The payment schedule is to be reduced from the current 20 to 7 working days. The deposit insurance fund should be funded ex-ante and should reach at least $0.8\%$ of covered deposits in the national banking system. Deposit insurance premia are to be risk adjusted according to the criteria set by the EBA.  

The recent developments are an important step forward, especially the funding requirements and further harmonization of deposit insurance across the EU. However, deposit insurance would still be national and backed only by the domestic treasury. Further moves toward a pan-European Deposit Guarantee Scheme might be necessary to reduce fragmentation along national lines in the European banking system. In particular, systemic bank failures in one of the European countries, may leave the national deposit insurance fund incapable of covering all the mandated payments. Even the anticipation of such an event may cause panic withdrawals and flight of deposits to neighboring countries with stronger deposit insurance funds. This might elevate the competitive advantage of banks in stronger countries over those in weaker countries and leads to distortions in competition.  

Bank recovery and resolution in the EU is governed by the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) requires banks to build “living wills,” which are resolution plans – to be used in the case of a failure. In addition, it sets a coherent framework for early intervention, giving bank supervisory powers to impose corrective actions on failing banks before insolvency. The BRRD also seeks to provide necessary tools to resolution authorities to be able to wind down failing banks effectively, without repercussions for financial stability, and without the need for public funds. Resolution tools include forced sell-off of (parts of) failing banks, transfer of business to a bridge bank, establishment of a good bank/bad bank structure, and a haircuts for bank creditors (i.e., bail in of bank creditors).  

The SRM creates a new, independent EU agency – the Single Resolution Board – responsible for an orderly wind down of failing banks in the EU, as stipulated by the SRM. It also creates a supporting Single Bank Resolution Fund that provides funds necessary for a smooth resolution of failing banks. The Single Resolution Mechanism’s resolution powers encompass the largest (most significant) banks in the EU (these number 120 out of a total of around 6000 banks in the Euro Area49) – the same ones that are covered by the SSM. Following the BRRD, the Single Resolution Board sets up the minimum requirement for equity and eligible liabilities (MREL). MREL seeks to ensure that a bank has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity such that the resolution authorities are able to support critical bank functions and restore a bank’s capital position after resolution. Currently, the MREL is set to $13.5\%$ of risk-weighted assets plus a combined capital buffer requirement that consists of the capital conservation buffer, an institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer, a systemic risk buffer, and additional buffers for globally systemically important institutions.50  

The SSM tasks the ECB with the supervisory authority over significant banks in the EU. The supervisory powers of the ECB include providing and withdrawing licenses to credit institutions, approving mergers and acquisitions and asset disposals of BHCs, supervision of compliance with bank regulation, and increasing regulatory standards if needed to safeguard financial stability. For example, the ECB could demand that a bank strengthen its corporate governance or raise its capital levels. National supervisors retain their supervisory responsibilities toward other, less significant, banks. In addition, they provide support and local knowledge in the supervision of significant banks’ operations in their countries.  

The European Union also seeks to strengthen the functioning of capital markets, and particularly reduce the fragmentation along national lines. Proposals have been made to create a so-called Capital Market Union, a step in the direction of making Europe less bank-dependent by easing access to nonbank funding sources.  

# Structural reform proposals  

# UK Vickers Report  

As discussed in Chapter 15  in the wake of the global financial crisis, the UK government established a commission with a task to analyze how to enhance financial stability and competition in financial services (Independent Commission on Banking (2011)). The objectives of the Independent Commission on Banking were: (i) to reduce the severity and frequency of the future systemic financial crises; (ii) to enhance the ability of the financial system to support the real economy (e.g., by providing credit, risk management, and other financial products to households and businesses), and; (iii) to secure the stability of the payment system and assure capital and liquidity certainty of individuals and small and medium enterprises.  

The Independent Commission on Banking explicitly took into account not just financial stability issues but also the competitive environment. It stated as its principles that it seek to curb incentives for excessive risk taking, reduce the costs of the future systemic financial crises, and increase the level of competition in the banking system. It considered the costs that more stringent regulatory standards might impose on GDP due to a lower level of banking activity (e.g., lending) and the impact on competitiveness of the UK financial sector and economy.51 It also evaluated the impact of regulatory reform on the nonbank financial institutions in the UK.  

In the final report, called Vickers Report, the Independent Commission on Banking suggests several structural measures as well as improvements in capital regulation and competition in retail banking (Independent Commission on Banking (2011)). The crucial feature of the Vickers report are the proposed structural measures to separate (“ring fencing”) retail banking, which is crucial for the smooth operation of the UK real economy, from other, less systemically important banking services (e.g., wholesale and investment banking services).  

Ring fencing still allows banks to exploit some economies of scale among retail and wholesale/investment banking activities. Subsidiaries can share information, expertise, and brand name. They can provide a one-stop-shopping access to all banking services. In addition, the banking group can provide “back-stop” capital to the ring-fenced subsidiaries in case of financial difficulty.52  

The idea is that ring fencing enables an efficient resolution of a failing bank by preserving the ring-fenced part (e.g., moving it to a bridge bank or to a private acquirer) and liquidating the rest. Also, burden-sharing arrangements that include bank shareholders and creditors should minimize the reliance on public funds to rescue the bank. It is also envisioned that ring fencing shields the retail banking part from external financial shocks that affect wholesale and investment banking operations. Finally, ring fencing may allow regulators to focus exclusively on the retail banking operations, and thus keep wholesale and investment banking more competitive by having reduced regulatory scrutiny and lighter regulation.  

Besides structural measures, the Vickers Report recommends that loss-absorbing capacity in the UK banking system needs to be increased. The first recommendation is to increase the minimum capital requirements for large UK retail banks to an equity capital level that is at least $10\%$ of risk-weighted assets. This is far above the Basel III minimum, even for globally systemically important banks. The minimum leverage ratio should be increased accordingly.  

In addition, the primary loss-absorbing capacity of large UK banking groups should be at least $17-20\%$ . Primary lossabsorbing capacity includes equity and other capital, but also long-term unsecured debt with so-called “bail-in” provisions. The holders of bail-in debt can take losses in the resolution process if the equity of banks is wiped out. Contingent capital (“cocos”) that can take losses before the resolution can also be included in the primary loss-absorbing capacity if deemed appropriate by the regulators. The regulator keeps discretion on the level of loss-absorbing capacity within the range of $17-20\%$ and on the type of loss-absorbing capacity. That is, the regulator needs to estimate the risk of a bank dipping into the till of public finances for help, the bank’s strength in credit recovery and the viability of its resolution plans, and accordingly adjust the minimum loss-absorbing capacity somewhere in the range from 17 to $20\%$ .  

The Vickers Report also suggests that insured deposits have higher priority in potential resolution compared to other uninsured debt. This reinforces the credibility of a stance that losses are imposed on unsecured debt in the case of a bank failure. Creditors anticipate losses in resolution and, therefore, have higher incentives to monitor risks of banks.  

The Vickers Report also unveils substantial shortcomings in the competitive environment in the UK banking system. It notes that the UK banking system is heavily concentrated. Four largest banks have a $77\%$ of market share in personal current accounts and $85\%$ of market share in current accounts for small and medium enterprises. Switching between banks is difficult and the terms of offered bank services are rather opaque. In addition, during the global financial crisis, two large banks, Lloyds and HBOS, merged even though the competition authority (i.e., Office of Fair Trade) estimated that such a merger would hamper competition in personal current accounts, and mortgage and small and medium enterprise banking services.  

The Vickers Report comes with recommendations to improve the odds of establishing another viable bank (building on the mandatory divestiture of Lloyds’ branch network). It also proposes measures to ease switching among banks for individuals and small and medium enterprises (faster transfer of accounts between banks). This focus on competition in banking has been much more dominant in the UK than in continental Europe or even the US.  

Liikanen report: As discussed in Chapter 15  the Liikanen proposals suggest that banks should transfer proprietary trading and other trading activities to a separate legal entity if these activities are significant in size (Liikanen (2012)). In effect, deposit-taking activities and the pending government safety network would then be separated from risky trading activities in banking. However, a separate legal entity where the trading activities would reside could be a part of the same banking group (see also Chapter 11). Consequently, the European universal banking model could be left intact. Table 16.4 summarizes the Liikanen, Volcker, and Vickers proposals.  

The Volcker rule is possibly the most stringent, but narrower in scope because it only prohibits proprietary trading and allows for market making activities and contains several exemptions. The Liikanen Report and the Vickers Report are much broader in scope but less stringent in terms of what they prohibit. In particular, they require the separation of substantially more activities in separate legal entities but do not prohibit them completely.

Apart from the structural remedies, the Liikanen Report also emphasizes the importance of implementing of the new regulatory framework in the EU for capital regulation and resolution of weak banks, established by Capital Requirement Regulation and Directive (CRR/CRD IV) and Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. Stronger capital regulation will strengthen banks and their resilience in the future systemic financial crises. The effective resolution process will limit the use of government resources to wind down failing banks even if they are large and systemically important.  

The Liikanen Report supports the need that banks build credible recovery and resolution plans (i.e., the action plans in the case of failure for banks and regulators) as proposed by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive. The Liikanen Report also suggests that structural separation between the depository and trading entity could be widened within the banking group if this is perceived necessary, for example, due to unrealistic recovery and resolution plans.  

The Liikanen Report proposes the use of bail-in debt to increase the loss-absorbing capacity of the EU banking system. The priority of repayment of bail-in debt in the resolution process should be clearly defined and known to investors in advance. The bail-in debt should be kept outside the banking system in order to limit the systemic implications of burden sharing in the case of a bank failure.  

The Liikanen Report also suggests a reevaluation of risk-weights used within the capital regulation framework. It also proposes a reform of bank corporate governance aimed at: (i) improving the quality of board of directors and management boards; (ii) enhancing risk management within the bank; (iii) designing prudent compensation practices; (iv) enhancing disclosure of risks; and (v) empowering regulators with sanctioning powers.  

All this is very much work in progress. The complexity in implementing the various proposals makes it difficult to assess their future impact.53 Having said this, one intended purpose of all of these measures is to make the financial system simpler, that is, reduce complexity. We have yet not seen the implementation of the proposed measures, but if they reduce complexity, then more timely intervention (“prompt corrective action”) might be facilitated. Also resolving financial distress might become easier. To this end, also “living will” requirements are imposed. These seek to provide for a more orderly dismantling/liquidation of failed institutions.  

# CONCLUSION  

U.S. banking history was shaped by American populism and the frontier mentality. The result was a fragmented financial services industry and a similarly fragmented public regulation of financial services. The issuance of bank notes and the need for cash-asset reserves conditioned the focus on liquidity in banking. The pyramiding of liquidity reserves led to systemic risk in the national banking system of the nineteenth century and to periodic financial panics. This led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Federal deposit insurance was added in 1933 in response to a virtual collapse of the banking system.  

Regulation of interest rates and controlled entry into banking created monopoly rents for banks and mitigated the moral hazard arising from deposit insurance. This provided stability that lasted until the late 1970s when higher and more volatile interest rates induced massive disintermediation. Regulators responded by lifting interest-rate ceilings, relaxing investment restrictions, and reducing regulatory scrutiny. Thrifts that were legally locked into fixed-rate mortgages sustained huge losses owing to the consequent interest-rate risk. These losses impelled thrifts to undertake greater credit risk, resulting in further losses. The implosion of the thrift industry eventually led to a series of legislative and regulatory initiatives including FIRREA (1989) and FDICIA (1991).  

The 2007–2009 global financial crisis has led to the regulatory and supervisory overhaul. In the United States, the Dodd–Frank Act was passed. In Europe, several initiatives, including common capital regulation, common rules on deposit insurance and on bank recovery and resolution (Single Resolution Mechanism) and the SSM – conferring bank-supervisory powers on the ECB – were adopted. The crisis facilitated pan-European agreement that would not have been feasible in times that are more tranquil. As with the Volcker Rule in the Dodd Frank Act, further structural changes in banking might be imposed in the United Kingdom (following the Vickers Report) and the EU (the Liikanen Report).  

Regulatory reform has almost always been a reflexive reaction to financial crises. Actions following the 2007–2009 global financial crisis were no different. The unanswered question is: what are the welfare effects of these legislative and regulatory actions? There is a dearth of cost-benefit analyses.

# Liquidity Constraints, Capital Requirements, and Monetary Policy  

The size and composition of banks’ balance sheets are constrained by the legal reserve requirement, which establishes a minimum ratio of cash assets to deposit liabilities, and the capital requirement that establishes minimum ratios of bank capital to risky assets (loans, to a first approximation) and to total assets (the so-called leverage ratio). For most of U.S. history, and certainly for the half-century following the Great Depression, capital requirements tended to be without effect or not binding. Therefore, the operating constraint on banks’ size was the legal cash-asset reserve requirement.54 This changed in the late 1980s when increased credit risks of banks’ on- and off-balance-sheet activities were recognized. At the same time, legal cash-asset reserve requirements were reduced in a series of steps, at least partly in response to the dismal record of bank earnings. For many banks, the position of reserve requirements and capital requirements was reversed, so that the capital requirement became binding. This affected the way monetary policy, especially the Federal Reserve’s open-market operations, played out in the economy.  

In the traditional setting, Federal Reserve purchases of government securities would expand the excess cash-asset reserves of the banking system, prompting the banks to expand lending and the asset size of their balance sheets. The initial Federal Reserve purchase would drive up U.S. government securities prices and depress interest rates. The secondary effect of the expansionary open-market operations would come from the banks’ reactions to new deposits from those who sold their government securities to the Federal Reserve. These autonomous deposits increase the banks’ cash-asset reserves. In an effort to dissipate the new excess reserves, the banks lend newly created deposits. This expands the asset (liability) size of the banks and exerts added downward pressure on interest rates.  

All of this would take place without any interference or influence from capital requirements. Indeed, this traditional interpretation of monetary policy assumes that the capital requirement is not binding. If, however, the capital requirement is binding, a very different picture emerges. The initial effects on interest rates via the government securities markets remain unchanged, but bank reactions are conditioned by an altered constraint. To be sure, a capital constraint can be relaxed by reducing dividends or selling bank equity, or even by realizing capital gains by selling assets or liabilities that are being carried at understated historical values. But such adaptations often are costly in the short run. Thus, the bank’s capital may be fixed in the short run as a practical matter, and in such cases, it is the other balance sheet accounts that must accommodate to the capital constraint.  

Capital requirements are of two types: risk-based and leverage ratios. For simplicity, we can think of the former as a minimum ratio of capital to loans and the latter as a minimum ratio of capital to total assets (liabilities). Now suppose the bank can hold nonearning cash assets, credit risk-free, interest-bearing government securities, or risky loans. Assume further that the cash-asset reserve requirement is zero, but there is a binding capital requirement of either the risk-based or leverage type. Banks have one class of noninterest bearing deposits and one type of capital, equity.  

If the capital requirement is of the risk-based variety, and the Federal Reserve undertakes an expansionary openmarket operation, the bank will receive an autonomous deposit. Some small fraction of the deposit inflow may be held in the form of cash for liquidity purposes, but most will flow into government securities. We know the bank will not make loans because it is capital constrained. Thus, interest rates will fall, deposit expansion will ensue, but loans will not be made.  

Binding capital requirements, therefore, can explain a credit crunch even though monetary policy retains its effectiveness in terms of influencing interest rates. Interest rates are lowered by the Fed’s expansionary open-market operations, first as a result of the Federal Reserve’s purchase of government securities, and then as a result of the bank’s purchase of government securities. The drop in interest rates will presumably spur investors to borrow via the capital markets, but not all have easy access to these markets. Thus, the expansionary impact of a given open-market operation may well be weakened, and it will certainly be rechanneled with smaller firms more likely to be stifled.  

Now consider a leverage-type capital ratio that fixes the maximum amount of total assets the bank can hold for any given amount of capital. In this case, the banks are totally out of the monetary policy loop. A purchase of government securities by the Federal Reserve cannot produce even an initial increase in bank deposits. Since the bank’s size is constrained by the capital requirement, it cannot accept the deposit of the seller of government securities unless it simultaneously eliminates another deposit of equal amount. In this interesting case, the initial purchase of government securities by the Federal Reserve will put expansionary downward pressure on interest rates, but the banks will not be able to expand. An autonomous deposit will require the bank to sell loans or securities in order to extinguish an equivalent amount of deposits. This will put upward pressure on interest rates and force banks to hold excess reserves.55  

Supplanting cash-asset reserve requirements with capital requirements inevitably alters the way in which monetary policy affects the economy at large, and this has special relevance for understanding the 1991–1992 credit crunch. Bank loans were said to be unavailable despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stimulate the economy by lowering short-term interest rates.56 The Federal Reserve actively purchased government securities, expanding the reserves of the banking system, and bank assets grew, but lending remained largely unaffected. Banks simply increased their holding of government securities, and the economy grew sluggishly until the end of 1993.
