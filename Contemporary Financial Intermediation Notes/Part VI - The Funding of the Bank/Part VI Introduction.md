# The Deposit Contract, Deposit Insurance, and Shadow Banking  

“As to guaranteeing bank deposits, the minute the government starts to do that... the government runs into a probable loss. We do not wish to make the United States government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future.”  

Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his first press conference as President of the United State  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Charter Value The economic value of a bank to its owners (the shareholders). It can be viewed as the net present value of the profits expected to accrue to the shareholders over the life of the bank.  

nticompetitive Restrictions Restrictions aimed at limiting competition in the banking industry.   
Price Elasticity of Demand A measure of the responsiveness of market demand to changes in price.   
Junk Bonds Very high (default) risk bonds issued by corporations. These bonds have low credit ratings and carry high yields.   
Capital Asset Pricing Model A model describing how risk is priced in the capital market. In particular, it predicts a linear relationship between the expected return on a security and its systematic risk factor (defined as “beta,” the ratio of the covariance of the return on the security with that of the market to the variance of the market return).  

# INTRODUCTION  

In earlier chapters, we focused on the asset side of the balance sheet for depository institutions. We now shift to the liability side. Although depository institutions have a wide variety of liabilities, in this chapter we will concentrate on different types of deposits, since this source of funding dominates for depository institutions. For example, at the end of the first quarter of 2018, U.S. banks had $\$17.53$ trillion in assets, financed with $\$13.53$ trillion in deposits. After covering depository institutions, we will discuss how institutions fund themselves in the shadow-banking system.  

In the United States, the terms “bank deposits” and “deposit insurance” are almost inseparable. Yet, it is essential to distinguish the issues raised by the deposit contract per se from those related to deposit insurance. Thus, we will first discuss the deposit contract without the insurance aspect. We will then discuss “liability management”, which is the process of managing the bank’s net interest margin, that is, the difference between the asset revenues and the liability costs, expressed as a fraction of total assets. This will be followed by an analysis of deposit insurance. Having previously discussed the uninsured deposit contract, we will be able to see how governmental deposit insurance alters the deposit contract, and the behaviors of deposit takers.  

We doubt that anyone remains to be convinced about the importance of deposit insurance-related issues. The increasing frequency of financial crises and the economic disruptions they have caused seem to reinforce the need for safety nets that reassure savers that they need not worry about the safety of the money they deposit in banks. This is because if they were worried, they would be more prone to take their money out at the first sign of trouble, which would then make the whole system vulnerable to runs on banks caused by rumors and unsubstantiated innuendos. Nonetheless, deposit insurance is not without its detractors. The main criticism is that the safety net it provides creates a moral hazard because depositors have little incentive to take the trouble to exert market discipline on the bank if it is taking excessive risk or making other imprudent choices. Many have blamed deposit insurance and greed for the S&L crisis and the widespread banking failures of the 1980s.1 While this seems to be accepted, it is more difficult to explain why we have deposit insurance, and in particular, why we have the kind of deposit contract that seems to make federal insurance desirable. Discussions of these issues figure prominently in this chapter. What is unfortunate is that the S&L crisis was, to a great extent, avoidable, and the regulatory reforms that followed the crisis made sense well before the crisis occurred. As early as 1977, academic publications made the point that federally insured depository institutions had powerful incentives to take asset risk that was excessive from a social welfare standpoint, and that capital regulation, as it existed then, by itself was incapable of controlling these incentives, so that a fundamental reform of regulation was necessary.  

Some might argue, however, that our historical experience (particularly since the advent of federal deposit insurance, following the Great Depression) did not prepare us for the systemic shocks like the S&L crisis. In the post-1933 period, extremely low bank failure rates made banking a rather unusual industry. So another puzzle is: Why the rash of failures did not occur prior to the 1980s? It turns out that the empirical and theoretical research on which this chapter is based provides valuable insights into the timing of financial crises, and leads us to conclude that, despite our comfortable post-Depression experience, we should have foreseen many of the things that happened.  

The regulatory reforms put in place after the S&L crisis of the 1980s, especially those dealing with capital requirements for depository institutions and regulatory forbearance, have served the purpose of increasing the safety and soundness of the depository banking industry fairly well, at least for the smaller institutions that were at the center of the S&L crisis. However, since 2000, massive consolidation in the banking sector and the explosive growth of the shadow-banking system, due in no small measure to the burgeoning popularity of securitization of a growing number of assets, were creating all sorts of risks that banking regulators seemed unprepared for.2 Also very fragile funding structures and high leverage became prevalent.3 A major part of this lack of regulatory oversight had to do with the fact that most of the shadow-banking institutions – brokerage house, money market mutual funds, investment banks, asset-backed securities conduits and the like – are not depository institutions and hence not covered by deposit insurance and banking supervisors, but under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the subprime crisis of 2007–2009 originated in the United States in the shadow-banking sector. Many of the institutions that became financially distressed as a result of the crisis – like AIG and Bear Sterns – were interconnected with many other institutions – including depository institutions – through swap contracts and other arrangements, and the opaqueness of these institutions and their arrangements meant that regulatory bodies like the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department could not determine with certainty the consequences of allowing them to fail. Further complicating matters, ever-expanding bank holding companies were increasingly conducting shadow banking activities. Thus, even though these were not necessarily deposit-insured institutions, the Federal Reserve stepped in with unprecedented forms of assistance to forestall the failures of many of these institutions. These events will be discussed in greater depth in Chapter 14  which is devoted to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, but for now we note that the crisis was a rude awakening in that we have now come to appreciate that institutions can not only be too big to fail, but also “too interconnected to fail,” and that systemic risk is not just some exogenous shock that comes out of thin air, but rather a consequence of the incentives built into the system, and the responses of individual institutions to those incentives.  

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, we discuss the deposit contract. After that, we take up liability management and how it has been affected by interest-rate deregulation and deposit insurance. Then we discuss deposit insurance. We examine the arguments for and against deposit insurance, including the ability of governmentally provided deposit insurance to ward off runs on banks and panics. Issues related to the risk-sensitive pricing of deposit insurance are also examined, as is an analysis of the empirical evidence on the importance of moral hazard in federally insured depository institutions. The empirical evidence also provides insights into the timing of problems with deposit insurance. We then discuss the 1980s deposit insurance debacle in the United States, and developments that have occurred since then. We conclude with a discussion of funding in the shadow banking – nondepository institutions – sector.  

# THE DEPOSIT CONTRACT  

# The Nature of the Deposit Contract  

Deposit contracts either have defined maturities like certificates of deposit (CDs), or are withdrawable on demand. We will focus on demand deposits, the quintessential banking liability. A demand deposit is created when an individual or firm deposits money in an account from which this money can be withdrawn at a moment’s notice, that is, on demand.  

The demand deposit contract has four important features:  

It is a debt contract.   
Its maturity is infinitesimal and it can be rolled over indefinitely.   
It is not traded in a secondary market.   
It is governed by a “sequential service” constraint.  

# Debt Contract  

Because the deposit is a debt contract, the depositor in an uninsured bank confronts the same asset-substitution moral hazard in dealing with the bank as the bank does in dealing with its borrowers (recall Chapters 7 and 8). That is, when a bank creates a deposit, it is simply borrowing from the depositor.  

# Maturity  

The maturity is such that the depositor is promised the ability to withdraw at any time without penalty, that is, the depositor can sell the bank’s liability back to the bank at par. Thus, a demand deposit is virtually as liquid as currency. The key difference is that currency carries no default risk, whereas an uninsured bank could default and not be able to fully satisfy withdrawal demands. Indeed, throughout this section we will assume that there is no deposit insurance, so that we can focus on the characteristics of the deposit contract itself.  

# Nontraded Contract  

The fact that demand deposits are not traded in a secondary market implies that the depositor’s payoff does not depend directly on how information about the bank is processed by other market participants, that is, the depositor does not face market price risk. Unlike a person who plans to sell a traded security in the market at the (random) price prevailing at a future date, a demand depositor knows precisely (in nominal terms) how much she will receive at any future point in time when she withdraws from her account, subject to the condition that the bank is solvent.  

This last condition is not always satisfied, however. In fact, if things were believed to be going badly for the bank, we would expect the suspicious depositors to rush to the bank to withdraw their deposits. If you arrive late, it is possible that in paying off the earlier depositors the bank will have run out of money by the time you get there. In this case, absent deposit insurance, the maximum amount you can withdraw would be less than you had anticipated. In this sense, your payoff depends on what other depositors believe about the bank, just as it does with any traded debt contract that you liquidate prior to maturity.  

# The Sequential Service Constraint  

This dependence of your payoff on the actions of other depositors occurs because the deposit contract satisfies a sequential service constraint (SSC). Hence, when a depositor seeks to withdraw, the amount the bank pays depends only on what was promised and on his place in the queue of depositors wishing to withdraw. In particular, the depositor’s payoff cannot depend on any information that the bank may have about depositors in the queue behind that depositor. Thus, the bank pays depositors on a “first come, first served” basis. To see this, consider a bank that has $\$5$ in equity, and $\$95$ in interestfree deposits acquired from 95 depositors (each of whom deposited $\$1$ ). The bank’s $\$100$ of assets consist of $\$20$ in cash, and loans that are currently worth $\$80$ if held to maturity. But if the loans are prematurely liquidated, they are worth only $\$27.50$ . Thus, the current (premature) liquidation value of the bank is $\$47.50$ . Now imagine that some depositors rush to withdraw their money. Others hear about this and become suspicious about the bank’s assets. There is now a full-scale bank run. You are the $48\mathrm{th}$ depositor in a queue of 95 when the bank’s doors open in the morning. As the branch manager walks in, she counts the number of people in the queue and sees that every depositor is there to withdraw. Despite this, the SSC dictates that the bank cannot use this information in determining how much the first-in-line depositor should be paid. In this case, the manager is forced to call the outstanding loans, that is, liquidate them to collect $\$27.50$ . The first 47 depositors will each receive $\$1$ . You will receive $\$0.50$ , and all those behind you will go home empty-handed. One might argue that a more equitable approach would have been to give each of the 95 waiting depositors $\$0.50$ . But the SSC precludes that.  

The nature of the deposit contract is worth examining for two reasons. First, when all of the bank’s liabilities are uninsured, these features have significant implications for the disciplining of bank management. This suggests that the details of the demand deposit contract are probably not an outcome of chance; they serve a purpose. Second, when deposits are insured, some of these features of the demand deposit contract encourage bank runs, thus increasing the liability of the deposit insurer.  

# The Demand Deposit Contract and Economic Incentives  

# The Effects of Nontradability and the Debt-Like Nature of Deposits  

Consider first that demandable debt is not traded and that it is a debt contract. The analysis in Chapters 7 and 8 implies that the depository institution in this case has an incentive to increase asset risk to the detriment of the depositors. That is, the institution’s managers have an incentive to invest in risky loans that transfer wealth from depositors to shareholders. Similarly, depositors face a moral hazard in that the institution has an incentive to shirk in monitoring the borrowers to whom it has extended loans. This too adversely affects the depositors’ expected payoff. A third form of moral hazard is fraud. Deposits are essentially “someone else’s” money, and managers may be tempted to appropriate some of that money for themselves. While these pathologies have been attributed to federal deposit insurance, they were encountered even prior to the adoption of deposit insurance,4 and our theory predicts that incentives for managerial fraud exist even with (nontraded) deposits that are uninsured. That the deposit contract is not traded aggravates the moral hazard problem because the discipline imposed by market pricing is absent.  

# The Effect of Maturity  

It turns out, however, that the other two features of the demand deposit contract – its infinitesimal maturity and the SSC – help to attenuate these different types of moral hazard. In developing the intuition below,5 we first consider the effect of the undefined maturity.  

Suppose that there are numerous individuals who demand deposit accounts at a bank. It is natural to expect that some of these depositors are particularly skilled in analyzing the bank’s financial health, whereas others are less able. Let us suppose that these skilled depositors keep a watchful eye on the bank’s managers because they recognize that moral hazard could diminish their expected payoff. Now, imagine that a few of these vigilant depositors discover that the bank’s risky loans are not doing well. Default on many of these loans is likely. Moreover, these depositors discover that the bank has extended numerous loans to close friends of the top managers; this raises suspicion of fraud. What should these informed depositors do? Since they have information that the bank is in peril and may default on its deposit obligations, their best bet is to withdraw their funds as quickly as possible.  

When these informed depositors withdraw their funds from the bank, there are two possibilities. One is that the uninformed depositors do not react. In this case, the total outflow of funds from the bank will depend on the size of the deposit holdings of the informed depositors. If their holdings are large enough, the bank will be compelled to attract new deposits. The second possibility is that some or all of the uninformed depositors observe the withdrawals of the informed depositors and decide to follow suit. In this case, there is a bank run. In either case, the bank will need to attract new deposits to replace withdrawals, or liquidate. Liquidation will involve either the calling back of loans, with the associated disruptions in the productive activities of borrowers, or loan sales to other banks. The alternative of attracting new deposits will be difficult, for obvious reasons. Prospective depositors will see the large deposit withdrawals and will be reluctant to entrust their money to the bank. And even if some deposit money flows in, the bank will need to pay higher interest rates on these deposits. Thus, deposit withdrawals by the informed depositors are likely to be costly to the bank. The anticipation of incurring these costs could deter the bank’s managers from risky investments, and from shirking on the monitoring of borrowers. It could also reduce the temptation to defraud the depositors.  

# The Role of the SSC  

This argument suggests that the demandable nature of deposits helps to keep the bank management on its toes. There is a slight hitch in this disciplining process, however. If a depositor can rely on other depositors to monitor the bank, then all that such a depositor has to do is to keep an eye on the informed depositors. There is no need for the “free-riding” depositor to expend personal resources to monitor the bank. This can subvert depositor monitoring. The reason is that every depositor may think that others will do the necessary monitoring, and in that case, no one monitors! This is where the SSC comes into play. Because a depositor’s expected payoff is greater if he is at the front of the queue than if he is at the rear, he recognizes that by playing a “follow the leader” strategy, his expected payoff is lower than if he monitors himself. This strengthens each individual depositor’s incentive to monitor. These ideas are made concrete in the example developed in the box below.  

# An Illustration of the Incentive Effects of the [Uninsured] Deposit Contract  

# Example 12.1  

Consider a bank that receives a $\$1$ deposit at $t=0$ from each of 105 different depositors. It invests $\$10$ of shareholders’ equity in the bank and lends $\$120$ , keeping $\$5$ as cash reserves. Out of the 105 depositors, there are 30 depositors (called type- $\mathbf{\deltaD}_{1}$ depositors) who are capable of monitoring the bank’s management; the remaining depositors (called type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{2}$ depositors) keep their money in the bank simply for transactions and safekeeping purposes. The cost of monitoring the bank for an individual type- $\mathbf{\cdot}\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositor is $\$01$ per period.  

The bank has two mutually exclusive investment opportunities. Project (or loan) A pays $\$200$ with probability 0.7 and zero with probability 0.3 at $t=1$ . Project B pays $\$150$ with probability 0.9 and $\$12$ with probability 0.1 at $t=1$ . If the bank chooses one of these projects, the probability that the bank will actually end up with that project is 0.9. With probability 0.1, the bank will have inadvertently chosen the other project. Thus, we assume that the bank may make errors in project choice.6 By monitoring the bank, a type- $\mathbf{\cdotD}_{1}$ depositor can discover the bank’s true project choice at some point in time intermediate between $t=0$ and $t=1$ , say at $t=1/2$ . These depositors can, if they desire, force liquidation of the bank by withdrawing their deposits at $\mathrm{t}=1/2,$ and the threat of this liquidation provides a disincentive to the bank to choose the risky project. Note that the bank’s projects or loans mature at $t=1$ . If they are liquidated at $t=1/2$ , they are worth only $\$25$ to the bank. Under the terms of the deposit contract, the bank promises to pay a $12\%$ interest (conditional on the bank having the financial capacity to do so) if deposit withdrawal occurs at $t=1$ , and no interest if withdrawal occurs before that. Thus, a depositor is entitled to $\$12$ if she withdraws at $t=1$ , and $\$1$ if she withdraws at $t=1/2$ . The risk-free discount rate is zero and all agents are risk neutral.  

All the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\sf D}_{2}$ depositors plan to withdraw at $t=1$ , but each is subject to a random liquidity-motivated desire to withdraw at $t=1/2$ . To simplify, we will assume that even though no one knows in advance which $\mathrm{(type-D_{2})}$ depositors will wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ , the fraction of those who will wish to withdraw is known to be 5/75. That is, five type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\sf D}_{2}$ depositors will wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ . Assume that the bank’s managers make decisions in the best interests of their shareholders. Compute the equilibrium strategies of the bank and its depositors.  

# Solution  

t is useful to summarize the strategies available to the bank and the different types of depositors before we begin to analyze the solution. These are listed in Table 12.1  

TABLE 12.1 Strategies of Participants   


<html><body><table><tr><td> Agent</td><td colspan="3">Strategies</td></tr><tr><td>Bank</td><td>Choose project A at t = 0</td><td> Choose project B at t = 0 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Type-D, depositors</td><td>Monitor and decide whether or not to withdraw at t = 1/2 based upon result of monitoring</td><td>Do not monitor and withdraw at t = 1</td><td>Do not monitor and withdraw at t = 1/2</td></tr><tr><td> Liquidity-motivated Type-D2 depositors</td><td>Withdraw at t = 1/2</td><td>Withdraw at t = 1/2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Other (Patient) Type-D depositors</td><td>Withdraw at t = 1</td><td>Withdraw at t = 1</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

We will solve this problem in four steps. First, we analyze the bank’s project choice in the case in which the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors do not monitor and the bank knows that there is no monitoring. We show that the bank chooses project A in this case. Second, we show that our assumption in Step 1 is invalid because it cannot be a Nash equilibrium for no type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors to monitor. Next, we wish to examine if it is a Nash equilibrium for all the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\sf D}_{1}$ depositors to monitor. We do this in two steps. In Step 3, we show that the bank chooses project B if it believes that all the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors will monitor. Then in Step 4, we examine the strategy of a type${\sf D}_{1}$ depositor when he knows that all the other type-D1 depositors will monitor and the bank has opted for project B. We show that this type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositor will wish to monitor. This verifies that it is indeed a Nash equilibrium for all the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors to monitor.  

The key assumption in this example is that the bank’s project choice cannot be contracted upon because not all depositors can observe it. If this were not the case, there would be no role for depositor monitoring.  

# Step 1  

We will first analyze the outcome in which the type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors do not monitor the bank. Given that the bank knows tha there is no monitoring, which project will it prefer? If it chooses project A and if this choice is error-free, the expected payoff o its shareholders is  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0.7</td><td>×</td><td>[200</td><td>112]</td><td>=</td><td>$61.6,</td></tr><tr><td>→</td><td></td><td>→</td><td>→</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Probability</td><td></td><td>Total</td><td>Bank's repayment</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>of success</td><td></td><td>payoff</td><td>to its depositors</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>  

and if it chooses project B and this choice is error-free, the expected payoff is  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0.9 →</td><td>[150 →</td><td>112] →</td><td>0.1 →</td><td>× [112 →</td><td></td><td>112] = $3 →</td></tr><tr><td>Probability of</td><td>High payoff</td><td>Bank's repayment</td><td>Probability</td><td>Low payoff</td><td></td><td>Repayment</td></tr><tr><td>high payoff</td><td>on project B</td><td>to depositors</td><td>of low payoff</td><td>on project B</td><td></td><td>to depositors</td></tr></table></body></html>  

6  This feature ensures that the type- $\mathbf{\cdotD}_{1}$ depositors do monitor the bank in equilibrium. The reason is that the threat of depositor monitoring will, in equilibrium, cause the bank to choose the project desired by the depositors. If this choice were error-free, depositors would anticipate that the bank will make the desired project choice and therefore perceive no need to monitor. But then the bank, in turn, should anticipate the behavior of the depositors and decide to invest in the project preferred by its own shareholders. And so on and on! The point is that we have a time consistency problem that leads to there being no equilibrium. However, as our solution will make clear this problem can be avoided when the bank’s project choice is error-prone.  

When project choice is error-prone, the expected payoff of the bank’s shareholders when project A is chosen is  

$$
0.9\times\S61.6+0.1\times\S34.2=\S58.86,
$$  

and their expected payoff when project B is chosen is  

$$
0.9\times\$34.2+0.1\times\S61.6=\S36.94.
$$  

Thus, if there is no monitoring, the bank will choose project A.  

# Step 2  

The question now is: Can it be a Nash equilibrium for no type- $\mathbf{\deltaD}_{1}$ depositor to monitor? This is equivalent to asking whether it is in the best interest of every individual type- $\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositor not to monitor when she knows that no other type- $\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors are monitoring. Suppose you are one of those type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors. If you do not monitor, your expected payoff is  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0.9 →</td><td>× [0.7 × $1.12] →</td><td>+</td><td>0.1 × →</td><td>[$1.12] = $0.8176 →</td></tr><tr><td>Probability that bank will actually have projectA</td><td>Depositor's expected payoff if bank chooses project A</td><td>project B</td><td>Probability that bank inadvertently chose</td><td>Depositor's payoff when project B is chosen</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Now, if you do monitor, and discover that the bank chose project A, what should you do? If you do nothing (i.e., you do not withdraw your deposit), your expected payoff at $t=1$ is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{0.7\times\S1.12-\S0.01=\S0.774.}\\ {\uparrow\qquad\uparrow\qquad\uparrow\qquad}\end{array}
$$  

f you withdraw, you know that the bank will be forced to liquidate its asset portfolio since it has only $\$5$ in cash reserves and there are five type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{2}$ depositors who will withdraw at $t=1/2$ for liquidity purposes. Liquidation will fetch $\$25$ , so that the bank will have a total of $\$30$ to disburse. You are sure to receive your $\$1$ at $t=1/2$ . Thus, your payoff will be  

$$
\$1-40.01=90.99.
$$  

This means that if you monitor and discover that project A has been chosen, you should demand to withdraw your deposit at $t=1/2$ . On the other hand, if you find that project B was chosen, your payoff is  

$$
\$123,456,71
$$  

f you wait until $t=1$ to withdraw, and it is $\$0.99$ if you withdraw at $t=1/2$ . Hence, it is better for you to wait until $t=1$ (remember that your time value of money between $t=1/2$ and $t=1$ is zero). We can now compute the overall expected payoff to you from monitoring. This payoff is  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0.9 ×$0.99 →</td><td>+ 0.1 × $1.11= $1.002</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>→</td></tr><tr><td>Probability that you will discover</td><td>Probability that you will discover</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>project A was chosen and will therefore withdraw at t = 1/2</td><td>that project B was chosen and will therefore withdraw at t = 1</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Clearly, this payoff exceeds your payoff if you do not monitor $(\$0.8176)$ . This proves that you have an incentive to monitor when others do not, which means that it cannot be a Nash equilibrium for nobody to monitor.  

# Step 3  

Let us now examine if it is a Nash equilibrium for all the type- $\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors to monitor. We begin by noting that if the bank believes that all these depositors will monitor, then it is in the bank’s best interest to choose project B. This is verified below.  

f the bank chooses project A, then there is only a 0.1 probability that project B will be inadvertently chosen. That is, there is a 0.9 probability that the bank will be liquidated at $t=1/2$ . Thus, the expected payoff of the bank’s shareholders from opting for project A is  

<html><body><table><tr><td>0.1 →</td><td>× $34.2 = $3.42.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>↑</td></tr><tr><td>Probability that the bank will not be liquidated</td><td>Expected payoff of bank's shareholders if project B is (inadvertently) chosen and bank is not liquidated</td></tr></table></body></html>  

f the bank opts for project B, then there is only a 0.1 probability that the bank will be liquidated at $t=1/2$ (this is the probability that project A will be erroneously picked). Thus, the expected payoff of the bank’s shareholders from opting for project B will be  

$$
0.9\times\$34.2=\S30.78.
$$  

Clearly, the shareholders are better off opting for project B.  

# Step 4  

The next step is to examine the strategy of a type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositor when he knows that all the other type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\sf D}_{1}$ depositors will monitor and the bank has opted for project B. If you are that depositor and you monitor, your payoff (at $t=1$ ) is $\$12$ if you discover at $t=1/2$ that the bank indeed chose project B. But if you discover that project A was chosen, then you will want to withdraw your deposit. The problem now is a little different from the previous case. You realize that if you discover that project A was chosen, so will the 29 other type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\sf D}_{1}$ depositors. When added to the five liquidity-motivated type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{2}$ depositors, this means that the line of those who wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ will be 35 depositors long. But the bank has only $\$30$ upon liquidation, and hence can only satisfy the first 30 depositors.  

Assuming that each person who goes to the bank will have an equal probability of being one of the first 30, the probability is 30/35 that you will be one of the first 30 withdrawers.7 In this case, your expected payoff is only 305 × $\frac{30}{35}\times\$1=50.8571$ , since you get nothing if you are not one of the first 30 in line. Thus, your overall expected payoff from monitoring is given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{0.9\times\S1.12+0.1\times\S0.8571-\S0.01=\S1.0837.}\\ {\uparrow\qquad}\end{array}
$$  

f you decide not to monitor, then you are behaving like a type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{2}$ depositor. Your expected payoff will be $\$12$ if the other type${\sf D}_{1}$ depositors discover that project B was chosen (the probability of this is 0.9), and it will be zero if they discover that project A was chosen and decide to liquidate the bank at $t=1/2$ (the probability of this is 0.1). Hence, your overall expected payoff from not monitoring is  

$$
0.9\times\$1.12=\$1.008.
$$  

Another possible strategy is for you to behave like a liquidity-motivated type- ${\bf\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{2}$ depositor and withdraw your deposit at $t=1/2$ without monitoring. In this case, you recognize that there is a 0.9 probability that the other type- $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors will not withdraw and a 0.1 probability that they will. If the other type-D1 depositors do not withdraw, there are only six depositors in all (including you) who wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ . The bank will be forced to liquidate, and you will receive your $\$1$ for sure. If the other type$\mathsf{D}_{1}$ depositors withdraw, the bank will also liquidate, and you will have a 30/35 chance of getting your $\$1$ . Thus, your expected payoff from withdrawing without monitoring is  

$$
0.9\times1\times\S1+0.1\times\frac{30}{35}\times\S1=\S0.9086.
$$  

Comparing the three payoffs $(\$1.0837,\S1.008,$ , and $\$0.9086$ , we see that your best strategy is to monitor. Hence, it is a Nash equilibrium for all the type- $\mathbf{\cdotD}_{1}$ depositors to monitor the bank, and for the bank to choose project B.  

Although we worked out this numerical example explicitly for the case of asset-substitution moral hazard, the intuition for managerial fraud is similar. In either case, the demandable nature of deposits puts pressure on bank management to not deviate too far from the desires of the depositors, and the SSC lends credibility to the depositors’ threat to monitor to ensure “proper” bank behavior by creating a situation in which all vigilant depositors wish to monitor. Thus, these specific features of the deposit contract play an important role in aligning the incentives of the contracting parties in an uninsured bank. This leads naturally to the question of deposit insurance. Before we get to that, however, we discuss liability management in a bank.  

# LIABILITY MANAGEMENT  

We have so far discussed the economics of the deposit contract. The use of the deposit contract is an integral component of what is called liability management.  

# What Is Liability Management?  

Depository institutions pay particular attention to their net-interest margin (NIM), which is the difference between the yield on assets and the interest cost of liabilities, expressed as a fraction of total assets. Liability management refers to the institution’s strategies for maintaining the continuity and cost effectiveness of funding assets.  

There are three main (interrelated) issues in liability management. The first is diversification, which refers to choosing among funding sources so as to avoid over-dependence on a particular source. A second choice involves the mix of liabilities. Depository institutions raise funds using a variety of deposits,8 each of which represents a specific contractual form that is a strategic choice. The third choice is about liability maturity structure, which determines the bank’s interest-rate risk exposure for a given asset maturity structure. We discuss each issue briefly in what follows.  

# Diversification  

Diversifying funding sources reduces liquidity risk (recall Chapter 6). Borrowing and lending in the federal funds market, borrowing at the discount window, dealing with repurchase agreements, and utilizing large CDs, brokered deposits, and Eurodollar deposits are techniques that banks use to diversify. Borrowing in the fed funds market and at the discount window is usually short term; most fed funds transactions are overnight loans, although the number of term fed funds transactions, with maturities in weeks, has increased recently. For longer-maturity liabilities, banks rely on a variety of deposits. Prominent among these are negotiable CDs, called jumbos, which are actively traded large-denomination time deposits with market-determined interest rates, a minimum maturity of one week, and denominations exceeding $\$100,000$ . Most negotiable CDs are issued directly to customers, although some large institutions issue them to brokers, who then sell them to other investors. Deposits marketed this way are called brokered deposits.  

Large banks also use Eurodollar deposits, which are time deposits denominated in dollars but held in banks outside the United States, including foreign branches of U.S. banks. Eurodeposits are created in many ways. Perhaps the simplest way is when an American transfers money on deposit in a U.S. bank to a bank in another country. These deposits remain in dollars. Eurodeposits are subject to the Federal Reserve’s cash-asset reserve requirements, and are not protected by U.S. deposit insurance.  

Banks also raise funds by using repurchase agreements or “repos.” A repo is the sale of a marketable security, with the agreement to repurchase it at a specified future date. That is, it is a loan secured by a marketable security. As long as the securities pledged against repos are U.S. government or government agency securities, repos are not subject to reserve requirements. Repos range in maturity from overnight to a month or more. Since repos involve collateral, they are not considered deposits and hence are not covered by deposit insurance.  

Banks use a variety of other funding sources, such as subordinated debt as well as securitization and loan sales. Securitization also facilitates diversification of the bank’s loan portfolio. Moreover, bank holding companies can issue commercial paper.  

# Liability Mix  

Bank liabilities can be divided into two categories: products and investment instruments.9 A product entitles the purchaser to a financial claim as well as to some bank services. That is, it is a contract that bundles monetary and possibly nonmonetary payoffs. An example is a checking account on which the bank pays interest and provides transactions services. For corporations, other services include cash management at possibly subsidized prices. Thus, purchasers of product-based deposits, called “customers”, receive both explicit and implicit interest, and the demand for such deposits depends both on the explicit interest as well as on the value depositors attach to the bank’s services.10 Because many of these services are demanded by retail depositors, deposits tend to be small (below the de jure deposit insurance coverage limit of $\$250,000$ per account). Moreover, customers prefer to have the payoffs on their contracts as insensitive as possible to the fortunes of the intermediary itself. For example, a life insurance policy provides its beneficiaries with a specified cash payment conditional on the death of the insured. That function is less efficiently performed if the contract calls instead for the death benefit to be conditioned on the financial condition of the insurance company as well as on the death of the insured.11 Consequently, an increase in the policyholder’s risk due to a decline in the insurance company’s financial condition may require a greater reduction in the insurance premium than would be actuarially fair. It may, therefore, pay for the insurance company to reduce the policyholder’s risk as much as possible. In the case of banks, this may explain why product-based deposits are typically fully insured.  

Investment instruments, on the other hand, are simply financial claims, similar to the liabilities of nonfinancial firms. The bank provides no transactions or other services to the claimholder, so the design of these contracts involves the same risk-return tradeoffs faced by nonfinancial firms. An example of an investment instrument is a brokered CD. Deposit contracts that are investment instruments tend to be purchased by institutions, are relatively large in denominations, and include uninsured deposits. Their prices are usually determined through secondary-market trading.  

One of the bank’s liability-management choices is the appropriate mix of product-based deposits and investment instruments. Because of the relative insensitivity of their values to the bank’s riskiness, product-based deposits do not involve much monitoring of bank management by depositors. Investment instruments, on the other hand, have values that are sensitive to the bank’s riskiness, and it pays for the holders of these claims to monitor the bank. The bank is, therefore, subject to greater market discipline with these deposits. From the standpoint of the bank’s management, there may be a desire to reduce the bank’s reliance on such deposits in order to limit market discipline. Of course, doing so may sacrifice diversification in funding sources, with the attendant liquidity risk that may eventually result in a loss of control for management. The bank’s shareholders, on the other hand, would like sufficient reliance on investment instruments to ensure the desired level of market discipline. This suggests a liability-management agency problem between shareholders and managers of banks.  

# The Duration Structure  

Given its asset duration structure, the bank’s choice of liability duration structure will determine its interest-rate risk. Given long-duration assets, choosing a matching long duration on the liability side will minimize interest-rate risk. However, given a bank’s added value in providing particular assets and liabilities (based on its customers’ needs), banks typically end up with liabilities of shorter duration than assets.  

Banks often resolve this tension by using derivatives (Chapter 10). The better-managed banks purchase the most beneficial assets and liabilities and then use options, futures, and swaps to achieve the desired degree of immunization against interest-rate risk.  

# DEPOSIT INSURANCE  

# The Rationale for Deposit Insurance: A Historical Perspective  

The Need for Deposit Insurance  

If the demand deposit contract discussed earlier works well in disciplining bank management, why do we need deposit insurance? The reasons are many. Not all make perfect sense in today’s environment, but we will get to that later. For now, let us simply note that an uninsured (demand) deposit contract can be quite disruptive. In a sense, it can lead to overdisciplining of banks. This can be seen as follows. In the previous section, we assumed for simplicity that the vigilant depositors could discover the bank’s project choice without error. In reality, this discovery is likely to be error-prone. It is then possible that the bank is forced to liquidate assets even when its project choice is congruent with the preferences of depositors. This is socially wasteful ex post.  

In addition, systematic elements in the risk profiles of the asset portfolios of banks may give rise to a contagion effect among banks. That is, when one bank fails, depositors suspect that the failure may be due to systematic risk elements that pervade the asset portfolios of all banks in that geographical area, and this may lead to spreading bank runs. Since it often takes a long time for the precise reasons for a bank’s failure to become public, the contagion effect may be encountered even when the failure of a particular bank is due to idiosyncratic factors such as poor management. Indeed, this is the rationale for the “too big to fail” doctrine, which leads the government to rescue sufficiently large banks from failure.  

Both of these problems are reduced with deposit insurance. When a government agency insures a bank’s deposits, it guarantees that the depositors will receive their promised payment, regardless of the bank’s financial condition. This makes it unnecessary for depositors to monitor the bank, and it lessens the likelihood of runs on individual banks or on groups of banks.  

# Historical Background  

Federal deposit insurance came into existence in the United States with the enactment of the Banking Act of 1933, and the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure bank deposits. The insurance system was extended the following year to S&Ls with the creation of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured S&L shares (deposits). In 1971, deposit insurance was also made available to credit unions.12 All of this was inspired by the Great Depression and the massive runs on banks that forced President Roosevelt to declare a “banking holiday” in March of 1933. The banking panics of the Great Depression were not new, however. There were as many as seven panics from 1866 to 1934. We will use the term “bank run” (in the singular) to denote a situation in which depositors at a single bank wish to exchange their deposits for currency, and the term “banking panic” to denote a situation in which depositors at many banks wish to exchange their deposits for currency.  

Before federal deposit insurance, panics were often addressed by suspending convertibility of deposits into cash. Under this approach, the bank was simply closed to depositors who wished to withdraw their money. By giving the banks “breathing room” during which “mass hysteria” had a chance to die down, more information about the financial condition of the bank could be released. Unless this information confirmed the worst fears of depositors, they could be persuaded to refrain from withdrawing their money when the suspension was lifted. Suspension amounted to default on the deposit contract and was a violation of banking law. Nevertheless, five out of the seven panics referred to previously involved suspension of convertibility (those in 1873, 1890, 1893, 1907, and 1914).13  

Another method that was used during banking panics was the issuance of clearinghouse loan certificates. These arose from Commercial-Bank Clearinghouses (CBCHs), private-market arrangements among banks that served some of the functions of a central bank. Initially a CBCH was formed to facilitate check clearing. Prior to the formation of the New York CBCH in 1853, for example, commercial banks collected checks by a process of daily exchange and settlement with each other. The clearinghouse centralized the settlement process by permitting exchange to be made with the clearinghouse alone. However, as it evolved, the clearinghouse was able to provide additional information-based services such as certification (based on a minimum capital requirement needed to become a member of the clearinghouse) and monitoring (based on periodic audits) of its member banks. Members who failed to satisfy CBCH regulations were disciplined with fines or expulsions. This economized on individual monitoring costs that depositors would have had to incur in the absence of a clearinghouse.  

One way for a bank to reduce the likelihood of a run is to reduce the depositors’ concern about the bank’s assets. The clearinghouse loan certificate, first issued during the panic of 1857, was an attempt to do this. A policy committee of the CBCH first authorized the issuance of loan certificates. Whenever a member bank had insufficient cash to satisfy deposit withdrawals, it could apply to the CBCH loan committee for certificates. Borrowing banks were charged interest rates varying from $6\%$ to $7\%$ and were required to present acceptable collateral. These certificates, which typically had maturities of 1 to 3 months, could be used by the bank in place of currency. Depositors were willing to accept the loan certificates in exchange for demand deposits because the loan certificates were claims on the CBCH, rather than on the individual bank. Thus, depositors obtained some insurance (diversification benefits) against individual bank failure. This meant that when there was a run on a bank, the bank could either pay off depositors in loan certificates (thereby exchanging claims against its own assets for claims against the CBCH), or it could raise new deposits from depositors who would be sold loan certificates. The bank would then use the proceeds to pay off the older depositors. In this way, the problem of bank-specific risk arising from informational asymmetries was resolved through a private system of coinsurance among banks.  

Despite the efforts of the CBCHs to restrain member banks, they could not eliminate all moral hazard. Besides, there was the possibility of the CBCH itself being corrupted. Thus, there remained a role for monitoring by depositors. This, in turn, led to occasional runs on banks.  

# Reasons for Federal Deposit Insurance  

Even though private arrangements can diminish the likelihood of bank runs, there are two reasons why they cannot eliminate them. First, even though a private arrangement like the CBCH provides depositors with some diversification, this diversification is limited by the size of the group of member banks. Size limitations may arise from transportation or information costs. Moreover, as the group grows larger, the cost to the CBCH of cheating by an individual bank diminishes, and the CBCH’s incentive to monitor its members is weakened. This may be one reason why a large number of new clearinghouses sprang up within a 10-year period following the establishment of the NewYork CBCH in 1853, rather than a single “mega” clearinghouse emerging. A second weakness of private arrangements is that depositors can never be completely sure of the integrity of the arrangement. Thus, there was still some incentive for depositors to monitor the CBCH. In turn, this implies that panics could not be avoided.  

The establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 was partly in response to the inadequacy of private arrangements in performing key central bank functions. Nevertheless, the Fed could not prevent the banking panics of the Great Depression, and this eventually led to the establishment of federal deposit insurance. Two of the arguments for federal deposit insurance are discussed below.  

1. Money Supply: the Macroeconomic Argument: At a macroeconomic level, deposit insurance acts as a stabilizer by preventing reductions in the stock of money through bank failures. Since commercial banks are the main providers of the nation’s money stock, large-scale uninsured failures of commercial banks would reduce the national money supply. Deposit insurance helps to prevent this in two ways: (a) it replaces deposits that would otherwise be lost, and (b) it discourages banking panics by preserving public confidence.  

The reason why deposit insurance has to be federal is the credibility of the federal government in its promise to meet all contractual payments. Because of its virtually unlimited authority to raise revenues through taxation, the federal government can meet payout commitments that may be far in excess of the deposit insurance fund. This taxation may be explicit (the government can simply raise taxes) or implicit (the government can print more money to repay depositors, thereby taxing by reducing the real value of each unit of money).  

2. Improving Consumer Welfare: the Microeconomic Argument: We have already noted the incentive of individual depositors to monitor the bank. This results in costly duplication of monitoring. In the numerical illustration of the previous section, the equilibrium involves all 30 vigilant depositors monitoring the bank even though monitoring by just one depositor would suffice. There are two ways in which federal deposit insurance helps to reduce overall monitoring costs. First, because a government agency (the federal insurer) is insuring deposits, the need of insured depositors to monitor is either eliminated (when deposit insurance is complete) or diminished (when deposit insurance is incomplete). Moreover, since the federal insurer must itself monitor banks, even uninsured depositors perceive a much smaller need to monitor. In other words, most of the monitoring burden is shifted from individual depositors to the federal insurer. This eliminates much of the duplicated monitoring encountered with uninsured deposits, without any residual monitoring incentives as with the private CBCH arrangement. Second, a federal deposit insurer can be expected to specialize in monitoring insured banks because it must deal with a large number of them. Thus, even apart from reducing duplication, there may be a direct reduction in monitoring costs. For example, in our numerical illustration, instead of monitoring costing 1 cent per audit, it might cost 3/4 cent per audit.  

The overall effect of reduced monitoring costs will be to increase the effective interest rates on deposits,14 but this benefit of deposit insurance may be offset by a host of implementation problems that we have yet to address.  

# Banking Runs and Panics: Theories and the Empirical Evidence  

Although the idea that deposit insurance can eliminate bank runs is an old one, research in the last decade has provided a clearer understanding of why bank runs and banking panics occur. In light of the recent S&L and banking turmoil, linked by many to federal deposit insurance, alternative arrangements deserve careful consideration. This subsection offers a perspective that should be useful in thinking about these issues.  

When informational imperfections interfere with the functioning of a market, governmental intervention may be warranted. An example is Akerlof’s lemons problem in the used car market (recall Chapter 1); “lemons laws” protect used car buyers in many states. Another example is the Federal Aviation Authority’s regulation of airline safety and the Federal Drug Administration’s regulation of the medicinal drug market. In these markets, it is very costly for consumers to let the market provide the necessary disciplining of providers. Similarly, if banking panics disrupt the productive sector of the economy, federal deposit insurance may be warranted if it is effective in reducing the likelihood of panics. The two main theories discussed below explain how deposit insurance can prevent runs and panics.  

1. The “Sunspots” Theory of Bank Runs: This theory maintains that bank runs are triggered by completely random events like “sunspots.”15 Suppose that we live in a two-period world with three points in time: $t=0$ , 1, 2. Individuals are risk averse. At $t=0$ , individuals have endowments of wealth that they wish to invest in projects. Each project requires a $\$1$ investment at $t=1$ , pays off $\$1$ for sure at $t=2$ if not liquidated earlier, and has positive NPV, that is, each offers a rate of return sufficiently higher than the riskless rate (which is zero) if continued until $t=2$ . Let $R>\$1$ . However, if the project is liquidated prematurely at $t=1$ , then there is a loss of productive efficiency and the project pays off only $\$1$ .  

At $t=0$ , individuals are unsure of their future preferences for the timing of their consumption. At $t=1$ , they receive a “preference shock” and learn whether they are about to die or will live another period. If they are about to die, they want to withdraw the money they have invested and consume it immediately at $t=1$ . If they learn that they will live, then they want to leave their money in the projects and consume $\$1$ at $t=2$ . For the population as a whole, a (random) fraction, $f,$ of individuals are “diers” at $t=1$ and a fraction, $1-f,$ are “livers.”16  

What would happen without a bank? Well, if you discover at $t=1$ that you are a dier, you will liquidate your investment and consume $\$1$ . Call the first-period consumption $C_{1}^{\mathrm{D}}.$ that is, $C_{1}^{\mathrm{D}}{=}1$ , and your second-period consumption, $C_{2}^{\mathrm{D}}=0$ . If you discover that you are a “liver,” then you will choose to consume nothing at $t=1$ (i.e., $C_{1}^{\mathrm{L}}=0.$ ) and you will consume an amount $C_{2}^{\mathrm{L}}=R$ at $t=2$ . Thus, the nonbank outcome is the pair $\{C_{1}^{\mathrm{D}}=1,C_{2}^{\mathrm{L}}=0\}$ or the pair $\{C_{1}^{\mathrm{L}}=0$ , $C_{2}^{\mathrm{L}}=R\}$ , depending on the individual’s type. Is this the best outcome from the standpoint of an individual at $t=0?$ The answer is obviously no! Since you are a risk-averse individual, you would like some insurance at $t=0$ against a random future shock to your own preference for consumption. This is where a bank can help.  

The basic idea is as follows. To provide risk-averse individuals insurance against preference shocks, a bank can arise to promise those withdrawing at $t=1$ a little more than $\$1$ and those withdrawing at $t=2$ a little less than $\$1$ still ensuring that the promised payoff at $t=2$ exceeds that at $t=1$ . Since $R>1$ , this is simply a temporal redistribution of the individual’s wealth from a state of nature in which wealth is relatively high to one in which it is relatively low, that is, a classic insurance scheme. Compare this to a capital market that also redistributes temporally, but involves no insurance aspect. As long as the bank has a reasonably good idea of how many individuals will withdraw on average at $t=1$ (this is similar to insurance companies estimating likely outcomes based on actuarial tables), it can structure the deposit contract in such a way that a known fraction of projects are liquidated at $t=1$ to pay off the withdrawers. Note that more projects will need to be liquidated than there are withdrawers because each depositor is promised more than $\$1$ and the liquidation value of each project at $t=1$ is $\$1$ . Hence, those waiting until $t=2$ will receive less than $\$1$ This is a nice arrangement because the $t=2$ payoff exceeds the $t=1$ payoff, so if a depositor can “afford” to wait until $t=2$ , he will. Thus, one possible outcome is that only the diers withdraw at $t=1$ and all the livers wait until $t=2$ . All depositors are better off than they would be without a bank because they have received some insurance at $t=0$ against unpredictable future changes in their preferences.  

The fly in this ointment, however, is that the entire scheme rests delicately on the assumption that none of the livers withdraws at $t=1$ . But what if a liver believes that others like him might “panic” and withdraw at $t=12$ If this belief is justified, it would be foolish for him to be the only patient depositor since the bank will have to liquidate all its projects at $t=1$ and there will be nothing left to disburse at $t=2$ . So he will attempt to withdraw at $t=1$ as well. In other words, the beliefs of the livers at $t=1$ are crucial. If a representative liver believes others will withdraw at $t=1$ , he will too, and a panic run at $t=1$ is a Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, if a representative liver believes others will wait until $t=2$ , he will too, and this is a Nash equilibrium as well. These beliefs are unrelated to the quality of the bank’s assets.  

How do you preclude the bad Nash equilibrium? One way is to provide deposit insurance.17 If the claims of all depositors are insured, then the livers know that they are guaranteed a payoff at $t=2$ that is independent of the actions of other depositors. Hence, all livers will withdraw only at $t=2$ , and there will be no bank run. The example in the box below makes these ideas concrete.  

# Example 12.2  

Suppose there are 100 risk-averse individuals, each with $\$1$ to invest in a project at $t=0$ . The project will yield $\$1$ if liquidated at $t=1$ and $\$2.25$ if liquidated at $t=2$ . At $t=0$ , no individual knows what his $"\mathrm{type^{\prime\prime}}$ (denoting his consumption preference) will be at $t=1$ . If the individual turns out to be a “dier” (type D), then his utility function for consumption will be  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{U_{\mathrm{D}}=\sqrt{C_{1}^{\mathrm{D}}}.}\end{array}
$$  

f he turns out to be a “liver” (type L), then his utility function for consumption will be  

$$
U_{\mathrm{{l}}}=0.6\sqrt{C_{\mathrm{1}}^{\mathrm{{l}}}+C_{\mathrm{2}}^{\mathrm{{l}}}}.
$$  

These utility functions capture the idea that the dier benefits from consumption at $t=1$ only, and the liver is indifferent between consuming at $t=1$ or $t=2$ (he gets equal utility from each) so that he will prefer the higher of the two consumptions. It is known  

at $t=0$ that $40\%$ of the individuals will end up being diers and $60\%$ will be livers at $t=1$ . Compute the ex ante $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\Psi}^{'}t=0.}\end{array}$ ) expected utility of each individual if (i) there is no bank and each individual invests in his own projects, and (ii) there is a bank that accepts a $\$1$ deposit from each individual and invests all the proceeds in 100 projects.  

# Solution  

We will solve this problem in six steps. First, we calculate each individual’s expected utility absent banks. In this scheme, an individual receives $\$1$ if he consumes at $t=1$ and $\$2.25$ if he consumes at $t=2$ . Second, we introduce a bank that is a mutual owned by the 100 depositors. It promises $\$1.1$ to each depositor withdrawing at $t=1$ and $\$2.1$ each to those withdrawing at $t=2$ . Each depositor experiences a higher expected utility at $t=0$ with this scheme than in the nonbank case. Third, we show that the intermediated outcome leads to a (good) Nash equilibrium in which all type-D depositors withdraw at $t=1$ and all type-L depositors wait until $t=2$ . Fourth, we show that there is also a bad Nash equilibrium in which all depositors withdraw at $t=1$ . Fifth, we note that the bank run described in Step 4 arises for no particular reason, but that it is possible whenever the existence of the bank makes depositors better off. Finally, in Step 6 we show how deposit insurance can eliminate the Nash equilibrium.  

# Step 1  

Consider first the nonintermediated situation. Let us assume, for simplicity, that the diers/livers fractions (0.4 and 0.6) can be viewed as subjective probability assessments of all individuals at $t=0$ . Then each individual believes that he faces a 0.4 chance of being of type-D at $t=1$ and a 0.6 chance of being of type-L. In the nonintermediated case, $[C_{1}^{\mathrm{D}}=1,C_{2}^{\mathrm{D}}=0].$ , and $\lbrack C_{1}^{\mathsf{L}}=0,$ , $C_{2}^{\mathsf{L}}=R=\$92.25\mathsf{l}$ . Hence, each individual’s expected utility will be  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathsf{E}(\mathsf{U})=0.4\times\sqrt{10}+0.6\times0.6\times\sqrt{2.25}}}\\ {{=0.9400.}}\end{array}
$$  

# Step 2  

Now consider a bank, owned by its 100 depositors. It provides insurance against depositor preference shocks with a demand deposit offering $C_{1}^{*}>\$1$ and $C_{2}^{*}<\$8$ (where asterisks denote first- and second-period consumptions in the intermediated case), with the stipulation that $C_{1}^{*}$ and $C_{2}^{*}$ are mutually exclusive. For example, suppose the bank announces at $t=0$ that $C_{1}^{*}=\$1.1$ . Then, with 40 depositors withdrawing at $t=1$ , the bank will need to pay out $\$44$ , and this requires premature liquidations of 44 projects. The remaining 56 projects will yield a total payoff of $56\times\$25=\$126$ at $t=2$ . The bank will be able to promise each of the 60 depositors withdrawing at $t=2$ an amount $C_{2}^{*}=\$126/60=\$2.1$ . The expected utility of a depositor at $t=0$ will be  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{E^{*}(\mathsf{U})=0.4\times\sqrt{1.1}+0.6\times0.6\times\sqrt{2.1}}\\ {=0.9412.}\end{array}
$$  

Hence, every individual is made better off by the bank that provides consumption smoothing.  

# Step 3  

The Step-2 outcome is a Nash equilibrium among depositors. Each type-D depositor’s Nash equilibrium strategy is to withdraw at $t=1$ since that gives him his highest utility (his utility from consumption at $t=2$ is zero). If each type-L depositor takes as given the Nash equilibrium strategy of the other type-L depositors (to wait until $t=2$ to withdraw), then no type-L depositor can do better by withdrawing at $t=1$ . This is because withdrawal at $t=2$ gives a type-L a utility of  

$$
0.6\times{\sqrt{2.1}}=0.8695{\mathrm{~whereas}}
$$  

withdrawal at $t=1$ gives a utility of  

$$
0.6\times{\sqrt{1.1}}=0.6293.
$$  

hus, a Nash equilibrium is needed for all type-D depositors to withdraw at $t=1$ and all type-L depositors to wait until $t=2$ .  

# Step 4  

The $"\mathrm{good}^{\prime\prime}$ outcome is not the only Nash equilibrium, however. There is also a $\boldsymbol{\upsilon}_{\mathrm{bad}^{\prime\prime}}$ Nash equilibrium with a bank run. To see this, suppose that the representative type-L depositor believes that all the other type-L depositors will withdraw at $t=1$ rather than $t=2$ .18 What should you, as the “representative” type-L depositor, do?  

Suppose you also decide to withdraw at $t=1$ . The bank will then observe that all 100 depositors wish to withdraw. All 100 projects will have to be liquidated to obtain $\$100$ . According to the SSC, the bank will pay $\$1.1$ each to the first 90 depositors and the remaining $\$1$ to the 91st depositor; the last nine depositors receive nothing. If you wait until $t=2$ to withdraw (when all the other depositors withdraw at $t=1$ ), you get nothing. If you rush to the bank at $t=1$ , then assuming that your position in the queue is decided randomly (with equal probability of being at any position in the queue), you have a 0.9 probability of receiving $\$1.1$ , a 0.01 probability of receiving $\$1$ , and a 0.09 probability of receiving nothing. Clearly, your optimal strategy is to withdraw at $t=1$ too. Thus, it is also a Nash equilibrium for all depositors to withdraw $t=1$ . This equilibrium is a bank run.  

# Step 5  

Two points are noteworthy. First, the bank run in Step 4 arises for no particular reason. We are not in a position to say which Nash equilibrium will arise. Hence, while we can say that a bank run is a possibility, we cannot say why. Second, a simple way for the bank to eliminate this type of run is to stipulate that withdrawers of demand deposits at $t=1$ can receive only $\$1$ . In this case, the bank does not need to liquidate more projects than there are withdrawers at $t=1$ , so that a depositor who waits until $t=2$ will surely receive $\$12$ Thus, it is optimal for every type-L depositor to wait until $t=2$ , regardless of what the other type-L depositors do. But in this case the bank’s demand deposit contract provides no risk sharing and the bank adds no value over the nonintermediated case. Hence, runs are a possibility whenever the bank adds value.19  

# Step 6  

Deposit insurance can eliminate the bank run equilibrium without trivializing the bank. To see this, imagine that a governmental insurer were to guarantee that any individual withdrawing at $t=1$ will receive $\$1.1$ and any individual withdrawing at $t=2$ will receive $\$2.1$ . Then, only the good Nash equilibrium survives.20  

The message of this theory is this: In the absence of deposit insurance, even a perfectly healthy bank faces the threat of a run, given the SSC associated with demand deposits. In other words, runs can result from shifts in the beliefs of individuals, unrelated to the “real” economy or the health of the banking system. Bank runs are simply random manifestations, a force majeure triggered even by “sunspots.” In French, the term for a bank run is colloquially sauve qui peut (every man for himself).  

Although some runs reflect sunspot phenomena, it is difficult to verify empirically what precisely triggered a run. Banking panics, on the other hand, have often been triggered by adverse information about banks. We now turn to an informational theory of bank runs.  

2. Adverse Information and Bank Runs: Suppose that we have three types of individuals.21 We still have the diers (type-D individuals) who must consume at the end of the first period and represent a fraction, $f,$ of all individuals. But among the livers (type-L individuals), we now have a fraction who receives information about the terminal $(t=2)$ value of the bank’s assets. In the previous theory, we assumed that this value, $\$1$ was nonrandom and known to everyone. Assume now that $\tilde{R}$ is a random variable with a commonly known expected value, $R$ Let $\tilde{R}=H>0$ with probability $p$ and $\tilde{R}=0$ with probability $1-p$ Thus, at $t=0$ , no individual knows either the $t=2$ value of $\tilde{R}$ or what his type (D or L) will be at $t=1$ . However, at $t=1$ , each individual discovers whether he is a $\mathrm{~D~}$ or $\mathrm{~L~}$ , and some fraction, $q$ of the Ls also comes to know the value $\tilde{R}$ will take at $t=2$ . Nobody knows how many individuals of each type are there at $t=1$ (i.e., both the fraction $f$ and the fraction $q$ are random).  

The choice problem faced by the Ds and the informed Ls at $t=1$ is straightforward. All the Ds will line up to withdraw their deposits. If the informed Ls learn that $R=H,$ then it is better for them to defer withdrawal until $t=2$ , thereby avoiding premature project liquidation. But if the informed Ls learn that $R=0$ , then it pays for them to withdraw whatever they can at $t=1$ .  

Consider now the choice problem of the uninformed Ls. They can withdraw at $t=1$ or wait until $t=2$ . Their decision will be based on their assessment of the $t=2$ value of the bank’s assets. Although they cannot directly observe this value, they can infer it by observing the length of the withdrawal queue at $t=1$ .22 In drawing this inference, they realize that some people are in the withdrawal queue at $t=1$ because they have discovered that they are Ds. But they do not know how many such individuals there are. This means that when they observe the length of the withdrawal queue at $t=1$ , they are unsure whether all are Ds or whether some are informed Ls.  

It is true, however, that the longer the queue the more likely it is that it contains some informed Ls with adverse information about the bank. If the uninformed Ls knew for sure that the queue contained informed Ls, they would withdraw their money at $t=1$ , and if they knew for sure that it contained only Ds, they would defer withdrawal until $t=2$ . But when they cannot be sure, they use the queue length as a noisy signal of the information possessed by the informed Ls. Thus, they withdraw their deposits at $t=1$ if the queue is sufficiently long, and they defer withdrawal until $t=2$ if the queue is shorter.  

Defining a bank run as a situation in which uninformed Ls withdraw at $t=1$ , we see that a bank run is more likely when some depositors receive adverse information about the bank. The reason is that as the informed Ls line up to withdraw their funds, they increase the queue length. This induces the uninformed Ls also to seek withdrawal of their deposits. Thus, a bank run results from depositors attempting to detect the bank’s condition from the length of the withdrawal queue. However, since their learning is “noisy” (they occasionally confuse liquidity-motivated withdrawals with informed withdrawals), they make both type-I and type-II errors.23 That is, they sometimes do not run the bank when they should (when the queue is relatively short but consists of informed Ls: a type-II error if the null hypothesis is that the bank is healthy); and they sometimes run the bank when they should not (when the queue length is relatively long but consists only of Ds: a type-I error). Because runs can sometimes occur when they should not, deposit insurance may improve welfare by eliminating the possibility that uninformed Ls will erroneously withdraw.  

3. The Empirical Evidence on Panics: Strictly speaking, neither of the two theories of bank runs discussed just above explains panics. According to the sunspots theory, a bank run is a completely random event, so there is no reason for a run to precipitate a panic, although a panic could come about by pure chance. According to the adverse information theory, a run is caused by information specific to a bank. Once again, there is no reason for a run to be contagious. These then are theories of bank runs and not banking panics.  

The adverse information theory, however, can be adapted to provide an explanation for banking panics. Suppose there is information about some event that is relevant to the fortunes of all banks. That is, there is a systematic risk element that affects all banks. Unlike the standard Capital Asset Pricing Model, however, assume that the systematic risk is not commonly known. Individuals may then attempt to infer something about systematic risk from their observations of presumably related events. For example, the failure of a large bank may cause depositors to believe that general economic conditions have deteriorated, and this may lead to a panic. The intuition is similar to that of the adverse information theory. According to that theory, depositors infer something about their bank from the behavior of fellow depositors. Here, depositors at one bank infer something about their bank from the behavior of depositors in other banks.24  

An example of an event that may reveal adverse systematic information is a recession, or a bank run during a recession. During the period from 1873 to 1914, every major business cycle downturn was accompanied by a banking panic. Empirical evidence supports this version of the adverse information hypothesis. If banking panics are indeed systematic events, then there must be a change in the risk perceptions of individuals prior to a panic, and this, in turn, must cause a change in the deposit/currency ratio. That is, the perceived risk variable must achieve some critical value at the panic date. Also, the movements in the risk predictors and in perceived risk should occur at panic dates and not at other dates. If such movements occurred at other dates, then there should have been panics at those dates.  

An empirical examination of panics in the pre-Federal Reserve era provides insight into the relationship between changes in risk perceptions and banking panics.25 To serve as a proxy for perceived risk, empiricists use unanticipated changes in the liabilities of failed businesses.26 This is reasonable since the fortunes of nonfinancial firms affect the fortunes of banks. As Table 12.2 shows, panic dates correspond to the timing of the largest values of the liabilities shocks. Panics also follow the business cycle peak by several months.

23  A type-I error in statistics is when the decision maker rejects the (null) hypothesis although it is true and a type-II error is when he accepts (or more appropriately, fails to reject) the null hypothesis although it is false. 24  For a recent theory that captures this intuition, see Acharya and Thakor (2016) 25  The evidence reported here is from Gorton (1988) 26  In an empirical study by Gorton (1988)  this variable was measured by the residuals (error terms) from an estimated time-series model.

Note: The change in perceived risk in June 1920 was large enough to have caused a panic in the pre-Fed Era. Source: Gorton (1988).  

The study also indicates that the percentage change in the currency/deposit ratio is significantly correlated with the perceived risk measure. Thus, the data for the pre-Fed period support the notion of a threshold value of perceived risk that triggers panics. More recent research indicates that the banking panics during 1890–1909 were triggered by net movements of deposits away from the money-center banks and low levels of excess reserves. Changes in stock market values had little effect.27  

The formation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914 and the initiation of deposit insurance in 1934 had a significant influence on the timing of panics. In the period from 1914 to 1933, we can see from Table 12.3 that changes in the perceived risk measure were large enough in at least one instance (June 1920) to cause panics during the pre-Fed period, but resulted in no panics in the post-Fed period.  

The introduction of deposit insurance again significantly changed depositor behavior. In the period from 1935 to 1972, until after deposit insurance was introduced, there were several instances of large failed business liabilities shocks, none of which resulted in panics. Thus, deposit insurance appears to have served its purpose.  

# Deposit Insurance Pricing and Moral Hazard  

Until the 1980s, the pricing of federal deposit insurance was largely risk insensitive. That is, each bank was charged an insurance premium that depended only on its volume of deposits, and not on its riskiness. Many have charged that this heightened incentives for insured depository institutions to take excessive levels of risk. Note that institutions like banks can increase risk in a variety of ways. However, for the purposes of this discussion, we will focus on the bank’s incentive to invest in assets with high default risk. Although deposit insurance premiums are now risk sensitive, only a limited number of risk categories are used and at best, the premiums are only crudely related to risk for most banks. In this section, we will show how the imperfectly risk-sensitive structure of deposit insurance pricing also creates incentives for excessive risktaking by banks.28  

Deposit Insurance as an Option: Consider an insured bank (both principal and interest on deposits are insured) that has raised deposits requiring the bank to repay $\$8$ at the end of the period. Let $\$V$ be the total value of the bank’s assets at the end of period. Now, if $V\geq B$ then the depositors receive $\$8$ from the bank and the bank’s shareholders receive $\S(V-B)$ . If $V<B$ then the bank fails. Its shareholders receive nothing, whereas the deposit insurer takes possession of the bank’s assets and pays out $\$8$ to the depositors. The net loss to the deposit insurer in this case is $\$123,456$ . Thus, the end-of-period payoffs to the different parties can be written as  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Shareholders:</td><td>Max[0, V-B]</td></tr><tr><td>Depositors:</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>Deposit Insurer:</td><td>Min[O, V- B], which is either zero (when V> B) or negative (when V< B).</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The effect of deposit insurance is to create an additional cash inflow to the firm of– $\cdot\mathrm{Min}[0,V-B]$ dollars. But $-\mathbf{Min}[0$ , $\left|V-B\right|$ can also be written as $\mathrm{Max}[0,B-V]$ . Hence, if $G(T)$ is the value to the firm of the deposit insurance guarantee when the length of time remaining to maturity of the deposits is T, then on the date of maturity,  

$$
G(0)=\operatorname{Max}{[0,B-V]}.
$$  

You will recall now from our discussions of options in Chapters 1 and 10 that the payoff structure in Equation (12.1) is identical to that of a put option at expiration. To see this, imagine that $V$ is the (random) value of the underlying security on which the option is written, and $B$ is the exercise (or strike) price. Then, as the owner of the put, you will exercise your option to sell the security to the option writer at $\$8$ if the value of the security, $V,$ is less than $B$ In this case, your gain from exercising the option will be $\$123,456$ . On the other hand, if $B<V$ then you will let the option expire unexercised, and your gain will be zero.  

# The Cost of the Option  

In other words, when the FDIC insures a bank’s deposits, it is writing a put option in favor of the bank. The cost to the FDIC of providing this insurance is simply the value of the put option. We can calculate this value using the option pricing formula developed by Black and Scholes (1973):  

$$
G(T)=B e^{-r T}\Phi(x_{2})-V\Phi(x_{1})
$$  

where  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\displaystyle x_{1}\equiv\frac{\log(B/V)-\left[r+\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right]T}{\sigma\sqrt{T}}}}\\ {{\displaystyle x_{2}\equiv x_{1}+\sigma\sqrt{T}.}}\end{array}
$$  

Here $r$ is the instantaneous risk-free interest rate, $\Phi(\bullet)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $V$ is the current value of the bank’s assets, and $\upsigma^{2}$ is the variance rate per unit time of the logarithmic changes in the value of the assets. It is assumed that all the Black–Scholes assumptions are satisfied.  

# The Cost Per Dollar of Deposits  

We can also compute the appropriate deposit insurance premium per dollar of deposits. If depositors are promised a repayment of $\$8$ at a time, $T,$ in the future, then the current value of these (riskless) deposits will be  

$$
D=B e^{-r T}.
$$  

Let $g=G(T)/D$ be the cost (to the FDIC) of the deposit insurance guarantee per dollar of insured deposits. Then, using Equations (12.2) and (12.3) we can write  

$$
g(d,\tau)=\Phi(h_{\scriptscriptstyle2})-\frac{1}{d}\Phi(h_{\scriptscriptstyle1})
$$  

$$
\mathrm{where}\ h_{1}\equiv\frac{[\mathrm{log}(d)-\frac{\tau}{2}]}{\sqrt{\tau}}
$$  

$$
h_{2}\equiv h_{1}+\sqrt{\tau}.
$$  

Here $d\equiv D/V$ is the current deposit-to-asset value ratio for the bank, and $\tau\equiv\upsigma^{2}T$ is the variance of the logarithmic change in the value of the assets during the term of the deposits.  

# Properties of a Risk-Sensitive Deposit Insurance Pricing Scheme  

A few points are worth noting. First, an increase in the deposit-to-asset value ratio causes an increase in the cost per dollar of deposit insurance to the FDIC, that is,  

$$
\partial g/\partial d=\Phi(h_{1})/d^{2}>0.
$$  

Similarly, as $\tau$ increases, so does the cost of deposit insurance, that is,  

$$
\partial g/\partial\tau=\Phi^{\prime}(h_{1})/2d\sqrt{T}>0.
$$  

Here the prime denotes a derivative; hence, $\Phi^{\prime}(h_{1})$ is the standard normal density function at $h_{1}$ This is a well-known property of options; their value increases with the volatility of the underlying security. Hence, the FDIC should charge a higher deposit insurance premium for banks with lower capital-to-total-assets ratios and higher volatility in the value of total assets. Alternatively, in a regime in which the FDIC charges each bank a fixed premium per dollar of insured deposits, rather than $g$ (which is a function of $d$ and $\tau$ ), banks with higher capital ratios and lower asset risks subsidize those with lower capital ratios and higher asset risks, assuming that the FDIC breaks even on average.  

# The Option Feature and Moral Hazard  

These observations also highlight the moral hazard inherent in deposit insurance. Since $g$ is the value to the bank of deposit insurance per dollar of insured deposits, a bank can increase this value by reducing its capital and increasing its asset volatility. To the extent that the premium charged is insensitive to these initiatives of the bank, a shareholderwealth-maximizing bank has an incentive to increase financial leverage and asset volatility. Figure 12.1 illustrates this incentive graphically.  

In Figure 12.1  the curve AB is the total expected return on the bank’s assets, net of bankruptcy costs.29 This curve peaks at $\upsigma^{*}$ . The expected return to depositors, as represented by the straight line CD, remains constant because we assume that deposits are completely insured. The total expected return to depositors and the FDIC is equal to the deposit yield plus the deposit insurance premium minus the expected bankruptcy costs. This total expected return, represented by the curve BF, is constant for $\sigma<\upsigma_{\mathrm{f}}$ (some threshold variability) because the probability of bankruptcy is zero in this range. Then, as the probability of bankruptcy rises, the total expected return to the FDIC and the depositors declines. Since the depositors are completely protected and the deposit insurance premium is insensitive to $\upsigma$ it is the expected return to the FDIC that falls very rapidly as $\upsigma$ arises. Consequently, even though the total expected return on the bank’s assets is falling as $\upsigma$ increases beyond $\upsigma^{*}$ , the expected return to the bank’s shareholders is increasing in this range. In fact, the shareholders’ expected return peaks at $\upsigma_{\mathrm{m}}>\upsigma^{*}$ .

FIGURE 12.1 The Relationship Between Expected Return and Risk.  

The optimal level of risk (as represented by $\upsigma$ ) depends on the decision maker’s objective. If the objective is to minimize the liability of the deposit insurer, then the optimal risk choice is $\sigma=\sigma_{\mathrm{f}}.$ If the objective is to maximize the bank’s total expected return on assets, then the optimal risk choice is $\sigma=\sigma^{*}$ . But if decisions are made to maximize the wealth of shareholders, the optimal risk choice is $\upsigma=\upsigma_{\mathrm{m}}$ Thus, if the “socially desired” risk choice is $\upsigma^{*}$ , the bank will take more risk than the social optimum by choosing $\upsigma_{\mathrm{m}}$ This is the moral hazard of deposit insurance.  

# Why the Concern With Moral Hazard in Banking?  

You will recall from Chapters 7 and 8 that a similar moral hazard exists for nonfinancial firms that borrow from banks. However, with nonfinancial firms, the costs of this moral hazard are borne ex post by private lenders, who pass along these costs ex ante (through the pricing mechanism) to the borrower. Thus, the moral hazard gets priced among the contracting parties in equilibrium. In the case of banks and other federally insured depository institutions, however, these costs are borne ex post by the FDIC, and hence, eventually by the taxpayers. Of course, if the FDIC breaks even in aggregate, then these costs are passed along ex ante to the banking industry as a whole, and there is simply a redistribution of wealth across banks. That is, less risky banks end up subsidizing their riskier counterparts, with no direct wealth consequences for the taxpayers.  

This analysis, as well as our earlier discussion of the similarity between a deposit insurance guarantee and a put option, indicates a role for safety regulation in banking. Given deposit insurance, banks have a propensity to lower capital and increase risk. Capital requirements and asset portfolio restrictions seek to address these distorted incentives arising from deposit insurance. However, the implementation of these regulatory devices has not always been effective.  

In the box below, we provide an illustration of the effect of moral hazard in the context of the put option pricing formula.  

Example 12.3 Consider a bank with federally insured deposits maturing in one year. Imagine that the bank’s asset value changes monthly and you have been provided the following data on asset values for the past seven months (you may assume that the probability distribution of asset value changes remains stationary through time).   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Month</td><td>Bank Asset Value (in millions of dollars)</td></tr><tr><td>１</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>２</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>５</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>97.605074</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Suppose the bank’s current deposit-to-asset value ratio is 0.95. Compute the value to the bank of the deposit insurance guarantee per dollar of insured deposits. Also compute the value of this guarantee for a higher deposit-to-total-asset-value ratio (of your choice), holding fixed the variance of asset value changes, and the value of this guarantee for a higher variance, holding fixed the deposit-to-total-asset-value ratio.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in three steps. First, we will compute $\tau,$ the variance of bank asset values. Second, we compute $\mathsf{h}_{1}$ and $\mathsf{h}_{2}$ using the value of $\tau$ obtained in the previous step. Finally, in Step 3 we calculate the cost of deposit insurance per dollar of insured deposits.  

# Step 1  

To compute $\tau,$ we define $V_{t}$ as the asset value in month $t$ and $V_{t-1}$ as the asset value in month t – 1. Thus, when we write the asset value in month 2, for example, we will write $V_{2},$ and when we write the ratio $V_{\mathrm{t}}/V_{\mathrm{t-1}}$ in month 2, we will write $V_{2}/V_{1}$ We can construct Table 12.4  

TABLE 12.4 Calculation of Asset Value Variance   


<html><body><table><tr><td>A Month</td><td>B Asset Value Vt</td><td>C Vt/Vt-1</td><td>D log (Vt/Vt-1)</td><td>E D-Sample Mean</td><td>F (E)²</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>100</td><td>一</td><td>一</td><td>一</td><td>一</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>101</td><td>1.01</td><td>0.00995</td><td>0.013988</td><td>0.0001957</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>99</td><td>0.9802</td><td>-0.02000</td><td>-0.015962</td><td>0.0002548</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>102</td><td>1.0303</td><td>0.02985</td><td>0.033888</td><td>0.0011484</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>100</td><td>0.9804</td><td>-0.01979</td><td>-0.015752</td><td>0.0002481</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>98</td><td>0.9800</td><td>-0.0202</td><td>-0.016162</td><td>0.0002612</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>97.605074</td><td>0.9959701</td><td>-0.004038</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

n this table, we compute the “sample mean” by adding up the entries in column D and dividing by 6 to obtain –0.004038. Column E is then obtained by subtracting the sample mean from each entry in column D. Column F is merely each entry in column E squared. Now,  

$$
{\begin{array}{c}{\sigma^{2}={\frac{\operatorname{sum\of\all\entries\in\column\F}}{5}}}\\ {={\frac{0.0021082}{5}}=0.0004216.}\end{array}}
$$  

Note that we divide by 5 because we lose one degree of freedom in computing the variance. Now, $\boldsymbol{\tau}=\mathbf{\sigma}\mathbf{\sigma}^{2}~T=0.0004216\times12=0.005$ approximately. Note that $T=12$ since the deposit maturity is 1 year and asset values change monthly.  

Step 2 Next, we compute $\mathsf{h}_{1}$ using Equation (12.5) as  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{h_{1}=\frac{\left|\log(0.95)-(0.005/2)\right.}{\sqrt{0.005}}}}\\ {{\left.=-0.76076\right.}}\end{array}
$$  

and $h_{2}$ using Equation (12.6) is  

$$
h_{2}=-0.76076+\sqrt{0.005}=-0.69005.
$$  

Step 3 Using Equation (12.4), we can now compute $g$ as  

$$
g=\Phi(-0.69005)-{\frac{1}{0.95}}\Phi(-0.76076)\cong0.0099.
$$  

Thus, the value to the bank of having the deposit insurance guarantee is roughly 99 cents per $\$100$ of insured deposits. This is much higher than the premia often charged in the past (e.g. 25 cents per $\$100$ of insured deposits). In Table 12.5  we present calculations for a variety of deposit-to-asset value ratios and values of $\tau$ Note that if we increase $d$ to 1 and hold $\tau$ fixed at 0.005, the value of $g$ rises to $\$2.82$ per $\$100$ of insured deposits. This illustrates the bank’s incentive for leverage emanating from deposit insurance. Similarly, if we hold $d$ fixed at 0.95 and increase $\tau$ to 0.006, the value of $g$ rises to $\$1209$ per $\$100$ of insured deposits. This illustrates the bank’s incentive to take on more risky assets.  

The option pricing approach indicates factors that must be considered in setting the deposit insurance premium. The premium per dollar of insured deposits must be sensitive to the volatility of the bank’s assets and to its deposit-to-total-asset ratio. If not, the bank will have an incentive to reduce its capital and increase its asset risk in the interests of its shareholders. The option pricing approach is not meant to be taken literally as a precise way to set the deposit insurance premium, since many of the standard Black–Scholes assumptions are not satisfied.30 For example, the asset values of banks often exhibit jumps rather than following a continuous path through time as assumed by Black–Scholes. In any case, the numerical values in Table 12.5 suggest the magnitude of the gains to banks from exploiting risk-insensitive deposit insurance pricing.

# Empirical Evidence on Moral Hazard  

Apart from the anecdotal evidence on moral hazard, there is now substantial scientific evidence to support the theories we have reviewed. Federal deposit insurance has been in existence for banks since 1934, but the more visible problems were encountered only during 1970–1990. This suggests that there must have been countervailing forces in the past that diminished the risk-taking propensity created by deposit insurance. The empirical evidence we discuss here sheds some light on these forces.  

1. Some Evidence on the Effect of Federal Deposit Insurance on Risk-Taking: The Case of Credit Unions: Federal deposit insurance was extended to credit unions in 1971 when the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) was formed, and the coverage limits are currently the same as for banks and thrifts.  

Credit unions: (i) make loans to their own members, (ii) make loans to other credit unions, and (iii) engage in loan participations with other credit unions. A credit union’s asset portfolio consists primarily of: (i) secured loans for the purchase of consumer durables, and (ii) investments in low-risk assets such as government bonds, loans to other credit unions, and deposits with commercial banks.  

A credit union can increase its risk by decreasing its capital cushion and by increasing the fraction of its total assets invested in high-risk assets. An empirical examination provided support for this hypothesis.31 Figure 12.2 is a graph illustrating the behavior of capital ratios (defined as capital divided by total assets) for federal credit unions over the 1949–1992 period. In 1970, just prior to the adoption of federal deposit insurance, the capital ratio was about the same as in 1949. There was a slight decline during the transition period from the preinsurance regime to the insurance regime. The sharpest decline occurred during the insurance period. This is consistent with the prediction of a moral hazard associated with deposit insurance.  

A similar pattern can be seen by examining the behavior of bank capital ratios over time, as shown in Figure 12.3 As is apparent, banks kept much higher levels of capital before the advent of deposit insurance.32  

2. The Relationship Between Market Power in Banking and Moral Hazard: As mentioned earlier, a major puzzle is why the deposit insurance system in the United States worked so well for so many years despite the risk-taking incentives provided by federal deposit insurance and why problems surfaced only recently. One explanation is that a bank’s risk-taking propensity depends on the value of its charter. The higher the charter value – the capitalized value of its future cash flows – the weaker is the bank’s incentive to take risk. This is because higher risk implies a higher likelihood of insolvency, in which case the insurer takes possession of the bank, and the charter is lost. Thus, the higher the value of this charter, the greater is the bankruptcy cost for the bank. In the past, various anticompetitive restrictions gave banks market power that enhanced the value of charters. The loss to the bank from losing its charter in the event of bankruptcy provided a counterbalance to the incentive for excessive risk-taking due to fixed-rate deposit insurance.33 The deregulation that took place in the 1980s increased banking competition but lowered the value of bank charters. Greater risk-taking was predictable.

FIGURE 12.4 Capital-to-Asset Ratios, Market and Book Values. (Source: Keeley (1990)).  

Evidence supports this theoretical prediction. Figure  12.4 is a graph of the time series behavior of the average capital/total assets ratio of the 25 largest bank holding companies in the United States from 1952 to 1986. The decline in this ratio is significant.  

A direct test of the relationship between risk-taking and charter value would need to have some measure of the capitalized value of future rents, or market power. One such measure is “Tobin’s $q$ ” which is approximated as the ratio of the market value of assets (market value of common equity plus the book value of liabilities) to the book value of assets. The higher the $q$ ratio, the larger is the charter value, relative to the book value of its assets. Since bank risk-taking is also not directly observable, a proxy is needed. A reasonable proxy is the interest cost on large uninsured CDs. The holders of such CDs should be sensitive to the bank’s riskiness and demand higher interest rates from riskier banks. The evidence is quite compelling. Each $1\%$ increase in the $q$ ratio results in a 16–18 basis point reduction in the average CD cost. Moreover, this relationship is statistically significant. Thus, bank risk-taking appears to have increased substantially in the 1980s owing to deregulation that diminished bank charter values.

FIGURE 12.5 Capitalization of the 25 Largest Bank Holding Companies During 1962–2012. This figure shows the weighted average capitalization of the 25 largest bank holding companies from 1962 to 2012. Capital ratios are expressed in book values (shareholder equity/total assets) and market values (market value of equity/market value of assets). (Source: Compustat and own calculations).  

To provide a comparison with more recent data, we have provided in Figure 12.5 the capital ratios in book and market value terms for the 25 largest bank holding companies from 1959 to 2012. The effect of the capital regulation that began with the Basel I Accord is evident, as capital ratios exhibit an upward drift beginning in the late 1980s, but note the divergent experience that we documented in Chapter 2 34  

In Figure  12.6  we show the number of bank failures during 1992–2011. As is evident, the number of failures decreased dramatically during the early 1990s and has stayed relatively low as banks have operated with healthy capital ratios. Then there was an increase in bank failures during the financial crisis.

# THE GREAT DEPOSIT INSURANCE DEBACLE  

# General Background  

We have now reviewed both the theory and some empirical evidence about the effects of deposit insurance on depository institutions’ risk-taking behavior. In trying to understand the great deposit insurance debacle of the 1980s, it is important to remember that until the mid-1970s deposit insurance worked remarkably well. But, two developments undermined federal deposit insurance. One is the lowering of bank charter values, which increased managers’ incentives to take more asset risk and to also engage in fraud. The other is the decline in regulatory vigilance over the same period; this simply exacerbated the moral hazard problem of federally insured depository institutions.  

The waste that resulted from the collapse of the thrift industry and the many banking failures in the 1980s can be classified into three categories: excessive risk-taking, excessive consumption of perquisites by top executives, and outright fraud. Moreover, these diversions/destructions of wealth were possible due to three factors working in concert: deposit insurance with risk-insensitive pricing, low charter values due to deregulation, and lax monitoring by regulators. This laxity in monitoring, caused by a lowered commitment of resources to supervision, was also compounded by cozy relationships between some regulators and the institutions they were supposed to be watching over. In Figure 12.7  we have provided a simple schematic to summarize these effects.  

It is not as if $\mathrm{\nabla{S}\&L}$ and bank managers woke up one morning in the 1980s and decided to change the way they made decisions in order to “rip off” the taxpayers.  

The point is that their incentives were altered. Their decision rule was still the same, but the altered incentives changed their behavior. The reasons for the deposit insurance crisis can therefore be traced not just to the managers of depository institutions, but also to the politicians and regulators who pursued myopic and hasty policies. In what follows, we briefly discuss the causes and effects depicted in Figure 12.7  

# Regulatory and Political Culpability  

For some years, S&L regulators tried to ignore problems in the thrift industry. Hoping that problems would improve, regulators permitted insolvent institutions to continue to operate. Our analysis of credit risk in Chapters 7 and 8 highlighted the important incentive effects of capital on a borrower’s risk-taking propensity. The same is true of depository institutions; their propensity to take risk is greater when capital is lower. When capital is negative, excessive risk-taking is easy to predict. Indeed, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) was quite aware that the thrift industry was in deep trouble in 1981, but chose not to close all the insolvent institutions.35

FIGURE 12.7 Schematic of Effects Responsible for Problems in Banking and Thrift Industries.  

This inaction was part of a broader regulatory malaise. The main findings of a 2-month USA Today-Gannett News Service investigation are listed below.36  

Some regulators had close ties to the industry.37  In some cases, regulators suggested that S&Ls try to grow rapidly and to invest in risky ventures as a way of quickly boosting profits.  Regulatory agencies lacked the powers and the human resources to monitor rapidly growing S&Ls.  Congress repeatedly refused requests to add S&L examiners, and told the FHLBB to go easy on problem S&Ls.38  

# Excessive Risk-Taking  

As previously discussed, the three prominent ways to detect excessive risk-taking involve examining capital-to-total-asset ratios, interest rates on large (uninsured) CDs, and the assets in the institution’s portfolio. The last two are briefly discussed below.  

# Higher Interest Rates on CDs  

Riskier institutions must pay higher interest rates on large CDs, or conversely, those institutions that offer to pay higher interest rates on their deposits anticipate investing in high-risk, high-yield assets to cover their deposit funding costs. Since risk-taking incentives are the strongest in insolvent and nearly insolvent institutions, one would expect such institutions to be paying the highest rates. This is precisely what happened in the southwestern United States, where the S&L industry was devastated. Higher interest rates offered by insolvent institutions led to a self-fulfilling prophecy. When a depository institution has low net worth, it is expected to invest in riskier assets, so that depositors demand relatively high interest rates. These high interest rates, in turn, increase the attractiveness of high-yield, high-risk assets to the institution, thus completing the cycle. Moreover, in order to compete with insolvent institutions, solvent institutions may be compelled to offer higher interest rates on their deposits, leading to stronger incentives to invest in riskier assets.  

# Investments in High-Risk Assets  

There is ample evidence of excessively risky investments by S&Ls. These investments included loans to developers to build ki resorts, speculative positions in government securities, junk bond portfolios, and so on.  

# Excessive Consumption of Perquisites by Managers  

Although it is empirically difficult to determine whether a given level of perquisites consumption by a manager is “appropriate,” some of the examples are striking and suggestive of abuse. These include institutional purchases of planes to transport top managers from their places of residence to their offices, payments for escort services, offices lined with expensive antiques and paintings, and gold-painted toilets. Many of the institutions where such apparent abuse occurred were investigated by the FSLIC.  

# Fraud  

Estimates of direct losses to the government due to fraud by S&L managers range from $\$8$ billion to $\$15$ billion, and fraud is suspected in $80\%$ of failed S&Ls. Parties, mansions, airplanes, women, Rolls-Royces, and Cayman Island bank accounts are some of the perks that S&L executives showered upon themselves as they looted federally insured deposits.  

The $\mathrm{\S{\&L}}$ crooks also caused failures of S&Ls run by honest managers, by selling them stakes in their bad loans. For example, the now-insolvent First Federal Savings and Loan of Malvern, Arkansas, bought an interest in a doomed $\$44$ million loan to a high-rise condo in Honolulu, which subsequently defaulted.  

Many of the fraud cases are very complex. Shady S&Ls and equally shady borrowers combined dozens of loans, companies, and properties into convoluted deals to cover personal use of S&L deposits. Some S&Ls made borrowers pay big one-time fees – $4\mathrm{-}10\%$ of the loan – in order to obtain loans. The S&Ls would report these fees as income, which boosted profits. Many loans were never repaid, leaving the property in the S&L’s hands. An S&L executive might get a kickback for participating in the scheme. In Texas, this strategy was described as: “Heads, I win. Tails, FSLIC loses.”  

Following the S&L debacle, the government has filed approximately 100,000 civil suits against S&L executives, directors, owners, borrowers, and others believed responsible for contributing to the insolvency of S&Ls. The success of these prosecution efforts, and of attempts to recover some of the losses due to fraud, negligence, and simple mismanagement, remains uncertain.  

To summarize, the greatest banking debacle since the Great Depression was not just an “unfortunate break” or an outcome of exogenous changes in the banking environment. Increasing competition increased interest-rate volatility and deregulation reduced the profitability of depository institutions, substantially diminishing charter values. Models of bank behavior predict increased risk-taking by federally insured institutions in such a setting, suggesting a need for improved regulatory monitoring. Unfortunately, safety was sacrificed at the same time that the industry was deregulated, as resources devoted to regulatory supervision were decreased. Regulatory ineptness and political meddling compounded the effects of poorly-thought-out initiatives.39  

In later years, the subprime crisis of 2007–2009 eclipsed the S&L crisis in terms of its magnitude and global impact. Although it affected the shadow-banking system more than depository institutions in the United States, it also affected depository institutions in other countries. We will say more about this in Chapter 14  

# Banking Fragility, Deposit Insurance, and Developments Since the Great Deposit Insurance Debacle  

We have seen in this chapter that deposit insurance induces moral hazard and invites banks to engage in reckless risk-taking. That is, there is an inherent paradox in the use of deposit insurance as a way to diminish the likelihood of bank runs and banking fragility. The safer banks feel due to deposit insurance, the greater is their risk-taking propensity! It is for this reason that it may be socially efficient to impose a limit on the level of deposit insurance, thereby leaving room for market discipline, which then opens up the possibility of bank runs and banking fragility. In other words, there may be an “optimal” amount of banking fragility that strikes the right balance between the market discipline associated with the possibility of bank runs to temper banks’ risk-taking incentives and the need to ensure that the likelihood of runs is not so high as to make banking excessively fragile.40 Of course, the subprime crisis of 2007–2009 has taught us that even though such thought out experiments may make sense on paper, in reality regulators often have a hard time saying no to bailouts ex post  especially when confronted with the possibility of large and interconnected institutions failing. Thus, market discipline may be substantially weakened by the ex ante expectation by creditors of banks that there will be regulatory forbearance ex post regardless of whether there is deposit insurance.  

One could argue that one way to cope with the moral hazard related to regulatory forbearance and deposit insurance is to use capital requirements as an instrument to reduce banks’ proclivity to take excessive risk. Regulatory reforms associated with the Basel I accord and FDICIA of 1991 (see subsequent chapters) lend strong support to the hypothesis that sufficiently high capital requirements can be effective in controlling risk.41  

The real question, however, is whether we need deposit insurance in the first place, for a lot of the regulatory apparatus we observe would be unnecessary were it not for deposit insurance.42 But would we not have excessive bank runs without deposit insurance? This is actually an open question. Mutual funds have no deposit insurance and we had not observed any runs until the 2007–2009 subprime crisis, and even those runs were induced by concerns about the risks of the investments made by these mutual funds. At the end of the day, a fundamentally sound banking system, backed up by a credible lender of last resort, may not be as fragile without deposit insurance today as it may have been in the past, especially when one considers that selective bailouts of uninsured institutions may be used to promote the safety of the financial system, as in the subprime crisis.43 If this is true, the entire system of deposit insurance and regulations may have to be reconsidered.  

# FUNDING IN THE SHADOW-BANKING SECTOR  

With depository financial intermediaries – the traditional banking sector – savers deposit money in banks which is then channeled to investors through bank loans. By contrast, the shadow-banking system is a web of specialized nondepository financial institutions that channel funding from savers to investors through a range of securitization and secured funding techniques.44 Shadow banks engage in credit and maturity transformation, just like traditional banks do, but without formal access to public sources of liquidity (e.g., discount window) and deposit insurance.  

# Growth of Shadow Banking  

Funding in the shadow-banking sector has actually grown much faster than bank deposit funding, as shown in Figure $12.8^{45}$ Included in shadow banks are various nondepository financial institutions like investment banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and finance companies; securitization structures such as ABCP and ABS; and key investors in securitized structures, such as money market mutual funds. As of the end of 2015, global shadow banking assets were estimated to be over \$34 trillion.46  

Shadow banks raise their financing by using tradable instruments like commercial paper and “repos.” A “repo” is a repurchase agreement whereby an institution borrows short-term using traded securities as collateral, having the collateral returned to it when the loan is repaid. The collateral used in these transactions comes from the creation of asset-backed securities created by the securitization of loans, leases, and mortgages. Savers hold money-market mutual fund (MMF) balances, instead of deposits with banks.

# The Funding Process: How it Works  

In the shadow-banking system, there is a chain of wholesale-funded, securitization-based lending that transforms risky, long-maturity loans (e.g., subprime mortgages) into lower-risk, short-term money-like instruments. The process by which this transformation occurs is described below:47  

Loan Origination: Finance companies originate auto loans, leases, nonconforming mortgages, whereas banks originate many different types of mortgages.   
Loan Warehousing: This is conducted by conduits and is funded through asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). That is, the conduits provide an institution where loans can be warehoused for securitization.   
Securitization: involving the pooling and structuring of loans into term asset-backed securities (ABS), is conducted by broker-dealers’ ABS syndicate desks.   
ABS Warehousing: is funded through repos and swaps and facilitated by trading books.   
The Creation of Collateralized Debt Obligations (CCDOs): occurs through the pooling and structuring of ABS, and is also conducted by broker-dealers’ ABS.   
ABS Intermediation: is performed by limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and credit hedge funds, which are funded by repos, ABCP, bonds, and capital notes.   
Funding: of all of these activities is conducted in wholesale funding markets by a mix of regulated unregulated intermediaries like MMFs and securities lenders. These cash investors fund shadow banks through short-term repos, commercial paper ABCP, bonds, etc.  

Figure 12.9 summarizes the credit intermediation process in the shadow-banking system.  

# The Role of Commercial Banks in Shadow Banking  

Commercial banks get involved in shadow banking in various ways. The most obvious is that commercial banks are owned by bank holding companies (BHCs). A BHC might own a wealth management unit with a money market mutual fund, that is, a shadow bank within the BHC. Another example is triparty repo funding by the broker–dealer subsidiary of a BHC. Similarly, a BHC might have an ABCP conduit, which would be off-balance-sheet to the BHC, but may be supported by a commercial bank subsidiary of the BHC through loan commitments.48 Another connection is that commercial banks originate the loans whose securitization creates the securities that shadow banks hold and then borrow against these securities which are used as collateral in repo transactions.  

In the future, as BHCs are subjected to more stringent and liquidity requirements, some shadow-banking activities may migrate out of BHCs into the shadow-banking system.  

# CONCLUSION  

We have devoted this chapter to an extensive discussion of the deposit contract, liability management, and deposit insurance. The nature of the deposit contract is such that it leaves the bank vulnerable to runs, and the banking system vulnerable to panics. It appears that deposit insurance served its purpose of minimizing bank runs and panics. Indeed, for almost 50 years since the inception of federal deposit insurance in 1933, failure rates in the banking and thrift industries have been abnormally low compared to other industries. Moreover, this stable environment meant that liability management was not a pressing issue for banks.  

But all that changed in the 1970s and 1980s. As interest-rate volatility increased and interest-rate restrictions were relaxed and then eliminated, liability management became a significant concern for banks. Moreover, a combination of deregulation, heightened volatility in market prices, lax regulatory monitoring, political interference, and corrupt executives in federally insured institutions significantly undermined the safety of the industry, and imposed monstrous losses on the deposit insurance funds. It is somewhat ironic that these events were quite predictable, in light of what was known prior to these events.  

The 2007–2009 financial crisis offered new challenges, particularly the fragility of funding structures in the shadowbanking sector. Chapter 14 covers this in depth.

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. What are the main economic features of the demand deposit contract and how do these features discipline management when deposits are uninsured?   
2. What measures were used to cope with bank runs and panics prior to federal deposit insurance? Why were these not entirely satisfactory?   
3. What is a bank run and how can you explain a run on economic grounds?   
4. How does deposit insurance prevent runs and panics?   
5. Explain the similarity between deposit insurance and a common stock put option and how this leads to moral hazard.   
6. Why did deposit insurance work so well in the United States until 1980 despite the obvious moral hazard, and why did it fail after that?   
7. Discuss the roles of bank managers, accountants, regulators, and politicians in the “great banking/S&L debacle.”   
8. What is liability management and what are its main objectives?   
9. What is the agency problem between the shareholders and managers of a bank in liability management?   
10. Is moral hazard unethical, illegal, or neither? Can you outline a conceptual framework for defining unethical behavior by a depository institution?   
11. What aspects of S&L/bank behavior would you consider unethical? For example, were junk bond investments unethical? Be sure to take an ex ante perspective and not use “20-20 hindsight.”   
12. Why do you think unethical behavior became so rampant in the last decade and not prior to that? Did people change? Did morals decline in general? Did the environment change? Can you relate unethical behavior during this period to similar behavior during other periods in history?   
13. Consider a bank that receives a $\$1$ deposit from each of 200 different depositors at $t=0$ . It invests $\$25$ of shareholders’ equity in the bank and lends $\$200$ , keeping $\$25$ as cash reserves. Out of the 200 depositors, there are 75 depositors (called type- $\mathbf{\cdotD}_{1}$ depositors) who are capable of monitoring the bank’s management; the remaining depositors (called type-D2 depositors) have kept their money in the bank simply for transactions and safekeeping. The cost of monitoring the bank for an individual type- $\cdot\mathrm{D}_{1}$ depositor is $\$03$ per period.  

The bank has two mutually exclusive investment opportunities. Project (or loan) A pays $\$300$ with probability 0.6 and zero with probability 0.4 at $t=1$ . Project B pays $\$250$ with probability 0.8 and $\$220$ with probability 0.2 at $t=1$ . If the bank chooses one of these two projects, the probability that the bank will actually end up with that project is 0.7. With probability 0.3, the bank will have inadvertently chosen the other project. Thus, we assume that the bank may make errors in project choice. By monitoring the bank, a type- $\mathbf{\cdotD}_{1}$ depositor can discover the bank’s true project choice at some point in time intermediate between $t=0$ and $t=1$ , say at $t=1/2$ . These depositors can, if they desire, force liquidation of the bank by withdrawing their deposits at $t=1/2$ . Note that the bank’s loans/projects mature at $t=1$ . If they are liquidated at $t=1/2$ , they are worth only $\$70$ to the bank. Under the terms of the deposit contract, the bank promises to pay $15\%$ interest (conditional on the bank having the financial capacity to do so) if deposit withdrawal occurs at $t=1$ , and no interest if withdrawal occurs before that. Thus, a depositor is entitled to $\$1.15$ if she withdraws at $t=1$ , and $\$1$ if she withdraws at $t=1/2$ . The risk-free discount rate is zero and all agents are risk neutral.  

All the type- ${\bf\cdot D}_{2}$ depositors plan to withdraw at $t=1$ , but each is subject to a random liquidity-motivated desire to withdraw at $t=1/2$ . To simplify, we will assume that even though no one knows in advance which (type- $.\mathrm{D}_{2}^{\cdot}$ ) depositors will wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ , the fraction of those who will wish to withdraw is known to be 25/125. That is, 25 type- ${\bf\cdot D}_{2}$ depositors will wish to withdraw at $t=1/2$ . Assume that the bank’s managers make decisions in the best interests of their shareholders. Compute the equilibrium strategies for the bank and its depositors.  

14. Why do you think shadow banking grew so much in the last two decades? What does it imply about systemic financial risks?
