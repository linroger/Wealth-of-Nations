Project Finance Financing provided for large projects that are separately incorporated from the sponsoring firm.  

# INTRODUCTION  

In the previous two chapters, we examined a variety of issues related to bank lending. There are, however, three important topics that we did not cover. These are syndicated lending, loan sales, and project finance. Syndicated lending occurs when multiple lenders participate in making a single large loan. There is a lead lender, typically a commercial bank, in the syndicate that originates the loan and the other lenders participate by providing varying amounts of the loan. A variant of syndicated lending is loan sales  which we will also discuss. Project financing occurs when the sponsoring firm for a project decides to incorporate the project as a stand-alone entity outside the firm and seeks financing that has a direct claim on the project cash flows rather than the cash flows of the sponsoring firm. In this chapter, we will describe these practices and explain the underlying economic forces at work that make these practices efficient in some circumstances.  

# SYNDICATED LENDING  

In this section, we first discuss what a syndicated loan is and the economic functions syndication serves. We then discuss the syndicated loan market, both in domestic and international lending.1  

# What Is Syndicated Lending?  

A syndicated loan is a credit granted by a group of lenders, typically banks, to a borrower. Every lender has a separate claim on the borrower, even though there is a single loan agreement. There is typically an originating bank (or group of originating banks) that conducts the credit analysis prior to granting the loan and also negotiates the pricing structure of the loan. These originating banks, called the senior syndicate members, are appointed by the borrower and provide the key financial intermediation services of resolving precontract informational asymmetries and designing the loan contract. The others in the syndicate, called the junior banks, provide a portion of the funding. The numbers and identities of the juniors vary depending on the size, complexity, and pricing of the loan, as well as the borrower’s willingness to expand its banking relationships.  

Why do we observe syndicated lending? One of the main reasons is the need for the senior lenders to diversify their credit risk exposure. By inviting banks to participate, the seniors can avoid excessive exposure to a single borrower, while still earning a fee for their origination expertise, including contract design, pricing, and distribution services. That is, loan syndication is a way for the bank to solve an inherent tension between the benefits of specialization and the benefits of diversification.

For the junior lenders in the syndicate, syndication enables participation without the costs of origination expertise. That is, these banks can diversify their loan portfolio by adding credits that they lack the expertise to originate themselves. Moreover, it exposes the junior bank to the borrower, and therefore creates the possibility of a future relationship that is deeper and more profitable for the bank.  

An example of a syndicated loan structure is provided in Figure 9.1  This syndicated loan took the form of a loan commitment (a topic discussed in greater depth in the next chapter) from a syndicate of banks to Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. in 2001. In this syndication, Deutsche Bank AG is the senior bank in the syndicate and Bank One NA, Citibank NA, Credit Lyonnais SA, and UBS AG are the juniors.  

# The Market for Syndicated Loans  

Syndicated lending has been very popular in United States domestic lending for many decades. However, since the 1970s, the practice has become an important part of the international lending as well.  

In the international market, loan syndications first developed as a sovereign lending business. In fact, just prior to the sovereign default by Mexico in 1982, most of the developing countries’ debt consisted of syndicated loans. The repayment difficulties experienced by Mexico and other sovereign borrowers in the 1980s resulted in the restructuring of Mexican debt into Brady bonds in 1989.2 As a consequence, emerging-market borrowers gravitated toward bond financing, causing a shrinkage in syndicated lending. A revival of syndicated lending occurred in the early 1990s, and syndicated lending became the biggest corporate finance market in the United States, as well as the largest source of underwriting revenue for lenders.3 The 2007–2009 financial crisis suppressed this market considerably, but it rebounded subsequently.

Figure 9.2 shows syndicated lending in the United States through the end of the financial crisis. Since 2010, syndicated lending growth has picked up. In 2017, global syndicated loan volume increased $8.72\%$ to $\$4.3$ trillion. Of this, $\$2.4$ trillion was U.S. syndicated lending (see Bloomberg Professional Services (2018)).  

By the beginning of the 1990s, banks operating in the syndication loan market had begun applying more sophisticated risk-management techniques, making more effective use of covenants and bond-pricing models. A secondary market for loan sales also began to develop as well, which began to attract nonbank financial firms like pension funds and insurance firms. Many banks began to view syndicated lending as a way to gain investment banking business. Moreover, borrowers from emerging markets began to find syndicated loans an attractive alternative and complement to other financing sources. Figure 9.3 shows syndicated lending activity in different regions around the world.  

Commercial banks dominate the syndicated lending market, although investment banks became more active over time. Syndicated loans are also being increasingly traded on secondary markets, facilitated by the standardization of documentation for loan trading and its positive effect on syndicated-loan liquidity.4  

Participants in the secondary market include: (i) market makers, (ii) active traders, and (iii) occasional sellers/ investors. The market-makers are usually large commercial and investment banks. They take positions, commit capital, and create liquidity. Active traders are mainly investment and commercial banks, specialized distressed-debt traders and institutional investors, called vulture funds, which trade distressed debt. Less active traders include insurance companies and nonfinancial corporations. Finally, there are also occasional participants who are either buyers or sellers of syndicated loans.5  

# The Brady Plan  

The Brady Plan, first announced by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in March 1989, was designed to address the debt crisis of the 1980s, which plagued some developing countries. The debt crisis began in 1982, when a number of countries, primarily in Latin America, confronted by high interest rates and low commodity prices, were on the verge of defaulting on their commercial bank loans. This caused credit flows to these countries to dry up, leading to economic stagnation.  

The Brady Plan evolved in response to this crisis. Its main features were: (1) bank creditors would grant debt relief in exchange for greater assurance of collectability in the form of principal and interest collateral; (2) debt relief would be linked to some assurance of economic reform and (3) the resulting debt would be easier to trade, to allow creditors greater ability to diversify risk.  

Because rescheduling occurred on a case-by-case basis, each Brady issue is unique, but most Brady restructurings included for the lenders a choice between exchanging their loans for either par bonds or discount bonds. Both par and discount bonds were 30-year collateralized bonds. Par bonds represent an exchange of loans for bonds of equal face amount, with a fixed, below-market rate of interest, permitting long-term debt service reduction through concessionary interest terms. Discount bonds represent an exchange of loans for a lesser amount of face value in bonds (generally a $30{-}50\%$ discount), allowing for immediate debt reduction, with a market-based floating rate of interest. The principal of both par and discount bonds was secured at final maturity by a pledge of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities denominated in dollars. A portion of the interest payable on par and discount bonds (generally from 12 to 24 months coverage) was also secured by the pledge of high-grade investment securities.  

The Brady Plan was successful in many respects. First, it allowed the participating countries to negotiate substantial reductions in their debt service obligations. Second, it helped commercial banks to diversify sovereign risk. Third, it encouraged many developing countries to adopt and pursue ambitious economic reforms. Finally, it has enabled many developing countries to regain access to international capital markets.  

# The Pricing of Syndicated Loans  

Syndicated lending, in terms of the closeness of the relationship between the bank and the borrower, is somewhere between a relationship loan and a transaction loan (see Chapter 7).  

The senior bank in the syndicate has a relationship with the borrower and thus, there are aspects of relationship lending that are embedded in a syndicated loan. However, the junior lenders in the syndicate are essentially making transaction loans.  

The pricing structure of a syndicated loan resembles that of a loan commitment. A variety of fees are charged, as shown in Table 9.1  

In addition to the fees and the spread between the lending rate and the lender’s cost of funds, various mechanisms are used to control risk exposure. These include guarantees, collateral, and covenants.  

Banks have traditionally sold loans to other banks. Over time the volume has increased substantially.6 An increasing number of banks are becoming involved in loan sales as buyers and sellers. Banks commonly employ asset sales specialists. Moreover, the number of banks selling loans through syndication has increased, and unlike traditional loan sales, an increasing number of loans (about $60\%$ ) are now being sold to buyers outside the U.S. correspondent banking network, mainly to foreign banks, other intermediaries, and nonfinancial firms. Maturities of loans sold range from 1 day to 2 years, with roughly $80\%$ having maturities of 90 days or less.  

# What Is a Loan Sale?  

A loan sale is similar to a loan syndication in that the originating bank is able to ensure that part of the funding for the loan comes from other lenders. There are two kinds of commercial loan sales: loan strips and loan participations. A loan strip is a short-term share of a long-term loan. When the strip comes due at the end of a given period (say 5, 30, or 60 days), the selling bank must repay the strip holder the contractual amount. In essence, funding has dried up for the loan at that point in time. To continue funding the loan, the originating bank must resell the strip for another period or provide funding itself.

One important consideration for borrower consenting to their loans being traded on the secondary market is avoiding withholding tax in the country where the acquirer of the loan is domiciled. Source: Gadanecz (2004)  Table 1.  

A loan sale without recourse removes the loan from the seller’s books and thus does not require reserves or capital to be held against it. In the 2007–2009 financial crisis, substantial grey areas were discovered where recourse arrangements (via guarantees and other assurances) continued to expose the original seller to the risks that many had assumed had been shed by the seller. These issues are not new. For example, it had been argued earlier that strips could expose banks to refunding risk. In January 1988, FASB determined that loan strips could be recorded as sales if: (i) the buyer of the strip assumes the full risk of loss, and (ii) the lender has no contractual obligation to repurchase the loan strip. The banking committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accounts announced that it would treat a strip as a sale if, at the strip’s maturity the original lender can refuse to lend because either: (i) the borrower violates a covenant in the loan contract, or (ii) a material adverse change (MAC) in the borrower’s financial condition is discovered. Note that (ii) is the same as the standard MAC clause in loan commitments.  

# Loan Participation  

Like syndicated lending, loan participation is a multilender financing arrangement. It differs from a loan strip in that it is an outright sale of a loan. Participations are loans where the lead lender (“Lead”) sells a participation in a loan to one or more participation lenders.7 The Lead continues to manage the loan on behalf of the participants. The relationship among the lenders is typically formalized in a participation agreement, which stipulates that the participant receives an undivided interest in the loan. The sale of the loan to participants typically occurs after the loan documentation has been executed by the Lead and the borrower. Unlike a syndicated loan, the participants do not contract directly with the borrower. The Lead negotiates the loan terms with the borrower, receives all the payments from the borrower, and collateral is maintained by the Lead in its own name. Participants make advances to the Lead, and these take the form of purchases of participation interests.  

The advantage of being a participant rather than being a junior lender in a syndication is that the lender does not need a separate contract with the borrower and can deal solely with the Lead. Thus, a participation is very much like a pure transaction loan or capital market investment. The advantages of being a junior lender in a syndicate rather than a participant are twofold. One is that the junior lender does not have to worry about the additional risk that the Lead may become insolvent.  

The other is that the junior lender in a syndicate can hope to develop a relationship with the borrower, something that is less likely for a participant.  

From the standpoint of the Lead, one advantage of a loan participation relative to a syndication is that it retains exclusive control over its relationship with the borrower and does not invite potential future competition for relationship lending from the junior lender in the syndicate. The advantage of a syndication for the senior lender is that, because the juniors have direct relationships with the borrowers, the senior lender can free up its own capital in an amount of credit extended by the junior lenders.  

# Choice Between Loan Syndication and Loan Sales  

The syndicated loan market and the market for loan participations have developed because they offer distinct economic advantages for borrowers as well as lenders. For the borrowers, syndicated and participation loans offer some of the advantages of relationship borrowing along with some of the advantages of transaction borrowing (such as liquidity and hence a lower borrowing cost). For the senior lenders, loan syndication permits exploitation of their origination expertise in resolving precontract informational asymmetries and negotiating pricing terms, while also enables them to diversify their credit risk exposure. The same is true for the Lead in a participation loan. For junior lenders, the benefits of loan syndication include the ability to diversify into sectors in which they lack origination expertise and to possibly develop a relationship with the borrower which could be deepened in the future. For participants, the benefit of loan participation lies in the ability to diversify into credits where they lack relationship and/or origination expertise.  

# Moral Hazard and Reputation in Loan Sales and Syndicated Lending  

In loan sales and syndicated lending, screening and monitoring of borrowers continues to be important. So very much in the spirit of the “banks are special” discussion in Chapter 3  banks need to have sufficient incentives to invest in screening and monitoring borrowers. However, since the lead bank in a syndicate has only a portion of the loan on its books, its incentives to engage in costly credit screening and monitoring of its loans are weaker than when the whole loan stays on its books. The same is true in loan sales. So, how can participating lenders be reassured that the lead bank will do adequate screening to ensure that only creditworthy borrowers are receiving loans?  

One mechanism for this is reputation. Syndicated lending is a repeated game  with a great deal of reciprocity. A lead bank in one syndicate may later get invited to be a participant bank in another, or it may end up approaching the same participant banks to join a subsequent syndicate in which it is again the lead bank. If a bank establishes a poor reputation by making syndicated loans that default more than expected, it may have trouble finding participants in later deals, or it may have to take larger positions in those deals to reassure its syndicate partners that there was proper due diligence before the loan was originated.8  

There is empirical evidence of such reputational effects in the syndicated market. In a study of the effect of large-scale bankruptcies among the borrowers of lead arrangers in loan syndicates, it was documented that such lead arrangers – who had demonstrably made poor loans that subsequently defaulted – suffered reputational damage and were less likely to subsequently syndicate loans. If they did succeed in subsequently syndicating loans, they were compelled to retain larger fractions of the loans and were less likely to attract other lenders to participate.9  

# PROJECT FINANCE  

In this section, we first define project finance, the economic functions it serves, and why it has grown so much recently. We then examine the characteristics of the project financing market.  

# What Is Project Finance?  

Project financing is a technique for financing large-scale infrastructure projects, including those in the natural-resource sectors, like energy and mining. Project financing is different in many respects from conventional financing. With project finance, the firm or public sponsor wishes to invest in a large project, and this is achieved by incorporating the project separately as an independent entity and seeking financing that represents a claim only on the cash flows of the projects. Typically, the sponsor, possibly with other sponsors like investment banks, invests some equity and then finances the rest of the project with debt that is typically nonrecourse to the sponsor. Nonrecourse debt means that the lenders have a claim only against the cash flows of the project and not against any other cash flows of the sponsor. The financing mix for the project typically involves a relatively high proportion of debt. The global scale of project finance is significant. Dealogic valued total investment in 2014 at $\$407.8$ billion.

Key: Amount (\$m) Source: Dealogic and Latham & Watkins (2017)  

Why is project financing used? There are numerous reasons. First, because the cash flows of the project are not commingled with those of the sponsor, it is easier for lenders to resolve precontract informational asymmetries. This lowers information processing costs for the lender and therefore benefits the borrower. Second, the absence of cash flow commingling also means that the asset-substitution moral hazard is reduced. This not only lowers the borrower’s cost of capital for financing the project, but also permits higher degrees of leverage to be used, generating a higher debt tax shield. Third, because multiple lenders are involved, the financing structure also has the risk-sharing advantages of syndicated lending. Finally, given the nonrecourse nature of the debt financing for the project, the sponsor does not expose itself to the risk of financial distress in case the project experiences difficulties. This is particularly important for large projects.  

There are two reasons why project financing is not used for all projects. First, fixed costs are incurred in establishing a special-purpose entity (SPE) to incorporate the project independently. Second, the success of the project typically depends on the joint efforts of many different parties, so there are coordination costs. Project financing is attractive only when its benefits exceed these costs. Although project financing is a venerable practice, it has become an increasingly globalized business since the 1990s. In part this is due to the growing trend to privatize and deregulate many industries around the world.10  

The breakdown of global project financing for 2016 based on geography is shown in Figure 9.4 and by sector in Figure 9.5. These pie charts have evolved over time. For example, the significant growth in project financing between 1998 and 2000 was in part due to the reallocation of global investors’ portfolios from developing to industrialized economies following the East Asian crisis of 1998–1999 and new project financing investments in Europe and North America. After 2000, there was a global decline due to a general economic slowdown in the early 2000s. There was strong growth after 2004 which lasted until the 2007–2009 financial crisis, during which there was a decline, followed by subsequent growth.  

The long-term outlook for project financing is quite bullish. Future demand for infrastructure financing in developing as well as in industrialized countries is likely to grow faster than GDP.11

It Buys Labor, Equipment and Other Inputs in Order to Produce a Tangible Output (Energy, Infrastructure, etc.). The Host Government Provides the Legal Framework Necessary for the Project to Operate. (Source: Adapted from Esty, 2004  and Sorge, 2004).  

A typical project financing structure is the nexus of multiple contracting relationships as shown in Figure 9.6.  

Hybrid structures that combine features of conventional financing and project financing are also being developed. With these structures, the debt financing provided to the project is still nonrecourse to the sponsor, but the idiosyncratic risk of the project is diversified away by lenders who finance portfolios of projects rather than single ventures. Moreover, some hybrid structures also involve partnerships between private companies and host governments with private financiers assuming construction and operating risks and host governments taking on market risks.  

There are two interesting recent developments in the project finance market. One is the growing popularity of various forms of credit protection such as political risk guarantees, credit derivatives, and a variety of new insurance products that help financiers manage various risks. Second, project finance loans are also increasingly being securitized. This will add considerable liquidity to this market and lower borrowing costs for sponsors.

FIGURE 9.7 Different Channels for Infrastructure Investments.

With such developments, the market for project finance could well begin to become more integrated with other financia markets. Figure 9.7 shows different financial arrangements available for infrastructure investments.  

To summarize, project financing has grown in response to two market forces: (i) the need for borrowers to be able to obtain financing that is exclusively tied to the characteristics of the project and divorced from the sponsor’s other cash flows, so as to reduce informational and agency costs, and permit higher leverage; and (ii) the need for lenders to reduce their credit risk exposure by breaking up the loan for a large project into smaller pieces that are financed by numerous lenders, with the possibility of “private–public partnerships” that involve participation by the local government. Project financing is an example of collaboration between commercial projects and investment projects to provide a variety of brokerage and qualitative asset-transformation services, such as resolution of precontract informational asymmetries, reduction of agency costs, and designing the loan contract so as to permit the borrower to obtain more leverage than would be otherwise possible.  

# CONCLUSION  

In this chapter, we examined three special topics in lending: syndicated lending, loan sales, and project financing. One element that connects them is that project financing usually involves loan syndication as well. Loan syndication creates a loan that combines features of a relationship loan and a transaction loan, whereas project financing permits borrowers to undertake large infrastructure projects with significantly higher leverage than would be otherwise possible and with potential for risk sharing with governmental entities. Both syndicated lending and project financing involve loan commitments by lenders, a topic we will turn to in the next chapter.
