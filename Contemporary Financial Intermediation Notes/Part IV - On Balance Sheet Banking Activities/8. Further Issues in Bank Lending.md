# Further Issues in Bank Lending  

“A banker is a fellow who lends you his umbrella when the sun is shining and wants it back the minute it begins to rain.”  

Mark Twain  

# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

Discount Window A facility, often referred to as lender of last resort, where banks can borrow short term from the Federal Reserve to meet their liquidity needs, normally using Treasury securities as collateral. The interest rate charged for these advances, a tool of monetary policy, is called the “discount rate.”  

Open Market Operations Purchases and sales of government securities by the Federal Reserve to adjust the legal reserves available to banks to support their deposit liabilities. Sales of government securities to banks reduce the reserves available to banks, and purchases of government securities from banks increase these reserves. This is a tool of monetary policy.  

Interest Elasticity of Investment Measure of the sensitivity of demand for investment funds by corporations to changes in interest rates (their borrowing rates).  

onetary Policy The Central Bank’s (Federal Reserve’s) policy with regard to the money supply and interest rates.  

Reserve Requirement The fraction of bank’s deposits and other (short-term) funding sources that must be kept as liquid assets, either as cash in vault, or as deposit with the Federal Reserve.  

CD A certificate of deposit. This is a time deposit with a stated maturity and interest rate. It may be negotiable (marketable) or nonnegotiable (nonmarketable).  

Consol Bond A bond with an infinite maturity, that is, one that promises a perpetual coupon stream and has no principal repayment.   
Credit Crunch Precipitous reduction in the availability of credit.  

# INTRODUCTION  

In Chapter 7 we examined informational problems in lending and how these problems are addressed through the design of loan contracts. In this chapter, we continue our discussion of loan transactions and extend it to cover a variety of issues such as the initial pricing of loans and adjustments in contractual terms that take place after the loan is made. While Chapter 7 was concerned mainly with static issues in lending, this chapter is concerned mainly with dynamic issues. We begin the next section with a discussion of how profit margins are assessed and how loans are priced. In the section that follows, we examine the reason for possible price rigidities in loan contracts and credit rationing. The bank’s optimal lending process is described in the next section. We then explore the economic incentives for banks and borrowers to develop long-term relationships. This is followed with a discussion of loan default and restructuring. A case study is presented to help illustrate the concepts.  

# LOAN PRICING AND PROFIT MARGINS: GENERAL REMARKS  

In this section, we discuss how banks assess the profitability of loans and how these are priced. We begin our discussion with an analysis of the assessment of profit margins. This is followed by a discussion of benchmark lending rates, after which we discuss compensating balances. We conclude the section with an analysis of the link between default risk and bank profit margins.  

# Assessing Profit Margins  

To assess the profit margin of a loan, a bank should first determine its sources of income from lending. These are (a) the interest on the loan, (b) noninterest fee income on the loan, and (c) income from fees charged for services the borrower purchases due to the lending relationship. As for (b), there are many sources of noninterest fee income. These include closing fees (charged for concluding the loan agreement), loan-servicing fees, and commitment fees (fees charged for making credit lines or loan commitments available).1 As for (c), borrowers may purchase a variety of services from banks due to the lending relationship. These include cash-management services and trust services, for example. If the purchase of these services can be linked to the taking of the loan, then the net profit from the sales of these services by the bank should be attributed to the loan.  

After assessing the income from the loan, the bank should compute the expenses incurred to generate that income. These expenses include processing costs, salaries, postage, advertising and other marketing expenses, occupancy expenses, and other loan-servicing costs. Finally, the bank should compute the costs of funding the loan. These costs include the cost of demand and time deposit and nondeposit funds supporting the loan, as well as the costs of servicing deposits. Having assessed income expenses and costs, the bank can calculate its profit on the loan as shown in Table 8.1  

# Benchmark or Reference Lending Rates  

Our previous discussion of profit margins did not explain how a particular loan interest rate itself should be determined. In practice, banks set the interest rates on loans by relating them to a benchmark or reference interest rate. A commonly used reference rate is the prime interest rate.2 Traditionally, the prime rate was the interest rate posted by the bank for short and intermediate maturity loans for its most creditworthy customers, usually corporations with “blue-chip” credit ratings.  

Nowadays, the bank’s most creditworthy customers pay less than the prime. The prime is an administered rate loosely linked to market interest rates, and it tends to be more sluggish than market rates.  

Determining the prime rate is one of the many decisions a bank makes in the process of managing its balance sheet. Whereas each bank sets its own prime lending rate, the behavior of competing financial institutions is a major influence. In addition, three major categories of market interest rates provide the principal inputs in the prime-rates setting process: (a) the rates on nonloan bank assets, (b) rates on bank-acquired liabilities, and (c) rates on corporate debt claims that are close substitutes for bank loans. Also, the term structure of interest rates, bankers’ expectations of future interest rates, the expected growth in deposits, and the expected growth in loan rates are important in setting the prime.  

Many of the bank’s loan rates are indexed to the prime rate, either additively as in “prime plus” (i.e., prime plus $1\%$ ) or multiplicatively as in “prime times” (i.e., prime 1.05). Thus, a decision to alter the prime rate involves adjustments in a bank’s entire schedule of business loan rates. This means that a bank must consider expected demand for all types of loans in determining its prime rate.  

Later in this chapter we will discuss the bank–customer relationship, a particularly important topic in view of the growing emphasis on relationship banking. For now, it suffices to note that “customer relationships” are arrangements whereby a bank provides a variety of services to long-established customers, and these relationships must also be considered in setting the prime rate. Customers are typically risk averse and hence dislike frequent and unpredictable adjustments in their borrowing rates. Thus, in order to foster customer relationships, the bank may wish to smooth the prime rate in relation to market interest rate movements. The usual customer relationship includes two features that are particularly relevant to prime rate determination – compensating balance requirements and loan commitments. We will deal with loan commitments in the next chapter. Compensating balances are dealt with next.

# Compensating Balances  

Increased competition in banking in recent years has reduced the use of “compensating balances.” Nevertheless, some banks still require minimum average deposit balances (known as compensating balances) as partial compensation for bank loans and other bank services. The bank’s compensation results from not paying interest (or paying below-market interest) on compensating balances.  

Compensating balances frequently are used with loan commitments or lines of credit. They can be viewed as raising the effective loan rate. Although compensating balances requirements are usually stated as percentages of the dollar amounts of credit lines, many arrangements require the deposit of additional balances when credit lines are activated or used. Nominal loan rates are quoted in terms of the loan principal. If a borrower must use a part of the loan to meet compensating balances requirements, the effective loan rate on the funds available for the borrower’s use will exceed the stated rate because the borrower is paying loan interest on funds committed to remain in his deposit account. This means that a bank can increase effective loan rates by simply increasing compensating balance requirements and leaving its prime rate unchanged. In other words, given the fact that the prime rate affects the bank’s entire schedule of lending rates, the bank may respond to changes in market interest rates by leaving the prime unchanged but changing nonprice loan terms – maturities, collateral requirements, or compensating balance requirements – so that effective lending rates can be selectively altered  

# The Relationship Between Lending Profit and Default Risk  

How should a bank set the interest rate on a loan? In the previous chapter, we made the simplifying assumption that each loan is priced to yield zero expected profit to the bank. As mentioned earlier, this is a representation of perfect competition among lenders. Such prices should only be viewed as minimal, however, since loan markets are imperfectly competitive. Thus, loans will be priced so that banks earn profits. The question is: How should the price of the loan be related to its riskiness? We will show that, because of agency problems, banks may price loans so that riskier borrowers are charged less than safer borrowers on a risk-adjusted basis.  

# Example 8.1  

To examine this issue, imagine that banks can charge any borrower 150 basis points above the interest rate at which the bank would break even (in an expected value sense) on that borrower. This is a simple way to recognize the inertia induced by transactions costs or switching costs. That is, the bank can charge a borrower $1.5\%$ above its breakeven rate before the customer will consider switching to another bank. By assumption, the bank’s own borrowing cost is the riskless interest rate. Now suppose the bank has two types of borrowers who are observationally separable. One is a low-risk borrower, Safeway, Inc., and the other is a high-risk borrower, Gamble Brothers. Although the bank can distinguish between these two types, it cannot directly control what the borrower does with the bank loan. Each borrower has the choice of investing in one of two mutually exclusive, single-period projects: S and R, each of which requires a $\$100$ investment. The cash flow probability distributions of these projects are given in Table 8.2 (“w.p.” means “with probability”).  

Compute the bank’s expected profit on each borrower.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in three steps. First, we examine Safeway, Inc. and ask what project the bank would like Safeway to choose. It turns out the answer is S. We then solve for the interest rate the bank can charge that will induce Safeway to choose S. Second, we examine Gamble Brothers. If the bank assumes that this borrower will choose R, then the breakeven interest rate is so high that the borrower declines the loan. We solve for the interest rate that induces Gamble Brothers to choose S. Finally, in Step 3 we compute the bank’s expected profit on each borrower, and find that this profit is higher on Safeway. Note that one key assumption here is that the bank is unable to directly control the borrower’s project choice, so that it must attempt to influence it through its loan pricing. Another key assumption is that the markup over the breakeven interest rate that the bank can charge is constant across borrowers.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">TABLE 8.2 Probability Distribution of Project Cash</td></tr><tr><td>Borrower Type</td><td>Cash Flow Distribution for S</td><td>Cash Flow Distribution for R</td></tr><tr><td>Low risk (Safeway, Inc.)</td><td>$150 for sure</td><td>$153 w.p. 0.9 and zero w.p. 0.1</td></tr><tr><td>High risk (Gamble Brothers) The riskless interest rate is 5%.</td><td>$150 w.p. 0.8 and zero w.p. 0.2</td><td>$161 w.p. 0.5 and zero w.p. 0.5</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Step 1   
Consider first Safeway, Inc. If the bank assumes that this borrower will choose S, then its breakeven loan interest rate is $5\%$ . Since it can charge another $1.5\%$ without losing this borrower, it can post a loan interest rate of $6.5\%$ . We can see that if the bank charges this interest rate, Safeway’s net expected payoff is   
1. $150{-}106.5=\S43.5$ if project S is chosen and   
2. $0.9(153-106.5)=\S41.85$ if project R is chosen.   
Thus, the bank’s assumption about Safeway’s project choice is validated. Note that since the markup over the breakeven interest rate is fixed, the bank’s expected profit is higher the lower is the riskiness of the project that the borrower chooses. Thus, it is in the bank’s interest to ensure through its loan pricing policy that the borrower chooses S rather than R. In the case of Safeway then, the bank can charge an interest rate of $6.5\%$ .  

# Step 2  

Consider now Gamble Brothers. If the bank assumes that this borrower will select $\mathsf{R},$ then it must set the repayment obligation on the loan at $\$210$ to break even (i.e., note that $[(\S210\times0.5)/1.05]=\S100)$ . But Gamble Brothers would not take a loan at those terms. If the bank assumes that Gamble Brothers will choose $S,$ then its breakdown interest rate is $31.25\%$ (i.e., $\left[(\S131.25\times0.8)/1.05\right]=\S100)$ . We can verify that as long as the interest rate is no more than $31.67\%$ , Gamble Brothers will prefer S to R. Thus, let us say that the bank will charge $31.67\%$ .  

Step 3   
We can now compute the bank’s net expected profit on each borrower. On Safeway, Inc., the bank earns a net profit of $\$1.5$ or $1.5\%$ . On Gamble Brothers, the bank’s net expected profit is $(\$131.66-\$131.25)\times0.8=\S0.328$ . That is, the bank earns a higher expected profit on the low-risk borrower than on the high-risk borrower, even though it charges the latter a higher loan interest rate.  

The example illustrates the pricing difficulties associated with high-risk borrowers: charging higher interest rates might be counterproductive if it invites moral hazard.  

The intuition is as follows. A high-risk borrower has riskier projects than a low-risk borrower and therefore the bank’s breakeven interest rate on such borrowers is higher, that is, high-risk borrowers must be charged a relatively high interest rate even before the bank’s profit margin is considered. Further, because their probability of repaying the loan is lower, such borrowers must be charged a higher nominal interest rate premium over the breakeven rate for the bank to earn a given profit. However, as our example shows, the higher the interest rate charged by the bank, the greater is the borrower’s desire to switch to a riskier project. This is a general result. It is intuitive because a high repayment obligation means that even if the project succeeds, the borrower’s net payoff after repaying the bank is relatively low, and perhaps even negative. This makes it more attractive for the borrower to gamble on projects that yield larger payoffs if they are successful but have lower success probabilities. The bank rationally anticipates such behavior by the borrower. It realizes that to earn the same expected profit on the high-risk borrower that it does on the low-risk borrower, it will have to charge the high-risk borrower such a high interest rate that the borrower would be induced to choose greater risk than the bank would like. In other words, the bank has less room to earn profits on the high-risk borrower because increases in interest rates discourage such borrowers from choosing the desired relatively safe investments.  

The management implication is obvious. Banks may wish to refocus their attention on the low-risk, low-spread borrowers. Deposit insurance has distorted these incentives and induced banks to pursue riskier investments than would otherwise be optimal. Moreover, to the extent that riskier borrowers are less well known, the intermediation rents that banks can earn from servicing these borrowers may also be greater. This too creates incentives for banks to pursue riskier borrowers. It turns out that the incentive effects of interest rates influence the overall allocation of credit, not just the pricing of loans. This is an issue we examine in the section on credit rationing.  

# The Mathematics of Loan Pricing  

Having provided the basic background for loan pricing, we now develop the mathematics behind how loan processes are determined. It turns out that bank loan pricing has a close relationship to the principles of capital budgeting used by nonfinancial firms.  

# The Basic Components in the Loan Pricing Equation  

The bank would like to set the price of the loan so as to have $\mathrm{\DeltaNPV}\geq0$ to the bank. To ensure $\mathrm{\DeltaNPV}\geq0$ , the expected loan revenues must exceed the bank’s “cost of funds” plus the “institutional costs” of making the loan, that is.  

Expected loan interest revenue:  

$\geq$ Institutional cost of loan $^+$ [amount of debt financing in the $\mathrm{loan}\times\mathrm{cost}$ of debt] $^+$ [amount of equity financing in the loan $\times$ cost of equity].  

Since expected loan revenue: $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ [loan interest rate $\times$ size of loan] – expected loss on the loan,   
we can write:  

# Institutional Costs  

The institutional costs of making a loan are the direct cost of monitoring the loan and the collateral, the direct costs of screening the applicant, and the allocated overhead costs. Included in the allocated overhead costs are the costs of using property, plant, and equipment, and the costs of regulation and management.  

There are various empirical estimates of institutional costs that are available for United States banks. Older studies by Oliver, Wyman & Company, and McKinsey & Company suggested that costs could run as high as 250 basis points. Of course, this cost will vary depending on the size of the bank, the market in which it operates, the existing regulations, and the type of loan.  

# Expected Loss on a Loan  

The formula for this is:  

Bank’s expected loss on a loan $\c=$ probability of default $\times$ the expected loss given default.  

Figure 8.1 shows how each component of the expected loss on a loan behaves as a function of the value of the borrower’s asset given that the borrowing is secured with the project financed by the loan.  

In practice, banks often use a “recovery rate” of $30\%$ , implying an expected loss given a default of $70\%$ . The average probability of default for midmarket lending might be around $1.2\%$ .  

Many banks now use the borrower’s credit rating to estimate probabilities (this is also consistent with the approach in the Basel II Capital Requirements that we will discuss in a later chapter). Moody’s KMV, a division of Moody’s Corporation, estimates ranges of default probabilities based on credit ratings as follows:  

AAA/Aaa $=0.02\%-0.03\%$ $\mathrm{{AA}/\mathrm{{Aa}}}=0.03\%\mathrm{{-0.10\%}}$ $\mathrm{A}=0.10\%-0.24\%$ $\mathrm{BBB}/\mathrm{Baa}=0.24\%-0.58\%$ $\mathrm{BB}/\mathrm{Ba}=0.58\%-1.19\%$  

# The Capital Structure Supporting a Loan  

Just like a nonfinancial firm finances its assets with a mixture of debt and equity, so does a bank finance its loan with a mixture of debt and equity. How does a bank determine the mix?  

![](images/72d0041338e10465dafa28e336e1b84ee93096231fca43dbaea4956cf00a65b9.jpg)  
FIGURE 8.1 The Bank’s Expected Loss on a Loan.  

Here we use a well-known result from corporate finance, namely that firms with more volatile cash flows and higher assets betas (greater systematic risk) use more equity in their capital structures. Similarly, a bank will use more equity capital in its financing of a loan that has higher potential for cash flow volatility and thus higher risk. In practice, a bank will create numerous loan categories and decide which category a particular loan belongs to. Each loan category will have a hypothetical capital structure, and categories associated with more risk will have more capital allocated to them.  

# The Required Rate of Return on the Bank’s Debt and Equity Capital  

The pretax cost of the bank’s debt is simply the average cost of all of the bank’s debt. This includes the costs of various types of insured and uninsured deposits, the cost of various forms of nondeposit short-term borrowings like advances, and the cost of subordinated debt. Then:  

$$
\mathrm{Costofdebt}=\mathrm{averagepretax}\mathrm{costofdebt}\times[1-T]
$$  

where $T$ is the bank’s effective tax rate.  

What determines the cost of the bank’s equity capital? This is the minimum expected rate of return that the bank’s shareholders demand, given the risk in their investment. Now bank assets are unique because they are primarily debt claims. This means that the bank’s payoff on a loan is fixed unless default occurs. In computing the risk of default, the bank must assess the default risk of a single asset as well as the default risk that a single asset adds to a diversified portfolio.  

# Default Risk of a Single Loan  

Suppose a bank is considering lending to a firm. If it makes the loan, the firm will have approximately $\$75$ million of debt due in one year and an expected market value of assets of $\$150$ million in one year. The standard deviation of the firm’s assets is assumed to be $17\%$ . (See Figure 8.2).  

What Figure 8.2 gives is a single number representing the probability of default. It is what is expected. It does not tell us the bank’s actual losses, which are random variables with probabilities associated with them. Thus, we need to characterize the distribution of losses as well. For each loan in the portfolio, we can characterize the probability of losses using: (i) the mean loss (expected loss) and (ii) the loss volatility.  

To see this with an example, suppose a bank has made a loan to a farm on an island where it rains on one side or the other in a given year, but never on both sides. The probability of rain on any given side is 0.5. Assume that the loan repayment is $\$1$ million and the loss given default is $100\%$ . In this case, the bank’s expected loss $=0.5{\times}\$1$ million $=\$0.5$ million. The loan loss volatility $\c=$ standard deviation of loan loss:  

![](images/2bb6710412453bc5c5ac46fcf73789f78ee96b3a8add2ef8bafe69213f246bb2.jpg)  
FIGURE 8.2 Distribution of Firm’s Asset Value.  

$$
\sqrt{0.5[\S1\mathrm{{lmillion}-\S0.5\mathrm{{million}}]^{2}+0.5[0-\S0.5\mathrm{{million}}]^{2}}}=\S0.5\mathrm{{million}.}
$$  

# Default Risk of a Loan Portfolio  

Now let us consider the effect of forming loan portfolios. Just as with expected returns, the expected loss of a loan portfolio is the weighted average of the individual expected loan losses, adjusted to take into account portfolio diversification effects. To see how diversification affects the loan loss volatility of the portfolio, suppose that the bank now makes two loans, one to a farm on one side of the island and another to a farm on the other side. Assume each loan is $\$0.5$ million, so the total amount loaned out is $\$1$ million. What now is the distribution of losses in the loan portfolio?  

Note first that the bank’s expected loan loss is still $\$0.5$ million (the sum of the expected loan losses on the two loans, each of which is $0.5{\times}\S0.5$ million $=\$0.25$ million). The loss volatility on each loan is  

$$
\sqrt{0.5[\S0.5\mathrm{million-\S0.25\mathrm{million}]^{2}+0.5[0-\S0.25\mathrm{million}]^{2}}}=\S0.25\mathrm{million}.
$$  

Recognizing that each loan has a weight of 0.5 in the portfolio and that the two loans are perfectly negatively correlated, we can use Equation (1.7) to obtain the portfolio loan loss volatility as:  

$$
{\sqrt{\left(0.5\right)^{2}(39.25\ {\mathrm{million}})^{2}+\left(0.5\right)^{2}\ (39.25\ {\mathrm{million}})^{2}-2(0.5)(0.5)(30.25\ {\mathrm{million}})(50.25\ {\mathrm{million}})}}=0~ 
$$  

Thus, portfolio diversification eliminates loan loss volatility in this case.  

This means that the amount of equity capital supporting a loan depends on the characteristics of the portfolio that the loan belongs to. When the bank adds a loan to an existing portfolio, it computes the impact of this additional loan on the loan loss volatility of the portfolio in order to compute the incremental loss volatility due to the loan and consequently the equity capital needed to support the loan.  

# Distribution of Portfolio Losses  

The distribution of portfolio losses is not normal. In practice, the distribution is very skewed. As Figure 8.3 shows, there is a high probability of “small” (less than expected) losses, and a small (but positive) probability of extremely large losses.  

In Figure 8.3  curve A represents the distribution of portfolio losses when the portfolio is not very well diversified. The variance of losses and, hence, the loan loss volatility is quite high. Moreover, the distribution is skewed in that mean lies to the right of the peak of the distribution, that is, there is a relatively high probability of losses that are smaller than the expected loss. As the portfolio becomes better diversified, we move to Curve B, which as a distribution diversification makes the distribution with a lower loan loss volatility. Further diversification makes the distribution look like Curve C, which is beginning to concentrate most of the high-probability outcomes around the mean or the expected loss. In the limit, as the portfolio becomes perfectly diversified, as in the case of the portfolio of loans to the two firms considered earlier, the distribution collapses to a single point represented by the expected loss, that is, all loan loss volatility is eliminated.

FIGURE 8.3 Distribution of Portfolio Losses and the Effect of Diversification.  

# Recap and Summary  

Once the bank has estimated the equity capital to be committed to a loan, it can use Equation (8.1) to determine the minimum loan interest rate.3 The actual interest rate will depend on market conditions; the greater the bank’s monopoly power in a given market, the greater will be the (positive) spread between the loan interest rate and the minimum rate given by Equation (8.1)  A summary of the loan interest rate determination is given in Figure 8.4  

![](images/34a8db0a6a73a56da934c112cfe6d9a12b8ef6e52af753ac68d38d59fc436d61.jpg)  
FIGURE 8.4 Loan Interest Rate Determination.  

Some of the important additional considerations are that loan commitments should be included in the analysis. Moreover, it should be recognized that covenants in the loan contract reduce the risk of a new loan, highly “concentrated” (say in a particular industry as loans to firms of similar size) portfolios should require more capital.  

# CREDIT RATIONING  

Credit rationing is defined as a situation in which a lender refuses to extend credit to a borrower at the price posted by the lender for that borrower class. Credit rationing is not a phenomenon whereby a potential borrower refuses to accept credit because the price is “unfair” or too high. The essential point is that credit is denied at a price selected by the lender itself. Even if the borrower offers a higher interest rate than that asked for by the lender, a loan is refused by the lender.  

Credit rationing is a puzzling practice.4 When credit is rationed, there is an unsatisfied demand for credit at the price posted by the bank, that is, credit demand exceeds supply at that price. Conventional economic theory, or just plain common sense, suggests that the bank could increase its profits by increasing the price of credit. If the supply function for credit is upward sloping and the demand function is downward sloping, as shown in Figure 8.5  then this should bring about the usual equilibrium in which demand and supply are equated. Since the bank is supplying more credit and at a higher price, its profit should be greater. Thus it seems irrational for profit-maximizing banks to ration credit.5 Is it?  

While it is conceivable that banks forgo profitable lending opportunities, it seems implausible. We thus ask whether it is rational for a profit-maximizing bank to ration credit.  

# Why Should We Be Interested in Credit Rationing?  

It is believed that a fall in the money supply restricts spending. This could happen even if the fall in the money supply caused only a small increase in interest rates, or if spending is not curtailed by an interest rate increase. The reason is that a fall in the money supply would leave banks with less to lend, forcing them to reduce their lending, even if customers did not reduce their loan demand. Thus, spending was viewed as being constrained by the availability of credit to banks, and this credit was allocated to customers through nonprice means such as credit rationing. This argument, popularly known as the “availability doctrine,” suggested an alternative transmission channel for monetary policy that was based in an important way on the monetary policy argument.  

There are two reasons why we should be interested in studying credit rationing in connection with monetary policy. First, with credit rationing, monetary policy can be effective in influencing aggregate investment by corporations even with little variation in interest rates. That is, if the Federal Reserve feels that inflationary pressures need to be abated by curtailing spending, it could cause a slowdown of the economy without major changes in interest rates. This could be achieved by reducing the liquidity of banks, which in turn could lead to reduced bank lending due to credit rationing, even if investment demand by corporations was unchanged. Thus, the effectiveness of monetary policy would have not been empirically documented. An important implication of this is that in the presence of credit rationing, the monetary policy options of inducing increased interest rates through a higher discount window borrowing rate and of reducing the amount of credit available through open market operations (bond sales) are not necessarily equivalent. Credit can be reduced even if investment demand is insensitive to monetary policy manipulations.

FIGURE 8.5 The Demand and Supply for Credit.  

Second, it has been empirically found that a more stringent monetary policy does not affect all borrowers equally. Thus, if credit rationing is better understood with respect to the identities of those who are rationed, we may be able to better predict the effects of a restrictive monetary policy.6  

# Why Is There Credit Rationing?  

In order to understand why a profit-maximizing bank might ration credit, we need to examine the conditions under which it would not be optimal for the bank to increase its loan interest rate when faced with excess demand for credit. It is difficult to see why banks would do this if they had as much information as the borrower. If the bank was perfectly informed, it could always set an appropriate risk-adjusted price and lend accordingly.  

However, in a world of asymmetric information, credit rationing can be an optimal strategy for a profit-maximizing bank. The explanation turns upon two types of information hurdles.7 First, a bank may not be able to distinguish perfectly between borrowers with different credit risks, even after it has analyzed each borrower’s financial information. This is called the precontract private information problem. Even if the bank knows the average riskiness of borrowers within a given risk classification, it may not be able to identify individual risks [recall the Akerlof, 1970 discussion in Chapter 1]. The bank will, therefore, charge a common price to all within the risk class, so that some borrowers are subsidizing others. A second problem is that the bank may not be able to completely control the borrower’s actions. The borrower may thus be able to increase project risk, either through its choice of projects or through its expenditure of effort, without detection by the bank.  

Now imagine that a loan interest rate is announced by the bank for a particular risk class, and at that interest rate there is an excess demand for loans by borrowers in that risk class. What would happen if the bank chose to increase the loan interest rate? One possibility is adverse selection. Safer borrowers within the given risk classification may be unwilling to borrow at the higher interest rate, so that the mix of borrowers within the pool becomes riskier. If this happens, the bank’s expected profit could actually be lower at the higher interest rate; we provide a simple numerical example below to illustrate. A second possibility is that an increase in the loan interest rate could worsen the moral hazard problem. That is, those borrowers within the pool who have some latitude in their investment decisions may choose riskier projects at the higher loan interest rate. This again could mean a lower expected profit for the bank at the higher loan interest rate. Thus, the bank may conclude that increasing the loan interest rate is not worthwhile since its expected profit is maximized at an interest rate at which credit demand exceeds supply.8 Figure 8.6 depicts this graphically.  

We now provide numerical examples to illustrate these concepts. We will first focus on the adverse selection problem, ignoring moral hazard for the moment.  

Example 8.2 Suppose that you are the loan officer for the Midtown Community Bank and you know that within a particular risk class, there are two types of borrowers: low-risk borrowers and high-risk borrowers. However, you cannot distinguish between them.  

You believe that the probability that a randomly chosen borrower is low risk is 0.5 and that the borrower is high risk is 0.5. There are 1000 potential loan applications of each type within this risk class. Each applicant would like a loan of $\$100$ . The low-risk borrower will invest this loan in a project that lasts for one period hence will yield $\$130$ with probability 0.9 and nothing with probability 0.1. The high-risk borrower will invest the loan in a project that will yield $\$135$ with probability 0.8 and nothing with probability 0.2 one period hence. Midtown Community Bank is a monopolist with respect to these borrowers.9 Assuming that the only pricing instrument available is the loan interest rate, how should you price a loan to a borrower in this risk class so as to maximize the bank’s expected profit? You have only $\$100,000$ available to lend and the junior lending officer who reports to you has advised you that 2000 loan applications were received when it was announced that the bank would charge an interest rate of $29\%$ . The current riskless rate is $5\%$ . Assume that a borrower must have at least 1 dollar of net profit in the successful state in order to apply for a bank loan,10 and that there is universal risk neutrality.

FIGURE 8.6 Credit Rationing.  

# Solution  

This example shows how informational considerations can impart rigidity to the bank’s loan interest rate. To show this, we proceed in three steps. First, we will compute Midtown Community Bank’s expected profit if it charges a rate of interest of $29\%$ and is forced to randomly ration half its loan applicants (because all potential borrowers apply). Second, we calculate Midtown’s expected profit if it charges a rate higher than $29\%$ . In this case, the low-risk borrowers drop out, so that the bank lends only to the high-risk borrowers. Finally, in the third step, we compare the bank’s expected profits from the first two steps and show that Midtown Community Bank’s expected profit is maximized by setting the loan interest rate at $29\%$ and randomly rationing half its credit applicants. The key to this finding is that the bank cannot distinguish between the low- and high-risk borrowers.  

Step 1 Clearly, if you charge an interest rate of $29\%,$ , you will have to ration credit since you can lend only $\$100,000$ to this group of borrowers and the demand is for $\$200,000$ . Now, the maximum interest rate that your bank can charge without losing the low-risk borrowers is $29\%$ . At this interest rate, the net profit of the low-risk borrower in the successful state is  

$$
130-129=\$1,
$$  

because the repayment obligation is $\$129$ . Clearly, the high-risk borrowers will also choose to apply at this interest rate since the net profit of such a borrower in the successful state is  

$$
135-129=\S6.
$$  

The total expected profit of Midtown Community Bank, if it lends at an interest rate of $29\%,$ is  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\frac{(0.5\times0.9\times\S129+0.5\times0.8\times\S129)\times100,000}{1.05}}}\\ {{=\S4428.57}}\end{array}
$$  

The expression in Equation  8.3) can be understood as follows. There is a 0.5 probability that the borrower is low risk, in which case the bank gets repaid $\$129$ with probability 0.9. Similarly, there is a 0.5 probability that the borrower is high risk, in which case the bank gets repaid $\$129$ with probability 0.8. This explains the term in the parentheses of the numerator in Equation (8.3). This is multiplied by 1000 since the bank can make 1000 such loans. We discount at the riskless rate of $5\%$ since the bank is risk neutral. The initial outlay of $\$100,000$ is finally subtracted to arrive at the bank’s expected profit.  

# Step 2  

Since there is unsatisfied loan demand at the $29\%$ interest rate – half the loan applicants are turned down – it is natural to ask if Midtown can earn a higher expected profit by increasing the loan interest rate.11  

Clearly, if you raise the loan interest rate above $29\%$ , the low-risk borrowers will not wish to borrow. Since only the high-risk borrowers remain, you might as well raise the loan interest rate all the way up to $34\%$ , the maximum you can charge the highrisk borrowers before they too drop out. We refer to $34\%$ as a market clearing interest rate since at this level, loan demand equals loan supply.12  

Midtown Community Bank’s total expected profit at this interest rate is  

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\displaystyle\frac{0.8\times\S134\times1,000}{1.05}-\S100,000}\\ {=\S2,095.24}\end{array}
$$  

Note that Equation  8.4) recognizes that the bank knows that only the high-risk borrowers will apply.  

Step 3 t is clear now that the bank earns a greater profit by charging $29\%$ and rationing half its loan applicants rather than raising the loan interest rate to a market clearing $34\%$ . This illustrates how adverse selection may cause a profit-maximizing bank to ration credit. Raising interest rates in the face of excess demand may drive away the best customers and leave the bank worse off.  

We now turn to an illustration of the moral hazard effect.  

# Example 8.3  

Suppose Midtown Community Bank has received a loan application at $t=0$ from a firm that currently has no assets except for an investment opportunity available one period hence, at $t=1$ . The customer has stipulated that the loan must be made available at $t=0$ or not at all. The investment outlay required at $t=1$ is $I_{\mid}=\$100,$ of which $\$55$ will come from a bank loan. The firm will make its decision on whether or not to invest at $t=1$ . The firm currently has some securities outstanding. If the investment is made at $t=1$ , it will yield $\$7$ per year perpetually, beginning at $t=2$ . Although $\tilde{y}$ is not known now, it will be known at $t=1$ . There are five possible states of the world at $t=1$ , as shown in Table 8.3  

Thus, if state 1 is realized at $t=1$ , the project will pay $\$15$ per year perpetually beginning $t=2$ .  

Assume that the riskless rate is $10\%$ and the corporate tax rate is zero. Assuming that $\$55$ of $I_{1}$ will be financed with a loan, and the rest will come from the firm’s retained earnings, compute Midtown’s expected return as a function of the promised loan interest rate. Assume that $I_{1}$ is a perpetual loan (a consol) with interest payable at the end of each period, beginning at the end of the first period, that is, at $t=2$ .

# Solution  

The basic idea conveyed by this example is that it does not benefit the bank to keep increasing the loan interest rate because, beyond some point, an increase discourages the borrower from investing when the bank would prefer to proceed with the project. We solve this problem in three steps. First, we provide a framework for linking the bank’s actual annual interest payment on the loan as a function of the promised interest payment. Second, we calculate the interest payment the bank can expect to receive each period for different values of the promised loan interest rate. Finally, in Step 3 we conclude that the bank’s expected return is maximized at an “interior” loan interest rate, so that if loan demand exceeds loan supply at this rate, the bank will ration credit rather than raise the loan interest rate further.  

# Step 1  

Since at $t=1$ all uncertainty is resolved, we can view $10\%$ as the appropriate discount rate in determining whether or not to undertake the investment at $t=1$ . That is, $I_{1}$ will be made at $t=1$ if the value of the perpetuity at $t=1$ exceeds the investment outlay, that is, if and only if $\tilde{\gamma}_{\mathrm{s}}/0.10\geq I_{1},$ where $\tilde{\gamma}_{s}$ is the share of $\tilde{y}$ accruing to the borrower. Because $I_{1}=100,$ , we need $\tilde{y}_{\mathrm{s}}=10$ . If the investment is undertaken, then $\tilde{y}_{s}=\tilde{y}-$ interest on the $\$55$ loan. Note that the borrower follows this rule because at the time it has to make the investment (at $t=1$ ), it already has the money loaned by the bank, and hence treats it as its own retained earnings.  

Let $r$ be the actual annual interest payment on the risky bank loan (viewed at $t=0$ , $r$ is a random variable), assuming a perpetual loan with interest payable every period, beginning at $t=2$ . Let $r$ be the promised annual interest payment on any debt outstanding at $t=0$ , where $r$ is promised to begin at $t=2$ .  

Note that the bank loan is risky only when viewed at $t=0$ . As mentioned earlier, it becomes riskless at $t=1$ . At $t=1$ then, the value of the bank’s loan is the value of a riskless consol bond with an annual coupon equal to the interest payment the bank knows it will receive perpetually, that is, the value of the bank’s $\mathsf{l o a n}=\frac{\mathsf{i n t e r e s t}\mathsf{p a y m e n t}}{0.10}$ . For example, at $t=0$ the promised interest payment to the bank may be $\$17,$ , but at $t=0$ we do not know whether this promise can be kept. But suppose at $t=1$ , state 3 is realized. Then, if the firm adopts the project, the promise can be kept for sure, and the $t=1$ value of the loan is $\$17/0.10=9$ . Alternatively, if state 2 occurs, the promise will not be kept; the bank will receive only $\$16$ per year perpetually if the project is adopted. Thus, the time 1 value of the loan is $\$16/0.10=\$160$ .  

Step 2 Now the expected returns to Midtown with different loan interest payments (choice of investment made at $t=1$ ) are given in Table 8.4   
TABLE 8.4 Expected Returns to Bank   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Promised Loan Interest r</td><td>Minimal Level of y for Investment /, to be Made by Borrowing Firm's Shareholders</td><td>Probability (at t = 0) that Investment I Will be Made</td><td>Expected Interest Payment on Bank Loan (view at t = 0)</td></tr><tr><td>≤$5</td><td>$15</td><td>1.00</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>$6</td><td>16</td><td>0.95</td><td>$5.70</td></tr><tr><td>$7</td><td>17</td><td>0.90</td><td>6.30</td></tr><tr><td>$8</td><td>18</td><td>0.60</td><td>4.80</td></tr><tr><td>$9</td><td>19</td><td>0.20</td><td>1.80</td></tr><tr><td>$10</td><td>20</td><td>0.00</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

n this table, the fourth column is obtained by multiplying each promised payment in the first column by the corresponding probability in the third column. The numbers in the third column are obtained by examining the second column and Table 8.3 The smallest possible y! value in Table 8.3 is $\$15$ , so that the probability of observing a $\tilde{y}$ greater than or equal to $\$15$ is 1.00. Similarly, from Table 8.3 we see that the probability of obtaining a $\tilde{y}$ at least as great as $\$16$ is the probability that the state that will occur is either 2, 3, 4, or 5; this probability is 0.95. The rest of the numbers follow similarly.  

Step 3   
The above table shows that Midtown Community Bank’s expected return peaks at a promised loan interest of $\$7$ . Note that the present value of the bank loan at $\tilde{r}=\$7$ is $6.3/0.10=\$63$ , which exceeds the loan amount of $\$55$ ; hence, Midtown will be willing to lend. Thus, if the loan demand exceeds the loan supply at that rate, Midtown will be unwilling to extend more credit even if the borrower offers a higher interest rate. Credit rationing occurs here because of moral hazard. However, this moral hazard is a little different from that discussed earlier, wherein the borrower increased the bank’s default risk by switching to a risky project from a safe project. Here the borrower prefers not to invest in a project that would have enhanced the bank’s expected return; underinvestment is the problem here.  

# Bank Capital and Credit Rationing  

A bank’s capital position also may affect its decision to ration credit since different categories of loans have different capital requirements. Consider a bank that has the necessary deposits but would need to raise additional capital to satisfy a loan request. The additional cost of raising this capital, relative to that of raising money from other sources, will then be a charge against the bank’s profit from making the loan. If this additional cost is sufficiently high, the bank may prefer to invest the available deposits in marketable securities rather than in loans. Many allege that this is what happened in 1990–1992 and led to a credit crunch in the United States despite monetary policy initiatives aimed at reviving the economy.13  

Another reason why there may be a link between a bank’s capital and credit rationing is that there is a relationship between the bank’s capital and its incentive to monitor that we discussed in Chapter 3 14 A bank with insufficient capital may not monitor the borrower at a cost. Consequently, the economic value of a bank loan diminishes with a decrease in capital, and a bank with sufficiently low capital will view the default probability of the (unmonitored) loan as being so high that it does not view the loan as worth making.  

There is empirical evidence of (nonprice) quality credit rationing. For example, subprime mortgage borrowers cannot get mortgages without a sufficient equity input (down payment).15 Consistent with the theories,16 there is also evidence that when banks experience negative shocks to their capital positions, they tend to reduce their lending, which may be interpreted either as a reduced demand for bank loans or as banks simply lending less (possibly due to credit rationing that goes up when bank capital declines). In general, it is very difficult to tell whether reduced bank lending is due to supply or demand effects. However, some research has been able to separately identify supply effects.  

One such study took advantage of a “natural experiment” involving the U.S. branches of Japanese banks to identify the relationship between the shocks to bank capital and bank loan supply.17 During 1989–1992, the Japanese stock market declined precipitously. As a result, many Japanese banks found that their capital ratios dropped below the $8\%$ minimum required by Basel I. This, in turn, led the U.S. branches of these Japanese banks to reduce their lending. A $1\%$ decline in the capital ratio of the Japanese parent led to a $6\%$ decline in lending at the brank. Thus, this research shows that when banks experience a decrease in their capital ratios, they tend to cut back on their lending.18  

We have so far assumed that the bank and the borrower have a one-period relationship. As pointed out earlier, when the bank and the borrower contract with each other over many time periods, it is sometimes possible to reduce informational problems. Indeed, this is one reason to have long-term bank–borrower relationships.19  

# THE SPOT-LENDING DECISION  

We now turn to the bank’s lending decision in light of the possibility of credit rationing. To understand this, we should begin by noting that credit analysis, which is an integral part of the lending decision, is not a binary (0 or 1) process whereby the bank either conducts credit analysis or not. It should more appropriately be viewed as a continuum; the bank can perform credit analysis to varying degrees of detail.  

The more elaborate the analysis, the more costly it is for the bank. The point to note is that the degree of elaboration is a matter of choice for the bank and represents an important element of the spot-lending decision-making process.  

The bank must determine its spot-lending policy under uncertainty about both the quantity and the quality of loan demand, and within its own capacity constraints. These constraints include limits on screening and monitoring resources. Consequently, the bank may be unable to accommodate more than a predetermined level of aggregate lending without significantly sacrificing loan quality. Loan quality deterioration may imply an unacceptable elevation in the likelihood of ruin for the bank. This means that the first step in lending policy may be for the bank to establish an upper bound, say $\overline{{L}}$ , on the bank’s aggregate lending for a given period, say $(0,T)$ .20 Loan applicants arriving after the bank has reached its loan maximum are presumably rejected indiscriminately, and we refer to this phenomenon as rationing in the large. Before reaching its loan maximum, the bank does not ration indiscriminately. Rather, it recognizes applicant attributes and rejects only the less desirable. This phenomenon is referred to as rationing in the small 21 The decision to ration an applicant in the small is predicated on the outcome of the bank’s credit analysis and its lending prior to the applicant’s arrival, as we shall see subsequently.  

Consider now a bank that extends $\$1$ credit to each randomly arriving customer over a fixed planning period $(0,T)$ . If a loan applicant arrives at time $t$ where $0\leq t\leq T$ the bank conducts credit analysis to estimate the borrower’s repayment probability $\theta$ takes into account cumulative loans made to date, say $L_{t}.$ and the remaining time until the end of the bank’s planning horizon, $T-t.$ The bank’s spot-lending decision can be viewed as an optimal stopping problem, that is, the bank must decide when to stop conducting credit analysis and make a decision on whether to grant or deny credit to the applicant based on the available information. Figure 8.7 depicts this decision-making process in a flow chart format.  

It is worth noting that at each step, the bank is really making two decisions: (i) whether to acquire and/or process more information about the borrower at additional cost or stop the information acquisition/processing, and (ii) conditional on having decided not to process any more information, whether to extend credit or deny it. Note that these two decisions are made simultaneously at each step, rather than sequentially. Moreover, these decisions are affected by $L_{t}$ and $T-t.$ The larger the $L_{t}-$ the smaller is $\overline{{L}}-L_{t}-$ the more stringent will be the bank’s credit standard (i.e., the higher will the estimated $\theta$ have to be for the applicant to be granted credit), holding everything else constant. The bank becomes more selective because it has less money to allocate to applicants arriving after t  For similar reasons, the smaller is $T-t$ the more stringent is the bank’s credit standard, holding everything else constant. Another important observation is that the size of the flow chart (i.e., the number of steps) in Figure 8.7 is not predetermined. Rather, it depends on the information revealed by the credit analysis at each step, as well as $L_{t}$ and $T-t.$ Sometimes, the flow chart will have only one step. Based on a preliminary (and possibly cursory) examination of the borrower, the bank may decide to terminate the credit analysis process and either deny credit or grant it. We would expect this to happen in the case of borrowers who are very familiar to the bank either because of their previous credit history or because they belong to some group that contains members with similar default attributes that are relatively well known to the bank. For example, the bank may extend credit to IBM or deny credit to a highly leveraged firm in a risky industry without significant investment in credit analysis in either case. Thus, both intertemporal and cross-sectional reusability of credit information will affect the spot-lending decision flow chart. In addition to information about the borrower, $L_{t}$ and $T-t$ will also affect the size of the flow chart for reasons similar to those mentioned earlier. For example, if $L{-}L_{t}$ is large and $T-t$ is small, the flow chart may shrink in size as the bank eases its credit standards and grants loans based on favorable results from initial credit analysis.  

The amount of information possessed by the bank at the outset about the borrower also has other effects. The bank might charge the borrower a higher interest rate than the breakeven rate that could be charged given the bank’s information. This is because the bank has better information about the borrower than competing banks do, so it knows that its pricing policy will not cause the borrower to go to a competing lender. It is referred to as the hold-up problem.22 For example, suppose the information possessed by competing banks indicates that a borrower’s default probability is 0.08. Based on its own information, the incumbent bank knows that it is 0.065. Then the incumbent may charge the borrower a rate commensurate with a default-probability of 0.08, thereby earning a positive expected profit due to its informational advantage. We discuss this aspect of bank–customer relationships further in the next section.

FIGURE 8.7 Flow Chart of the Spot-Lending Decision.  

Note that the flow chart explains how the bank makes decisions regarding rationing in the small. Once $L_{\mathrm{}_{t}}=\overline{{L}}$ , all loan applicants are rationed in the large without any credit analysis.  

Some implications of this lending policy perspective are discussed as follows:  

An increase in $L$ will decrease aggregate rationing. This does not mean, however, that each loan applicant will necessarily face a reduced likelihood of rationing. The reason is that the bank will follow a less selective policy from the outset, so that the loans granted by time t will probably be larger. However, it is true that, holding $L_{t}$ fixed  the bank implements a more lax credit standard at time $t$ when a larger $L$ is chosen at the outset. The effect of $\overline{{L}}$ on the probability of a stockout – the bank exhausts its inventory of loanable funds – at time $t$ is ambiguous. This is because a higher $\bar{L}$ increases the lending capacity on the one hand and leads to more lax credit standards on the other. The first effect diminished the stockout probability and the second effect increases it.  

# LONG-TERM BANK–BORROWER RELATIONSHIPS  

In this section, we discuss some of the benefits of long-term banking relationships. This will build on our own discussion of relationship lending in Chapter 3  One benefit is that moral hazard may be reduced. The other is that private information problems can be dealt with more effectively because of information reusability. As we will illustrate in the ensuing discussion, this has potential implications for the design of loan contracts as well as for credit rationing.  

# Long-Term Relationships and Moral Hazard  

When a borrower knows that it may need to borrow in the future, it may limit actions in the current period which would impose losses on the bank. The borrower trades off the current benefits from exploiting the bank against the future costs of poorer credit terms or credit rationing due to these current actions. To see this, consider the following example given in the box below.  

# Example 8.4  

Consider a borrower, Kiddie Toys, Inc., that can choose between two projects, S and R. Project S yields $\$150$ with probability 0.8 and zero with probability 0.2, whereas project R yields $\$162$ with probability 0.5 and nothing with probability 0.5. The bank’s cost of funds is equal to the riskless interest rate of $5\%$ . As a banker, you cannot control your borrower’s project choice directly because you cannot observe this choice. You are restricted to making unsecured loans. Assume universal risk neutrality. Moreover, you can charge Kiddie Toys not more than 150 basis points above your breakeven interest rate or it will switch to another bank. Compute the expected payoffs to Kiddie Toys and the bank under the following scenarios: (i) the bank and the borrower can contract with each other over only one period, and (ii) the bank and the borrower can contract over two time periods. In case (i), Kiddie Toys will request a single loan of $\$100$ , and in case (ii), Kiddie Toys will need a sequence of two $\$100$ loans, with the ability to choose between S and R in each period.  

# Solution  

We proceed in four steps. First, we show that in scenario (i) the bank denies credit to Kiddie Toys at any interest rate because it fails to break even regardless of the project chosen by Kiddie Toys. Second, we consider scenario (ii) and show that, by contracting over two periods, it  s possible for the bank to induce Kiddie Toys to choose S in the second period. For a fixed second-period interest rate that guarantees S will be chosen in the second period, we solve for the maximum interest rate the bank can charge in the first period such that Kiddie Toys will choose S in that period, given that the bank will lend in the second period only if the first-period loan is repaid. Third, given the second-period interest rate in Step 2, we solve for the first-period interest rate needed to permit the bank to break even across its two-period horizon. Finally, in Step 4 we allow the bank to set its first-period interest rate 150 basis points above its breakeven interest rate. We check that Kiddie Toys will choose S in both periods and compute the expected profits of the bank and Kiddie Toys.  

# Step 1  

Consider case (i) first. Suppose the bank assumes that Kiddie Toys will choose project R. Then it must set the borrower’s repayment obligation at $\$105/0.5=9210$ in order to break even in expected value terms. Given this, Kiddie Toys chooses not to borrow. If the bank assumes that Kiddie Toys will choose S, then it must set its repayment obligation at $\$105/0.8=\$\$131.25$ (an interest rate of $31.25\%$ ) in order to break even, again in an expected value sense. However, at this interest rate, the expected payoff to Kiddie Toys from choosing S is $0.8(150-131.25)=\$15.00,$ , whereas from choosing R it is $0.5(162-131.25)=\S15.375$ . So the bank’s belief about the borrower’s project choice is contradicted, and it cannot be a Nash equilibrium for the bank to set the loan interest rate at $31.25\%$ . Indeed, the maximum interest rate, ${\boldsymbol{i}}_{\mathrm{max}},$ that the bank can charge such that Kiddie Toys does not strictly prefer R to S is given by the following equation:  

$$
0.8[150-(1+{i_{\operatorname*{max}}})100]=0.5[162-(1+{i_{\operatorname*{max}}})100].
$$  

Solving this equation yields $i_{\mathrm{max}}=30\%$ . However, at $30\%$ , the bank fails to break even, regardless of the project chosen by Kiddie Toys. Hence, no credit will be extended to the borrower at any interest rate, that is, we have an extreme form of credit rationing. The expected payoff to the bank as well as to the borrower is zero.  

# Step 2  

Now consider scenario (ii). Suppose that as a banker you tell Kiddie Toys: “I’ll give you a first-period loan of $\$100$ at an interest rate of $\dot{\mathsf{I}}_{1},$ and a second-period loan of $\$100$ at an interest rate of $\mathsf{i}_{2},$ conditional on your repaying the first-period loan. If you default on the first-period loan, then you will not get any second-period credit.”  

With such a contract, suppose we set $\dot{I}_{2}=30\%$ . Then we know that the borrower will choose S in the second period. Given this second-period loan interest rate, let $i^{*}\mathrm{_{max}}$ be the maximum value of $i_{1}$ such that Kiddie Toys will prefer to invest in S in the first period. Thus, $i^{*}\mathrm{_{max}}$ is the solution to the following equation.  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{0.8\{[150-(1+{i}_{\mathrm{max}}^{*})100]+0.8\times[150-130]\}}\\ &{=0.5\{[162-(1+{i}_{\mathrm{max}}^{*})100]+0.8\times[150-130]\}.}\end{array}
$$  

Note that in Equation  8.5), on the left-hand side we have written Kiddie Toys’ expected payoff over two periods from choosing S in the first period, given that S will be chosen in the second period. On the right-hand side, we have written Kiddie Toys’ expected payoff over two periods from choosing R in the first period, given that S will be chosen in the second period. In each case, we have recognized that second-period credit will be forthcoming only if the first-period project succeeds and the first-period bank loan is repaid; this is done by letting Kiddie Toys’ second-period payoff be zero if its first-period project fails and Kiddie Toys consequently defaults on the first-period loan. Solving Equation (8.5) yields $i_{\mathrm{max}}^{*}=46\%$ .  

# Step 3  

Given a second-period interest rate of $30\%$ , let $I_{1}$ be the first-period interest rate that the bank needs to charge to break even; remember that at $30\%,$ , the bank is making an expected loss on the second period loan. Now, $\hat{\dot{I}}_{1}$ is the solution to the following equation:  

$$
[0.8(1+\hat{i}_{1})\times100-105]+0.8[0.8\times130-105]=0
$$  

n Equation  8.6), the term $0.8(1+\hat{i}_{1})\times100-105$ is the bank’s expected profit on the first-period loan and $0.8\times130–105$ is its expected profit (which is negative) on the second-period loan. The latter is multiplied with 0.8 (the probability of repayment on the first-period loan) since the second-period loan is made only if the first-period loan is repaid. Solving Equation  8.6) gives $\hat{\boldsymbol{I}}_{1}=32.25\%$ . Note that now the bank is breaking even across two periods rather than in each period.  

# Step 4  

f we assume that on its two-period transaction, the bank can charge 150 basis points above its breakeven rate without losing Kiddie Toys to another bank, then $i_{1}$ will be set at $33.75\%$ (which is $32.25\%+1.5\%$ ). Kiddie Toys will now choose S in each period. The bank’s expected profit over its two-period relationship is given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{0.8(1+i_{1})\times100-105+0.8(0.8\times130-105)}\\ &{=0.8\times133.75-105+0.8(0.8\times130-105)}\\ &{=\S1.20.}\end{array}
$$  

The expected payoff to Kiddie Toys is given by  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{0.8(150-133.75)+0.8[0.8(150-130)]}\\ &{=\S25.08.}\end{array}
$$  

As this example illustrates, both the bank and the borrower are better off with a long-term relationship. We go from a situation in which no credit is extended in a single-period relationship to one in which the bank and the borrower negotiate a two-period contract that permits each party to earn a positive expected payoff. The intuition for this improvement is as follows. In the single-period case, it is impossible for the borrower to produce non-negative expected profit for the bank if it chooses project R, and it is impossible for the bank to induce the borrower to choose project S at an interest rate that permits the bank to break even, assuming that the borrower chooses S. So, no credit is extended. In the two-period case, the bank can commit to a second-period loan at a lower interest rate than it would take for to guarantee that the borrower will choose S in the second period. The bank can recoup this expected loss on the second-period loan by elevating the interest rate on the first-period loan appropriately. This high first-period interest rate will not induce the borrower to choose R in the first period because the borrower is promised a subsidized second-period loan only if it repays its first-period loan. This means that the borrower now perceives a greater cost to taking risk in the first period than it does in a one-period setting. This creates sufficient room for the desired first-period loan interest rate adjustment by the bank without risking a switch to project R by the borrower.  

To recapitulate, a multiperiod relationship with the borrower can mitigate moral hazard.23 It is less likely that the borrower will exploit the bank when it knows that it must deal with the same bank again. This creates an incentive for bank– borrower relationships.  

Three points are worth noting. First, it is important for the bank to offer the borrower a binding two-period contract. Since the bank anticipates a loss on its second-period loan, it would prefer not to extend this loan once the second period has arrived. Hence, it is important that a binding contract be negotiated at the outset. Second, as usual, the borrower is free to seek credit elsewhere after the first period. However, no bank will be willing to extend credit to the borrower in a one-period setting, and the incumbent bank is extending a subsidized second-period loan. Hence, the borrower will prefer to remain with the same bank for the second period. Finally, it is time consistent for the bank to deny the borrower second-period credit, conditional on first-period default, in accordance with the terms of the two-period contract. This is because the bank loses money if it lends in the second period, and will thus do so only if it is bound to do so.  

# Long-Term Relationships and Private Information  

One important advantage of a long-term relationship is that the bank learns about the borrower through time. This lessens the extent to which the borrower is privately informed relative to the bank, and hence improves credit allocations. In other words, the longer a borrower contracts with a bank, the better will be the credit terms it receives. As the borrower keeps repaying the bank, it keeps building an ever-improving track record that enables it to obtain better credit terms through time.24 We can see this with the following illustration.  

# Example 8.5  

Suppose The Midtown Community Bank is faced with two types of borrowers that it cannot distinguish, G and B. The type-G borrower wishes to borrow $\$100$ to invest in a single-period project that yields $\$135$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1 at the end of the period. The type-B borrower wishes to borrow the same amount in a project that yields $\$150$ with probability 0.4 and zero with probability 0.6 at the end of the period.25 If the borrower comes to the bank for a loan in the second period, it will be to finance exactly the same kind of project as in the first period. Assume that The Midtown Community Bank is perfectly competitive and there is universal risk neutrality. Compute the borrower’s interest rates on its first- and second-period loans. Midtown’s cost of funds is $5\%$ , the riskless rate. Assume that the bank’s prior belief is that there is $\mathtt{a}\ 0.8$ probability that the borrower is of type G and a 0.2 probability that it is of type B.  

# Solution  

The basic idea is to examine how the bank learns about the borrower through time and how this learning affects the terms of credit. We proceed in four steps. First, we solve for the first-period interest rate that is the same for all borrowers since Midtown cannot distinguish among borrowers. Second, we solve for the breakeven second-period interest rate, conditional on first-period project success and loan repayment by the borrower. Repayment of the first-period loan leads Midtown to revise upward its belief that the borrower is of type G. Hence, the second-period interest rate in this case is lower than the first-period interest rate. Third, we solve for the breakeven second-period interest rate, conditional on first-period project failure and default. This default leads Midtown to revise downward its belief that the borrower is of type B. This interest rate consequently turns out to be so high that no borrower wishes to take a second-period loan at that rate. Finally, in Step 4 we discuss how the first- and second-period rates might actually be determined by Midtown, and the effect of the relative bargaining powers of Midtown and the borrower on this rate.  

# Step 1  

Since The Midtown Community Bank is pooling these two types of borrowers, its breakeven loan interest rate in the first period will reflect the average success probability. Let the probability represent the bank’s prior belief that the borrower is of type G and let $p$ represent the success probability of a type G borrower. Also let $q$ represent the success probability of a type-B borrower. Then, the average success probability assessed by the bank is given by  

$$
\gamma p+(1-\gamma)q=0.8\times0.9+0.2\times0.4=0.8.
$$  

Hence, the first-period loan interest rate at which the bank breaks even is  

$$
(1.05/0.8)-1=0.3125\mathrm{or}31.25\%.
$$  

# Step 2  

Now, suppose the borrower repays his first-period loan. Then how should Midtown revise its beliefs about the borrower’s type? To answer this question, one needs to use Bayes rule, which, as we saw in Chapter 1, says that  

$$
\mathsf{P r}(x_{i}\mid\boldsymbol{y}_{i})=\frac{\mathsf{P r}(\boldsymbol{y}_{i}\mid\boldsymbol{x}_{i})\mathsf{P r}(\boldsymbol{x}_{i})}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathsf{P r}(\boldsymbol{y}_{i}\mid\boldsymbol{x}_{i})\mathsf{P r}(\boldsymbol{x}_{i})}
$$  

where $x_{1},...,x_{n}$ are the possible realizations of the random variable $x$ and $\mathsf{P r}(x_{i})$ is the prior probability that $x=x_{j\prime}$ with $X_{j}$ being some value chosen from $\displaystyle x_{1},...,x_{n}$ Similarly, $\gamma_{j}$ is some realization of $\gamma$ In our context, application of Bayes rule means that Pr(borrower is type G|project succeeds) $={\mathsf{P r}}(\mathbf{G}|\mathbf{S})$  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{=\frac{\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{S}|\mathrm{G})\mathsf{P r}(\mathrm{G})}{\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{S}|\mathrm{G})\mathsf{P r}(\mathrm{G})+\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{S}|\mathsf{B})\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{B})}}\\ &{=\frac{p\gamma}{p\gamma+q(1-\gamma)}.}\end{array}
$$  

Using Equation  8.8), we see that if there is repayment of the first-period loan, then the bank believes that the probability that the borrower is of type $\mathsf{G}$ is given by:  

$$
\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{G}|\mathsf{S})=\frac{0.9\times0.8}{0.9\times0.8+0.4\times0.2}
$$  

Hence, the average second-period success probability is given by:  

$$
0.9\times p+0.1\times q=0.9\times0.1+0.4=0.85.
$$  

The breakeven interest rate of the bank on the second-period loan, conditional on first-period success, is given by 1.05/ $0.85{-}1=23.53\%$ .  

Step 3   
Note that if there is nonrepayment of the first-period loan due to project failure, then Midtown assesses the probability of the bor  
rower being of type G as (in the equation below, $^{\prime\prime}{\sf F}^{\prime\prime}$ denotes failure)  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Pr}(G|\mathsf{F})=\frac{\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{F}|\mathsf{G})\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{G})}{\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{F}|\mathsf{G})\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{G})+\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{F}|\mathsf{B})\mathsf{P r}(\mathsf{B})}}\\ &{\qquad=\frac{(1-p)\gamma}{(1-p)\gamma+(1-q)(1-\gamma)}}\\ &{\qquad=\frac{0.1\times0.8}{0.1\times0.8+0.6\times0.2}}\\ &{\qquad=0.4.}\end{array}
$$  

The bank assesses the average success probability for this kind of borrower as  

$$
0.4\times p+0.6\times q=0.4\times0.9+0.6\times0.4=0.6.
$$  

Thus, the bank’s breakeven interest rate is $(1.05/0.6)–1=75\%$ . But at this rate, neither type would wish to borrow. This means that a borrower who defaults on his first-period loan is effectively denied second-period credit.  

# Step 4  

f the borrower’s first-period repayment behavior is freely observable by other banks, then the competitive Midtown Community Bank will charge interest rates of $31.25\%$ and $23.53\%$ on the first- and second-period loans, respectively. Thus, the loan interest rate declines through time for a borrower who repays his loans. At the other extreme, if competing banks are completely uninformed about the borrower’s repayment behavior, then Midtown could charge up to $31.25\%$ on the second-period loan and thus make a profit on its second-period loan. Anticipation of this profit could induce Midtown to compete by lowering its first-period loan interest rate below $31.25\%$ .26 Of course, this might strengthen the bargaining power of the borrower who repays his firstperiod loan. Having paid a lower than breakeven interest on its first-period loan, he knows that the bank need only charge $23.53\%$ on the second-period loan to break even on that loan. Of course, the borrower had agreed to pay more, but now that promise is “water under the bridge,” and (at some cost in terms of his reputation) the borrower could force Midtown to recontract. The interest rate on the second-period loan may end up somewhere between $23.53\%$ and $31.25\%,$ with the exact interest rate depending on the bargaining strengths of Midtown and the borrower.  

In practice, other competing banks do learn something about the borrower, but typically not as much as the incumbent bank. Therefore, through time an informational surplus is created in the bank–borrower relationship that could benefit both the incumbent bank and the borrower. Some have argued that this informational surplus could also be socially wasteful. The point is that the incumbent bank’s informational advantage could result in its extracting monopoly rents by charging excessively high loan interest rates. This means that the borrower’s share of its own project profit is diminished. The borrower’s marginal return to working hard to enhance project profits is thereby reduced, and the borrower curtails its effort input. Thus, projects pay off less on average.  

# LOAN RESTRUCTURING AND DEFAULT  

We have so far presented a simplified view of the default process: If the borrower has insufficient cash flow from its project, it defaults. However, as our discussion of bank–borrower relationships has indicated, there is gain from the relationship between the bank and the borrower. Thus, even if we ignore the legal and administrative costs of bankruptcy, the termination of the bank–borrower relationship through default (leading to bankruptcy) is usually costly. The costs to the borrower are transparent. But the bank suffers a cost as well, since a loan default diminishes bank capital. This means that the bank as well as the borrower would be interested in staving off default if possible. This is a major impetus for the widely observed restructuring of bank loans.  

There has been extensive research on the issue of default and renegotiation. The basic insights of this research are that the design of the debt contract has a lot to do with borrower’s incentive to default and the lender’s incentive to be willing to renegotiate. Moreover this research has also examined the conditions under which debt contract themselves are the efficient financial contract given the possibility of default and renegotiation.27  

# Types of Financial Distress  

Loan restructuring becomes necessary when the borrower is in financial distress. For expositional ease we will classify financial distress into three degrees of severity: mild, moderate, and severe.  

(a) Mild Financial Distress: Mild distress is a situation in which the borrower faces the prospect of temporarily insufficient cash flows to service its outstanding debt obligations, but the economic value of the firm comfortably exceeds its repayment obligations. Thus, the borrower faces a temporary cash flow shortfall, rather than insolvency. If forced, the firm could, at some cost, overcome its cash flow deficiency and meet its scheduled debt repayment. Examples are: delaying some investment plans, selling selected assets, or issuing new equity. However, such adjustments could diminish the firm’s economic value. A less costly alternative may be to approach the lenders with a request to restructure the firm’s debt. Lenders, such as banks, may be willing to accommodate such requests for two reasons. First, it signals flexibility on the bank’s part and thus improves its reputation in the credit market. Second, to the extent that such an accommodation minimizes borrower value dissipation, the bank may be better off in the long run. Indeed, it can claim for itself a part of the saving achieved by the debt restructuring.  

The usual approach to restructuring such loans stretches out the loan’s maturity and reduces current interest payments in exchange for an increase in future interest payments. We will discuss two cases of such loan restructurings.  

Case 1: Revlon:28 In 1986, Revlon was acquired by Ronald Perelman, a well-known corporate acquirer, and made a wholly owned subsidiary of Perelman’s MacAndrew and Forbes Holdings, Inc. This acquisition was a highly leveraged transaction (HLT), financed with loans from Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan, Citicorp, and Manufacturers Hanover. An HLT is a loan to a borrower whose debt-to-equity ratio is inordinately high relative to its peers. In particular, it is defined as financing for a buyout, acquisition, or recapitalization that pushes the borrower’s liabilities-to-assets ratio to more than $75\%$ , or a loan that doubles the company’s liabilities and its leverage ratio reaches $50\%$ . Revlon had a good record for meeting its financial obligations, and until 1989 it did not appear to be in any danger. However, two events resulted in a mild crisis. First, intense regulatory scrutiny of HLTs in 1990, combined with a deteriorating market for subordinated debt that banks used to augment their capital, caused Revlon’s lenders to rethink their position with regard to such loans. The banks decided that they did not want the Revlon loans on their books. They thus designed a refinancing package of four term loans totaling $\$1.25$ billion and a $\$550$ million revolving credit facility, and offered these for sale to other lenders. Second, even though Revlon had generally performed well since the Perelman acquisition, many were concerned about its future because of increased competition from Procter & Gamble Company, which had recently acquired Faberge and Elizabeth Arden.  

Moody’s Investors Service downgraded Revlon’s debt rating in January 1990 and noted that industry consolidation “could make maintenance of market shares more difficult and put additional pressure on cash flows.” These developments made Revlon’s potential creditors nervous.  

The refinancing package offered by the original four banks included loans with 4-year maturities, that is, they would come due in 1994. However, $\$365$ million in Revlon’s senior debt would mature in 1995, so banks that bought the refinancing package could find it difficult to help Revlon obtain refinancing in 1994 to repay the 4-year loans. Many potential creditors did not want to deal with a situation in which a subordinated tranche was paid off just before senior lenders were paid. There was additional concern about the refinancing of a $\$500$ million to $\$600$ million balloon (principal) payment that would need to be made in 1994.  

These difficulties led the four original banks to revise the terms of the deal they were offering to the market. These revisions took the form of structural and pricing adjustments. They were, however, not expected to affect the cost of the loan for Revlon. Rather, any changes in fees or pricing were expected to come out of the pockets of the four banks that underwrote the entire package and would be stuck with any portion of the loan they could not sell.  

This case illustrates some of the difficulties that banks face in restructuring a borrower’s debt even when the borrower is in relatively good financial condition. Indeed, Revlon even indicated that asset sales in the next few years were likely and that the resulting cash flows would provide the necessary cushion for complete debt service.  

Case 2: Zale Corporation:29 A Dallas-based jewelry retailer, Zale Corporation, was purchased by Peoples’ Jewelers Limited, Toronto, and Swiss-based Swarovski International Holdings AG in late 1986. As in the case of Revlon, the acquisition was financed with considerable debt, making it a HLT. The bank loans used to finance the acquisition were short term. In 1990, Zale was faced with the prospect of repaying these loans. In years past, these loans probably would have been rolled over, with Zale financing its repayment with a high-yield bond issue. However, disarray in the junk-bond market meant that this type of financing was out of the question. Since Zale was not in a position to repay its bank loans without significant impairment to its asset value, it preferred restructuring of its $\$300$ million in acquisition-related debt.  

Zale was provided with a restructured $\$300$ million loan commitment maturing in May 1993. This commitment involved unsecured loans, but with the banks being at the same level of seniority as much of the company’s high yield from its parents.  

Zale illustrates the kinds of steps that borrowers and banks are willing to take to avoid costly default and formal bankruptcy.  

(b) Moderate Financial Distress: This is a situation in which default is imminent without debt restructuring. Given the existing debt repayment obligations, the economic value of the firm’s assets is less than its repayment obligations. However, it is possible that if creditors agree to restructure the debt, the firm could produce sufficient future cash flows so that the economic value of the firm’s assets would exceed the value of restructured debt, which in turn would exceed the current value of the firm’s debt. In this case, the creditor’s forbearance is a bet on a change in the company’s fortunes. Thus, both the firm’s shareholders and its creditors could benefit from the restructuring. The following example illustrates this possibility.  

# Example 8.6  

Marvelous Computers, Inc. currently owes its creditors $\$120$ . It is run by an entrepreneur, Mr. Bill Doors, who could manage the firm for one period at a personal cost of $\$5$ . Mr. Doors has a unique ability to manage Marvelous Computers; under his stewardship the firm’s assets one period from now will be worth $\$125$ with probability 0.9 and $\$100$ with probability 0.1. Under any other management, the firm will be worth $\$90$ for sure, which is its current liquidation value. Assume that the riskless rate is zero and that there is universal risk neutrality. Analyze the possible strategies for the creditors.  

# Solution  

There are basically two strategies for the creditors, so that we solve this problem in two steps. First, we analyze what would happen if the creditors insisted on debt repayment on existing terms. Second, we analyze what would happen if the creditors agree to a restructuring that involves a reduction in Mr. Doors’ debt obligation. We find that reducing the face value of the debt increases its economic value to creditors. Hence, restructuring is the preferred strategy.  

# Step 1  

f creditors insist on debt repayment on existing terms, it is clear that Mr. Doors will prefer to default. This is because his payoff conditional on default is zero, whereas if he continues for one more period, his expected payoff is  

$$
0.9(125-120)+0.1(0)-5=-\upxi0.5,
$$  

given that the debt obligation must be settled first before ${\cal M}\mathfrak{r}$ . Doors collects anything. Since Mr. Doors’ equity in the firm is worth only $\$4.50$ and the personal cost to him of operating the firm is $\$5,$ he computes a payoff of $-\$0.50$ to managing Marvelous Computers for another period. The creditors’ payoff if Marvelous Computers defaults is the liquidation value of the firm, $\$90$ .  

# Step 2  

But now suppose creditors agree to a restructuring whereby the debt repayment obligation of Marvelous Computers is reduced to $\$123,456$ . Doors’ expected payoff from operating Marvelous Computers for another period is then  

$$
0.9(125-119)+0.1(0)-5=\S0.4,
$$  

compared to zero in default. Hence, the restructuring provides Mr. Doors with the incentive to continue to operate Marvelous Computers. The value of the debt (the expected payoff to creditors) now becomes  

$$
0.9\times119+0.1\times100=\$117.10.
$$  

Thus, by reducing the face value of debt by $\$1$ , creditors can  ncrease its economic value by $\$27.10!$  

We will now see a case of a company in moderate financial distress.  

Case 3: The Trump Organization: This company owned and operated a number of hotels (such as the Trump Plaza Hotel) and casinos (such as the Taj Mahal Hotel and Casino), and had over $\$2$ billion in debt in 1990. On Friday, June 15, 1990, the Trump organization failed to make a $\$30$ million interest payment to bondholders of Trump’s Castle Casino, leaving Mr. Trump 10 to 30 thirty days to avoid bankruptcy. Banks, which were major lenders, proposed to postpone some interest payments and provide additional debt financing to enable the Trump organization to avoid bankruptcy.  

The four major lenders were the banking units of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, and Manufacturers Hanover. However, there were over 100 additional banks with smaller loans to the Trump organization, and there were also bonds outstanding. The Trump organization’s crisis in June 1990, which led to the missed payment, necessitated negotiations between Mr. Trump and the four big banks. Although the banks were nervous about Trump’s cash situation, they probably viewed it as prudent not to force Trump property and sell it to repay the notes. The banks faced a dilemma. On the one hand, they wanted the Trump organization to conserve cash by missing some interest payments on the bank loans as well as on the bonds. On the other hand, they did not want the company to be forced into default by bondholders who could then force a liquidation to collect amounts owed to them. Bondholders had first liens on three of Mr. Trump’s properties through first mortgage bonds: the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Castle Funding, and Trump Plaza Funding.  

This was a classic situation in which default seemed imminent without debt restructuring, and yet it seemed to be in the interest of major lenders to forestall default. Indeed, at that time, most of the major lenders seemed confident that their loans to the Trump organization would be sound if default could be avoided.30 Not surprisingly, the eventual outcome of the negotiations between the Trump organization and its major lenders was that some 80 banks agreed on Tuesday, June 26, 1990, to lend the company an additional $\$65$ million to avoid bankruptcy. The banks also agreed to defer interest payments on $\$850$ million of their $\$2$ billion of outstanding loans.31  

(c) Severe Financial Distress: This is defined as a situation in which the borrower actually defaults on some debt obligation. A debt-restructuring plan may be worked out to preclude formal bankruptcy proceedings. In some cases, the borrower may actually announce its intention to file for reorganization under Chapter 11  and a subset of the lenders may agree to restructure the debt so that a portion of the debt can be repaid and a more efficient reorganization plan can be implemented than one that would be possible if all the lenders had to be accommodated. Such a reorganization plan may either be achieved outside of bankruptcy or during bankruptcy proceedings. There are numerous examples of companies that have announced bankruptcies during 2004–2005 but continued operating as they reorganized, such as many airlines (e.g., Northwest) as well as companies in the automotive industry (e.g., Delphi). We have already shown that avoiding formal bankruptcy may benefit both the lender and the borrower, but this may not always happen. We will now provide a simple example to show how it may be beneficial for some lenders to help the borrower pay off some of the debt in order to achieve a more efficient reorganization plan.  

# Example 8.7  

Consider Marvelous Computers managed by Mr. Bill Doors. The firm has two kinds of debt outstanding: senior debt under which it owes $\$100$ to bondholders, and a subordinated bank loan that requires a repayment of $\$1,000$ . The assets of Marvelous Computers have a current liquidation value of $\$200$ , but if the firm continues to operate, it will be worth $\$1,100$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1 one period hence. To manage the firm for an additional period, Mr. Doors incurs a personal cost of $\$5$ . Mr. Doors has declared that he wishes to file for bankruptcy and has contacted both the bank and the bondholders’ trustee. The bondholders wish to liquidate the firm immediately. What should the bank do? Assume universal risk neutrality and a risk-free interest rate of zero. Mr. Doors owns all of the firm’s equity.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in two steps. First, we compute the expected payoffs to all the concerned parties from continuation and liquidation. Second, we examine how the most efficient plan could be implemented. In this example, this is achieved by having the bank buy out the senior debt.  

Step 1 t is easy to see why the bondholders prefer immediate liquidation: since the liquidation value of Marvelous Computers is $\$200$ and they have seniority, they stand to collect $\$100$ , the full amount owed to them. On the other hand, with continuation they receive $\$100$ with probability 0.9 and nothing with probability 0.1, that is, the expected value of their claim is $\$90$ . From the bank’s perspective, however, the expected payoff is $0.9\times(1,100{-}100)=\S900$ if the firm is continued, and $\$100$ if the firm is liquidated immediately. Mr. Doors also prefers bankruptcy since as a shareholder he collects nothing if Marvelous Computers continues, but the personal cost of continuation is $\$5$ .  

# Step 2  

To ensure that the most efficient investment plan is chosen during bankruptcy, the bank can buy out the senior debt for $\$100$ . Moreover, the bank could agree to restructure the loan so that ${\cal M}{\sf r}$ . Doors owes only $\$1,090$ , instead of $\$1,100$ . Now, the continuation plan will be acceptable to all parties since Mr. Doors’ expected payoff is  

$$
0.9\times(1,100-1,090)-5=\S4,
$$  

he senior bondholders’ payoff is $\$100$ , and the bank’s expected payoff is  

$$
0.9\times1,090-100=\S881.
$$  

We will now discuss two cases of severe financial distress.  

Case 4: West Point Acquisition Company: This company was the vehicle for Mr. William Farley’s acquisition of a number of companies. On March 31, 1990, West Point Acquisition Company defaulted on the payment of $\$796$ million in principal and interest to a bank group led by Bankers Trust and Wells Fargo & Company. The loan was made to finance the acquisition of West Point-Pepperell, Inc. Earlier, Mr. Farley had obtained a 4-year extension of a separate $\$1$ billion bridge loan to West Point-Pepperell for operating purposes and this was also due on March 31.32 West Point-Pepperell also had $\$900$ million in outstanding junk bonds.  

The banks that loaned West Point Acquisition the money had anticipated the default and had been trying to reach an agreement about how to restructure the loan. It also was reported that the banks wanted to avoid bankruptcy proceedings, but wanted Mr. Farley to reach an agreement with the public holders of the West Point-Pepperell high-yield bonds. Mr. Farley had reportedly offered bondholders a significant equity stake in West Point-Pepperell in exchange for a postponement in interest payments on the debt for up to 3 years.  

Bankers Trust and Wells Fargo were also the lead banks on the $\$1$ billion bridge loan, although the composition of the bank group differed from that of the acquisition loan. Apart from the 4-year extension, the bridge loan was restructured with a $\$165$ million increase in the amount of credit and a reduction in the loan interest rate from prime plus $2.5\%$ to prime plus $1.5\%$ . This illustrates that lenders may be willing to reduce the actual repayment obligation to increase the expected payoff to them.  

Case 5: Ames Department Stores, Inc.: On Thursday, April 27, 1990, Ames Department Stores, Inc. announced that it had sought protection from its creditors in the federal bankruptcy court by filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.33 In 1988, Citibank led a bank group that provided $\$900$ million in financing for the purchase of the Zayre department store chain. Hurt by an industry downturn, Ames was in technical default on the $\$900$ million credit agreement and was trying to negotiate a second waiver from the Citibank-led group. Ames said that it filed under Chapter 11 after talks broke down. The basic problem for Ames was apparently the stoppage of shipments to Ames by suppliers who were concerned about the company’s cash flow crisis.  

At the time of bankruptcy, Ames said that Chemical Bank had agreed to provide it with $\$250$ million of debtor-inpossession (DIP) financing. The loan was to be used to repay vendors and fund operations while the company attempted to formulate a reorganization plan. The agreement on DIP financing between Ames and Chemical was, however, subject to court approval. Citibank was also reported to be interested in getting the business. In the box below, we provide further details on DIP financing.  

# Notes on Debtor-in-Possession [DIP] Financing34  

What exactly are DIP loans, and why have they grown so popular? We discuss these issues here.  

Firms filing for bankruptcy often face even greater pressures after filing for protection under the bankruptcy laws. These pressures stemmed from suppliers and customers shunning the bankrupt firm because of liquidity concerns. To overcome these difficulties, the 1978 Federal Bankruptcy Code set unified standards for how a debtor could obtain new working capital so that vendors, suppliers, and customers would continue with the company during bankruptcy. The debtor company is protected by freezing both its assets and its liabilities, including working capital bank lines. In place of the corporation, a new legal entity – the debtor-in-possession – is created. The 1978 Bankruptcy Code provides incentives for lenders to make new debt financing available to the bankrupt firm. It does so by providing a “super priority” lien that gives such a lender a very senior claim on the borrower’s cash flow. This claim stands just behind normal administrative expenses but before existing credits, including senior debt. The lien also provides for the loan to mature or be repaid before the debtor emerges from bankruptcy. Some of the key features of DIP loans are as follows: 1. The DIP lender has claim to any assets not already backing other credits. If assets are insufficient to cover the DIP lender’s claim, the DIP lender can make a prior claim on assets already pledged to existing creditors and use them as collateral for the new loan. 2. Most DIP loans are made as part of loan commitments. Commitment fees range from $2.5\%$ to $4\%$ of the line and loan interest rates from $1.5\%$ to $2.5\%$ over prime. In addition, there are usually syndication fees. 3. Even if the debtor is forced to liquidate while in bankruptcy, the DIP lender is the first to be repaid. DIP financing is said to have originated in 1984 when Chemical Bank set up a unit to market DIP financing as a new product. The operation began to blossom in 1987 when Texaco, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 protection after losing a $\$10$ billion lawsuit to Pennzoil Company, and turned to Chemical with a $\$2$ billion DIP loan request that was eventually scaled back to $\$750$ million. Since its inception, the market for DIP lending has become fiercely competitive, but it can also be quite profitable for banks.35 The United States Supreme Court, in its 2004 decision in Till v. SCS Credit Corporation, 1245. Ct. 1951, noted the existence of a free market for lenders advertising financing for Chapter 11 debtors-in-possession. The statutory framework governing DIP loans is Section 364 of Title 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  

This case illustrates how lenders may be willing to provide additional financing to a borrower unable to repay its existing debt. The reason is as follows. Often a company’s cash flow can be impaired by perceptions on the part of its customers, supplier, and possibly creditors that it is in financial distress. In Ames’ case, business was disrupted because suppliers stopped shipments. In such cases, it may pay for a bank to either restructure or to infuse additional credit to help the borrower overcome its liquidity shortfall even after the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.  

# The Coordination Problem in Creditor Coalitions  

We have shown how debt restructuring can benefit both the lender and a borrower in financial distress. In most cases, however, the borrower either has borrowed from many lenders or the original lender has sold some pieces of the loan to others. As a result, most debt-restructuring plans involve coalitions of lenders. This often creates coordination problems. It is difficult to ensure that a restructuring plan will be accepted by all creditors, because creditors often have divergent interests. In Example 8.7, we saw how disagreement between two creditors often blocks a restructuring. In that example, it was possible to resolve the conflict by having the junior debt claimant (the bank) buy out the senior debt claimant (the bondholders). However, in practice, efficient resolutions are not always that easy, as the following discussion illustrates.  

In the Trump organization case discussed earlier, there were approximately 100 banks involved. Some were “participants” – banks without direct relationships with the Trump organization. These banks had purchased loans from the original lenders, referred to as “assignees.” When a debt-restructuring plan has to be voted on, the assignees cannot vote until they go back and convince the participants. In the Trump case, this persuasion process was protracted and difficult. Many participants apparently asked to be bought out by the assignees. However, the assignees feared that “everyone would want out.”36 And in many cases, “letting a participant out” may be tantamount to providing a free put option. This is illustrated in the following example.  

# Example 8.8  

Having survived earlier travails, Marvelous Computers finds itself in trouble again. It now has three types of debt: a bank loan with the highest priority, senior debt owned by bondholders with the next highest priority, and junior debt owned by bondholders with the lowest priority. The repayment obligations of Marvelous Computers one period hence include the bank loan of $\$250$ , senior bonds of $\$45,$ and junior bonds of $\$45$ . Mr. Doors has announced his intention to declare Marvelous Computers bankrupt. At this stage, creditors must choose one of two mutually exclusive restructuring plans: plan A under which the value of Marvelous Computers next period will be $\$290$ with probability 0.6 and $\$125$ with probability 0.4, or plan B under which the value of Marvelous Computers next period will be $\$340$ with probability $1/3$ and $\$25$ with probability 2/3. If you are the bank’s representative, which plan would you prefer and what sort of coordination problems would you expect? Assume universal risk neutrality and a zero discount rate.  

# Solution  

We proceed in two steps. First, we calculate the expected payoffs to the various parties from the different plans under the assumption that the absolute priority rule will be strictly observed. Second, we examine the bank’s strategies with respect to securing the compliance of junior bondholders to the adoption of the plan preferred by the bank, and discuss the coordination problems that may be encountered.  

# Step 1  

We can readily compute the expected payoffs to the various parties under the assumption that absolute priority rules will be strictly observed. These expected payoffs are given below.  

To understand how these expected payoffs are determined, consider for example the bank’s expected payoff under Plan A. With probability 0.6, it is repaid in full $(\$250)$ and with probability 0.4, it receives $\$125$ ; the expected value is $0.6\times250+0.4\times125=\S200$ (Table 8.5 .  

TABLE 8.5 Expected Payoffs to Different Claimants   


<html><body><table><tr><td>Claimant</td><td>Expected Payoff under Plan A</td><td>Expected Payoff under Plan B</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loan</td><td>$200</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td>Senior bonds</td><td>$24</td><td>$15</td></tr><tr><td>Junior bonds</td><td>0</td><td>$15</td></tr><tr><td>Equity (Mr. Doors)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>  

# Step 2  

Clearly, your bank prefers plan A. Senior bondholders also prefer plan A. However, junior bondholders prefer plan B and will have to be bought out to secure their compliance. Unfortunately for your bank, they may insist on being bought out at par rather than at the economic value of their bonds. In this case, your bank and the senior bondholders must pay them $\$45$ . In essence, you have given them a free put option with an exercise price of $\$45$ ! Your bank may find it optimal to pay the $\$45$ since it still leaves you with a net expected payoff of $\$155$ , which exceeds your expected payoff from plan B. Worse still for your bank, however, senior bondholders may attempt to “free ride” and insist that you buy them out in order to implement plan A. Even though they lose $\$9$ with plan B relative to plan A, they may figure that you have even more to lose with plan B. If your bank buys them out at $\$45$ , then they too have been given a free put option. The senior bondholders recognize that even if you buy them out, your net expected payoff with plan A is $\$123,456$ , which exceeds that from plan B.  

# Renegotiation of Debt Contracts and the Borrower’s Choice of Financing Source  

We have seen how important renegotiating debt contracts can be to firms in financial difficulty. Moreover, given potential coordination problems in lender coalitions, the degree of renegotiability of debt covenants and other contract features will depend on how many creditors there are and who these creditors happen to be. Debt placed privately with a small number of large investors or a single bank loan may be much easier to renegotiate than public debt. Indeed, widely dispersed debt can significantly raise the costs of renegotiation.37 This suggests that the borrower should take into account the possibility of future renegotiation of contract terms in choosing its source of credit.38  

It has been shown that the value of the option to renegotiate debt contracts – the difference in the borrower’s net expected profit under a contract when renegotiation is possible and when it is impossible – is high when the firm’s ex ante creditworthiness is low. The intuition is that agency problems between shareholders and creditors are likely to be more severe among less creditworthy firms, so that the initial debt covenants to restrict the firm’s actions are likely to be relatively restrictive.39 While restrictive covenants control agency problems, they also reduce the firm’s flexibility to pursue profitable investments. Consequently, the importance of renegotiation is elevated for such a firm. This implies that firms with low credit ratings are more likely to negotiate debt contracts with more stringent covenants, but with creditors who are more likely to relax these covenants selectively when they seem inefficient in light of new information. Thus, we would expect firms with poorer credit ratings to take bank loans of privately placed debt and to also accept harsher covenants.  

# Alternative Intermediation Opportunities Created by Financial Distress  

One of the reasons why banks might wish to divest loans involving firms in financial distress is that such loans may be classified as risky or nonperforming and thus require more bank capital. Banks may sell these loans to other (possibly nonbank) financial intermediaries that operate under less stringent constraints. An opportunity for financial intermediation is thus created as assets are brokered to those who can hold them more efficiently.  

Observe that in these structural distress situations the traditional intermediation role of banks has little value. Continuation is unlikely. The objective is no longer to engage in relationship banking, but rather to maximize the collection on the outstanding distressed debt. This is a more brutal activity that other types of intermediaries may specialize in. Indeed, sometimes, so-called vulture funds are established which invest in the debt of financially troubled companies to play precisely this role.  

# CONCLUSION  

This chapter has focused on a variety of issues related to loan pricing, credit rationing, bank–customer relationships, and loan default and restructuring. In an environment in which information “decays” rapidly and new information arrives almost continuously, flexibility is important. Being able to renegotiate covenants and other contractual parameters in debt contracts in light of new information becomes essential. Such renegotiation can add value for both the creditor and the borrower.  

Banks have an inherent advantage over capital market financing when it comes to loan workouts and renegotiation of debt contracts. This advantage derives from the bank’s position as a “monolithic” lender, whereas capital market financing typically involves many disparate bondholders whose behavior is difficult to coordinate; coordination among creditors is vital to the success of any renegotiation effort. Thus, borrowers who find the option to renegotiate their debt contracts valuable are likely to gravitate to banks for credit. In an intensely competitive environment in which borrower-specific information is volatile, banks would do well to capitalize on their comparative advantage by negotiating restrictive covenants to control agency problems, but also remain flexible enough to accommodate postlending renegotiations of these covenants.  

# CASE STUDY: ZEUS STEEL, INC.40  

Robert Feldon started Zeus Steel, Inc. in December of 1993. He had been a salesman for a large steel fabricator, Seminole Steel Company, prior to forming his own steel fabricating operation. In Mr. Feldon’s opinion, Zeus Steel occupies a special position in the local market. Zeus buys “secondary” steel that has been rejected as top grade or “prime” by the steel mills because it is flawed in some way. Because of his long relationship with several suppliers, Mr. Feldon has been very successful in purchasing secondary steel at as much as $33\%$ under the going rate for prime steel. Zeus’ customers have no objection to using secondary steel either because Zeus removes the flaws (flattens the steel) or because the flaws are only cosmetic (small amounts of rust). The company’s primary sources of supply are steel mills, insurance companies (who sell damaged steel that they have insured during ocean shipment), and steel brokers. Often the most difficult time for Zeus is when the steel market is strong and secondary steel becomes very difficult to obtain at a discount. As a fabricator, Zeus buys the raw steel and cuts it to order into smaller strips with one of its 10 shearing machines.  

Feldon started Zeus with $\$150,000$ of his own money. He purchased a 35-year-old 30,000-square-foot building (with a new overhead crane) for $\$60,000$ in cash plus $\$240,000$ to be paid over a 10-year period $\$2,000$ per month plus interest at $8\%$ ); he bought at auction 10 used shearing machines for $\$100,000$ , of which he borrowed $\$50,000$ from the First National Bank (FNB). The remainder of his investment plus a $\$50,000$ line of credit from FNB was used for working capital.  

Robert Feldon, who still owns $100\%$ of Zeus Steel, has reached a critical juncture in his relationship with the First National Bank. Phillip Reiling, his old loan officer, has just taken a position at another bank, while his new loan officer, Mike Dickens (MD), has been a commercial loan officer for only 6 months (since his promotion from the credit department). These excerpts from the “credit memoranda” portion of Zeus’ credit file reveal the tenuous nature of the banking relationship:  

# Credit Memoranda  

# 1/30/99 MD  

I visited Zeus Steel and met Robert Feldon for the first time. Feldon informed me that he was not at all pleased with his relationship with FNB. According to Feldon, Phillip Reiling had been a good friend but was not always responsive to Zeus’ banking requirements. Feldon had warned Reiling of Zeus’ credit needs many months ago, but nevertheless the $\$200,000$ increase in the line of credit approved last November was treated as a last-minute “crisis.” Feldon emphasized that the current $\$500,000$ limit on the line of credit was “strangling” Zeus.  

I was given a tour of the plant and was impressed with the level of activity. It seemed as though every square inch of space was being used, much of it to store raw steel. Feldon was quite proud of the fact that he had been able to buy $\$300,000$ of “water logged” coil last month at a bargain rate of $\$11$ a pound; he apparently already has orders for more than half of that steel.  

I told Feldon we’d be more than glad to consider an increase in the Zeus line of credit upon receipt of the 12-31-98 financial statements. Feldon indicated that statements would show an even better year than 1997.  

2/26/99 MD  

Received urgent phone call from Bob Feldon who indicated that he was about to purchase three new machines for $\$200,000$ . He wants FNB to finance the equipment. I suggested lunch on Friday. Feldon agreed to bring an accounts receivable and an accounts payable aging, year-end statements, and a new personal statement. Ken Heyden, Bob’s accountant, will join us for lunch.  

2/28/99 MD  

Received a new Dunn & Bradstreet report that revealed some slowness in the trade. Earlier D&B’s showed Zeus paying its bill either “discount” or “prompt.”  

3/2/99 MD  

Entertained Bob Feldon for lunch to discuss his request for an increase in the Zeus line and also equipment financing. Also present at the lunch were Ken Heyden and John Garner, head of FNB’s Metropolitan Division. Feldon was quite pleased with Zeus’ 1998 performance. Much of the increase in sales was due to the acquisition of two new accounts, Archer Manufacturing and Hiawatha Motor Homes. Archer manufactures industrial tool boxes and related accessories that it sells primarily to the construction industry. Hiawatha is in the recreational vehicle business (also a manufacturer). In both cases it was understood that in order to obtain the business, Zeus would have to carry its receivables 60–75 days during peak season.  

In looking at the statements, we pointed out that it looked as though Zeus was slow in the trade (accounts payable of $\$1,225,000$ . Feldon emphasized that with a larger line of credit, Zeus could return to payable its bills in 45 days. Ken Heyden pointed out that his projections indicated that a $\$750,000$ line of credit would be appropriate.  

We asked Feldon about the decrease in profit during 1998 and he responded that he just took more out in salary and that his inventory was “understated” for tax purposes. When we expressed concern over the high salary, he said defensively: “You’ve got my personal guarantee, don’t you?”  

Feldon reiterated the urgency of his request. The new shearing machines (two 48-inch and one 60-inch) were critical to servicing the two new accounts. We mentioned that we would probably require that the line be secured by accounts receivable and inventory and that FNB normally requires audited financial statements (to which Feldon only half-jokingly responded. “Ken will charge me another $\$10,000$ for that!”). It appeared that relations were strained.  

3/6/99 MD  

Contracted three of Zeus’ suppliers to check credit. Youngstown and Inland Steel reported that Zeus had been a longtime customer with a good credit experience. Seminole reported that it feels very confident about Feldon but they had experienced slowness up to 60–75 days in the Zeus account.  

3/7/99 MD Balance in the Zeus accounts for 1998 were: Average Collected Balance – $\$55,000$ Average Fee Balance – $\$17,000$  

The following meeting took place between John Garner and Dickens on Friday, March 6, 1999, in Garner’s office.  

Garner: Mike, I’m concerned about Zeus Steel. I know Feldon was irritable and a bit defensive with us last week; but I think he has a right to be. Frankly, this account suffered from neglect under Reiling who took Zeus for granted, keeping Feldon happy with a low interest rate. We might not be able to do everything the way Bob wants, but I believe an honest effort on our part will save the account. After all, there aren’t many companies that have grown as dramatically as Zeus. Plus, I’ve got a lot of respect for Ken Heyden and all the business he’s sent our way.  

Dickens: A couple of things concern me though. Feldon has taken a lot of money out of Zeus in salary, which has resulted in undercapitalization. With the additional debt he’s asking for, I think the ratios will look quite different. I’m also concerned about the company’s rapid expansion – I think it may have been at the expense of a sound financial statement.  

Garner: We could always bring in a finance company to take the accounts receivable and the inventory as collateral. We could then participate in their line of credit and make the equipment loans ourselves. However, as you know, this is an expensive option for Feldon – the rate on the line will probably jump to $4\%$ over prime even with a $50\%$ participation on our part. But honestly, I think there are better solutions that are less likely to lose the Zeus business. Zeus has a good profit record and still has a very respectable debt/net worth ratio compared to many of our other local borrowers.  

Dickens: We’ve got to act fast – Feldon needs an answer by Monday and I know he’s also talking to Midtown Bank.  

Garner: As I see it, our options are: (1) increase the line of credit short of $\$750,000$ on an unsecured basis and approve the equipment loans in accordance with FNB loan policy ( $75\%$ of the purchase price and amortized over three years); (2) approve the full $\$750,000$ , but take the A/R and inventory as collateral;41 (3) approve the equipment loan but get a commercial finance company to do the lien of credit (and buy a participation in that line).  

Mike, the choice is yours. You present to the loan committee on Monday morning what you feel is our best offer. If you come up with some other alternative, that’s great. All I ask is that you provide the loan committee with a detailed financial analysis in support of your recommendation.  

Question: Can you help out Mike Dickens with a financial analysis of Zeus and prepare a recommendation for how the bank should proceed?

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. Suppose a firm has no assets at $t=0$ , except an option to acquire an investment opportunity at $t=1$ for $\$500$ million. The outlay required for this investment will be raised entirely through a bank loan. There are no taxes and everybody is risk neutral. The investment opportunity, if undertaken, will yield a payoff of $\$1$ per year perpetually, beginning at $t=2$ . However, what $X$ will be is not known now. This knowledge will become available only at $t=1$ . Right now, we can only describe the possible values of $X$ (at $t=1$ ) by the following probability distribution.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>State</td><td>Probability</td><td>X in millions of dollars</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.05</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>0.10</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>0.15</td><td>180</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>0.20</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>0.25</td><td>210</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>0.25</td><td>220</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">ABC, Inc.</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The riskless rate (single-period) is $10\%$ . Draw a graph that shows the relationship between the current market value of a perpetual (risky) bank loan for this form and the promised interest rate on this loan, which must be paid every year forever, and begins at $t=2$ .  

2. What is credit rationing? Why would it ever be rational for a profit-maximizing bank to ration credit?  

3. What are the three main types of financial distress? Why would lenders be willing to restructure debt when the borrower is experiencing mild financial distress? What kinds of accommodations are lenders usually willing to make?  

. What sort of restructuring are lenders willing to engage in when the firm is experiencing moderate financial distress and why?  

What sort of incentives do lenders have to restructure debt when there is severe financial distress and why?  

What is a “bridge loan” and how is it related to “merchant banking”?  

7. What is DIP financing and why might it be advantageous to existing creditors?  

scuss the kinds of coordination problems that can come up in loan workouts and how they might be solved.  

9. You are a banker and are confronted with a pool of loan applicants, each of whom can be either low risk or high risk. There are 600 low-risk applicants and 400 high-risk applicants and each applicant is applying for a $\$100$ loan. A low-risk borrower will invest the $\$100$ loan in a project that will yield $\$150$ with probability 0.8 and nothing with probability 0.2 one period hence. A high-risk borrower will invest the $\$100$ loan in a project that will yield $\$155$ with probability 0.7 and nothing with probability 0.3 one period hence. You know that $60\%$ of the applicant pool is low risk and $40\%$ is high risk, but you cannot tell whether a specific borrower is low risk or high risk. You are a monopolist banker and have $\$50,000$ available to lend. Everybody is risk neutral. The current riskless rate is $8\%$ . Each borrower must be allowed to retain a profit of at least $\$5$ in the successful state in order to be induced to apply for a bank loan. You have just learned that 1,000 loan applications have been received after you announced a $45\%$ loan interest rate. You can satisfy only 500. What should be your optimal (profit-maximizing) loan interest rate? Should it be $45\%$ (at which you must ration half the loan applicants) or a higher interest rate at which there is no rationing?  

10. Imagine this is January 1, 2002. You are head of the loan department at the High Growth Bank of Los Angeles. Mr. Alex Walker, the founder and CEO of ABC, Inc., a small manufacturing firm, comes to you with a request for a loan that his company will need no later than March 1, 2002. He has indicated that the company will repay the loan February 28, 2003, with principal and interest. ABC’s balance sheet and income statement are given below.  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">ABC, Inc.

In addition to the above information, you have the following ratios, which are averages of the industry to which ABC belongs.  

<html><body><table><tr><td>Currentratio</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Inventory turnover ratio</td><td>10.0</td></tr><tr><td>Average collection ratio</td><td>25 days</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed-asset turnover ratio</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Debtratio</td><td>30%</td></tr></table></body></html>  

An important consideration in this loan request is whether or not ABC can internally generate the funds needed to repay the loan by conforming more closely to industry averages. The loan request is for $\$650,000$ . You have not determined the loan interest rate yet, but the current annual borrowing rate for this customer is $10\%$ . Your expectation is that ABC’s borrowing rate over the next few months will stay at about $10\%$ . Should you make this loan? If you decide to make the loan, present a qualitative analysis of this loan request and make a summary statement of the necessary loan covenants. There should be at least one affirmative covenant, one negative covenant, and one restrictive clause. You are required to present a brief summary of additional information that could have improved your analysis. (Be specific.)  

11. Consider a borrower that can choose between two projects, S and R, each of which will pay off a random amount one period hence. Project S will yield $\$250$ with probability 0.9 and zero with probability 0.1 one period hence. Project R will yield $\$350$ with probability 0.4 and nothing with probability 0.6 one period hence. The bank’s cost of funds is equal to the riskless interest rate of $10\%$ . As a banker, you cannot control your borrower’s project choice directly because you assume universal risk neutrality. Moreover, you can charge this borrower 200 basis points above your breakeven interest rate before the borrower switches to another bank. Compute the expected payoffs of the borrower and the bank under the following two scenarios: (i) the bank and the borrower can contract with each other over only one period and the borrower will request a single loan of $\$150$ , and (ii) the borrower will need a sequence of two $\$150$ loans, with the ability to choose between S and R in each period. What should be the choice of the contracting horizon?  

12. Consider a firm managed by an entrepreneur. The firm has two kinds of debt outstanding: senior debt under which it owes $\$150$ to bondholders, and a subordinated bank loan that requires a repayment of $\$1,250$ . The firm’s assets have a current liquidation value of $\$400$ , but if the firm continues to operate, it will be worth $\$1,400$ with probability 0.8 and zero with probability 0.2 one period hence. To manage the firm for an additional period, the entrepreneur incurs a personal cost of $\$25$ . The entrepreneur has declared that he wishes to file for bankruptcy and has contacted both the bank and the bondholder’s trustee. The bondholders wish to liquidate the firm immediately. What should the bank do? Assume universal risk neutrality and a risk-free (discount) rate of zero. The entrepreneur owns all of the firm’s equity.  

13. Consider a firm that has three types of debt: a bank loan with the highest priority, senior debt owned by bondholders with the next highest priority, and junior debt owned by bondholders with the lowest priority. The firm’s repayment obligations one period hence include the bank loan of $\$150$ , senior bonds of $\$60$ , and junior bonds of $\$50$ . The firm has announced its intention to declare bankruptcy. At this stage, creditors must choose one of two mutually exclusive restructuring plans: plan A under which the value of the firm next period will be $\$180$ with probability 0.5 and zero with probability 0.5, and plan B under which the value of the firm next period will be $\$260$ with probability 0.4 and $\$20$ with probability 0.6. If you are the bank’s representative, which plan would you prefer and what sort of coordination problems would you expect? How would you attempt to overcome these problems? Assume universal risk neutrality and a zero discount rate.  

14. The following is an excerpt from a conversation. Critique it.  

Appleton: If banks don’t do it, someone else will. Butterworth: I’m sure that’s true, but the question is one of comparative advantage and deadweight losses, that is, reinventing the wheel. For instance, take the example of DIP (Debtor-in-Possession) financing. There’s nothing in the law that says only banks can provide it but banks are the biggest players in that market. It’s not a mere coincidence. Moderator: I guess it’s not surprising that the DIP financing market has grown so much, given the debt binge of American corporations in the last decade. I personally find the whole debt-restructuring process, and particularly the role of banks in it, quite fascinating. But I do find it ironic that banks are engaged in this at a time when borrowers are complaining about credit rationing by banks. Appleton: I think this concern with credit rationing is overdone. First of all, I don’t really believe banks ration credit, and if they did, it would be irrational. I’m not in the habit of worrying about why someone may want to smoke a $\$5$ bill! Moreover, a borrower who is rational could always go elsewhere. But honestly, I have yet to see a convincing study that shows that banks ration credit. Moderator: Come now, Alex! Do we need a convincing empirical study substantiating every little truth? Butterworth: Please don’t answer that, Alex. The fact of the matter is that it is possible to explain credit rationing as a rational practice. And this view that a rationed borrower can go “somewhere else” is not surprising coming from you Alex, since you don’t believe banks are special anyway. 15. Describe the bank’s spot-lending process, with particular emphasis on the roles of information-processing-capacity constraints and randomness in loan demand.
