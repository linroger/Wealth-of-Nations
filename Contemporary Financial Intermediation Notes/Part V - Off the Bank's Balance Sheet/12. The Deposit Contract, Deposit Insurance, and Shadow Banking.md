# GLOSSARY OF TERMS  

GNMA Government National Mortgage Association (see Chapter 7).   
FNMA Federal National Mortgage Association (see Chapter 7).   
FHLMC Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or “Freddie Mac” (see Chapter 7).   
FHA Federal Housing Administration is a federal agency within the HUD Department. The FHA makes no loans, but it operates a variety of loan insurance and subsidy programs designed for low-income housing to help stabilize that segment of the home mortgage market.   
Implicit Contract A term used in economics to designate an implicit understanding between parties about future behavior. There is no explicit contract, nor is the promise necessarily legally binding.   
GMAC General Motors Acceptance Corporation is a finance company that is a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation.   
BB, A-1 Ratings Ratings given to bonds by private agencies that specialize in evaluating credit risks. Companies usually pay these agencies to have their bonds rated. The ratings are then publicized and have an impact on the yield of the rated bonds. Generally, the higher the alphabet, the poorer the credit risk, that is, an A rating is better than a B rating, and an AA rating is better than an A rating.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Banking used to be a simple business. A bank borrowed money and loaned to others at a spread over cost. The borrowing and lending activities were reflected on the bank’s balance sheet.1 But now banks are as likely to do this business “off-balance sheet” as “on.” Chapter 10 discussed some off-balance sheet activities of banks, including loan commitments. We continue that discussion with an examination of securitization and loan sales.  

Let us start with a loan commitment. When a bank provides (“sells”) a loan commitment, it needs to provide funding only if the customer exercises the commitment. If a “takedown” occurs, the loan appears on the balance sheet. But the bank can avoid funding, even at this stage, by selling the loan to another bank (a loan sale) or by securitizing it. Securitization involves combining the loan with others of similar characteristics, creating credit-enhanced claims against the cash flows of this portfolio, and then selling these claims to investors.2  

The practice of loan sales by banks, which we covered in Chapter 9  is quite old; it goes all the way back to 1880. Securitization, by contrast, is more recent, dating back to 1970 when the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae,” or GNMA) developed the GNMA pass-through, a mortgage-backed security collateralized by Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA) single-family mortgage loans. Thus, the S&L industry has been involved in securitization for over 40 years. Banks, on the other hand, are relative newcomers to this market. Although in 1977 Bank of America issued the first private-sector pass-through, which was backed by conventional mortgages, the securitizing of various types of bank loans did not begin until 1985. But the evolution has been rapid in the U.S., collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) were flourishing by 2018 as securitization products that were providing low-cost funding for a variety of borrowers.  

Securitization is of growing importance in the U.S. economy. As of April 2011, the amount of securitized assets had risen to $\$11$ trillion, an amount that exceeded all marketable U.S. Treasury securities.3 The European volume is approximately $20{-}25\%$ of that in the United States, but showed a much higher growth rate before the 2007–2009 financial crisis; see Figure 11.1  which also shows the volume of securitization relative to GDP. The growth of securitization in Europe has been impeded by fragmented regulatory initiatives, and above all by a regulatory backlash following the 2007–09 crisis.

The Canadian securitization markets have been slow to recover after the 2007–09 crisis as well. However, China, Australia and Japan have seen robust growth.  

The origins of securitization can be traced to familiar lending practices such as factoring and secured lending, and the market subsequently evolved to the securitization of pools of home mortgages. Nonmortgage asset securitization began in March 1985 when Sperry Lease Financial Corporation floated a $\$192.5$ million public offering. These pass-through securities (which represent direct ownership claims against the securitized portfolio) were secured by a pool of lease receivables originated by Sperry Corporation, now Unisys Corporation. Letters of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland (now part of UBS) facilitated a triple-A debt rating for the issue.  

The securitization market is often referred to as the Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) market. The stated maturities in the ABS market usually do not exceed 6 years and average lives have ranged from 6 months to 5 years. Most of the market is concentrated in the 18-to-36-month period. The securitization market has increased dramatically, both in the United States and abroad. Figure 11.2 provides information on the annual ABS issuance in the United States and Europe.4 Securitization is also important in Asia and Latin America.5  

Currently, a wide range of assets are securitized. Examples are: automobile loans and leases, credit card receivables, commercial truck loans, and boat loans. Private issuers include commercial banks, finance subsidiaries of industrial companies, and savings institutions. See Table 11.1 for data on different types of securitized assets in the United States.  

An initial obstacle to securitization in the United States was uncertainty about whether the Glass–Steagall Act problems on underwriting or distribution of corporate securities also prohibited securitization. However, in the mid-1980s, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) ruled that national banks could sell interests in pools of loans. A court of appeals upheld the OCC’s position and ruled against the Securities Industries Association (SIA). The court ruled that sale of ABS was not limited by Glass–Steagall because these instruments were “not securities but investments in the underlying loans.” The Supreme Court later refused to hear an appeal by the SIA, thereby establishing the right of national banks to securitize.6

In the rest of this chapter, we cover a fairly wide range of topics pertaining to loan sales and securitization. In the next section, we explain securitization and loan sales as natural outcomes of the desire to capture some of the gains from decomposing the traditional lending function. Then we describe the different ways in which securitization is achieved. This is followed by an examination of the economics of securitization in greater detail. Accounting and regulatory issues are examined in the next section. After this we explore the strategic issues faced by banks participating in the ABS market. Loan sales are examined subsequently, and this is followed by the concluding section. A case study is provided to illustrate the strategic securitization issues facing banks.  

# PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON THE ECONOMIC MOTIVATION FOR SECURITIZATION AND LOAN SALES  

# Decomposition of the Lending Function  

Lending can be decomposed into at least four basic operations: (a) origination (including underwriting), (b) guaranteeing, (c) servicing, and (d) funding. This decomposition was long obscured by the modus operandi of financial institutions, which unified these operations. But there is nothing immutable about this unification. For example, suppose a bank were to specialize in the processing of interest rate and credit risk, along with the provision of brokerage services. It could restrict itself to writing letters of credit and loan commitments, avoiding deposits and earning assets altogether.  

So why were these lending functions combined in the first place and why are they being decomposed now? The reasons are twofold: funding advantages due to the regulatory environment and information technology. Let us consider each in turn.  

# The Traditional Benefits of Funding Loans  

In earlier times, depository institutions enjoyed an advantage in funding, and they consequently developed the expertise needed to originate and underwrite assets including loans. The funding advantage was a consequence of regulation: deposit interest rate ceilings, underpriced governmental deposit insurance, entry restrictions, and various tax advantages – particularly those related to loan-loss reserves, mutuality, and housing. The resulting rents were shared among depositors, borrowers, and owners/managers of banks and thrifts. This system, introduced in the 1930s following more than a decade of socially disruptive bank failures, was based on an implicit contract between depositors, owners/managers of banks and thrifts, and the government. Depositors agreed to accept a below-market return for their funds in exchange for a government guarantee; the guarantee (deposit insurance) transformed bank and thrift liabilities into contingent claims against the U.S. government. Bankers agreed to accept regulation and supervision in exchange for a subsidy that lowered the cost and extended the duration of deposits. The government accepted a residual exposure (on behalf of the taxpayers) under the deposit guarantee in exchange for the political gains from stability in the banking system.  

# The Erosion of Funding Benefits and the Incentives for Securitization and Loan Sales  

The implicit contract between depositors, depository institutions, and the government remained intact until the inflation of the 1970s increased the opportunity cost of deposit holding from something on the order of 100 basis points to 400, 500, or even 600 basis points. This caused depositors to turn to higher-yielding money-market funds. The implicit contract began to unravel.  

The trend continued with the legislatively mandated dismantling of deposit interest rate ceilings in the 1980s. As deposit interest rates rose, deposit rents of banks and thrifts eroded. In addition, entry barriers into banking began to crumble, tax preferences began to vanish, and the price of deposit insurance increased and capital requirements were raised. In varying degrees, all of these changes diminished the rents available to banks and the advantages that they enjoyed in funding loans with deposits. However, the originating, monitoring, and servicing skills that they had developed earlier remained intact. This provided the first impetus for banks and thrifts to originate and underwrite loans, but not to fund them, that is, to either sell or securitize loans.  

A second impetus for loan sales and securitization was provided by advances in information technology. A successful loan sale requires that the buyer (usually another financial institution) be able to assess the payoff attributes of the loan, which in turn is facilitated by good information. This is even more critical for securitization in cases where the buyers are investors as opposed to financial institutions. Improvements in information processing technology have made it easier for investors to rate assets, and therefore reduce informational gaps between investors and the originators of loans (banks). Moreover, information technology has been the key to the servicing and monitoring provided by financial institutions, especially with stripped cash flows. This has facilitated securitization.7 This argument can be seen quite clearly in the (somewhat oversimplified) numerical example given below.  

# Example 11.1  

Suppose the North American Bank has originated a portfolio of loans. North American knows that the aggregate payoff on this portfolio will be $\$100$ with probability 0.9 and $\$30$ with probability 0.1. Call this portfolio A. Investors, however, are unable to distinguish between this portfolio and another loan portfolio, call it $\mathsf{B},$ that has an aggregate payoff of $\$100$ with probability 0.7 and $\$30$ with probability 0.3. Investors believe that there is a 0.5 probability that the portfolio is $\mathsf{A},$ and an equal probability that it is B. There is universal risk neutrality.  

The cost to the bank of communicating the “true” value of its loan portfolio is $\$11$ ; this can be viewed simply as a charge against the revenue from the sale of the loan portfolio. Think of this as a signaling cost (Chapter 1  that declines with advances in information technology because these advances enable firms to resort to lower-cost signaling mechanisms. Also, North American’s net profit from loan origination and servicing is $1\%$ of the value of the securitized loan portfolio, whereas if the loans are kept on the books and funded by the bank, the bank’s net profit is $2\%$ of the “true” value of the loan portfolio minus a fixed cost of 99 cents associated with funding (this could represent, for instance, the sum total of regulatory taxes and administrative costs). Will North American prefer to securitize or fund its loan portfolio? Does your answer change if the communication cost drops from $\$11$ to $\$2?$  

# Solution  

We will solve this problem in three steps. First, we will show that if North American decides to sell/securitize its loan portfolio, it will prefer to do so without communicating information to investors since the cost of communication exceeds the benefits of revelation. Having shown that securitization without communication dominates securitization with communication, in Step 2 we show that North American prefers to fund the loan rather than securitize it without communication. Finally, in Step 3 we show that North American prefers to securitize with communication if the communication cost drops from $\$11$ to $\$2$ .  

# Step 1  

First, we compute the value of the “pooled” portfolio, that is, the price at which the bank can sell or securitize the portfolio without any information communication. Given risk neutrality, the bank offering portfolio A will be able to sell it for the average of the values of portfolios A and B, that is, at  

$$
0.5[0.9\times100+0.1\times30]
$$  

$$
=0.5[93]+0.5[79]=\S86.
$$  

Then, it is apparent that it does not pay for North American to reveal its true portfolio quality to investors, since its net payoff from doing so is $\$93$ (the privately known value of its loan portfolio) minus $\$11$ (the cost of information communication), which equals $\$82$ , whereas the “pooling value” of its loan portfolio is $\$86$ . Thus, securitization without communication dominates securitization with communication.  

# Step 2  

You can see now that if North American securitizes its portfolio without communication, its net profit is 86 cents ( $1\%$ of $\$86$ ). But if it funds the loans, its net profit is $0.02\times\S93-0.99=87$ cents. Thus, the bank will prefer not to securitize when the cost of communicating the true value of its loan portfolio to investors is $\$11$ . Combining steps 1 and 2 shows that funding the loan is North American’s optimal strategy.  

# Step 3  

f the communication cost drops to $\$2$ , North American’s net profit from communicating and securitizing is $0.01\times\$93-2]=91$ cents. This exceeds both the net profit from funding the loans as well as the net profit from securitizing without communication, and shows how improvements in information processing technology that reduce the costs of communicating financial information – can spur securitization.  

A more complete discussion of this phenomenon appears in a later section.  

7  See Greenbaum and Thakor (1987) for a discussion of securitization that assigns a role to information processing costs. Boot and Thakor (1993) explain securitization on the grounds that pooling a large number of securities in a portfolio diversifies away idiosyncratic information about individual securities, reducing the burden on investors to produce that information, and then tranching the cash flows from the portfolio to create multiple (debt) securities permits the creation of information-sensitive securities that encourage investors to engage in costly information production about the securities. See also Kareken (1987) and Fishman and Kendall (2000)  An examination of the effects of asset securitization appears in Thomas (2001)

# DIFFERENT TYPES OF SECURITIZATION CONTRACTS  

Loan-backed securities are collateralized by residential, multifamily, and commercial mortgage loans, automobile loans, credit card receivables, Small Business Administration loans, computer and truck leases, loans for mobile homes, and various finance receivables. There are three basic types of ABS, each of which evolved from the secondary mortgage market.  

# Pass-Throughs  

The first type of loan-backed security is a pass-through, which represents direct ownership in a portfolio of mortgage loans that share similar maturity, interest rate, and quality characteristics. The portfolio is placed in a grantor trust and certificates of ownership are sold directly to investors; each certificate represents a claim against the entire loan portfolio. The loan originator (say a bank or a thrift) services the portfolio and collects interest and principal on the loans, although sometimes origination and servicing are provided by different institutions. The servicer deducts a fee from the collected proceeds and passes the difference along to the investors; hence the name “pass-through.” Ownership of the loans (mortgages) rests with the certificate holders. Thus, pass-throughs do not appear on the originator’s balance sheet. There are two structures used with pass-throughs: static pool and dynamic pool. Each is discussed below.  

# Static Pool Pass-Throughs  

The term “static” here refers to the nature of the pool of loans against which claims are sold to investors; this pool is fixed. The trust in which the loans are held is tax free at the trust level. Taxes are levied at the beneficiary level. Most pass-through securities provide for monthly payments of principal and interest. Figure 11.3 shows a schematic for a typical static pass-through structure.8 The payments made by borrowers are paid into a separate interest-bearing account maintained in the trust department of an insured bank (the trustee) in the name of the trustee. This account is known as the collection account. Payments into this account are applied first to pay a monthly servicing fee. On each payment date, the trustee passes along the monthly payments of principal and interest to investors. The servicer is responsible for paying the trustee’s fee.  

There is usually credit enhancement of the loan portfolio. This enhancement is provided by posting “excess” collateral and/or through an insurance bond purchased by the originator. The protection covers some proportion of the underlying assets at the date of issue. For example, suppose there is $15\%$ credit enhancement with an insurance bond. The credit enhancer is then responsible for loan defaults up to that percentage of the value of the securitized loan portfolio.9 In effect, the credit enhancer purchases the defaulted contracts. With a credit enhancement, the guarantor trust is entitled to payments from the credit enhancer to cover the losses of the loan portfolio due to defaults up to the specified coverage.  

The most common type of static pass-through is the Ginnie Mae, which is a mortgage-backed security collateralized by FHA-VA mortgages. The GNMA, a direct agency of the federal government, acts as a credit enhancer, guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest. Thus, these pass-throughs are virtually free of default risk for investors. A highly developed secondary market ensures liquidity for these instruments. The federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), an indirect agency of the federal government, developed a similar pass-through security in 1971, called the “participation certificate” (PC). The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA, or Fannie Mae) developed the mortgage-backed security (MBS) in 1981. Both the PC and the MBS are backed by portfolios of uninsured and privately insured mortgage loans. Monthly interest and full repayment of principal on PCs are guaranteed by Freddie Mac, but the timing of principal payments is not.  

Private sector pass-throughs are less common than these federal agency issues. In 1977, Bank of America issued the first private sector pass-through. These securities were backed by conventional mortgages, and private mortgage insurance was purchased to cover the entire pool of loans rather than each individual loan. Since the insurance covered the loan portfolio as a whole, diversification available to the insurance company meant lower insurance cost than if individual loans, representing a subset of the portfolio, had been insured.  

# Dynamic Pool Pass-Through Structure  

“Dynamic” refers to the pool of loans against which claims are sold to investors. The debt obligations included in the pool are usually short term, so that they turn over, implying changes in the composition of the loan portfolio. This structure, also known as a “revolving structure,” involves a pool of loans with an average life that is shorter than the stated maturities of claims issued against the pool. When a loan within the pool matures, the proceeds are reinvested for a fixed period of time (the “revolving period”). During the revolving period (the duration of which can be structured to satisfy desired asset considerations), only interest is paid to the certificate holders. All principal repayments are reinvested to maintain the original principal amount. Principal amortization begins at the end of the revolving period, usually on a pass-through basis. This design is most often used with credit card receivables (e.g., JCP Master Credit Card Trust for JC Penney credit card receivables and Sears Credit Account Trust for Sears credit card receivables) where repayment periods are uncertain and can be very brief, frustrating the desire of investors to remain invested for some minimum period.  

# Asset-Backed Bonds  

The second type of ABS is the asset-backed bond (ABB). Like the static pass-through, the ABB is collateralized by a portfolio of loans. The main difference is that in the case of an ABB, the originator sells the assets to a wholly owned subsidiary created for the sole purpose of securitizing the assets. Consequently, the assets remain on the originator’s (consolidated) balance sheet. That is, instead of selling the assets to a trust that subsequently sells claims against the assets to investors, the subsidiary itself issues claims (general obligation notes) to investors. These claims are secured solely by the assets of the subsidiary and any credit enhancement obtained for the purpose. Figure 11.4 depicts the cash-flow structure of an ABB. As the figure indicates, the finance company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the originator, issues certificates/notes to investors, usually through an investment bank that underwrites the issue. The revenues collected by the finance company from principal and interest payments are transferred to a trustee. These revenues are added to cash contributions made by a credit enhancer and then disbursements are made to investors by the trustee.  

An important difference between a pass-through and an ABB is that the cash flows from the pool of assets that serve as collateral are not dedicated to the payments of principal and interest on ABBs. The maturity on an ABB is usually prespecified (normally 5–12 years) and interest is generally paid semiannually.  

ABBs are usually overcollateralized. The norm is to evaluate the collateral quarterly, and to augment it if the value falls below an amount stated in the bond indenture. The reasons for overcollateralizing are twofold.  

1. Overcollateralization, like other forms of credit enhancement, increases safety for investors and therefore reduces the required yield on the ABB. This benefits the originator because any proceeds beyond what is needed to service the principal and interest on the ABB accrue to the originator but are used to augment the value of the collateral pool. Thus, the overcollateralization is a particular form of reinvestment of the proceeds collected by the originator from the pool of assets. By reinvesting to increase the collateral, the originator reduces the risk faced by investors in the same way that a borrower reduces a lender’s risk by using project cash flows to purchase additional collateral rather than using the cash flows to increase dividends to shareholders. That is, overcollateralization improves the overall outcome by diminishing a form of moral hazard. Other forms of credit enhancement, such as an insurance bond, also diminish moral hazard, but work a little differently. For example, with an insurance bond, the firm providing the bond would be expected to monitor the originator to ensure sufficiently high asset quality.

2. Excess collateral also protects investors against decreases in the market value of the collateral between valuation dates. This is a simple risk-sharing argument. If the originator is more risk tolerant than individual investors – perhaps because of a superior ability to hedge risks – then the originator provides investors a form of value-fluctuation insurance in exchange for a lower yield on the ABB. In this sense, overcollateralization is no different from any other form of credit enhancement.  

ABBs have been used by both public and private entities, but private issues dominate. Major private issuers are savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks. The ABB market, however, is much smaller than the market for passthroughs (about $5\%$ of the market for pass-throughs). One reason for this may be that an ABB stays on the originator’s books. Thus, a financial institution must hold both reserves and capital against an ABB.  

# Pay-Throughs  

The third type of ABS is the pay-through bond. This security combines features of the pass-through and the ABB. Its similarity to the ABB is that the pay-through appears on the originator’s balance sheet as debt. Its similarity to the pass-through is that cash flows from the pool of assets used as collateral are dedicated to servicing the bonds.  

# CMO  

In June 1983, Freddie Mac issued a pay-through bond called a Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO). Each CMO issue was divided into three “tranches” (maturity classes), and each class received semiannual interest payments. The tranches, however, were strictly prioritized for the receipt of scheduled principal payments and repayments. That is, Class A bondholders received the first installments of principal payments, and any prepayments, until Class A bonds were paid off. After Class A bondholders were paid off, Class B bondholders began to receive principal payments and repayments. Class B bondholders have to be completely paid off before Class C bondholders could. Class A bondholders were repaid within 5 years of the offering date, Class B bonds will be repaid within 12 years, and Class C bonds within 20 years. Figure 11.4 provides a cash-flow diagram for a CMO for the first five years or until tranche A is repaid.  

![](images/f436399dc56f579d4e205973a5bb2caf1af7d870542a2f47c0050c1124b306c3.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.5 Cash-Flow Schematic for a CMO (for the First Five Years).  

Under the structure in Figure 11.5  Class A would receive interest plus all of the principal payments passed through from the underlying mortgages until it is entirely paid off (which is estimated to take no more than five years), while Classes B and C receive only interest. While there is still variability in the rate of repayment due to the randomness in prepayment rates, the CMO structure reduces this variability by “serializing” cash flows this way. That is, CMOholders receive a kind of “call protection.” They can be reasonably confident that their bonds will not prepay (be called) prematurely.  

CMOs facilitate the management of prepayment risk. Routinely borne by financial institutions, this risk arises from the fact that borrowers tend to prepay their debts when interest rates fall because they can refinance at lower rates. This is especially true for long-term mortgages that have no prepayment penalties. Thus, the financial institution does not fully benefit from the decline in its cost of funds relative to the rates on its longer-maturity assets. On the other hand, when interest rates rise, the institution’s cost of funds rises but its asset returns do not, as borrowers hold on to their low-interest-rate mortgages. By investing in a CMO tranche with a sufficiently long effective maturity (say Class C in Figure 11.5), the institution can reduce its exposure to prepayment risk.  

A wide variety of CMOs are available. They range from three maturity classes to more than six. Most, however, have four tranches, which include three “regular” maturity classes and a “residual” class, called the $^{66}Z$ class.” The first three classes are paid interest at the stated rates, starting with the issue date. The Z class is basically an accrual bond in which earned interest accrues to the principal and is compound while the other classes earn interest. After the first three classes are paid off, the Z class receives regular principal and interest payments along with accrued interest.  

CMOs can be used by financial institutions to facilitate asset/liability management. For example, suppose an S&L has 30-year fixed-rate mortgages financed with liabilities of shorter maturities. Such an institution could reduce the maturity mismatching on its balance sheet by swapping its mortgages for the shorter tranches of CMOs.  

Both public and private sector firms participate in the CMO market. Issuers include investment banks, federal agencies, builders, and thrift institutions, among others. The issuance of a CMO is not an asset sale because the debt obligation stays on the originator’s books. This structure was adopted to comply with tax regulations that stated that a trust could not qualify for grantor trust status if it issued multiclass claims that divide the cash flows in a not prorata fashion, as a CMO does; recall that this “tax problem” does not arise with pass-throughs because certificate holders do receive the cash flows in a prorata fashion. Thus, a CMO had to tolerate the “inefficiency” of keeping the collateral assets on the originator’s balance sheet rather than selling these to a trust. This resulted in another tax disadvantage, namely that due to regulatory taxes like reserve and capital requirements and deposit insurance premiums. This limited the use of CMOs.  

# REMICs  

The Tax Reform Act (TRA) of 1986 authorized REMICs (Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits). The main difference between a CMO and a REMIC is in the tax treatment. REMICs can qualify as asset sales for tax purposes if the following conditions are satisfied.  

1. A REMIC must contain at least one regular class and no more than one residual class.   
2. The collateral of a REMIC must consist of “qualified mortgages” or “permitted investments.” Qualified mortgages include single and multifamily residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgages as well as mortgage-backed securities. Permitted investments include short-term interest-bearing securities used only for reinvesting monthly cash flows prior to their scheduled transfer to bondholders, investments to fund operating expenses of the REMIC, and properties acquired through foreclosure.  

# Securitization Innovations  

New types of securitization contracts continue to proliferate for three main reasons. First, lower interest rates have made the prepayment options in mortgages more valuable to investors, who have become more sophisticated in dealing with prepayment risk. Thus, new securities that facilitate the management of prepayment risk have been created.  

Second, investors who are relatively uninformed about the probability distributions of future payoffs on various securities will find themselves at a disadvantage in dealing with investors who are better informed. The uninformed will therefore demand relatively information-insensitive securities that would enable them to trade without being expropriated. The cash-flow stripping that accompanies securitization often creates information-insensitive securities by partitioning the cash flows of a composite, information-sensitive security in such a way that the senior-most security is a nearly riskless bond that would appeal to uninformed investors.10  

Third, innovations in securitization and cash-flow stripping have also facilitated the creation of securities that appeal to informed investors. A given security with some private-information content can always be stripped into two securities, one of which is more information sensitive (has a greater private-information content) than the original security. Those who have the ability to acquire information at a cost will find that the return on their investment in information is greater with the more information-sensitive security. Thus, more of these investors will become informed, and there will be a greater demand from these investors, which in turn will elevate the price at which the security trades, and hence the issue’s revenue.11 A similar argument can be made for other attributes of the original security, which can be altered through cashflow stripping to appeal to specific clienteles of investors. For example, investors may have different cash-flow preferences due to tax considerations and risk attitudes. Then, stripping a security into components permits the issuer to cater more effectively to the desires of these clienteles than issuing only a single class of pass-throughs would permit. Translated into dollars, this means higher revenue for the issuer. Investors desire a low prepayment rate even when interest rates are falling. Investors who want a discount mortgage security with higher prepayment can purchase a P/O (“principal-only” security).  

# Stripped Securities  

The stripped mortgage security (the “strip”) involves two classes of pass-through securities that receive different portions of principal and interest from the same pool of mortgage loans. For example, a pool of mortgage loans with an average APR of $8\%$ might be split into a “premium” security with a $12\%$ coupon and a “discount” security with a $4\%$ coupon. When this process of “stripping” is taken to its logical extreme, it creates interest-only (I/O) and principal-only (P/O) securities. This is known as an I/O–P/O strip. Holders of the I/O strip receive primarily interest payments from the securitized pool, whereas the holders of the P/O strip receive nearly all of the principal payments.  

Strips offer advantages to issuers as well as to investors. The advantages to investors are based on the clientele’s argument presented earlier. That is, some investors may prefer information-insensitive securities, others may prefer informationsensitive securities, and yet others may desire a specific cash-flow pattern due to tax considerations. Strips can satisfy these different demands.  

A financial institution can also use I/O–P/O strips for hedging against interest-rate risk. I/Os are useful in hedging fixed-rate mortgage loans and other fixed-income assets. An increase in interest rates causes a decline in the value of the I/O as with other fixed-income assets. However, the higher interest rates will slow down prepayments. This will generate higher-than-expected cash flows for the holders of the I/O strips, and will thereby increase the value of the I/O. In most interest-rate scenarios, an increase in interest rates will cause prepayments to fall sufficiently to create an inverse relationship between the value of the I/O strips and the prices of the bank’s other fixed-income assets. This provides hedging.

FIGURE 11.6 A Typical ABCP Program.  

A financial institution can use P/O strips to hedge its fixed-income liabilities. A decrease in interest rates increases the value of a P/O strip because the discount rate for computing the present value of future principal payments has decreased. Moreover, prepayments go up, accelerating the cash flows accruing to the holders of the P/O strips, further increasing the value of that strip. Thus, the value of a P/O is inversely related to the values of fixed-income liabilities, and hedging is possible.  

# Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)  

ABCP is commercial paper secured by designated corporate assets, typically receivables. The term ABCP is almost oxymoronic since commercial paper is understood to be the traded, short-term unsecured debt of corporations. The maturity is typically 90–180 days. Figure 11.6 illustrates how an ABCP program works.12  

A bank establishes a “special purpose corporation” (SPC). The SPC purchases credit card receivables or other assets from a corporation (the seller) in need of funding. To finance this purchase, the SPC issues commercial paper that is secured by the assets purchased by the SPC. The bank provides credit enhancement enabling the SPC to obtain a high credit rating for the commercial paper, typically through overcollateralization and/or a standby letter of credit. This credit enhancement enables the SPC to obtain a high credit rating for the commercial paper.  

The ABCP market, which came into existence in 1983, has expanded rapidly, growing to a multibillion-dollar market within a decade. Fitch Investors Service reports that, in mid-1993, 175 ABCP programs were in operation, representing $\$75$ billion in outstanding commercial paper and $\$150$ billion in commitments. By the end of 2006, ABCP outstanding in the United States had grown to $\$1.1$ trillion, larger than the amount of unsecured (non-asset-backed) commercial paper outstanding and a significant portion of the “shadow banking system” in the United States.13 Global banks like Societe Generale (France), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Barclays Bank (United Kingdom), UBS (Switzerland), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (Japan), and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (Canada) were big players in this market. Following the financial crisis during which the ABCP market was under enormous stress and fell out of favor with many, outstanding volume dropped below $\$400$ billion by 2010, and by the end of 2014 to slightly over $\$200$ billion.14 The boom in the ABCP market is seen as one of the contributors to the 2007–2009 financial crisis. ABCP was used to fund off balance sheet special purpose vehicles (and conduits), and considered fragile as it supported long-term (and often opaque) assets that were typically financed with very short-maturity liabilities.15 We will discuss this more in Chapter 14  

For now, it is still interesting to ask why had ABCP grown so much in popularity in the precrisis years? We will examine both the demand and supply sides. On the demand side, ABCP offers some firms lower cost funding than either “regular” (unsecured) commercial paper or a bank loan. Regular commercial paper may either be unavailable or too costly because of the high cost of moral hazard owing to the unsecured nature of the paper (recall Chapters 7 and 8). A bank loan may be too costly because of capital and reserve requirements. One reason why ABCP lowers the firm’s funding cost is the credit enhancement provided by the bank. Not only does this directly lower the investor’s risk in holding the paper, but it also signals the bank’s involvement in monitoring the borrower16 and is certification that the borrower is creditworthy. Thus, the basic screening and monitoring services provided by the bank play a key role in the ABCP market.  

On the supply side, the risk-based Basel II (see Chapter 15) capital rules increased the benefits of ABCP to banks. If the bank were to extend a loan to the borrower, it would not only need to keep reserves against the deposit used to fund the loan, it would also need to set aside substantial capital (under Basel I, this was $8\%$ ). With an ABCP, the bank would need to keep capital equal to say $8\%$ of only the credit enhancement (typically a fraction of the total borrowing). For example, a $\$1$ billion bank loan would need $\$80$ million in bank capital, but with an ABCP program, a bank might issue a letter of credit equal to only $10\%$ of the total amount, so that only $\$8$ million in capital would have to be set aside.17 Thus, as with other off-balance sheet products, banks are able to earn fee income without posting as much capital as with conventional funding.  

As already noted, the financial crisis of 2007–2009 took its toll on the ABCP market. While ABCP had become popular for regulatory arbitrage, the off balance sheet structures often did not reduce the risk for the issuing bank. Via liquidity guarantees much of the risk would come back to haunt the banks. In the summer of 2007, ABCP outstanding began a precipitous decline. The trigger had to do with growing concerns about the default risks of subprime and other mortgages.18  

The collapse of the ABCP market also created problems for money market mutual funds (MMFs) that invest trillions of dollars on behalf of individuals, pension funds, municipalities, businesses, and others. These investments are close substitutes for bank deposits from the standpoint of investors. Many MMFs invested in ABCP, and met the withdrawal demands of their investors by selling ABCP in a liquid market, prior to 2007. Because liquidity was drained out of this market during the financial crisis, it was difficult for MMFs to meet the withdrawal demands of their investors. To help MMFs cope with this problem and to preclude further downward pressure on ABCP prices due to fire sales of these securities by MMFs, the Federal Reserve established the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF).19  

The AMLF was created by the Federal Reserve under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which permitted the Board, in unusual circumstances to authorize Federal Reserve Banks to extend credit to individuals, partnerships and corporations. Under the AMLF program, the Federal Reserve provided nonrecourse loans to U.S. depository institutions, U.S. bank holding companies, and the U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. These loans were fully collateralized by the ABCP purchased by the AMLF borrower. These institutions that received the loans used them to purchase eligible ABCP from MMFs, so the MMFs were the institutions that were the primary intended beneficiaries of the AMLF.  

The AMLF facility was administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which was allowed to make AMLF loans to eligible borrowers in all 12 Federal Reserve districts. The facility was announced on September 19, 2008, and closed on February 1, 2010.  

The AMLF program is a good example of how government liquidity-provision intervention can help in markets that are experiencing serious liquidity shortages or breakdown either due to temporarily distorted beliefs that cause overreactions to adverse events or due to informational asymmetries.20 Whether a liquidity crunch was the main problem during the subprime crisis is another issue altogether, and one that we will visit in a later chapter on the financial crisis of 2007–2009.

# Securitization of Other Assets: CARS, CARDS, Intellectual Property, and So On  

# Auto Loans  

Securitization of automobile loans began in 1985, and from 1985 to 1987, it was the largest sector of the ABS market.21 By 2005, auto-loan securitization had reached almost $\$220$ billion. The securitization of auto loans is actually the securitization of retail installment sales contracts that are backed by autos and light trucks. The maximum maturity of the loan is 60 months and the loans pay principal and interest on a monthly basis. These loans are packaged and sold as loan-backed securities called Certificates of Automobile Receivables, or “CARS,” in keeping with Wall Street’s penchant for catchy acronyms. They are usually pass-through securities, with both the principal and interest passed on directly to the certificate holders. However, the pay-through structure has also been used (e.g., by GMAC).  

CARS usually involve a higher servicing fee than mortgage-backed securities because an auto loan requires more monitoring. Moreover, the value of the collateral (the car) tends to depreciate somewhat unpredictably through time, compared to the value of a home. Nevertheless, auto loans are readily securitizable because they have predictable default rates, as well as reasonably stable prepayment rates.  

In the securitized auto-loan market, prepayment speed is usually indicated by the “absolute prepayment rate.” This rate represents the percentage of the original loans that are expected to prepay every month. For example, a $2\%$ rate means that $2\%$ of the original number of the loans in the pool can be expected to prepay every month. The prepayment speed is estimated prior to the offering of the CAR and is a key factor in its pricing. Figure 11.7 gives an example of the cash-flow characteristics of a CAR over its life.  

# Credit Cards  

Securitization of credit-card receivables began in April 1986 when Salomon Brothers privately placed $\$50$ million of passthrough backed by a pool of Bank One credit-card receivables. These securities were called Certificates of Amortizing Revolving Debts or “CARDS.” The original CARDS had a stated maturity of 5 years. For the first 18 months, only interest payments were passed through to investors. Principal payments received during this time by the grantor trust were used to purchase additional receivables. Investors began to receive principal payments after the first 18 months. These CARDS were not guaranteed by a third party. Bank One provided credit enhancement through excess collateral by establishing a reserve fund equal to twice the historical default rate on credit-card debt. The bank also retained a $30\%$ interest in the creditcard pool and recouped whatever was left in the reserve fund after covering defaults. This “reserve fund” concept has been applied to securitizations of assets other than credit cards, such as CARS.  

![](images/7ebf0a5481ce86a32ed7c0d06d95547c7d04e3bf025269360015f33016858d4b.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.8 Pool Cash Flow for CARDS. (Source: Monahan, Maureen, An Investor’s Guide to Asset-Backed Securities, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., March 1989).  

Following the Bank One experiment, other banks entered the market. For instance, the Republic Bank of Delaware offered a dynamic version of CARDS with a revolving/pass-through security in January 1987. CARDS overtook CARS in 1988 as issuers like Citicorp and Sears entered the market for the first time. By 2005, the volume of credit-card securitizations had reached about $\$357$ billion.  

Outstanding balances on credit cards tend to pay down quickly. This is why CARDS often have a “lock out” or “callprotection” period (such as the 18-month period for the Bank One CARDS) during which only interest is paid to investors. The principal is reinvested in new receivables. Amortization of principal and interest begins after the lockout period. The length of the amortization period depends on the characteristics of the credit-card pool, but this is not difficult to estimate because monthly repayments rates are predictable. Figure  11.8 illustrates the cash-flow structure and suggests why an originator/servicer might be interested in CARDS.  

The credit-card pass-through structure has undergone many refinements. For example, a bullet principal payment structure has been adopted whereby investors receive their entire principal in one lump sum at maturity. Prior to that they receive periodic interest payments exclusively. This provides investors against prepayment risk and early amortization.22  

# Other Tangible Assets  

Loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), computer leases, and various types of trade credit have also been securitized. Securities backed by lease receivables23 and trade credit are similar to mortgage-backed bonds. Commercial paper or corporate bonds are collateralized by lease or trade credit receivables, and the receivables remain on the issuer’s balance sheet. Sometimes the issuer sells the receivables to a subsidiary that issues debt collateralized by these receivables.  

Finance leases have also been securitized. A finance lease operates over most of the leased asset’s useful life. Finance leases either cannot be canceled, or if they are cancelable they require the lessee to reimburse the lessor for any losses that may be incurred as a result of the cancellation.  

Still other assets that have been securitized include junk bonds, leveraged buyouts, loans for manufactured homes, and commercial loans. Other than trade receivables, securitized commercial loans include loans for employee stock option plans (ESOPS), and leveraged buyout loans.24  

Securitization is now viewed as a vehicle that can be used for almost any asset. Among “nontraditional” assets that have been securitized are unsold airline seats, song royalties, proceeds from tobacco litigation (being securitized by various states), and natural resources like unsold oil and natural gas. The accounting statute governing securitization in the United States is FAS 140.  

# Securitization of Intangibles Like Intellectual Property  

In all of the previous cases of securitization that we have discussed, what was being securitized was essentially a tangible asset. However, conceptually there is no reason why securitization cannot be extended to intangible assets like intellectual property. After all, an important goal of securitization is to enable the borrower to raise cash now against the present value of future cash flows, rather than waiting for the future cash flows to materialize. Thus, as long as an intangible asset has the potential to generate future cash flows, one ought to be able to securitize it. And that is precisely what has happened in recent years. The intangible assets that have been securitized include: trademarks, brand names, product designs, corporate name and logo, manufacturing technology, databases and patents.25 In most cases, the firms involved were seeking financing from additional sources, since they had exhausted debt financing from traditional sources, lacked sufficient inventories to procure additional inventory-backed financing, and real estate was encumbered.  

# GOING BEYOND PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON ECONOMIC MOTIVATION: THE “WHY,” “WHAT,” AND “HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH” OF SECURITIZATION  

# Why?  

Our purpose in this section is to examine in more detail the economics of securitization.  

The Supply Side of Securitization: Issuer’s Prospective Costs: The primary costs of securitization to the issuer are administrative in nature. They include legal fees, investment banking fees, and rating agencies’ fees. Other costs include the costs of communicating information to investors and the cost of credit enhancement.  

Issuer’s Prospective Benefits: The numerous potential benefits to the issuer include management of interest rate, increased liquidity, and diversification of funding sources. In addition, securitization enables the originator to focus on the origination, servicing, and monitoring of loans and to avoid certain taxes and regulatory costs.  

1. Management of Interest-Rate Risk: By securitizing some of its assets, a bank or a thrift may be able to better manage the interest-rate risk. For example, consider an S&L that holds residential mortgages with an average stated maturity of 27.5 years and mostly fixed rate. On the other hand, $65\%$ of the typical S&L’s liabilities are time and savings deposits that mature in less than a year. This enormous maturity mismatch creates substantial interest-rate risk for the S&L. To reduce this exposure, the S&L could securitize a pool of mortgages using the pass-through method. This would take these assets off its books and shorten the average maturity of its assets, while still allowing the S&L to service the loans and earn the servicing fee.  

Another form of interest-rate risk is prepayment risk, which can also be reduced by securitizing. It can replace the mortgages in its portfolio with pass-throughs and CMOs. This helps the S&L to diversify. Moreover, the CMO helps protect against prepayment risk.  

The S&L could also attempt to lengthen the average maturity of its liabilities, which would further reduce the gap in maturities of its assets and liabilities. It can do this by issuing mortgage-backed bonds and pay-throughs. The mortgage loans remain on the S&L’s balance sheet but the average maturity of the S&L’s liabilities is effectively increased since a mortgage-backed bond has an average maturity of about 5–12 years. Of course, the S&L can hedge its exposure through other, more conventional, means such as swaps, options, and futures. But in terms of both transactions costs and overall effectiveness, securitization may be a superior alternative in many instances.  

2. Increased Liquidity: Securitization can improve the issuer’s liquidity. The obvious reason is that assets that were untraded prior to securitization are traded in active secondary markets after securitization; thus, the issuer holds more liquid assets even if it retains any portion of the securitized portfolio. While the observation itself is correct, it is not terribly insightful. As our discussion of liquidity in Chapter 6 indicated, an asset is liquid if it can be sold quickly without much of a loss relative to its “true” value. This, in turn, rules out a large gap in the information the seller has about the asset’s future prospects and the information a potential buyer has about those prospects. Now, active trading improves an asset’s liquidity because it provides profit incentives for potential buyers to produce information about the asset. The information is then partly transmitted to others (who may be uninformed) through trading volume, prices, and related parameters.26 Thus, trading increases the availability of information about the asset in the public domain and hence improves liquidity.  

However, before an asset can be introduced for trading at a price that does not impose large initial losses on the seller, it must have some measure of liquidity, that is, the informational gap between the buyer and the seller should not be too large. Securitization achieves this initial measure of liquidity in two important ways. First, third-party credit enhancement reduces the effect of informational asymmetries between the issuer and investors. Credit enhancement works like a (partial) standby letter of credit in that it substitutes a portion of the credit risk of the asset pool with the credit risk of the credit enhancer. If investors have a better knowledge of the credit enhancer (who is likely to have an established reputation) than of the securitized pool of assets, then the relevant informational asymmetry is reduced. Sometimes there is an outright letter of credit provided by a credit enhancer, in which case the informational asymmetry is reduced further.  

A second way in which securitization improves liquidity even prior to trading is through the pooling of a large number of assets and the subsequent partitioning of portfolio cash flows. To see this, think of a CMO with various tranches, each having its own priority status. The importance of the issuer’s private information about the future portfolio returns diminishes as one moves further up the priority ladder.27 That is, private information is less important for the first tranche (i.e., the bond with the first claim against portfolio cash flows) than it is for the portfolio as a whole. Thus, by splitting up the portfolio into tranches, the issuer essentially distributes the total private information related to the portfolio across the different tranches in a particular way. This in itself does not necessarily reduce the total information asymmetry. But it does make the high-priority tranches more liquid (less informationally sensitive) than the portfolio as a whole. The issuer can choose to retain its claim against the most information-sensitive (and least liquid), lowestpriority portion of the portfolio cash flow, and sell off the rest. The issuer needs to fund only the retained portion of the portfolio. The rest is liquefied and securitized.28 The following illustration clarifies this point.  

# Example 11.2  

Suppose the North American Bank has two loans, each of which is due to be repaid one period hence. The cash flows are independent and identically distributed random variables. Each loan will repay $\$100$ to the bank with probability 0.9 and $\$50$ with probability 0.1. However, while North American knows this, prospective investors cannot distinguish this bank’s loan portfolio from that of the Southside City Bank, which has the same number of loans, but each of its loans will repay $\$100$ with probability 0.6 and $\$50$ with probability 0.4. The prior belief of investors is that there is a 0.5 probability that North American has the highervalued portfolio and a 0.5 probability that it has the lower-valued portfolio. Suppose that North American wishes to securitize these loans, and knows that if it does so without credit enhancement, the cost of communicating the true value of its loans to investors is $5\%$ of the true value. The data for this problem are depicted in Figure 11.9  Explore North American’s securitization alternatives. Assuming that a credit enhancer is available and that the credit enhancer could (at negligible cost) determine the true value of North American’s loan portfolio, what sort of credit enhancement should North American purchase? Assume investors are risk neutral and that the discount rate is zero.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in four steps. First, we show that if the North American Bank securitizes its loan portfolio as a single security (i.e., without cash-flow stripping or creating tranches), it will prefer securitization with communication (investors learn the true value of its loan portfolio) to securitization without communication (in which case investors set a pooling price of the loan portfolio). Second, we examine the benefits of securitizing by creating two tranches represented by two particular classes of bondholders. We show that this cash-flow partitioning benefits North American by increasing its expected revenues relative to the securitization considered in step 1. Third, we stipulate a specific form of credit enhancement. Finally, in Step 4, we examine the net benefit of credit enhancement to North American and find that it is positive. Indeed, the loan portfolio is made perfectly liquid by credit enhancement. While credit enhancement by a party that knows North American’s portfolio better than investors will always help, it helps to the maximum extent possible here due to the assumption that the credit enhancer can discover the true value of North American’s loan portfolio at negligible cost.

FIGURE 11.9 North American Bank’s Loan Portfolio.  

Step 1   
f North American does not communicate any information to investors, the market value of its securitized loan portfolio will be   
the average value assessed by investors:  

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>× 0.5</td><td>×[0.9 × 100 +0.1 × 50]}</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>个</td><td>个</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of loans</td><td>Probability that loan portfolio is high-valued</td><td> Expected value of high-valued loan portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>+{2</td><td>× 0.5</td><td>[0.6 × 100 +0.4 × 50]}</td></tr><tr><td>个</td><td>个</td><td>个</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of loans</td><td>Probability that loan portfolio is low-valued</td><td>Expected value of low-valued loan portfolio</td></tr></table></body></html>

$=\$175$  

Now, North American knows privately that its loan portfolio is worth  

$$
2[0.9\times100+0.1\times50]=\S190.
$$  

Thus, if it wishes to communicate its private information to investors, it will cost North American $0.05\times190=\S9.5$ . It will then be able to sell its portfolio for $\$190$ and its net payoff will be $\$190-\$9.5=9180.5.$ This means that North American will prefer securitization with communication to securitization without.  

# Step 2  

Consider next the following securitization alternative. North American can create two classes of bondholders in a “seniorsubordinated structure” or a “juniorsenior structure.” Class A bondholders, who receive the first tranche, are entitled to $\$100$ in the aggregate. After they are paid off, Class B bondholders are entitled to receive $\$100$ or the residual cash flow, whichever is smaller. Now, since the Class A bondholders will receive $\$100$ for sure, regardless of whether the loan portfolio is high-valued or low-valued (note that the lowest payoff on either portfolio is $\$50$ ), there is no need for the bank to communicate information to these bondholders. The price at which this portfolio can be sold is $\$100$ . Since the Class B bondholders are entitled to receive a maximum of $\$100,$ , and the maximum total payoff on the loan portfolio is $\$200,$ it is apparent that these bondholders are essentially residual claimants who receive all of the cash flow remaining after the Class A bondholders are paid off. Thus, the true value of the Class B bonds must be equal to the total value of the loan portfolio minus the aggregate value of the Class A bonds, or $\$190$ $-\$100=\$90$ . Since the market value of the total loan portfolio is $\$175$ and the market value of the Class A bonds is $\$100$ , the market value of the Class B bonds should be $\$175-\$100=975$ . If North American now chooses to communicate the true value of Class B bonds to investors, it will be able to sell these bonds for $\$90$ , but the communication cost to the bank will be $0.05\times$ $90=\$4.5$ . Thus, its net payoff on securitizing this way will be  

$$
\$100+\S90-\S4.5=\S185.5.
$$  

North American’s net revenue is higher when it uses securitization to partition the total cash flow from the loan portfolio into two classes with different “information sensitivities.”  

# Step 3  

Now consider credit enhancement. The best way to structure the credit enhancement is to ask the credit enhancer to pay the Class B bondholders the difference between the promised amount of $\$100$ and the actual residual cash flow after the Class A tranche is paid off. Ignoring the possibility of default by the credit enhancer, this guarantees that Class B bondholders will receive $\$100$ for sure, regardless of the quality of the securitized loan portfolio. Thus, no information communication by the bank is necessary. The question is: How much will North American have to pay the credit enhancer, assuming that the credit enhancement is competitively priced?  

# Step 4  

To answer this question, suppose we label the two loans in the portfolio as 1 and 2. Then, there are four possible “states”: (i) both loans 1 and 2 pay off $\$100$ each (the probability of this is $0.9\times0.9=0.81$ ), (ii) loan 1 pays off $\$100$ and loan 2 pays off $\$50$ (the probability of this is $0.9\times0.1=0.09)$ , (iii) loan 1 pays off $\$50$ and loan 2 pays off $\$100$ (the probability of this is $0.1\times0.9=$ 0.09), and (iv) both loans pay off $\$50$ each (the probability of this is $0.1\times0.1=0.01$ ). Now, in state (i), the credit enhancer has no liability since the total portfolio cash flow of $\$200$ is enough to fully satisfy the claims of both classes of bondholders. In states (ii) and (iii), the total portfolio cash flow is $\$150$ , so that only $\$50$ is available to pay off Class B bondholders after Class A bondholders are satisfied. In each of these states, the credit enhancer’s liability is $\$50$ , and the total probability of these two states [i.e., the probability that either state (ii) or state (iii) will occur] is $0.09+0.09=0.18$ . In state (iv), the total portfolio cash flow is $\$100,$ , so that the credit enhancer’s liability is 100. Hence, the expected value of the credit enhancer’s liability is $0.18\times\S50+0.01\times\S100$ $=\$10$ . In a competitive market (with a zero discount rate and risk neutrality), this is what North American will have to pay for the credit enhancement. Thus, North American’s net payoff will be

The loan portfolio has been made “perfectly” liquid!  

3. Diversification of Funding Sources: Securitization provides originators with a way of raising financing from sources other than their traditional sources. For example, for a bank the traditional sources of funding are deposits, federal funds, subordinated debt, preferred stock and equity, all of which are essentially claims on the bank’s entire asset portfolio. By segregating some assets into a pool to be securitized, the bank is able to diversify its funding sources beyond its traditional sources. This is important for any bank CFO.  

4. Enables Focus on Origination, Servicing, and Monitoring: You will recall from our discussions in Chapter 3 that the key economic functions of financial intermediaries are related to the resolution of informational problems. One advantage of securitization is that it enables the bank to focus on the origination, servicing, and monitoring of loans, three activities that the bank can generally perform more efficiently than others because of specialization. When a bank or S&L originates a loan, it provides a valuable screening service – the bank’s willingness to make the loan tells other interested but less-informed parties something about the borrower that they did not know before. This can reduce the borrower’s cost of credit from other (nonbank) sources. Loan servicing is a transactional service that the bank may be able to provide at lower cost because of its specialization in handling numerous other similar transactions. And of course, monitoring of borrowers is one of the fundamental intermediation services that banks provide. By securitizing its loans, a bank can focus on these three activities without actually funding the loans. Absent regulatory help, it is not clear that banks have any special advantage in funding anyway. On the negative side, securitization might complicate loan renegotiations.29  

5. Facilitates the Avoidance of “Adverse Selection” Costs: Typically, a bank has a portfolio of assets with differing degrees of information sensitivity. Even if the market prices the portfolio correctly, it is quite possible that some of the assets are overvalued by the market and some are undervalued. Now consider a bank faced with the prospect of funding some new loans about which there is very little informational asymmetry, that is, the bank’s assessment of the value of this new loan portfolio is roughly equivalent to that of the market. But suppose that the bank on the whole is undervalued. If this bank goes out and raises capital (that consists, in part, of uninsured deposits and equity) to fund these new loans in the conventional (nonsecuritization) manner, it will have to pay an “adverse selection cost” in the sense that the bank’s cost of funding will be higher than it would be if investors had the same information about all of the bank’s assets as the bank’s managers themselves. This happens because investors who provide funding for these new loans are purchasing claims against the bank’s entire asset portfolio. That is, these factors may account for the bank’s disadvantage in funding loans.  

Instead of going the conventional route, suppose the bank decides to securitize these loans. Now investors who provide the necessary capital are purchasing claims only against the new assets. Thus, if there is little informational asymmetry about these assets, there will be virtually no “adverse selection” cost.30 An example is provided by Gelco Corporation, a truck-leasing company with a BB credit rating from Standard & Poor’s. Its commercial paper, backed by high-quality leases, was rated A-1. The firm saved about 80 basis points in borrowing costs by securitizing its lease receivables.31 This illustrates how a firm can take advantage of its marginal cost of funds on all its assets. The intuition here is similar to that for another fairly well-established practice known as “project financing,” which involves a corporation establishing a legally distinct subsidiary to finance a new project. See the discussion in Chapter 9  

A key element of the benefit of avoiding adverse selection costs is that securitization through SPCs often achieves “bankruptcy remoteness” of the securitized assets from the borrowing firm. That is, the claims of lenders who provide financing to the SPC cannot subsequently be diluted by the claims of Debtor-in-Possession lenders to the sponsoring firm should the sponsor file for bankruptcy. However, this bankruptcy remoteness protection for the SPC investors is not perfect and can be undermined in legal proceedings. We would then expect that the greater the legal risk of bankruptcy remoteness being undermined by the courts, the higher will be the interest rates demanded by the SPC investors.32  

6. Avoidance of Intermediation Taxes: Because securitization permits a depository institution to raise funds directly from investors rather than from depositors, it helps the institution to avoid “intermediation taxes” (or regulatory taxes) like reserve and capital requirements and deposit insurance premiums. This benefit is obvious in the case of a pass-through because the relevant assets are removed from the institution’s balance sheet, thereby eliminating the need to hold capital against those assets. Moreover, since the proceeds from the sale of the pass-throughs are not deposits, no reserve requirements or deposit-insurance premiums are involved.  

There is a more subtle interaction between regulatory taxes and the institution’s choice of which assets to securitize. Many regulatory taxes, like reserve requirements, have traditionally been flat taxes in that they do not depend on the riskiness of the asset involved. That is, there is “pooling” of these taxes across the spectrum of asset risks, and the actual taxes correspond to some sort of average. Thus, the low-risk assets (which should have lower-than-average taxes) “subsidize” the high-risk assets (which should have higher-than-average taxes). A bank can lessen the impact of these taxes by securitizing its low-risk assets and leaving only the high-risk assets on its books. This way it would have higher-thanaverage risk assets on its books, but it would only pay taxes that correspond to average risk.  

The Demand Side of Securitization: Investor’s Perspective: Having discussed why financial institutions and other firms might wish to securitize assets, we now turn to why investors might wish to hold these assets. One way for investors to invest in a bank’s assets (e.g., loans) is to purchase bank equity. Relative to that alternative, purchasing securitized claims offers a number of possible advantages, two of which are discussed below.  

1. Reduction in Market Incompleteness: These are two ways in which securitization helps to reduce market incompleteness. First, it improves the quality of assets that investors can hold and thereby increases the quality spectrum of available assets. Second, it provides a greater variety of cash-flow streams that investors can hold. Consider the quality issue first. The claims that an institution offers investors via securitization are often of higher credit quality than the institution itself. This is due to two reasons. First, as we have discussed earlier, there are incentives for the institution to securitize both lower risk and less information-sensitive assets. Second, credit enhancement improves the quality of the asset pool being securitized. Thus, it is not surprising that most of the asset-backed market is triple-A or double-A rated. Securitization provides investors with access to higher credit quality claims than available otherwise.  

Now consider the cash-flow variety issue. Because securitization combines pooling, cash-flow partitioning, and credit enhancement, it does not produce merely a linear combination of existing payoff vectors (recall the discussion of market completeness in Chapter 1). Rather, it produces claims that were previously unavailable to investors through linear combinations of existing claims. Moreover, even in the case of claims that could have been “home-manufactured” by investors who were willing to combine available securities, securitization provides a less-expensive alternative in terms of transactions costs. For example, ABS have limited prepayment risk, so the effective maturity of the security is relatively insensitive to market yields. This means that for a given decline in yield, these “positive” convexity and limited prepayment features may not be available in the same configurations to investors in nonsecuritized alternatives. Thus, securitization helps to reduce financial market incompleteness.  

2. Liquidity: Because of the size of the ABS market and the active trading involved, investors are assured that they are buying a liquid claim. Securitization may be viewed as an alternative technology (to traditional funding) for producing liquidity.33  

# What? Securitization With Recourse Versus Deposits and Risk Sharing  

The concept of recourse is key to understanding what securitization does for both the originator and the investor. When securitization is without recourse, the investor has a claim only against the pool of assets that have been securitized. He has no claim to any other assets of the originator. On the other hand, securitization with recourse closely resembles traditional balance sheet lending. The purchaser of a security with recourse has the option of trading the claim for a general bank claim like that of an uninsured depositor should the purchased asset default. If the bank fails, the investor has the option of keeping the securitized asset.  

In this subsection, we will discuss securitization with recourse. It turns out that the securitization benefits are similar to those created by multiclass securities, in which sequential claims are issued against the same collateral pool. Basically, better risk sharing is achieved, since the most risk-averse investors can be sold the most senior claims. Under current law, banks are not allowed to issue multiclass or senior deposit claims against their balance sheet assets. That is, deposit claims cannot be prioritized. Hence, from the bank’s perspective, a valuable opportunity to cater to “preference clienteles” among its potential depositor base is lost. However, securitization with recourse gives the bank an opportunity to profit from selectively catering to depositors with different degrees of risk aversion. Uninsured depositors can switch to a contract that gives them a senior claim on a part of the bank’s asset portfolio (i.e., the securitized asset). A loan-backed security with a bank guarantee attached (securitization with recourse) is like a large CD with the addition of a senior keeping the securitized security rather than waiting in line with other depositors to obtain his share of the bank’s other assets. In a capital market in which people have different degrees of risk aversion, we would expect the more risk-averse investors to buy these securitized claims, and their less risk-averse cohorts to bear more risk. Thus, securitization achieves better risk sharing than the standard deposit contract. This intuition is formalized in the model developed in the box below.34  

Now $[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ is the amount promised by the bank to the insured depositors, and $D(\theta)$ is the amount for uninsured depositors. If $A(\theta)\geq[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+B,$ the bank is solvent and the insured depositors receive $[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ from the bank. If $A(\theta)<[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+B,$ the bank fails. The insured depositors still receive $[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}},$ but only a portion of it comes from the bank. The FDIC covers the rest. This is a situation in which the FDIC takes over the bank, pays off $[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ to the insured depositors, and then shares the remaining assets of the bank proportionately with the uninsured depositors.35 The proportions are determined by the relative contributions of insured and uninsured deposits to the total deposit base. That is, whenever there is insolvency (i.e., $A(\theta)<[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+B)$ , the amount collected by the uninsured depositors is  

$$
D(\theta)=\left[\frac{B}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)
$$  

and the amount collected by the FDIC is  

$$
F(\theta)=\left[\frac{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{i}}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta).
$$  

We can now write down each party’s payoff at the end of the first period. First, the insured depositors receive $[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ regardless of $\theta$ Second, the uninsured depositors receive  

$$
D(\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{B}&{\mathrm{if~}A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{i}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ {A(\theta)/\left[B+[1+r_{\mathrm{i}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}\right]}&{\mathrm{otherwise.}}\end{array}\right.
$$  

The bank’s shareholders receive (at the end of the period)  

$$
S(\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{A(\theta)-B-[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}&{\mathrm{if}~A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ {0}&{\mathrm{otherwise.}}\end{array}\right.
$$  

The FDIC receives (at the end of the period)  

$$
F(\theta)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{\mathrm{if~}A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{i}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ {-[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+\left[\displaystyle\frac{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)}&{\mathrm{otherwise}.}\end{array}\right.
$$  

Note that the lower term in Equation (11.6) applies when $A(\theta)<B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}},$ so that  

$$
-[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+\left[\frac{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)<0.
$$  

Thus, the end-of-period cash flow to the FDIC is always zero or less.  

At the start of the period, the bank’s shareholders pay a deposit insurance premium to the FDIC. We assume that this premium is risk insensitive and fairly priced. Let $p$ denote this premium. To write down this premium, let us rank-order the states $\theta$ in increasing order of $A(\theta),$ so that $A(1)<A(2)<...<A(N)$ . Let $\theta=m$ be the state such that $A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ for all $\theta>m$ and $A(\theta)<B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}$ for all $\theta<m$ Then, the expected value of Equation (11.6) is  

$$
\pi=\frac{1}{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]}\sum_{\theta=1}^{m}p(\theta)\left\{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}-\left[\frac{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)\right\}.
$$  

That is, the deposit insurance premium is equal to the discounted present value of the FDIC’s liability. The question is: What is the NPV of the bank’s shareholders’ investment? This is seen to be  

$$
{\mathsf{N P V}}={\frac{1}{[1+r_{E}]}}E[S(\theta)]-\pi-d_{\mathrm{e}}
$$  

where $E(\bullet)$ means “expected value” and $S(\theta)$ is given by Equation (11.5). Now note how B and $d_{\mathrm{u}}$ are linked. Using Equations 11.1) and (11.4) we see that they are linked as follows.  

$$
\sum_{\theta=1}^{m}p(\theta)U\left\{\left[\frac{B}{B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)\right\}+\sum_{\theta=m+1}^{N}p(\theta)U(B)=U\{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{u}}\}.
$$  

The left-hand side (LHS) of Equation  11.9) is the uninsured depositor’s expected utility from investing in that deposit; this is obtained directly from Equation  11.4). We are using Equation  11.1) as an equality here because the bank, whose objective is to maximize the wealth of its shareholders, will pay the minimum amount required to attract funds from the uninsured depositor.  

t is clear now that the higher $d_{\mathrm{u}}$ is, the higher $B$ will have to be to satisfy Equation  11.9). Raising $B$ has two effects. One is that it increases the amount collected by the uninsured depositor when the bank is solvent. The other is that it increases the uninsured depositor’s proportional share of the bank’s assets in insolvency.  

For any fixed $d_{\mathrm{u}},$ B must also increase as the uninsured depositor becomes more risk averse. This is because he demands a higher risk premium, or a higher expected value for his risky payoff. Of course, as $B$ increases, $S(\theta)$ decreases, so that the bank’s shareholders become worse off as the uninsured depositor becomes more risk averse [see Equation  11.8)]. This provides a strong motivation for securitization with recourse because of the possibility of reducing the risk borne by the uninsured depositor. We will now see how this is achieved.  

To incorporate securitization into this model, let us partition the bank’s assets into two portfolios – a balance sheet portfolio, ${\mathbf{}}A_{\mathrm{b}},$ and an off-balance sheet portfolio, $A_{\mathrm{o}}$ The loans in $A_{\mathrm{b}}$ are funded with insured deposits and equity, which add up to $d_{\mathrm{i}}+d_{\mathrm{e}}$ dollars. The loans in $A_{\mathrm{o}}$ are funded with securitized bonds that fetch the bank $\${d}_{\mathrm{u}}$ These two portfolios combined give the same payoff as before, that is,  

$$
A(\theta)=A_{\mathrm{b}}(\theta)+A_{\mathrm{0}}(\theta).
$$  

We assume that the bank continues to service the loans’ securities. In doing so, the bank directs receipts of loan payments to the depositors. The key feature of this new arrangement, however, is that the receipts from $A_{0}(\theta)$ are committed to repay the securitized bonds first. Only after these bonds are fully paid off can the revenues be directed elsewhere. That is, the securitized bondholder has a senior claim on the payment stream $A_{0}(\theta)$ . Adding the option of securitized bond gives the holder additional protection by allowing him to change his claim to that of a balance sheet liability if the revenues from $A_{0}(\theta)$ are inadequate. In this case, he exercises his claim just like an uninsured depositor, as $A_{0}(\theta)$ and $A_{\mathrm{b}}(\theta)$ are pooled together. Thus, when the securitized bondholder exercises his recourse option, he is limited to a prorata claim on the total portfolio $A(\theta)$ . Let $B^{*}$ be the amount promised to the securitized bond.  

The securitized bondholder thus receives  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{B^{*}\mathrm{if}\ A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\\ &{B^{*}\mathrm{if}\ A(\theta)\geq B+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}\mathrm{and}A_{0}(\theta)\geq B}\\ &{D^{*}(\theta)=\left[\frac{B^{*}}{B^{*}+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}}\right]A(\theta)\mathrm{otherwise}.}\end{array}
$$  

This payoff structure is illustrated in the figure below. We have defined $\theta={\mathfrak{n}}$ as the state in which $B^{*}=A_{0}(\theta)$ .  

n Figure 11.10  we have assumed, for comparability, that $B^{*}=B,$ that is, the promised repayment amount is the same for uninsured deposits and the securitized bond. In that case it is clear that securitization gives the uninsured depositor a higher payoff for the same repayment amount. This higher amount comes from the additional-option feature embedded in the securitization contract. In the context of our model, what is held fixed across the securitization and no-securitization alternatives is not the promised repayment, but the initial amount raised from uninsured creditors, which is $d_{\mathrm{u}}$ When $d_{\mathrm{u}}$ is held fixed, we have $B^{*}<B$  

![](images/59112e6b54650b2f4fbc140e6fd2a20327ea64805c6fa89df0b3236d8b53013f.jpg)  
FIGURE 11.10 State-Contingent Payoff to Securitized Bondholder.  

Rather than formally prove that securitization with recourse improves the wealth of the bank’s shareholders, we will provide a numerical example to make the point. The basic intuition is simply that both the FDIC and the bank’s shareholder are risk neutral and hence “better able” to absorb risk than the risk-averse uninsured depositor. Securitization with recourse transfers some risk away from the uninsured depositor to these parties, thereby improving risk sharing. The effect is to reduce the amount that the bank’s shareholders must promise to repay the uninsured creditor, which increases the expected value of the shareholders’ claim. It also increases the riskiness of their claim, but they do not care about that because they are risk neutral.  

Example 11.3 The North American Bank needs to raise $\$50$ in financing at the beginning of the period to finance an investment that will yield a random payoff at the end of the period. This payoff has the following probability distribution.   


<html><body><table><tr><td>State 0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td> Payoff A(0)</td><td>$0</td><td>$50</td><td> $100</td><td>$150</td></tr><tr><td>Probability p(θ)</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.25</td></tr></table></body></html>  

The single-period riskless interest rate is 0.10. The bank must raise $\$30$ in FDIC-insured deposits, $\$15$ in uninsured deposits (with or without securitization) and $\$5$ in equity. North American’s shareholders and the FDIC are risk neutral. The uninsured depositor is risk averse with utility $U(w)=\sqrt{w}$ for wealth $w\geq0$ . Compute the NPV to North American’s shareholders when: (i) they finance conventionally using deposits and (ii) when they issue a securitized bond that has a preferred claim on a specially designated asset portfolio that represents $60\%$ of the payoff on $A(\theta)$ in any state.  

# Solution  

We solve this problem in six steps. First, we consider conventional deposit financing and solve for B, the repayment that must be promised to the uninsured depositors in order to raise $\$15$ from them. We do this by using Equation  11.9). Second, we solve for the insurance premium, $\neq,$ using Equation (11.7)  Third, we compute the NPV to North American’s shareholders. Fourth, we consider the alternative of issuing a securitized bond and solve for $B^{*}$ , the amount promised to the securitized bond. Fifth, we solve for the insurance premium in this case. Finally, in Step 6 we solve for the NPV accruing to North American’s shareholders with securitization, which is higher than the NPV accruing to them with conventional deposit financing.  

# Step 1  

Let us consider (i) first. Note that $d_{\mathrm{i}}=30,d_{\mathrm{u}}=15,d_{\mathrm{e}}=5,$ and $r_{\mathrm{f}}=0.10$ . Since the claim of insured depositors is riskless, the interest rate on these deposits should be the riskless rate, $10\%$ . Thus, North American’s repayment obligation to these depositors is $d_{\mathrm{i}}[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]=30[1.1]=\S33.$ The bank’s total repayment obligation to its creditors is $33+B$ To solve for $B$ we need to conjecture about its value first, so that we can identify the states in which North American is solvent and those in which it is not. Suppose we conjecture that $50<33+B<100.$ . Then North American will be insolvent in States 1 and 2, and solvent in States 3 and 4. We now solve for $B$ using Equation (11.9):  

expected utility payoffs in States 1and 2 expected utility payoffs in States 3 and 4  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{0.25\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{B}{B+33}\right]\times50}\qquad+\qquad0.5\sqrt{B}=\sqrt{1.1\times15.}\end{array}
$$  

Solving this equation gives $B=\$32$ , approximately. This means our conjecture is valid and that $B+33=\$65$ .  

# Step 2  

Next we solve for the insurance premium using Equation (11.7).  

$$
\pi=\frac{1}{1.1}\left\{0.25\times33+0.25\left[33-\left(\frac{33}{65}\times50\right)\right]\right\}={\tt S9.23}.
$$  

Step 3   
Further, since North American’s shareholders receive something only in the solvency States (3 and 4), the expected value of the   
payoff for shareholders is  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{E[S(\theta)]=0.25[100-65]+0.25[150-65]=\S30.}\end{array}
$$  

Thus, the NPV of North American’s shareholders is given by Equation (11.8) as  

$$
{\mathsf{N P V}}={\frac{30}{1.1}}-9.23-5=\S13.04.
$$  

Step 4 Now consider (ii). With securitization, the payoff stream of the total asset portfolio is split up as follows (Tables 11.2 .  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="5">TABLE 11.2 Payoff Distributions for Portfolios</td></tr><tr><td>State</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Payoff A(0)</td><td>0</td><td>50</td><td>100</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>Payoff to securitized bondf Ao (0)</td><td>0</td><td>30</td><td>60</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Payoff from on-balance sheet asset Ab (0)</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>40</td><td>60</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Now, suppose we conjecture that $50<B^{*}+33<100$ and that $B^{*}\leq\$30$ . Then, state 1 is the only state in which the holder of the securitized bond gets less than the amount promised. Thus, ${\mathsf{B}}^{*}$ is obtained by solving the following equation.  

$$
\displaystyle\mathbf{0.75\times\sqrt{B^{*}}}=\sqrt{1.1\times15}=4.062.
$$  

which yields $B^{*}=\$29.33$ .  

Step 5 We can now solve for the deposit insurance premium, which is  

$$
\pi=\frac{1}{[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]}\Big\{p(1)[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}+p(2)\Big[[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}-\Big\{A_{\mathrm{b}}(2)+A_{\mathrm{O}}(2)-B^{*}\Big\}\Big]\Big\}.
$$  

Note that the FDIC is liable for payments only in States 1 and 2. In State 1, it is liable for the entire repayment promised to the insured depositors, whereas in State 2, it is liable for that amount minus what it collects on the balance sheet asset, $A_{\mathrm{b}}$ (2), and whatever is left over on the off-balance sheet asset after the securitized bondholder is paid, $A_{\mathrm{o}}\left(2\right)-B^{*}$ . Thus,  

$$
\displaystyle\pi=\left\{\frac{1}{[1+r_{\mathrm{i}}]}\left\{0.25\times33+0.25\left[33-\left\{20+(30-29.33)\right\}\right]\right\}\right\}
$$  

Step 6  

Now, $B^{*}+[1+r_{\mathrm{f}}]d_{\mathrm{i}}=29.33+33=\S62.33$ . Thus, $\begin{array}{r}{E[S(6)]=0.25[100-62.33]+0.25[150-62.33]=\S31.34.}\end{array}$ This means  

$$
{\mathsf{N P V}}={\frac{31.34}{1.1}}-10.30-5=\S13.19.
$$  

Thus, in this example securitization results in a $1.16\%$ increase in the NPV accruing to the North American Bank’s shareholders, and this gain is due to the differing risk preferences of uninsured depositors and the banks and their insurer.  

# How Much Securitization?  

Given the proliferation in ABS and the spread of securitization to even intangible assets, an obvious question might be: Can and should everything be securitized? The answer is no, and there are three main factors that explain why there are still assets that have not been securitized.36 These are discussed below.  

1. Ease of Standardization: First, for an asset to be profitably securitized, it should be relatively easy to “standardize.” That is, its contract features should make it a component of a relatively homogeneous portfolio of other similar assets. Mortgage loans are an excellent example. Mortgage contracts are standardized and their cash-flow patterns are, on average, quite predictable. This was not always the case. Indeed, the possibility of securitization prompted the standardization. Loans with special contract features (such as, HLT loans and some types of LBO loans secured partly by personal collateral of managers) are difficult to standardize and hence would be difficult to securitize, although we have already witnessed the securitization of LBO loans. The reason for the desirability of contractual homogeneity is related to transactions and information-processing costs. When a large number of individual loans are pooled, the investor only has to evaluate the portfolio return. This creates both “informational diversification” and “statistical risk diversification,” so that the portfolio cash flows are more predictable and less sensitive to the peculiarities of the individual assets. This eases the originator’s/issuer’s problem of designing specific securities based on the total portfolio cash flow. Moreover, it makes it easier for investors to evaluate the values of the securitized assets. This attracts a larger number of investors and improves the liquidity of the market for the securitized assets.  

This is not to say that more heterogeneous and information-sensitive assets, which are more difficult to standardize, cannot be securitized. Rather, such assets would require greater credit enhancements to be securitized; the limiting case is that of “full-recourse” securitization. When the assets that comprise the portfolio are very dissimilar and difficult to standardize, the portfolio cash flows become quite sensitive to the actual choice of securities that make up the portfolio. More credit enhancement would be needed for such a portfolio, and beyond some point, it may not be worthwhile for the originator to purchase the required credit enhancement. Thus, standardization can be viewed as conserving the originator’s capital in that a high credit rating can be obtained for the portfolio with less credit enhancement. Without the appropriate credit enhancement, the rating agencies and investors have to study individual securities in the portfolio more. To see this more clearly, consider the following example.  

# Example 11.4  

Suppose there are three possible assets from which the North American Bank can choose two to securitize. Call these assets a, b, and c. The assets are quite similar and their cash-flow distributions are as described below. The probability of “success” for asset $\boldsymbol{{j}}$ is $p_{i}$ Compute the probability distributions of the various portfolio combinations. How important would it be for an investor to know precisely which two assets were in the securitized portfolio? Would your answer change if asset c were replaced by asset d, which has a cash flow that is uniformly distributed over [0, 1000].

FIGURE 11.11 Probability Distributions of Assets a, b, and c.  

# Solution  

We will solve this problem in two steps. First, we will compute probability distributions for the three possible portfolio combinations – ab, ac, and bc – and conclude that they are pretty similar. Second, we will show that replacing c by d would make a significant difference in that the investor will now need to know the portfolio composition.  

# Step 1  

Now, if North American were to choose assets a and ${\bf b},$ the total portfolio cash-flow distribution would be: 0 with probability 0.06 (which is $[1-p_{\mathrm{a}}]\times[1-p_{\mathrm{b}}])$ , 220 with probability 0.56 (which is $p_{\mathrm{{a}}}\times p_{\mathrm{{b}}})$ , 100 with probability 0.24 (which is $p_{\mathrm{{a}}}\times[1-p_{\mathrm{{b}}}]),$ and 120 with probability 0.14 (which is $[1-p_{\mathrm{a}}]\times p_{\mathrm{b}})$ . The expected value would be 164. If the issuer were to assemble the portfolio with assets a and $\mathbf{C},$ the probability distribution would be: 0 with probability 0.03, 210 with probability 0.27. The expected value would be 161. Similarly, if the portfolio consisted of b and c, the probability distribution would be: 0 with probability 0.03, 210 with probability 0.63, 120 with probability 0.07, and 90 with probability 0.27. The expected value would be 165. The portfolio payoffs are summarized in Table 11.3  

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="6"> TABLE 11.3 Probability Distributions of Various Portfolios</td></tr><tr><td> State/Portfolio</td><td>Low Cash Flow and Probability</td><td>Medium Cash Flow and Probability</td><td>Above-Medium Cash Flow and Probability</td><td>High Cash Flow and Probability</td><td>Expected</td></tr><tr><td> a and b</td><td>0 w.p. 0.06</td><td>100 w.p. 0.24</td><td>120 w.p.0.14</td><td>220 w.p.0.56</td><td>Value 164</td></tr><tr><td> a and c</td><td>O w.p. 0.02</td><td>90 w.p. 0.18</td><td>100 w.p.0.08</td><td>190 w.p.0.72</td><td>161</td></tr><tr><td>b and c</td><td>0 w.p. 0.03</td><td>90 w.p. 0.27</td><td>120 w.p.0.07</td><td>210 w.p.0.63</td><td>165</td></tr></table></body></html>  

Clearly, if you were an investor deciding whether to buy a piece of the portfolio, it would not be terribly important to know the precise composition of that portfolio. All the portfolios have similar expected values and each portfolio has a low probability of a low cash-flow realization, a high probability of a high cash-flow realization and intermediate probabilities for the medium and above-medium cash flows.  

Step 2   
Now imagine that c is replaced by asset d, which has a cash flow that is uniformly distributed over [0,1000]. It is now easy to see that it will be quite important for the investor to know which assets are in the portfolio. For example, a combination of a and d has an expected value of $\$580$ (the expected value of a is $\$80$ and the expected value of d is $\$500$ ), whereas a combination of a and b has an expected value of $\$164$ . And if the portfolio cash flows are partitioned, it will be even more important for the junior claimants to know the portfolio composition. This is why homogeneous pools of assets are easier to securitize.  

2. Extent of Private Information: Another important consideration is the extent of private information about the asset. If the loan originator has substantial information about the loan that others do not have, then information communication costs might deter securitization. This point is related to homogeneity in that information-sensitive assets are more difficult to standardize. But, even if the loan portfolio is homogeneous, it may be costly to securitize if each loan in the portfolio is steeped in private information possessed by the originator. Truly “opaque” assets are usually difficult to sell at anywhere close to their true value. Consequently, steep discounts may be needed to entice investors to buy assets they do not fully understand. It may not benefit the originator to securitize such assets. For example, it would be difficult to securitize and sell in the United States a portfolio of consumer loans made by a local bank in Nigeria, particularly if reliable statistics on historical repayment patterns were unavailable. By contrast, U.S. creditcard receivables are relatively easy to securitize in the United States. There is only cursory initial screening of creditcard applicants, so there is not much that the lender knows that others do not know. Moreover, the contract itself is fairly standardized, and repayment patterns of portfolios of credit cards are quite predictable. A similar argument holds for consumer mortgages. Screening procedures for determining who gets a mortgage loan are standardized, so that once a person is given a mortgage contract, she falls in a pool about which the original lender knows little more than the rating agencies and investors.  

One important implication of how private information affects assets chosen for securitization is that the quality of the assets on the balance sheets of banks may deteriorate. The assets that are securitized are typically more liquid. Assets that stay on the books are likely to be less liquid and have other problems as well.37 The bank may prefer to keep these lower-quality assets on its books because it may be able to sell them only at steep discounts relative to their “true” values, which may be privately known only to the bank. Since there is often an inverse relationship between liquidity and risk, the bank’s portfolio risk may increase due to securitization. Mitigating this concern is the fact that banks can diversify by buying securitized claims against loans originated by others.  

Of course, as information technology advances, the costs of processing and communicating financial information decline. This makes securitization less costly. The obvious implication is that securitization can be expected to grow in scope and volume.  

3. Moral Hazard: With traditional lending, the original lender combines origination, underwriting, funding, and servicing of the loan. The lender then has an incentive to monitor the loan. As we saw in Chapter 3  monitoring is an important activity of banks. With securitization, however, origination and funding are separated. This weakens the originator’s incentive to monitor the loans in the securitized portfolio.38 The reason is that monitoring is costly to the originator, and the benefits of the monitoring – an improvement in the cash flows from the securitized portfolio – accrue to the investors who have purchased the securities, not to the originator. In this context, the traditional bank can be seen as a solution to the moral hazard that can accompany loan decomposition. An obvious solution is to shift some of the credit risk back to the originator by employing securitization with partial recourse. This places the exposure with the party responsible for the monitoring, and hence reduces moral hazard.  

However, recourse raises other accounting/regulatory problems. Recall that one strong incentive to securitize comes from capital and reserve requirements, deposit insurance premiums, and other costs, which add an estimated 125 basis points to the funding costs of deposit-takers. If loans are securitized with recourse, they are not usually removed from the books, and hence none of the regulatory costs are avoided. However, the originator can utilize alternatives to recourse as a way to deal with moral hazard without keeping the loans on its books. Senior/subordinated structures, overcollateralization, and third-party guarantees can all provide credit enhancement to attenuate moral hazard.  

Credit enhancement deals with moral hazard in two ways. First, it directly improves the credit quality of the securitized asset, so that investors are less affected by the quality of underwriting and monitoring provided by the originator. Second, it creates an incentive for the credit enhancer to monitor the originator to ensure that the originator is underwriting and monitoring the loans in the securitized portfolio. We can expect the credit enhancer to be specialized in monitoring and thus monitor the originator more efficiently than individual investors can. Moreover, just as a bank saves on monitoring costs by centralizing the monitoring activity and thereby avoiding duplication of efforts (Chapter 3), a credit enhancer can save on monitoring costs that would otherwise be greater because of duplicated monitoring by individual investors. There are, however, natural limits to the gains from credit enhancement since the marginal effectiveness of the credit enhancer’s monitoring will expectedly decline with more monitoring (diminishing returns to scale). This will be reflected in the fee charged to the originator by the credit enhancer. Depending on the nature of the asset (in particular, the sensitivity of its cash flow to monitoring by the originator) and the level of credit enhancement sought, a point may be reached beyond which further credit enhancement is not justified from the originator’s standpoint. And there may well be assets that are better for the originator to fund with deposits than to securitize and credit enhance up to the optimal limit, because of moral hazard.  

Some types of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans are unlikely candidates for securitization, although we anticipate this to be a shrinking list. Loans whose values are highly dependent on lender monitoring are usually subject to a great deal of moral hazard, as we have seen in Chapters 7 and 8  Such loans are difficult to securitize because the required credit enhancement would be too costly. Put differently, unpredictability in the quality of monitoring provided by the originating lender may lead to a lot of unpredictability in the cash flows generated by such loans. We would expect, on moral hazard grounds, that such loans would be securitized infrequently. This is what we observe. However, despite this, we expect few, if any, C&I loans to not be securitized in the future.  

Although things like credit enhancement and recourse can attenuate the basic moral hazard involved in securitization, it is still interesting to ask whether the incentives of banks are, in practice, affected by the knowledge that a loan that the bank is originating will subsequently be securitized. An empirical investigation of this using data on securitized subprime mortgages addressed this question.39 In the mortgage market, a rule of thumb used by investors is the FICO score of the mortgage borrower.40 Loans made to borrowers that fall just above a cut-off FICO score of 620 have a higher unconditional likelihood of being securitized than loans that fall just below 620. While one might imagine that a loan with a FICO score of 619 has about the same (or slightly higher) credit risk than a loan with a FICO score of 621, the evidence shows that lowdocumentation loans that are originated at a FICO score just above the threshold of 620 tend to default within two years of origination at a rate that is higher than the rate at which loans just below the FICO score of 620.  

An important reason is that the loans with FICO scores of $620+$ have greater liquidity for the originator than those with FICO scores of $620-$ This additional liquidity works through two channels, both of which tend to weaken the lender’s screening incentives: the securitization rate and the time it takes to securitize the loan. As for the securitization rate, a $620+$ loan is $10\%$ more likely to be securitized than a $620-$ loan. As for the time it takes to securitize, an accepted $620-$ lowdocumentation, subprime loan stays on the lender’s balance sheet for almost two months longer than an accepted $620+$ loan. The impact of the weakened screening incentives is large – the portfolio of low-documentation non-agency loans with greater ease of securitization – along the two dimensions described above – defaults at a $20\%$ higher rate than a similar-risk portfolio with lesser ease of securitization.  

These empirical findings have the striking implication that the credit screening incentives of mortgage loan originator seem to be affected by whether the loan will be securitized. When an originator knows that a loan is more likely to be held on its books rather than being securitized, it tends to screen the borrower more carefully before making the loan.  

# STRATEGIC ISSUES FOR A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION INVOLVED IN SECURITIZATION  

Securitization is technology for liquefying claims and diversifying funding sources management by banks and other financial institutions. Its enormous growth is only one of the indicators of an ongoing revolution of ideas in the capital markets.  

# Securitization as a Balance Sheet Management Tool  

As already seen, securitization can be used by a financial institution to manage a variety of risks. These are:  

Interest rate risk, Prepayment risk, Credit risk, Liquidity risk.  

Most of the loan sales and loan participations involve sales without explicit recourse to the originating lender, so that all the risks listed above are sold off together. In the ABS market, recourse is much more common, so that only some of the risks are disposed of by the seller. The reason for this difference is not hard to see. Loan sales and participations involve banks dealing with each other or with other financial institutions that are quite capable of assessing the risks involved and ensuring adequate monitoring.41 Recourse, with its associated regulatory costs, is therefore avoided. But securitization involves a financial institution dealing with smaller investors who must be reassured through recourse that adequate monitoring will be provided.  

The management implication is that the financial institution must carefully balance the gains from laying off risk through securitization (without recourse) against the cost of securitizing. On the one hand, deposit funding, which is an alternative to securitization, has an interest cost plus a regulatory cost. On the other hand, securitization involves a fixed cost (legal costs plus distribution costs) plus a credit-enhancement cost (which is a function of the heterogeneity and information sensitivity of the asset pool). These costs of alternative funding modes will determine the institution’s choices about which assets to securitize and how much recourse to offer the buyers. As we have seen earlier, assets that are very “opaque” may be hard to securitize. The institution may prefer to either involve other lenders in a participation arrangement or fund it entirely by itself. In other words, balance sheet funding will be chosen when the financial institution has a comparative advantage in “piercing the veil” of an “opaque” asset but finds it difficult to explain its value to investors.  

# Securitization as a Pricing Tool  

With easier entry into banking, over the past several years banks have had to come up with ways to cope with greater price competition. While banks must be competitive, they also must make sure that they are pricing at profitable levels. Some banks attempt to do this by setting a minimum interest rate at which they will originate loans. They call this the “minimum buy rate” and set it at their estimated cost of funding those loans, plus a spread that provides a minimum acceptable return. Unfortunately, banks often cannot determine precisely the real funding cost of any particular asset. Many use rough approximations based on their average overall cost of funds.  

Securitization can help the bank improve the accuracy of its pricing. For example, if a bank is continually putting originated assets into a securitized pool, it can base its pricing directly on the funding costs for that asset. This will ensure consistent market-driven pricing and guarantee that the bank is always originating assets at a profitable spread. Moreover, since securitization helps the originating bank to avoid the costs of reserve and capital requirements, it may provide a competitive advantage over nonsecuritizing bank competitors. This permits the bank to either lower its prices and increase market share, or earn higher profit margins at current prices.  

# Securitization as a Strategic Weapon for Market Penetration and Diversification  

# Market Penetration  

After having conducted a thorough analysis of its comparative advantage in specific markets, suppose your bank decides that its optimal strategy is to be a price leader in a given market and to expand market share. However, you are worried that there is substantial risk in that rapidly changing market conditions could mean that net interest margin (the difference between the loan interest rate and the bank’s cost of funding that loan) fluctuates randomly, sometimes falling below the minimum required return on allocated capital. For strategic reasons, continuous presence in the market is necessary for your bank. The randomness in your future interest margin means, however, that such strategically motivated continuity may prove quite costly. It could force your bank to suffer periodic losses in order to retain its foothold in the market. This is a form of underinvestment problem in that you may be forced to forgo investment because of short-run costs, even though continued presence may be best for you in the long run.  

An intelligently designed securitization program can be an excellent strategic weapon in overcoming this impediment. Suppose your bank has targeted the market for high-quality, low-margin auto loans. Then you could establish participation in a commercial paper program into which these loans can be periodically placed. Pricing on the auto loans can be adjusted daily to be in tune with market conditions. You can determine the margin on any loan at the time of origination, and compute the profitability of funding the loan with deposits as well as funding it through your participation in a commercial paper program. If the loan is unprofitable with either the deposit funding or the securitization alternative, then you may want to let the lending opportunity pass. If it is most profitable to fund the loan with deposits, you could mark it to be held on your bank’s balance sheet. But suppose that this loan is unprofitable to fund with deposits. Then, rather than pass up the lending opportunity, you could examine whether it is profitable to securitize the loan. There will be instances in which securitization (at the commercial paper cost) is profitable for you even when balance sheet lending is not. Thus, the bank can ensure greater continuity of presence in its strategically chosen market segment by resorting to securitization. In essence, this is an argument for maintaining numerous funding sources even when there is a fixed cost to doing so. Note that such a strategy could also be motivated for liquidity reasons.  

# Diversification  

As we saw in Chapter 7  asset portfolio diversification can significantly reduce a bank’s risk of ruin. This is hardly a new insight. Virtually all bankers are aware of it. Yet there seems to be a trend toward increased concentration in loan portfolios.42 This is particularly true for C&I loan portfolios. The reason is that increasing competition has forced banks to carve out competitive niches in order to maintain profit margins. Banks have specialized their lending in markets where they have a comparative advantage. And this leads quite naturally to geographic or industry concentration, or both. A conflict arises, therefore, between specialization and diversification.  

Bankers initially responded to this conflict by engaging in international lending and by expanding through nationwide networks of loan production offices that were intended to overcome the shackles of state banking laws. For many banks, however, the results were disappointing. Losses resulted from an inadequate knowledge of the new credit environment and from the increased marketing expenditures needed to develop new relationships. The reaction to these unsuccessful diversification attempts was a retreat to familiar regional/industry market segments.  

Securitization can rescue loan portfolios from underdiversification by permitting banks to overcome geographic limitations. Banks can originate and service loans to borrowers about whom they know more than others. The rewards for their superior knowledge will be reflected in the higher spreads and profit margins. But there is no need to sacrifice diversification by also funding these loans. The originating bank can securitize some of these loans and thereby free up capital to pursue other lending opportunities and diversify. Moreover, the bank also can purchase loans securitized by banks that specialize in other industries and geographical areas. This too will facilitate diversification.  

From the standpoint of the bank’s overall strategy, securitization opens doors that were previously closed. A bank can aggressively pursue new markets without having to plan for periodic losses in the future just to retain its foothold in those markets, as well as specialize in industries and regions without risking under diversification.  

# Strategic Decisions and Securitization Structures  

As the regulatory and competitive environment for banks further evolves, securitization will have to continue to adapt as it has adapted until now. Corporate ingenuity has thus far come up with innovative securitization structures that permit the implementation of the tactical and strategic goals of banks, and has resulted in an increasing number of tangible and intangible assets being securitized. We expect this trend to continue.  

# COMPARISON OF LOAN SALES AND LOAN SECURITIZATION  

A loan sale, which we considered in Chapter 9  is similar to asset securitization with three basic differences. First, a loan sale merely transfers a part of the ownership of the loan portfolio from the originator to others, whereas securitization alters patterns of cash flows and other asset properties. Thus, a loan sale is a brokerage function, whereas securitization involves qualitative asset transformation (recall Chapter 2). Second, with securitization, claims against the asset are sold as securities in the capital market so that the original loans are converted into market-traded securities, whereas with a loan sale the asset is merely transferred from one bank to the other without material qualitative transformation. Third, most loan sales are made without explicit recourse to the seller. Moreover, unlike securitization, there are usually no guarantees, insurance, or any other type of explicit credit enhancement, although the portion of the loan retained by the originator functions somewhat like credit enhancement in attenuating moral hazard. Thus, a loan sale usually removes the loan permanently from the seller’s balance sheet.  

One striking difference between loan sales and securitization is that with a loan sale to another bank, the asset stays within the banking industry, whereas with securitization, it is converted into a capital market investment. However, loan sales and securitization provide a bank with similar advantages in terms of strategic choices. The bank’s ability to specialize in originating, servicing, and monitoring loans to borrowers in specific regions and from specific industries can be put to profitable use without compromising diversification objectives, when the bank designs and implements a comprehensive loan sales and asset-securitization program.43  

# CONCLUSION  

The adverse impact of the 2007–2009 financial crisis on some securitization markets has been quite severe. The ABCP market has more or less come to a standstill. However, securitization is a technology that can have distinct benefits when executed appropriately. It promotes diversification benefits and lowers funding costs. Given the significant benefits, the trend toward securitization is likely to continue in the absence of a substantial decrease in the relative cost of traditional funding for banks and thrifts. Banks’ relative funding advantages of the past were based on deposit interest rate ceilings, discounting and advances, deposit insurance and the tax system, and regulated entry into banking. It is unlikely that these advantages will return, particularly in light of the significantly higher regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty faced by banks now. Thus, securitization is likely to grow, as long as workable solutions to the moral hazard problem can be developed. If these solutions involve some form of recourse on the part of the originator, then they will need to satisfy accountants, regulators, and the contracting parties.  

Securitization has been at the heart of the development of the shadow banking system. Shadow banks are defined as “financial entities other than regulated depository institutions (commercial banks, thrifts, and credit unions) that serve as intermediaries to channel savings into investments,”44 and such “channeling” occurs through securitization. The key players in the shadow banking system are ABS, ABCP conduits, repurchase agreements (repos), and MMFs.  

# CASE STUDY: LONE STAR BANK  

# Introduction  

Lone Star Bank is a relatively small but rapidly growing regional bank based in Palo Alto, California. In recent years, the bank has specialized in loans to small personal computer manufacturers. Historically, these customers have been mostly located in and around the Palo Alto and surrounding “Silicon Valley” area, but in the past few years, the bank has pursued similar business in other high-tech growth communities. Although the bank is not as large as some of its competitors, it has generated a strong reputation as a bank that understands the computer industry.  

John Langston, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lone Star, believes that growth in the personal computer industry will continue to be substantial. The bank would like to parlay its current reputation and expertise into a much larger presence, but faces two major constraints. First, keeping up with the fast growth of the industry will require the bank to deal with difficult funding issues, since the base of deposits available to the bank is limited by a variety of regulations and competitive considerations. In particular, leverage-ratio constraints would require the bank to raise additional capital to support a larger deposit base, and this is considered a costly alternative. Second, the bank must maintain a fairly continuous presence in the market for strategic reasons. A loss in market share could allow competitors to develop equally strong reputations for understanding the business.  

With these considerations in mind, Langston calls Lana Tanner and Hugh Akston, executive vice presidents, into his office to discuss his concerns about the bank’s loan pricing policies.  

# The Initial Meeting  

Langston: You both know our situation. Since we’ve been doing these computer company loans, we’ve had great success. We saw an opportunity that other banks didn’t understand. But I’m concerned about a couple of things. First, our business loan portfolio is getting to be really heavily concentrated in the computer industry. (See Exhibit A.) Second, I’m worried that our success in lending to this segment might mean that we aren’t pricing these loans correctly. Our return on assets has been slipping a bit lately (see Exhibit B)  and I think we may be pricing our loans too cheaply.  

Tanner: Well, the obvious thing to do would be to try to diversify by going into some other markets. But we can’t forget the fiasco we had a couple of years back, when we thought we would expand heavily into real estate development loans. (See Exhibit C.)  

Langston: (He groans.) Ugh, that’s for sure. We took a hit on that one. I think we’ve learned a lesson there. We should stick to what we are good at.  

Akston: Well, the next thing to look at would be the sale of some of our assets. By transferring some of the funding of loans elsewhere, we would concentrate on what we do best: identifying and monitoring successful firms. That way, we could stay in this industry segment while simultaneously diversifying our portfolio. I’ve talked to some other banks about doing some loan sales.  

Langston: Great! Does that look promising?  

Akston: Unfortunately, it really doesn’t. Most of the companies we deal with are fairly small, as you know. The fact that all of these companies are producing a product that is something like a commodity to the end-user means that slight differences in technology or costs can make all the difference in the world to company profitability. We’ve got our team of computer wizards who are on top of all that. Ironically, though, the same knowledge advantage that has allowed us to beat the bigger banks in this market makes them too scared to buy loans from us directly. They don’t think that they can tell the good borrowers from the bad ones as well as we can. And they are afraid that we would pawn off our losers on them. The bottom line is that we would have to either sell the loans for a lot less than they are really worth, or else provide a lot of credit enhancement. (See Exhibit D.)  

Langsten: Well, I want the two of you to check into this in detail, particularly the possibility of securitizing some of our loan portfolio. Find out what our options are, and get back to me next week.  

[The meeting ends. Lana Tanner and Hugh Akston start working on the options available to the bank. Tanner will look into various kinds of securitization markets, while Akston will check into accounting and regulatory concerns.]  

# The Second Meeting  

Langsten: Well, Lana, you were going to look into the possibility of more direct securitization. Do you think we could package several of our loans into a pool for sale as asset-backed bonds?  

Tanner: Unfortunately, even though the companies we lend to produce very similar products for sale, they vary widely in financial structure, costs, and so forth. For example, Gell Microsystems has a long-term contract with Sintel to buy memory chips at present prices. So if Washington imposes tariffs on Japanese chips, thus raising the overall cost of memory chips, Gell will benefit. Other companies have a variety of long-term or short-term contracts with other parts of the industry, including some really complicated software licensing arrangements. Quite simply put, these companies are not very homogeneous. (See Exhibit E.) About the only thing they have in common is their industry and the fact that they do a significant portion of their sales through business lease agreements.  

Langston: So what’s the bottom line?  

Tanner: Well, we could try to package some of our loans to these companies, but the very different payoffs between these firms would mean that investors would have to know a lot about which firms were in the pool. The Wall Street people I talked to seemed to think that we would lose a lot of basis points in trying to sell these things, or else that we would have to overcollateralize or buy insurance bonds.  

Langston: Well, it seems that we are caught between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, we have the ability to identify and monitor good loan situations better than anyone else can. But this very advantage makes it difficult for us to get these loans off of our books.  

Akston: Also, there’s a factor that we haven’t talked about yet. As you mentioned, we are really heavily concentrated in one relatively narrow industry. Additionally, the personal computer industry has historically been very sensitive to macroeconomic changes. When the economy turns sour, individuals and businesses can easily postpone the purchase of a new computer. That means that all of the companies we fund probably have highly correlated patterns of default. Many of our individual customers work in the computer business, too, so that default patterns on our consumer loans are also correlated with the computer industry. If we securitize with recourse, we really haven’t diversified ourselves against an overall change in the computer business climate. A downturn would only be temporary, and we’ve weathered them before, but if we don’t get some real diversification, we will be much more leveraged with respect to this particular risk – and we might lose strategic market share to better-diversified banks during a tight squeeze.  

Langston: Ouch! Well, this is tough. Hugh, tell me what you found out.  

Akston: Well, one thing is clear. Unless we are willing to sell these loans at huge discounts, we will have to retain a significant amount of recourse. What that means is that, for RAP purposes especially, we will have a hard time getting this stuff off our books.  

Langston: O.K. Well, here’s what I’d like the two of you to do. We’ve discussed a lot of different options for the bank, but it is time to act. I’d like you to work together and systematically examine each of the options we’ve mentioned as well as any others you can think of. Report back to me what the pros and cons are of each approach, and give me your final recommendation about which policy would be best for us.  

# The Assignment  

Present the pros and cons of each approach mentioned in the case, being sure to cover the issues of fundamental importance.   
Try to think creatively about alternative solutions to come up with something potentially better for the bank.

# REVIEW QUESTIONS  

1. What are the similarities and the differences between loan sales and securitization?   
2. What are the four basic components of a lending transaction? Why were these unified in the first place and why are they being decomposed now through securitization?   
3. Discuss pass-through (both static and dynamic pool), ABBs, and pay-through, with particular focus on the differences between these contracts.   
4. What are CMOs and REMICs?   
5. Why are pass-throughs more popular than pay-throughs, and why are REMICs now replacing pass-throughs?   
6. What are I/O – P/O strips and how can they be used to hedge interest-rate risk?   
7. What are the supply- and demand-side forces stimulating securitization?   
8. What is asset-backed commercial paper? Why has it become popular? Why don’t corporations avoid banks and directly issue secured commercial paper?   
9. Are there any “natural” limits to securitization? What are these? What sort of assets are most likely to be securitized and what assets are likely to be securitized?   
10. Explain how a financial institution can use securitization as a tactical tool for balance sheet management and pricing, and as a strategic weapon for market penetration and diversification.   
11. What does the anticipated future growth of securitization portend for the viability of banks and the ability of the Fed to control monetary aggregates?   
12. Suppose bank A has two loans, each of which is due to be repaid one period hence and whose cash flows are independent and identically distributed random variables. Each loan will repay $\$250$ to the bank with probability 0.8 and $\$125$ with probability 0.2. However, while bank A knows this, prospective investors cannot distinguish this bank’s loan portfolio from that of bank B that has the same number of loans, but each of its loans will repay $\$250$ with probability 0.5 and $\$125$ with probability 0.5. The prior belief of investors is that there is a 0.4 probability that bank A has the higher-valued portfolio and 0.6 probability that it has the lower-valued portfolio. Suppose that bank A wishes to securitize these loans, and it knows that if it does so without credit enhancement, the cost of communicating the true value of its loans to investors is $8\%$ of the true value. Explore bank A’s securitization alternatives. Assuming that a credit enhancer is available and that the credit enhancer could (at negligible cost) determine the true value of the loan portfolio, what sort of credit enhancement should bank A purchase? Assume everybody is risk neutral and that the discount rate is zero.  

13. Given below is a conversation. Critique it.  

Moderator: O.K.! That’s one for you, Alex. But I don’t understand one thing. If banks are allowed to invest only in very safe assets, what happens to all of the assets that banks currently fund?   
Appleton: No big deal. These can be shifted to the capital market or funded with uninsured deposits.   
Moderator: But is such disintermediation or reintermediation necessarily a good thing?   
Appleton: I don’t see why not. Banks are already securitizing many of their assets, from credit-card receivables to mortgages. What I’m suggesting is only a natural extension of that process.   
Butterworth: Sure, but there are natural limits to securitization. Besides, even with securitization, the bank acts as an originator. What you’re proposing, Alex, is based, I think, on the premise that there is really nothing special about banks.
