# The 2007–2009 Financial Crisis and Other Financial Crises  

“In its analysis of the crisis, my testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities. The triggers of the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007–2009 – the proximate causes, if you will. Developments in the market for subprime mortgages were a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis. In contrast, the vulnerabilities were the structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the financial system and in regulation and supervision that served to propagate and amplify the initial shocks.”  

Chairman Ben Bernanke (April 13, 2012).1

# INTRODUCTION  

The financial crisis of 2007–2009 is widely regarded as the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s.2 The crisis threatened the global financial system with total collapse, led to the bailouts of many large financial institutions by their national governments, caused big declines in stock prices, followed by smaller and more expensive loans for corporate borrowers as banks pulled back from lending, and decline in consumer lending, as well as lower investments in the real sector.3 The decline in lending to consumers and corporations also caused unemployment to rise.4 In the United States, Lehman Brothers, a global 158-year old investment bank, filed for bankruptcy, whereas Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two huge government-sponsored enterprises that have been key players in the securitization market in the United States, as well as the insurance giant AIG, were bailed out by the government, and Wachovia (the fourth largest bank in the United States) was bought out by Citigroup. In response to these events, financial markets became highly volatile, and the Dow Jones

Industrial Average experienced its largest single-day point drop in value on September 29, 2008. Investor confidence fell dramatically and credit channels tightened considerably as the difference between the 3-month London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) and the 3-month Treasury bill rate – known as the TED spread – shot up, as shown in Figure 14.1  a reflection of growing fears about counterparty risk.5  

The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimates that the financial crisis cost the United States an estimated $40{-}90\%$ of 1 year’s output, an estimated $\$6-514$ trillion, the equivalent of $\$50,000$ for every U.S. household.6 Even these staggering estimates may be conservative. The loss of total U.S. wealth from the crisis – including human capital and the present value of future wage income – may be as high as $\$15-830$ trillion, or $100{-}190\%$ of the 2007 U.S. output.7 Table 14.1 provides estimates of different dimensions of the costs of the crisis, and Figure 14.2 shows that the rebound in output has been much weaker than in previous business cycles.  

In the aftermath of the crisis, the U.S. Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Act, an enormous piece of legislation that introduced sweeping changes in the regulation of the U.S. financial system and numerous regulatory changes were contemplated and implemented in Europe as well. In this chapter, we describe and analyze this financial crisis. We begin in the next section with an overview of what happened and the time-line of events. In the section after that, we develop a causal link of events to shed light on what caused the crisis, explaining where there seems to be consensus and where we still have differing opinions, and then discuss the real effects of the crisis. This is followed by a section that provides a brief description of the regulatory responses to the crisis, and assesses these responses. The penultimate section discusses crises in some other countries and compares these with the U.S. The final section concludes.

# WHAT HAPPENED  

The financial crisis of 2007–2009 came on the heels of a credit crunch that began in the summer of 2006 and continued into 2007. Most agree that the crisis was rooted in the U.S. housing market. The factors that contributed to the housing price bubble that burst during the crisis will be discussed later in this chapter. The first signs of problems surfaced in early 2007 when Freddie Mac announced that it would no longer purchase high-risk mortgages, and New Century Financial Corporation, a leading mortgage lender to risky borrowers, filed for bankruptcy. These developments elevated concerns about the credit risks in mortgages and the solvency of institutions that held them. A timeline of these events and those that followed is discussed below and summarized in Table 14.2  

These elevated insolvency concerns caused investors to withdraw their funds from various institutions. The crisis, according to most people, began in August 2007, with large-scale withdrawals of short-term funds from various markets previously considered safe, as reflected in sharp increases in the “haircuts” on repos and difficulties experienced by ABCP (asset-backed commercial paper) issuers experiencing difficulty in rolling over their outstanding paper.8  

It was the sharp decline in U.S. house prices that caused this stress in the short-term funding markets in the shadowbanking system during 2007. This caused credit rating agencies (CRAs) to downgrade their assessments of the creditworthiness of asset-backed financial instruments in mid-2007. Between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2008, $\$1.9$ trillion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) received downgrades that reflected a higher assessment of risk. This came as a shock to investors.9 This caused credit markets to continue to tighten, and led the Federal Reserve to provide relief by opening up short-term lending facilities (Term Securities Lending Facility, TSLF) and auctions for the sale of mortgage-related financial products. But this failed to prevent the hemorrhaging, as asset prices continued to decline.  

In early 2008, these stresses began to show up in institutional failures. Mortgage lender Countrywide Financial was bought by Bank of America in January 2008, and then in March 2008, Bear Stearns, the sixth largest U.S. investment bank, was unable to roll over its short-term funding due to losses on MBS whose prices were plunging. Bear Stearns’ stock price had a precrisis 52-week high of $\$133.20$ per share, but dropped like a rock as revelations of losses in its hedge funds and other businesses came to light. JP Morgan Chase made an initial offer of $\$2$ per share for all the outstanding shares of Bear Stearns, and the deal was consummated at $\$10$ per share when the Federal Reserve intervened with a financial assistance package. The problems continued with the failure of IndyMac, the largest mortgage lender in the United States, which was taken over by the U.S. government. Then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (with ownership of $\$5.1$ trillion of US mortgages) became sufficiently financially distressed and were also taken over by the government in September 2008.

The next major tremor occurred when Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. It was unable to raise the capital it needed to underwrite its downgraded securities. On the same day, AIG, a leading insurer of credit defaults, received $\$85$ billion in government assistance, as it faced a severe liquidity crisis. The dominos continued to topple as on the next day, the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund, “broke the buck,” with its per-share value falling below $\$1$ . This caused a run on these funds. Interbank lending rates rose significantly.  

The news kept getting worse. On September 25, 2008, a very large savings and loan institution, Washington Mutual, was taken over by the FDIC, and most of its assets were transferred to JP Morgan Chase. By October, the crisis had spread to Europe, forcing central banks around the globe to cooperate and announce coordinated interest rate cuts and a commitment to unlimited liquidity provision. But there was also growing recognition that this was perhaps an insolvency crisis, and banks needed higher levels of equity capital to deal with it. The U.S. government provided some of this capital. By mid-October, the US Treasury had invested $\$250$ billion in nine major banks.  

The crisis continued into 2009. By October, the unemployment rate in the United States had hit $10\%$ .  

# CAUSE AND EFFECT: THE CAUSES OF THE CRISIS AND ITS REAL EFFECTS  

Although there is some agreement on the causes of the crisis, there are disagreements among experts on many of the links in the causal chain of events. We begin by providing a pictorial depiction of the chain of events that led to the crisis, and then discuss each link in the chain (Figure 14.3).  

# External Factors  

In the vast number of books and articles written on the financial crisis, various authors have put forth a variety of precrisis factors that created a powder keg just waiting to be lit.10 There is no consensus on which of these factors were the most significant, but we will discuss each in turn.  

# Political Factors  

Some have pointed to politics playing a major role in planting the seeds of the crisis. One viewpoint is that economic inequities had widened in the United States due to structural deficiencies in the educational system that created unequal access for various segments of society.11 Politicians from both parties viewed the broadening of home ownership as a way to deal with this growing wealth inequality, and therefore undertook legislative initiatives and other inducements to make banks extend mortgage loans to a broader borrower base by relaxing underwriting standards, and this led to riskier mortgage lending.12 The elevated demand for houses pushed up house prices, and led to the housing price bubble.  

![](images/131b089f32fba4947cad795ad2b9da2cab465b8491c10543cf2db5b361a3d6e2.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.3 The Chain of Events Leading Up to the Crisis.  

A somewhat different view of political influence lays the blame on deregulation motivated by political ideology. Deregulation in the 1980s created large and powerful financial institutions with significant political clout to block future regulation, goes the argument.13 This “regulatory capture” created a crisis-prone financial system with inadequate regulatory oversight and a cozy relationship between government and big banks.  

# Growth of Securitization and the OTD Model  

It has been suggested that the desire of the U.S. government to broaden ownership was also accompanied by an “easy money” monetary policy that encouraged softer lending standards by banks. In particular, an empirical study of Euro-area and U.S. Bank lending standards finds that low short-term interest rates (generated by an “easy money” monetary policy) lead to softer standards for household and business loans. Moreover, this softening is magnified by securitization, weak regulatory supervision over bank capital, and a lax monetary policy for an extended period.14 These conditions thus made it profitable for banks to expand mortgage lending in the period prior to the crisis. Empirical evidence has also been provided showing that the OTD model encouraged banks to originate increasing volumes of risky loans, and caused banks to be less diligent in screening loans than if these were held on the books. $^{15}\mathrm{A}$ one-standard deviation in a bank’s propensity to sell off its loans has been documented to increase the default rate by about 0.45 percentage points; given the low levels of default rates in general, this represents an overall increase of $32\%$ .16  

These developments led to a substantial increase in the credit that flowed into the housing market to enable consumers to buy homes. Loan originations (new loans issued) rose from $\$500$ billion in 1990 to $\$2.4$ trillion in 2007, before declining to $\$900$ billion in the first half of 2008, and mortgage loans outstanding increased from $\$2.6$ trillion to $\$11.3$ trillion over the same period. The subprime share of home mortgages grew from $8.7\%$ in 1995 to a peak of $13.5\%$ in 2005.17  

# Financial Innovation  

Numerous financial crises have been preceded by financial innovations that worked hand-in-hand with high bank leverage and produced asset price bubbles. This crisis was no different.18 We witnessed an explosion of financial innovation for over two decades prior to the crisis. Part of the reason is that financial markets are very competitive, so with standard financial products – those whose payoff distributions everybody agrees on – it is hard for financial institutions to have high profit margins. This encourages the search for new financial products, especially those whose creditworthiness not everybody agrees on. This limits how competitive the market for those products will be, and allows the institutions involved in offering those products to earn high profits, at least for a while.  

Many of these financial innovations produce enormous benefits for society. But they are also innately more risky. The reason is that it is not only competitors who may disagree that these are creditworthy products, but also the financiers of the institutions offering these products. When this happens, short-term funding to the innovators will not be rolled over, and a funding crisis ensues. The explosion of new asset-backed securities created by securitization prior to the crisis created an ideal environment for this to occur.19  

# U.S. Monetary Policy  

It has been suggested that the easy-money monetary policy followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, especially in the 6 or 7 years prior to the crisis, was a major contributing factor to the price boom and subsequent bust that led to the crisis. The argument is that monetary policy was too “loose fitting” during 2001–2007 in the sense that actual interest rate decisions fell well below what historical experience would suggest policy should be. See Figure 14.4  

These unusually low interest rates, a part of a monetary policy choice by the Federal Reserve, were viewed as responsible for accelerating the housing boom and thereby ultimately leading to the housing bust. There is research to support this view. A regression to estimate the empirical relationship between the interest rate and housing market shows that there was a high positive correlation between the decline in interest rates during 2001–2007 and the boom in the housing market. Moreover, a simulation to see what would have happened in the counterfactual event that the Taylor rule20 interest rate policy in Figure 14.5 had been followed indicates that we would not have witnessed the same housing boom that occurred.21 Of course, in the absence of the housing boom, there would be no bubble to burst and no crisis.

FIGURE 14.6 Housing Investment versus Deviations from the Taylor Rule in Europe. (Source: Taylor (2009)).  

Similar developments occurred in Europe where deviations from the Taylor rule varied in size across countries due to differences in inflation and GDP (Figure 14.6). The country with the largest deviation from the rule was Spain, and it had the biggest boom in housing, as measured by the change in housing investment as a share of GDP. Austria had the smallest deviation from the rule, and also experienced the smallest change in housing investment as a share of GDP.  

It appears that there was coordination among central banks to follow this easy-money policy. Apparently, a significant fraction of the European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate decisions can be explained by the influence of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions.22  

# Global Economic Developments  

There are some who have pointed to developments in the global economy as a contributing factor.23 In the past two decades, emerging-market countries – most notably China – have accounted for an increasing percentage of global GDP. This growing wealth has led to the accumulation of large amounts of savings in these countries, and the lack of extensive social safety nets means that there have been incentives for individuals to hang on to these savings and not reduce them by indulging in higher domestic consumption. Rather, the savers have sought to invest in safe assets, resulting in huge inflows of investments in the United States in assets like bank debt, AAA-rated mortgages, and so on. When coupled with the easy-money monetary policy pursued in the United States over approximately the same time period, the result was a very large infusion of liquidity into the United States and Western Europe. This led to exceptionally low mortgage interest rates, as shown in Figure 14.7  

This would normally lead to an increase in inflation as more money is available to purchase goods and services. However, the rise of emerging-market economies meant that global companies in the West could move procurement, manufacturing, and a variety of back-office support services to these countries with lower labor costs. Consequently, core inflation stayed low in the West, and provided no signals to central banks to discontinue their easy-money monetary policies. Moreover, the flood of this “hot money” found its way into real estate, increasing demand for housing, and pushing up house prices.

FIGURE 14.7 Average Mortgage Interest Rates from 1982 to 2005. (Source: Holt (2009)).  

# Misaligned Incentives  

There are many who have suggested that misaligned incentives also played a role. The argument goes as follows. Financial institutions, especially those that viewed themselves as too big to fail (TBTF), took excessive risks because de-jure safety-net protection via deposit insurance and de-facto safety-net protection due to regulatory reluctance to allow such institutions to fail.24 Such risk-taking was permitted due to lax oversight by regulators whose incentives were not aligned with those of taxpayers.25 Moreover, “misguided” politicians facilitated this with their overzealous embrace of unregulated markets. This is also the essence of the report of the U.S. government’s Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC).26  

The risk-taking was a part of the aggressive growth strategies pursued by banks. This meant that banks were willing to substantially increase their mortgage lending. This increase in financing meant another facilitating factor in pushing up home prices.  

# Success-Driven Skill Inferences  

While misaligned incentives clearly played a role in this crisis, as they have in previous financial crises, they do not tell the whole story. There was more to the 2007–2009 crisis. In particular, the recent crisis followed a long period of high profitability and growth for the financial sector, and during those good times, there was little warning of the onset and severity of the crisis from any of the so-called “watch dogs” of the financial system – rating agencies, regulators, and creditors of the financial system.27 This suggests that other, possibly complementary, forces were at work besides misaligned incentives.  

A major driver of the conditions that made the crisis likely was that the long period of success that preceded the crisis caused everyone to develop a very high regard for the skills of bankers in managing risks.28 To see how this can lead to a high probability of a financial crisis, imagine there is a high probability that loan defaults are affected by the skills of bankers in managing credit risk, and a small probability that these outcomes are driven solely by luck or factors beyond the control of bankers. Banks start out initially making fairly safe loans because riskier (and more profitable) loans are viewed by the financiers of banks as being too risky. Now, if these loans successfully pay off over time, everybody raises their assessment of their beliefs about the abilities of banks to manage (credit) risk, even though the performance of the loan portfolio may have been just due to luck. As this happens, it becomes possible for banks to finance riskier loans as investors view these loans as being less risky due to their elevated regard for bankers’ skills. And if these successfully pay off, then even more risky loans are financed. This way, risk taking in banking continues to rise, and no one issues warnings about an impending crisis.  

Of course, even low-probability events (the so-called “black swans”) sometimes occur. Thus, it is possible that investors eventually find themselves in a state in which they believe outcomes are purely luck-dependent. When this happens, beliefs revert sharply to prior beliefs. And since only relatively safe loans could be financed with these prior beliefs, the sudden drop in beliefs about the risk-management abilities of banks causes investors to withdraw funding for the loans that are suddenly viewed as being “excessively risky.” This theory predicts that it is precisely when there is a sufficiently long period of high profitability and low loan defaults that bank risk-taking increases, and that a financial crisis occurs only when its $e x$ ante probability is being viewed as being sufficiently low.  

# Housing Prices  

As a consequence of the factors just discussed, house prices in the United States experienced significant appreciation prior to the crisis, especially during the period 1998–2005. The Case-Shiller U.S. national house price index more than doubled between 1987 and 2005, with a significant portion of the appreciation occurring after 1998. See Figure 14.8.  

Further supporting empirical evidence that there was a housing price bubble, came from the observation that the ratio of house prices to renting costs appreciated significantly around 1999.29 See Figure 14.9  

![](images/195c078fb6e37303b7ad6379d03835c70e3d70deea0329deceff7e3bf8e13844.jpg)

FIGURE 14.10 Per Capita Consumption from 1978 to 2008. Note: All Numbers are in 1980 Dollar per Household. (Source: Jagannathan et al., 2013)  

# Leverage and Consumption  

The housing price bubble facilitated a substantial increase in individual consumption. U.S. households, feeling rich in an environment of low taxes, low interest rates, easy credit, expanded government services, cheap consumption goods, and rising home prices, went on a consumption binge, letting their personal savings rate drop below $2\%$ for the first time since the Great Depression. The increase in U.S. household consumption during this period was striking. Per capita consumption grew steadily at the rate of $\$1994$ per year during 1980–1999, but then experienced a big jump to approximately $\$2849$ per year from 2001 to 2007, as reflected in the sharp increase in excess consumption (consumption in excess of wages) reflected in Figure 14.10 30  

Some of this higher consumption was financed with higher borrowing, which was supported by rising home prices. Indeed, the simplest way to convert housing wealth into consumption is to borrow against the equity built up in one’s house. As the value of residential real estate rose, mortgage borrowing increased even faster. Figure 14.11 shows this phenomenon – home equity fell from $58\%$ of home value in 1995 to $52\%$ of home value by 2007.31  

This increase in consumer leverage, made possible by the housing price bubble, had a significant role in the crisis that was to come. An empirical study, conducted using detailed zip-code level data, shows that the sharp increase in mortgage defaults during the crisis was significantly amplified in subprime zip codes, or zip codes with a disproportionately large share of subprime borrowers as of 1996.32 The study shows that, during 2002–2005, the subprime zip codes experienced an unprecedented relative growth in mortgage credit, despite significantly declining relative income growth – and in some cases declining absolute income growth – in these neighborhoods. The study also notes that this was highly unusual in that 2002–2005 is the only period in the past 18 years during which personal income and mortgage credit growth were negatively correlated.33 That is, it is the only period during which people were borrowing more while their incomes were falling.  

What exacerbated the situation is that this increase in consumer leverage was by those who were perhaps least equipped to handle it and was also accompanied by an increase in the leverage of financial institutions, especially those in the shadow-banking system, which turned out to be the epicenter of the crisis. This made these institutions fragile and less capable of handling defaults on consumer mortgages and sharp declines in the prices of MBS than they would have been had they been not as thinly capitalized.  

# Risky Lending and Screening  

In the chapter on securitization, we discussed the empirical evidence which indicates that securitization may have weakened the incentives of banks to screen their borrowers. There is also additional evidence that during the dramatic growth of the subprime (securitized) mortgage market, the quality of the market declined dramatically and that lenders seemed to be aware of this.34 In particular, the quality of loans, measured as the performance of loans, deteriorated for six consecutive years prior to the crisis, and this deterioration is statistically significant even after loan performance is adjusted for differences in borrower characteristics like the credit score, level of indebtedness, loan amount, and ability to provide documentation; differences in loan characteristics like product type, amortization term, loan amount, and mortgage interest rate; and macroeconomic conditions like house price appreciation, level of neighborhood income, and change in unemployment. The fact that lenders seemed aware of the growing default risk of these loans is suggested by the higher rates lenders charged borrowers as the decade prior to the crisis progressed. For a similar decrease in the quality of the loan (e.g., a higher loanto-value ratio), a loan made early in the decade was associated with a smaller interest rate increase than a loan made late in the decade. Thus, even though it is possible that lenders underestimated the credit risks in the loans they were making, they do seem to have been aware that they were making riskier loans.

These lenders also seem to have taken steps to reduce some of these risks from their balance sheets. Research shows that from the end of 2006 until the beginning of 2008, originators of loans tended to sell their loans, collect the proceeds, and then use them to originate new loans and repeat the process.35 The research also shows that banks with high involvement in the OTD market during the precrisis period originated excessively poor-quality mortgages, and this result cannot be explained by differences in observable borrower quality, geographical location of the property, or the cost of capital for high-OTD and low-OTD banks. This evidence indicates that the OTD model induced originating banks to have weaker incentives to screen borrowers before extending loans. However, this effect is stronger for banks with lower capital, suggesting that capital strengthens banks’ incentives to screen their borrowers and operate with lower levels of credit risk.  

# The Bubble Bursts  

The start of the crisis, according to most accounts of the financial crisis, can be traced to the bursting of the housing price bubble, and the fact that the failure of Lehman Brothers in September, 2008 was a sign that the crisis was deepening. But exactly what caused the housing price bubble to burst?  

Some studies cite evidence that run-ups in house prices are a common place occurrence prior to the start of a crisis.36 But they do not explain what caused the bubble to burst. However, we can get some insights into what happened by examining the dynamics of loan defaults in relation to initial home price declines, and how this fueled larger subsequent price declines, causing the bubble to burst. Home prices reached their peak in the second quarter of 2006. The initial decline in home prices from that peak was a rather modest $2\%$ from the second quarter of 2006 to the fourth quarter of 2006.37  

With prime mortgages held by creditworthy borrowers, such a small decline is unlikely to lead to a large number of defaults, and especially not defaults that are highly correlated across geographic regions of the United States. The reason is that these borrowers have $20\%$ of equity in the home when they buy the home, so a small price drop does not put the mortgage “under water” and threaten to trigger default.  

Not so with subprime mortgages. Even the small decline in home prices pushed these highly risky borrowers over the edge. Foreclosure rates increased by $43\%$ over the last two quarters of 2006, and increased by a staggering $75\%$ in 2007 compared to 2006.38 Homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages that had low teaser rates to attract them to buy homes were hit the hardest. The drop in home prices meant that they had negative equity in their homes (given how little of their own money many of them had put down in the first place). So, when their rates adjusted upward, they found themselves hard pressed to make the higher monthly mortgage payments. As these borrowers defaulted on their mortgages, CRAs began to downgrade MBS, and many of the adverse events described in Table 14.2 began to kick in. This caused credit availability to decline, pushed up interest rates, and accelerated the downward house price spiral, eventually threatening the repayment ability of even prime borrowers. From the second quarter of 2006 to the end of 2007, foreclosure rates for fixedrate mortgages increased by about $55\%$ for prime borrowers and by about $80\%$ for subprime borrowers. Things were much worse for those with adjustable-rate mortgages – their foreclosure rates increased by about $400\%$ for prime borrowers and by about $20\%$ for subprime borrowers.  

# Liquidity Shrinks in Response to Insolvency Concerns  

Before the financial crisis, the shadow banking sector of the U.S. economy had grown dramatically. One notable aspect of the shadow banking system is its heavy reliance on short-term debt, mostly repurchase agreements (repos) and commercial paper. Repo liabilities of U.S. broker dealers increased $2\%$ times in the 4 years before the crisis.39 The IMF (2010) estimates that total outstanding repo in U.S. markets at between $20\%$ and $30\%$ of U.S. GDP in each year from 2002 to 2007. The IMF estimates for the European Union are even higher – a range of $30\%$ to $50\%$ E.U. GDP per year during 2002–2007.  

A repo transaction is basically a “collateralized” deposit.40 The depositor (or lender) deposits money in a financial institution for a short period of time, typically overnight. The amount deposited is usually large and exceeds deposit insurance coverage limits. The interest rate paid on this deposit is the overnight repo rate. To reduce the depositor’s risk, given the absence of deposit insurance, the institution that accepts the deposit gives the depositor a marketable security as collateral. If the institution that has the deposit fails, then the depositor can sell the collateral to recover the deposited amount. Such transactions often involve “haircuts.” If the deposit is $\$80$ and the security given by the institution to the depositor as collateral is also worth $\$80$ , there is no “haircut.” But if the deposit is $\$80$ and the security provided as collateral is worth $\$100$ , then the haircut is $20\%$ .  

The repo transactions used Treasury bonds, MBS, commercial paper, and so on as collateral. As news about defaults on mortgages began to spread, concerns about the credit qualities of MBS began to rise. The bankruptcy filings of subprime mortgage underwriters and the massive downgrades of MBS by the rating agencies in mid-2007 created significant concerns about the credit qualities of many types of collateral being used in repo transactions, as well as possibly the quality of the credit screening conducted by the originators of the underlying mortgages. This caused repo haircuts to spike up significantly, causing the short-term borrowing capacity in the shadow banking sector to decline substantially, creating what appeared to be a liquidity crunch.  

An important question is whether this was a market-wide liquidity crunch or a bank-specific increase in concerns about solvency risk that caused the availability of funding to shrink for some banks but not for others. That is, one viewpoint is that when people realized that MBS were a lot riskier than they thought, liquidity dried up across the board because the high level of asymmetric information and opaqueness in MBS arising from the multitude of steps in the creation of a MBS – from the originations of multiple mortgages to their pooling and then to the specifics of the tranching of this pool – meant that it was hard for an investor to determine which MBS was of high quality and which was not.41 So when bad news arrived about mortgage defaults, there was a (nondiscriminating) market-wide effect. According to this view of the events, this was a liquidity crunch.  

Another viewpoint is that this was, at its core, a bank-specific solvency issue, and not a liquidity crisis. A recent study examines funding sources and asset sales at commercial banks, investment banks, and hedge funds.42 It hypothesizes that if liquidity dries up in the financial market, institutions that rely on short-term debt will be forced to sell assets at fire-sale prices.43 The empirical findings are, however, that the majority of commercial and investment banks did not experience funding declines during the crisis, and did not engage in the fire sales predicted to accompany liquidity shortages. The problems at financial institutions that did experience liquidity shortages during the crisis originated on the asset side of their balance sheets in the form of bad news about the credit risks embedded in the assets they held. Commercial banks’ equity and asset values were strongly negatively affected by the levels of net charge-offs, whereas investment banks’ asset changes seemed to reflect changes in market valuation.44 Thus, this was an insolvency crisis, according to this viewpoint.  

Nonetheless, there were events that seemed to have market-wide implications. The failure of Lehman Brothers was followed by larger withdrawals from money market-mutual funds after one large fund “broke the buck.” The ABCP market also experienced considerable stress. By July 2007, there was $\$1.2$ trillion of ABCP outstanding, with the majority of the paper held by MMFs. Issuers of commercial paper were unable in many cases to renew funding when a portion of the commercial paper matured, and some have referred to this as a “run.”45 As Figure 14.12 shows, things deteriorated quite dramatically in this market beginning August 2007.  

![](images/d79564bf06a94576704aaa0255189982ebbcc9923438e5d29b155cf74e18996f.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.12 Runs on Asset-Based Commercial Paper Programs. (Source: Covitz et al., (2013)).  

The ABCP market fell by $\$350$ billion in the second half of 2007. Many of these programs required backup support from their sponsors to cover this shortfall. As the major holders of ABCPs, MMFs were adversely affected. This culminated in the Reserve Primary Fund, a large MMF, “breaking the buck.” Consequently, ABCP yields rose for outstanding paper. Many shrinking ABCP programs sold their underlying assets, putting further downward pressure on prices. All of these events led to numerous MMFs requiring assistance from their sponsors to avoid breaking the buck. But even in this case, the empirical evidence indicates that the runs suffered by MMFs were mainly due to asset risk and solvency concerns rather than a liquidity crisis per se.46  

On balance, it appears that the evidence suggests that this was, in the end, an insolvency crisis in which rising perceptions of the default risks of mortgages caused investors to withdraw funding from the institutions that held MBS and especially those that used them as collateral for short-term funding. The massive withdrawal of funding created the appearance of a liquidity crisis.  

# The Real Effects of the Crisis  

This financial crisis had significant real effects. These effects can be pictorially depicted as shown in Figure 14.13  

![](images/8e3ec5bc92f9061f26d26a6b4da9b8c30efc2371e589ab24b9403bb8681dc0f1.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.13 The Real Effects of the Crisis.  

# Credit Demand Effects  

The argument for why the crisis adversely affected household demand for credit goes as follows.47 First, due to a variety of reasons discussed in this chapter (including easy credit with relaxed underwriting standards, booming house prices, low interest rates, etc.), household debt went up significantly. Then, the bursting of the house price bubble significantly depleted household net worth. In response, the highly levered households cut back on consumption. However, the relatively unlevered households did not increase consumption to offset the decline in consumption by the levered households. This is not surprising. Many of the unlevered households were probably consuming what they wanted to consume, so they may have had little reason to consume more.  

Empirical evidence shows that this interaction between precrisis household leverage and decline in consumption made a major contribution to the events witnessed during the crisis. In particular, the research indicates that the large accumulation of household debt prior to the recession, in combination with the decline in house prices, explains the onset, severity, and length of the subsequent consumption collapse. Consumption declined much more in high-leverage countries with larger house price declines and in areas with greater reliance on housing as a source of wealth. Thus, as house prices dropped, so did consumption and the demand for credit to finance that consumption.  

# Credit Supply Effects  

There is overwhelming empirical evidence that the crisis also caused a significant decline in the supply of credit by banks. One piece of evidence is that syndicated loans declined during the crisis, which is important since syndicated lending is a major source for credit for the corporate sector.48 The syndicated loan market includes not only banks, but also investment banks, institutional investors, hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds (see Chapter 9 for more on syndicated lending). The evidence is that syndicated lending began to fall in mid-2007, and this decline accelerated starting in September 2008. Syndicated lending volume in the last quarter of 2008 was $47\%$ lower than in the prior quarter and $79\%$ lower than in the second quarter of 2007, which was the height of the credit boom. Lending declined across all types of corporate loans.  

Not only did the volume of lending fall, but the price of credit rose significantly as well. Firms paid higher loan spreads during the crisis.49 This increase in loan spreads was higher for firms that borrowed from banks that incurred larger losses. This result holds even when firm-specific, bank-specific, and loan-specific factors are controlled for, and the endogeneity of bank losses is taken into account.  

It is quite challenging to separate supply and demand effects. One study examines whether there are discernible reductions in credit supply, even when overall demand for credit is going down.50 This study examined German Savings banks, which operate in well-defined geographies and are required by law to serve only local customers. In each geography there is a Landesbank, owned by the savings bank in that area. These Landesbanken (the regional banks) had varying degrees of exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages. These exposures created varying amounts of losses for these Landesbanken, and therefore required different amounts of equity injections from their respective savings banks. In other words, different savings banks were affected differently, depending on the losses suffered by their Landesbanken due to their subprime mortgage exposures. What the research uncovers is that the savings banks that were hit harder cut back more on credit. The average rate at which loan applicants were rejected by the harder-hit banks was significantly higher than the rate at which rejections occurred at unaffected banks.  

There is also survey evidence that shows that credit supply fell as a result of the crisis.51 A survey of 1050 Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) in 39 countries in North America, Europe, and Asia was completed in December 2008. About $20\%$ of the surveyed firms in the United States (about $14\%$ in Europe and $8.5\%$ in Asia) indicated that they were very affected in the sense that they faced reduced availability of credit. Consequently, they reduced capital expenditures, dividends, and employment.  

# Reduction in Corporate Investment and Increase in Unemployment  

With both household consumption going down and credit becoming more scarce and more expensive, it is not surprising that corporate investment fell and unemployment rose. The United States entered a deep recession, with almost 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009, which represented about $6\%$ of the workforce. It also discouraged many from trying to re-enter the workforce after the crisis abated, leading the labor participation rate to decline to historically low levels. This meant that subsequent measurements of the unemployment rate tended to understate the true unemployment rate. Even measured unemployment rose every month from $6.2\%$ in September 2008 to $7.6\%$ in January 2009. U.S. housing prices declined about $30\%$ on average and the U.S. stock market fell approximately $50\%$ by mid-2009.  

The U.S. automobile industry was particularly hard hit. Car sales fell $31.9\%$ in October 2008 compared to September 2008. Retail sales in the U.S. declined by $2.8\%$ between September and October 2008, and by $4.1\%$ compared to September 2007.  

# THE POLICY RESPONSES TO THE CRISIS  

Beginning in August 2007, the governments of all developed countries undertook a variety of measures to deal with the financial crisis. The IMF (2009) identifies as many as 153 separate policy actions taken by 13 countries, including 49 in the United States alone. That represents too large a set of policy interventions to discuss here. So we will briefly describe the major categories of interventions here (Figure 14.14).52  

# Expansion of Traditional Role of Central Bank as Lender of Last Resort  

This set of interventions included the discount window, Term Auction Facility (TAF), Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), and Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). The Federal Reserve also approved bilateral currency swap agreements with 14 foreign central banks to assist these central banks in the provision of dollar liquidity to banks in their jurisdictions, with the largest of these arrangements being with the ECB.  

The discount window has long been a primary liquidity-provision tool used by the Fed. In December 2007, the TAF was introduced to supplement the discount window. The TAF provided credit to depository institutions through an auction mechanism. Like discount window loans, TAF loans had to be fully collateralized to the satisfaction of the lending Federal Reserve bank. The final TAF auction was held on March 8, 2010.  

![](images/8a60eca437bb83ced617da3825618edf2483b2a252ef2e5936b2b28ef7f0a8be.jpg)  
FIGURE 14.14 The Major Categories of Interventions by the Federal Reserve Board.  

The PDCF was established in March 2008 in response to strains in the tri-party repo market and the resulting liquidity pressures faced by primary securities dealers. Primary dealers are broker-dealers who serve as the trading counterparties for the Federal Reserve’s open-market operations, and thus play a pivotal role in providing liquidity in the market for U.S. treasuries. The PDCF serves as an overnight loan facility for primary dealers, similar to the discount window for depository institutions. Credit extension required full collateralization. This facility was closed on February 1, 2010.  

The TSLF was a weekly loan facility designed to promote liquidity in Treasury and other collateral markets. The program offered Treasury securities for a loan for 1 month against other program-eligible collateral. The borrowers were primary dealers who participated in single-price auctions to obtain these loans. The TSLF was closed on February 1, 2010.  

# Provision of Liquidity Directly to Borrowers and Investors in Key Credit Markets  

These interventions included the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), ABCP MMF Liquidity Facility (AMLF), Money Market Investors Funding Facility (MMIFF), and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF). Of these, we earlier discussed the AMLF in the chapter on securitization (see Chapter 11).  

The CPFF was established in October 2008 to provide liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper. Under the program, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provided 3-month loans to a specially created limited liability company that then used the money to purchase commercial paper directly from issuers. The CPFF was dissolved on August 30, 2010.  

The MMIFF was designed to provide liquidity to U.S. money market investors. Under this facility, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could provide senior secured loans to a series of special purpose vehicles to finance the purchase of eligible assets from eligible investors. The MMIFF was announced on October 21, 2008 and dissolved on October 30, 2009.  

TALF was created to help market participants meet the credit needs of households and small businesses by supporting the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by consumer and small-business loans: auto loans, student loans, credit card loans, equipment loans, floor plan loans, etc. The goal was to revive the consumer-credit securitization market. The facility was launched in March 2009 and dissolved by June 2010.  

# Expansion of Open Market Operations  

The goal of these initiatives was to support the functioning of credit markets and put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. These initiatives involved the purchase of longer-term securities for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio. For example, starting in September 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to purchase agency-guaranteed MBS at the rate of $\$40$ billion per month. In addition, starting January 2013, the Fed began purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at the rate of $\$45$ billion per month.  

# Initiatives Designed to Address Insolvency Concerns and Counterparty Risk  

As the crisis progressed and the vast amounts of liquidity-injection seemed incapable of ending the crisis, the Fed began to realize that insolvency risk concerns had to be dealt with. One measure to deal with insolvency risk was the Troubled Asset  

Repurchase Program (TARP), which was initially authorized in October 2008 and ended on October 3, 2010. The original intent was for the government to buy risky “toxic” assets from financial institutions in order to “clean up” their balance sheets, reduce market perceptions of the credit risks in the assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions, and unfreeze credit markets.53 However, in practice the program evolved into one in which the government bought equity securities (the Capital Purchase Program) and took ownership positions in various financial and nonfinancial firms.  

This was accompanied by regulatory pressure on U.S. banks to recapitalize themselves through other means. To not comply may have meant more equity injections by the government and even greater government ownership – a prospect most banks wished to avoid. As a result, U.S. banks recapitalized quickly and counterparty risk concerns dissipated. This may have been the most effective policy response to the crisis. In contrast, European banks were not compelled to recapitalize to the same extent, so the after-effects of the crisis lingered on much longer there.  

# Assessment of Policy Initiatives  

Many believe that the liquidity support provided by central banks was effective in calming markets in the initial phases of the crisis. However, there is no consensus on whether these were the right measures for the long run, or whether the problem was even correctly diagnosed. At the very least, markets exhibited considerable volatility after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which indicates that central banks were learning as they went along – building the bridge as they walked on it, so to speak – and not all the initiatives had the intended effects.  

A key issue for central banks was to determine whether the events they were observing were due to liquidity or counterparty risk arising from asymmetric information about the quality of assets on the balance sheets of institutions and the opaqueness of those balance sheets. The Federal Reserve and the ECB clearly believed it was a liquidity problem, which is reflected in the first three categories of measures we discussed earlier. But if the issue was counterparty risk, then the proper approach would be to require banks to make their balance sheets more transparent, deal directly with the rising mortgage defaults, and undertake measures to infuse more capital into financial institutions,54 something that only occurred when the U.S. government began the process of recapitalizing banks.  

How do we know what was really going on? One study tackled this question.55 It began by examining the LIBOR–OIS Spread  This spread is equal to the three-month LIBOR minus the three-month Overnight Index Swap (OIS). The OIS is a measure of what the market expects the federal funds rate to be over the three-month period comparable to the three-month LIBOR. Subtracting OIS from LIBOR controls for interest rate expectations, thereby isolating risk and liquidity effects. Figure 14.15 shows the behavior of this spread just before and during the crisis.  

The figure indicates that the spread rose in early August 2007, and stayed high. This was a problem because the spread not only is a measure of financial stress, but it affects how monetary policy is transmitted due to the fact that rates on loans and securities are indexed to LIBOR. An increase in the spread, holding fixed the OIS, increases the cost of loans for borrowers and contracts the economy. Policymakers thus have an interest in bringing the spread down. But just like a doctor who cannot effectively treat a patient if he misdiagnoses the disease, so can a central bank not bring the spread down if it does not correctly diagnose the reason for its rise in the first place.

FIGURE 14.16 The LIBOR–OIS Spread. (Source: Taylor, 2009)  

To see whether the spread increased due to elevated risk concerns or liquidity problems the study measured the difference between interest rates on unsecured and secured interbank loans of the same maturity.56 The study referred to this as the unsecured–secured spread.57 This spread is essentially a measure of risk. The study then regressed the LIBOR–OIS spread against the secured–unsecured spread, and found a very high positive correlation. It concluded that the LIBOR–OIS spread was driven mainly by risk concerns, and there was little role for liquidity.  

As further support for this conclusion, the study shows that the TAF had little effect on the LIBOR–OIS spread. Moreover, the sharp reduction in the federal funds rate during the crisis – the fed funds target rate went from $5\%$ in August 2007 to $2\%$ in April 2008 – also did not succeed in reducing the LIBOR–OIS spread (see Figure 14.15). However, it also caused a depreciation of the dollar and caused oil prices to jump, causing a sharp decline in world economic growth.  

The study goes on to show that in October 2008, the crisis worsened as the LIBOR–OIS spread spiked up even further, as shown in Figure 14.16  That is, more than a year after it started, the crisis got worse. Some suggest that the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 was a proximate cause. The study suggests, however, that that may have been more a symptom than a cause, and that the real culprit was that the market participants were concerned that default risks had increased substantially, fueled by sinking house prices and rising oil prices. That is, this paper provides strong evidence that this was a crisis caused by insolvency risk.  

It also appears that central banks – especially the U.S. Federal Reserve – eventually came to recognize that this was an insolvency crisis at its very root, and that measures like recapitalizing banks were needed to reduce concerns about counterparty risk. These measures eventually helped to end the crisis.  

# FINANCIAL CRISES IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND REGULATORY INTERVENTIONS  

Financial crises have occurred in many different countries, and many have involved various forms of central bank intervention. The IMF found that governments intervened with some form of recapitalization or capital injection in 32 of the 42 banking crises around the world. So in this sense, the recapitalization initiatives of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the $2007-$ 2009 crisis were not exceptions. Below we discuss a handful of other crises to provide a contrast in regulatory responses.58  

# Sweden  

As has been the case with so many other financial crises, Sweden too experienced a financial crisis that was preceded by very high real estate prices. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a substantial credit expansion in Sweden and a real-estate boom, with house prices doubling between 1981 and 1991. Sweden’s exchange rate was tied with Germany, so when interest rates increased in 1990 in Germany due to the unification of East and West Germany, Sweden’s interest rates also increased substantially, causing a recession in Sweden and a precipitous drop in prices. As a result, nonperforming loans at banks increased to $11\%$ of GDP in 1993.  

This significantly impaired the capital ratios of Sweden’s largest banks, and these banks were unable to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. Instead of injecting capital into banks – as was done by the Fed during the subprime crisis – the Swedish government nationalized two of Sweden’s largest banks and provided a loan guarantee to the third. The ownership of these banks by the government permitted expeditious liquidation of bad assets and restructuring of insolvent firms. The process took less than six years and cost Sweden less than $2\%$ of GDP.  

# Latvia  

Latvia’s transition from a centrally planned economy (as part of the Soviet Union) to a free-market economy resulted in the creation of more than 60 licensed banks within 4 years. However, the rapid growth in private banking also occurred with little or no supervision from the central bank. As a result, poor lending practices went unchecked.  

A crisis occurred when the central bank requested all banks to present audited financial statements in 1995. The largest bank failed to present its statements, was discovered to be insolvent, and was liquidated in 1996. Several other banks were also discovered to be insolvent. During the crisis, non-performing loans increased all across the banking sector. It was difficult for banks to collect on loans in the absence of laws governing loan collateral.  

A series of interventions helped stabilize the banking system. Some banks were liquidated, new banking laws were established which strengthened the regulatory powers of the central bank, deposit insurance was established, and some assistance was received from the EBRD.  

# Argentina  

This country has experienced four banking crises since the 1980s, with a “triple crisis” in 2001. The banking sector was transformed during the 1990s through privatization and consolidation. This allowed foreign bank entry. However, bank profitability was low and a large fraction of bank assets were Argentinian government debt.  

In 2001, as the economy deteriorated, concerns about bank solvency and the health of the national currency, the Peso, caused large-scale deposit withdrawals, conversions into U.S. dollars and deposits abroad. This was a classic banking crisis, the first of the “triple” crisis.  

Then, the government defaulted on its debt in December 2001, devastating the asset portfolios of the already-weakened banks. This was the second part of the “triple crisis.”  

The third part of the triple crisis was when the financial distress forced the country to exit its currency board regime, which was a convertibility program that tied the Argentinian peso to the dollar. Since there were bank runs still going on, the government restricted deposit withdrawals and froze all deposit accounts. This fueled further declines in deposit inflows to banks and diminished bank lending.  

Government intervention also involved additional steps, including the conversion of dollar-denominated loans and deposits from dollar to peso at different rates, the authorization of regulatory forbearance, the nationalization of three banks, and the closure of another.  

# CONCLUSION  

This chapter has reviewed a very large body of research on the causes and effects of the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression, and the policy responses undertaken by central banks to deal with the crisis. It appears that the crisis resulted from a toxic brew of many factors that interacted with each other: politics, monetary policy, global economic developments, misaligned incentives, the growth of securitization, and a complacency born of success-driven skill inferences.  

Whatever the cause, the crisis lasted longer than expected and had a huge impact on the United States and global real economies. Central banks took unprecedented measures to deal with the crisis. Whether these were the right measures is an issue on which there is no consensus, and this will be the subject of research for many years to come.  

It does appear, however, that having significantly higher levels of capital in banking (including shadow banking) would have gone a long way in reducing the likelihood of this crisis. Research indicates that higher levels of bank capital reduce both insolvency risk, and funding or liquidity risk.59 Thus, better capital regulation should be a central focus in discussions of how to reduce the likelihood of future crises.
