# Class Note 5A Coercive Exchange Offers and Exit Consents

### Class Note 5A: Coercive Exchange Offers and Exit Consents

*See the Kahan and Tuckman paper in the packet.*

An **exit consent vote** is one where a **change in covenants** is combined with an exchange offer where a new bond is given in exchange for the old bond if and only if one votes to change the covenants in the old bond. As a result,  those who are exiting the old bond are the ones choosing to change its covenants. If a holder prefers the new bond given his or her belief that the vote will pass,  any reduction in the value of the old bond will not matter (because he or she will hold the new bond).

### Example Scenario

Suppose there is an exit consent vote that will pass if **M+1 bondholders** vote yes and tender their bond in exchange for a new one. The deal is structured so that you may only get the new bond if you vote to change the covenants in the old bond to make it drop in value. If fewer than M other holders tender,  you can't make it pass,  if M+1 or more tender,  it passes no matter what you do.

- **Value of bond as it stands:** $B$
- **Value of new bond that you get if you tender,  vote yes and the vote passes:** $B_n$
- **Value of old bond if the consent vote passes (some covenants are removed):** $B'$
- **Payment for consent vote,  in addition to new bond =** $p$. This is called the consent payment.

If you hold it all the issue,  you compare $p + B_n$ to $B$.

- There are N old bondholders; it passes if M+1 holders accept the new bond and vote to change the covenant.
- If you expect less than M to accept,  you expect to have the tender fail,  and even if you tender you get the old bond back. As a result,  you get $B$ no matter what. It does not matter if you tender or not.
- If you hold the bond and expect more than M+1 to accept and tender their bonds,  you get $B'$ if you keep the old bond,  and $p+B_n$ if you take the new one. Call this **expecting the consent vote to succeed**.

If you expect the consent vote to succeed,  you will tender **if and only if** $p + B_n > B'$.

This might be **coercive**,  if the old bond drops in value by more than the cash payment $(p + B_n < B)$. You would tender here,  even though you would not if you owned the total bond issue. That is if $p + B_n < B$ while $p + B_n > B'$.

### Example 1

Suppose there was no trust indenture act,  and the exit consent vote was to set the principal and interest of the old bond to zero: that is $B' = 0$. Suppose that there is no consent payment,  $p = 0$. And suppose that you expect the consent vote to succeed,  you tender if $p + B_n > B'$,  which is $B_n > 0$. You will take a bond worth a penny if you expect the old bond to be made worthless. Perhaps this is the scenario that made them pass the trust indenture act!

### Example 2

If there are no covenant changes in the old bond,  the consent payment is zero,  and the new bond is **junior** to the old bond and has a lower face value,  as in class note 4. Here,  the offer will fail because the new bond is worth less than the old bond will be worth if others exchange their bonds: $B_n < B'$.

### Example 3

If there are no other covenant changes in the old bond,  the consent payment is zero,  and the new bond is **senior** to the old bond and has a lower face value,  as in class note 4,  then it is possible that the offer will succeed. The reason is that $B_n$ may exceed $B'$. In the example in note 4,  exchanging the old bond with face $P = 1.6$ for a new bond with face value $P' = 1$ resulted in success.

Suppose you own 1/100 of the old bond,  with a face value of $0.016$,  and you are offered a new senior bond with a face value of $0.01$. If you expect everyone else to take the new bond,  we saw that their face value of $0.99$ will be senior to you,  and you get zero unless the firm is worth 2 in the future.

- The value of the old bond,  $B'$,  drops to $0.2(0.016) + 0.8(0) = 0.0032$.
- The new bond is worth $B_n = 0.2(0.01) + 0.6(1-B)/100 + 0.2(0) = 0.2(0.1) + 0.6(0.007) = 0.0062$.

Thus the new bond is of higher value.

If the new senior bond had a smaller face value of $P' = 0.5$,  the offer would fail because it would not reduce the payment to the old junior bond in the case where $V = 1$.

The new bond with face value $P' = 0.5$ is small enough that it will be paid in full when $V = 1$ as well as $V = 2$,  because there is $0.7$ left when $V = 1$ after the bank takes $0.3$. More importantly,  it allows the old (junior) bond to be fully repaid when $V = 1$.

Your 1/100 part of the new bond has a face value $P' = 0.005$ and would be worth:

$$ B_n = 0.2(0.005) + 0.6(0.005) + 0.2(0) = 0.8(0.005) = 0.004 $$

The old bond with a face value of $0.016$ would be paid in full when $V = 2$ and when $V = 1$ because there is $0.7$ left after the bank,  and $0.99(0.5) = 0.495$ of debt is senior to you (99% are assumed to take the $0.5$ face value senior bond). This leaves $0.7 - 0.495 = 0.205 > 0.016$ to pay your bond,  so the value of the old bond is:

$$ B' = 0.2(0.016) + 0.6(0.016) + 0.2(0) = 0.0128 $$

The loss of priority does not reduce the value of the old bond here.

Think of the extreme case where the new bond had zero face value. A bond with face value zero does not causes pain by coming in senior to you! In that case Bn=0 and B'=B
