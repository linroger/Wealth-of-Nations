# Do Bondholders Lose from Junk Bond Covenant Changes?*

## I.Introduction

It has longbeen recognized thatfinancial debt covenants can reduce the agency costs of debt and thereby increase the value of the firm. But there is noguarantee that covenantswhich were optimal when the debt was issued remain optimal over time. 2 As a firm's economic environment changes and as its investment opportunities vary,  therenegotiation of covenants may be desirable. Most researchers have assumed that it is not cost-effective to renegotiate the covenants of diffusely held public debt securities and,  as a result,  havefocused on the renegotiation of bank or privately placed debt. 


1. See,  e.g.,  Kalay and John (1982),  who analyze the optimal structure and covenants which restrict dividend payments. 3. See,  e.g.,  Bulow and Shoven (1978),  Berlin and Loeys

This article documents that firms can and do change the covenants of their public debt indentures through consent solicitations. A game-theoretic model shows that bondholders may consent to covenant changes even when it is not in thein collective interest to do so. Despite this finding,  bondholder returns around solicitations are positive. Further analysis indicates that bond holders coordinate their actions to modify or defeat disadvantageous proposals and therefore can demand some of the gains resulting from covenant modifications. The policy implication of this study is that bondhold ers may not need additional regulatory or judicial protection in the solicitation process,


The first goal of this article is to document that firms can and do change the covenants of their public debt securities through consent solicitations. Section II describes the mechanics of soliciting bondholder consents and presents summary statistics on a sample of solicitations which took place during the years 1988 and 1989. The following conclusions are reported and explained. (1) Consent solicitations rarely involve investment grade debt andusually seek to modify more than one bond issue at a time. (2) Some firms ask for covenant changes alone while others combine consent solicitations with exchange offers or tender offers. (3) Consent solicitations generally propose to remove or relax covenants that are thought to prevent stockholder expropriation of bondholder wealth,  for example,  covenants that restrict a company's ability to pay dividends,  to incur additional debt,  to engage in transactions with a controlling shareholder,  or to sell assets without forcing the purchaser to assume the company's obligations with respect to the bonds. (4) Most solicitations are ultimately successful,  although many of the original proposals require modification before receiving bondholder approval SectionIII begins with a game-theoretic analysis of consent solicita-

Tions and concludes that there exists a trembling hand perfect (THP) Nash equilibrium in which bondholders who cannot coordinate their actionswill consent to covenant changes even when it is notin their collective interest to do so. For the sake of clarity,  solicitations that support such an equilibrium will be called "structurally coercive. The analysis then shows thataparticular change in therules of these solicitations can make them even more coerciveinthe sense that the unique,  symmetric trembling hand perfect equilibrium is characterized by bondholders' consenting to disadvantageous indenture modifications. Other changes in the rules of these solicitations,  however,  completely remove their coercive force. The former changes might be of interest to firms contemplating covenant modifications while the latter would be ofinterest to regulators seeking toprevent coercion or to drafters of debt covenants seeking to protect bondholders. Section III concludes by revisiting the data toreveal that almost all of the solicita tions in the sample were structurally coercive. While this theoretical discussion argues that firms have an incentive

To propose covenant eviscerations through coercively structured solicitations,  only an empirical analysis can determine whether observed solicitations are,  in fact,  coercive. In other words,  do firms expropriate bondholder wealth by proposing and enacting covenant modifications without offering adequate compensation? The answer to this question has significant policy implications. Both legal scholars 4 and representatives of large mutual funds have advocated reforming the solicitation process to eliminate its coercive elements,  while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has considered burdening consent solicitations with the requirements of a new security offering. 6 With this debate in mind,  Section IV studies abnormal bondholder returns around the announcements of structurally coercive consent solicitations. These abnormal returns turn out to be significantly positive indicating that frms cannot,  or do not,  exploit the coercive nature of their solicitations. Thefinding of abnormally positive returns can be explained by the

Hypotheses that the ability of bondholders to act in concert,  through the emergence of bondholder groups or through less formal channels of communication,  prevents coercion. More precisely,  bondholders approve only those offers which are in their collective interest while they defeat or require modification of deleterious proposals. Section Vprovides some direct evidence in support of the bondholder coordination hypothesis. In short,  the consent solicitation process more closely resembles an attempt to balance the interests of stockholders and bondholders than an attempt to dictate terms to bondholders. The conclusion thatfirms cannot dispose of covenants without com-

Pensating bondholders is consistent with the Asquith and Wizman 1990) and Cook,  Easterwood,  and Martin 1992) findings that bondholders without significant covenant protection were hurt by leveraged buyouts while those with strong covenant protection prospered. The policy implication of these findings is that bondholders do not need more regulatory or judicial protection in the consent solicitation process. Section VI summarizes the article and briefly concludes.

## II. The Mechanics of Consent Solicitations: Description and Summary Statistics

The TrustIndenture Act of 1939 and most indenturesprohibit the alteration of interest or principal provisions without the consent of each bondholder affected by the changes. Other terms of the indenture,  however,  may be changed with less than unanimous approval. In fact, most indenture agreements provide for covenant modifications with the consent of either a majority or 2/3 of the outstanding face value of the bond issue. In the simplest form of a consent solicitation,  the issuer mails a

solicitation statement to each holder of a certain bond issue. This statement describes the proposed modifications to the indenture under which the bonds were issued and asks bondholders to consent to these modifications on or before a particular date. The firm usually offers a consent payment as an inducement to consent,  for example,  \$10 for every $S1, 000$ principal amount owned. If the issuer receives the requi-. Site number of consents,  it executes a supplemental indenture incorporating the modifications and sends consent payments to those bondholders who consented before the deadline. Note,  however,  that these covenant changes bind all bondholders,  consenting or not. If the issuer does not receive a sufficient number of consents,  or

Does not anticipate that it will receive a sufficient number,  it can terminate the solicitation or extend the deadline. Ifit chooses to extend the deadline,  it may also sweeten the solicitation by raising the consent payment or by proposing a more appealing set of modifications. No consent payments are made,  however,  if the solicitation ultimately fails. Consent solicitations are often combined with exchange or tender

Offers. Consents in such offers are called exit consents because bondholders vote on the modifications immediately before tendering their securities. In these situations firms usually allow only consenting bondholders toparticipate in the exchange or tender offer,  that is,  frms require exit consents. As a result,  if a sufficient number of bondholders tender their securities and consent to the terms of the solicitation,  dissenting bondholders suffer a loss of covenant protection without receiving any form of compensation. These solicitations may or may not offer consent payments in addition to the opportunity to tender securities From the description of the various forms of consent solicitations

The reader may have already sensed their coercive nature. The analysis of coercion,  however,  is postponed until the following section. The restof this section discusses the data set collectedfor this article and presents some summary statistics withrespect to the practice of consent solicitations. A preliminary sample of solicitation events was collected by searching through 1988 and 1989 news wires. The sample was then pared down in two ways. First,  since this article focuses on the modification of diffusely held public debt,  solicitations that followed negotiations between the firm and itsbondholders were discarded as more closely resembling privately placed debt renegotiation. Second,  because the primary purpose of distressed solicitations is not to modify covenants


But to obtain immediate relief in the form of interest deferral and principal forgiveness,  these were also removed from the sample. After these two cuts,  there remained 58 solicitations by 55 distinct issuers with respect to 148 debt issues. Because press releases usually did not contain sufficient information
about the terms of the consent solicitations and because solicitation documents are often not filed with the SEC,  all of the issuers and the two major solicitation agents (D.F.King & Co. And Georgeson & Co.) were asked to furnish solicitation statements. Some of the information gathered from these documents and from the press releases is reported below. AppendixA lists the issuers of the bonds for which modifications were sought. Only 4 of the 55 sported investment grade ratings (i.e.,  BBB and above by Standard and Poor (S&P),  Baa and above by Moody's). The most obvious reason that investment-grade debt did not make muchof an appearance is thathighlyrated debtrarely carries protective covenants (see Brook 1990). Of the 58 events,  25 were simple consent soliciations,  24 were ac-

Companied by tender offers,  8 were accompanied by exchange offers,  and 1 was accompanied by both a tender offer and an exchange offer. Many of the solicitations sought to modify more than one bond issue:

28 sought to modify one issue,  20 sought to modify two issues,  and 10 sought to modify three or more issues. Since different issues ofa single issuer often contain similar covenants，amending one issue may be insufficient to free the issuer from cumbersome covenants. Also,  to the extent that formalizing a proposal and contacting bondholders involve fixed costs,  issuers can be expected tolump their solicitations together. Table 1 lists the transactions that issuers sought to consummate on

receiving the requisite number of consents. Many of these,  particularly leveraged acquisitions,  payments to stockholders,  asset sales,  and issues of additional debt,  seem to be taken from an academic survey on the ways in which stockholders can expropriate bondholder wealth. So covenants supposed to prevent this sort of behavior are not written in stone. In fact,  of the 52 solicitations for which the requisite data could be obtained,  43,  or $83\%$ ,  were successful in amending the indentures of at least one of the targeted issues. The fact that companies seek to modifyindentures by removing or

Diluting protective covenants is not in itself a cause for concern. As long as the terms of the solicitation adequately compensatebondholders for the loss of covenant protection,  bondholders will not experience losses and shareholders will seek only modifications that increase firm value. However,  as shown in the next section,  the structure of consent solicitations may coercebondholders into consenting even if they are not adequately compensated. Consequently,  shareholders may seek modifications thatreduce the value of the firm as awhole so long as enough value can be expropriated from the bondholders

### III. A Game-theoretic Analysis of Consent Solicitations

If bondholders can coordinate their actions,  the analysis of consent solicitations is simple: bondholders will accept an issuer's proposal if and only if they benefit from the changes. Consequently,  firms will propose only those changes that increase the value of the firm as a whole andshare at least some of thisincreasedvalue with thebondholders. This section,  therefore,  focuses on situations in which bondholders cannot coordinate their actions. 9 Let there be $N+1$ bondholders,  $N\geq2$ .Each bondholder owns one bond and may consent,  $C$，or not consent,  $NC$ to the proposed indenture amendments. Let $M+1\in([N+1]/2, N]$ , be the approval threshold. If $M$ orless of theholders consent,  the amendments are not adopted and each bond is worth $B$ dollars. If $M+1$ ormoreof the holders consent,  the amendments are adopted and each consenting

------------------------------------------------------------------

holder receives,  inexchange forhis old bond,  a package of new securities and cash worth a total of $B_{n}$ . In addition,  each consenting holder receives a consent payment of $\$p\geq0$ .At the same time,  each nonconsenting holder keeps his old bond which,  because of the covenant eviscerations,  is now worth $B^{\prime}<B$ Note,  by theway，that a solicitationwithout an exchange or tender offer reduces to the specialcase $B_{n}=B^{\prime}$ Let $S$ denote the vector of actions by the $N+1$ players and let $S_i$

denote the vector of actions of all players but player $i$ .The payoff functions of the game，following directly from the rules described above,  are as follows:

$$\left.\pi_{i}(C, S_{-i})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}B_{n}+p&\text{if at least}M+1\text{other holders consent};\\B_{n}+p&\text{if exactly}M\text{other holders consent};\\B&\text{if at most}M-1\text{other holders consent};\end{array}\right.\right.$$

$$\left.\pi_{i}(NC, S_{-i})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}B'&\text{if at least}M+1\text{other holders consent};\\B&\text{if exactly}M\text{other holders consent};\\B&\text{if at most}M-1\text{other holders consent}.\end{array}\right.\right.$$

If $B_{n}\:+\:p\:\geq\:B$ ,  that is,  if the bondholders weakly benefit from the solicitation,  the weakly dominant strategy equilibrium has everyone consenting. This inequality would hold if the stockholders are willing at least to compensate bondholders for the losses suffered from the removal or weakening of the protective covenants. In that case,  stock holders benefit from the solicitation only if the modifications increase firm value. Assume now that $B_{n}\:+\:p\:<\:B$ .That is,  assume that a successful

solicitation and exchange would lower the value of bondholder positions. There are two possible cases here. If $B_{n}\:+\:p\:<\:B^{\prime}$，so that bondholders are better off holding their original bonds even if the solicitation is successful,  NC weakly dominates and the solicitation is doomed to fail. If,  on the other hand,  $B_{n}\:+\:p\:>\:B^{\prime}$ ,  bondholders prefer tobein the consenting majority rather than be caught in the nonconsenting minority. This is the most interesting case: since $B>B_{n}$ $+p>B^{\prime}$ , bondholders as a group dislike the terms of the solicitation Nevertheless,  an individual bondholder might consent for fear of receiving only $B^{\prime}$ should the solicitation succeed despite his vote.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Let game 1 be the game described above when parameter values are such that $B>B_{n}+p>B^{\prime}$ 11 It can be easilyverified thatgame 1 has many Nash equilibria. In order to focus on the most sensible set of these equilibria,  the analysis turns to trembling-hand perfection. Loosely stated,  a Nash equilibrium is trembling-hand perfect if no player will change his Nash strategy even when there is some small possibility thatother players will deviate from their Nash strategies (see Selton 1975). PROPosrrioN 1. Game 1 supports two THP Nash equilibria. In one

all players consentandin the other all players withhold consent Proof. See Appendix B.Q.E.D

Proposition 1 shows that thefear of being caughtin the noncon-

Senting minority can dominate the desire tovote against a harmful proposal. The fact that allplayers consenting is a THP Nash equilib rium means that bondholders who cannot coordinate their actions may consent to covenant changes that make them worse off as a group. This finding implies that equity holders may findit profitable to propose modifications that lower the value of the firm as a whole so long as enough bondholder wealth can be expropriated in the process. The indeterminate solution to game 1 suggests a change in the rules

thatwould make the soliciation more likely to succeed: strengthen the incentive to consent by offering consenters $p>0$ whether or not the amendments pass. This game will be called game 2. PRoposrTioN 2. The unique symmetric THPNash equilibrium of game

2 is one in which all players consent. Proof. See Appendix B.Q.E.D

The analysis of this section reveals that requiring bondholders to consent in order to receive consent payments or requiring that they consent in order to participate in the exchange or tender offer can lead to coercive outcomes. Absent both these requirements,  bondholders can vote against covenant changes without forfeiting either consent payments or the right to participate in the exchange offer. In other words,  they may assure themselves of the payoffs available in the event of the solicitation's success without having to contribute to that success. 12 Formally stated,  it is easy to show that without these two requirements bondholders would never approve disadvantageous covenant changes. One may now return to the data and ask whether or not firms structure their consent solicitations in a coercive way. Table 2 answers this question in the affirmative. Of the 48 solicitations for which sufficient modifications (i.e.,  making *consent payments') or conditioning participation in an exchange or tender offer on consenting to covenant modifications (i.e.,  requiring exit consents') may lead individual bondholders to consent to wealth-reducing changes. This table shows the number of consent solicitations that made these consent payments or required exit consents. Solicitations for which the terms could not be obtained are not included.

Information was available,  44 either made consent payments available only to consenting bondholders,  required exit consents,  or did both.

### IV. Bond and Stock Returns around Solicitation Events

## A.Hypotheses

When a firm announces a proposed transaction and consent solicitation,  three kinds of information are revealed: (1) the change in expected firm value due to the anticipated transaction,  (2) the change in the expected division of firm value across equity and debt claims due to the terms of the solicitation,  and (3) the change infirm value signaled through the transaction and solicitation proposal. Consider,  for example,  an announcement to sell assets subject to bondholder approval. To the extent that the sale allows cash and managerial effort to flow toward more profitable endeavors,  firm value will tend to rise. To the extent that the terms of the solicitation fail to compensate bondholders adequately for the removal of assets from their reach,  debt claims will tend to fall in value. Finally，to the extent that the announcement of a sale price reveals that investors had previously misestimated the value of the assets to be sold,  firm value would change to reflect this news about asset values. Because proposals are assumed to reflect stockholder interests,  the

Announcement of potential changes in firm value and in the division of firm value should result in abnormally positive stock returns. The impact of any signaling effectmay，however,  be positive or negative

------------------------------------------------------------------

The theory of SectionII showed thatbondholders who cannot coordinate their actions may approve disadvantageous covenant changes. And,  as noted earlier,  firms need only offer inducements to consent if bondvalues stand to fall as a result of theproposed indenture modifications and related transactions. Therefore,  if coercion occurs in prac-. Tice,  and if the average signaling effect is not overwhelmingly positive,  the sample of bonds subjected to coercively structured solicitations should exhibit abnormally negative announcement returns. Despite these theoretical predictions with respect to bondholder re-

Turns,  there are grounds to doubt that issuers will,  or even can,  in practice,  exploit coercion. First,  proposals at unfair terms may result in litigation with and liability to injured bondholders (see Coffee and Klein 1991). Second,  such proposals may hurt the issuer's reputation and increase its future costs of raising capital. Third,  contrary to the assumptions of the theoretical model,  it maybe the case that bondholders can coordinate their actions. Absent a signaling effect,  the first two considerations imply zero abnormal bond returns: firms will not expropriate bondholder wealth,  but they need not share any gains which result from the ensuing transaction. The third consideration,  conversely,  implies abnormally positive returns since bondholder coordination,  actual or threatened,  would force stockholders to give up some of their gainsin exchangefor bondholder consents.

### B.Data and Methodology

To examine the hypotheses outlined above empirically,  stock and bond price data were collected for as many of the solicitation events as possible. The event dates,  isolated from press releases,  were the announcements of transactions which required bondholder consents. Because many firms in the sample wereeither privately owned or were subsidiaries of public companies,  stock price data were available for only 29 of the 54 coercively structured solicitations. Returns from the daybefore to the day after the event date were adjusted by subtracting，alternately,  the return on the S&P 500 Index and on the Nasdaq Composite Index over the same time period. Stock and index prices were collectedfrom the Center for Research in Security Prices data base and the New York Stock Exchange,  American Stock Exchange,  and Over-the-Counter Daily Stock Price Record. Bond prices could be found,  at daily or monthly frequencies,  for 42 of the 54 events. If daily prices were available,  the analysis focused on the narrowest window around the event date forwhichprices could be found. Sources of daily price data were the SalomonBrothers High Yield Department,  the Bear Stearns High Yield Department,  Interactive Data Corporation,  and Bloomberg. If daily prices were not available,  the analysis focused on a window from the month-end before the. Event to the month-end after the event. Sources for monthly price data were Moody’s and S&P.In order to adjust for interest rate risk,  each corporate bond was matched with a Treasury bond of a similar maturity and,  if possible,  of a similar coupon. Then,  on every date for which a corporate bond price was collected,  the price of its matched-maturity. Treasury was collected. In order to adjust for credit risk,  average monthly yields for corporate bonds in different rating classes were collected. Treasury-bond data were taken from Salomon Brothers quote sheets and from the Wall Street Journal. Yield data across ratings were provided from investment banking sources by Edward Altman. To be more specific about the adjustments of bond returns for inter-

Est rate risk,  define the following variables

a: the abnormal return of the bond around the event date,  
$P_{-1}$ : the price of the bond before the event date,
$Y_{-1}$：the yield to maturity of the bond before the event date,
$P_{+1}$ : the price of thebond after the event date, 
$y_{+1}$ : the yield to maturity of the bond after the event date,
$\Delta y_T$ : the change in a matched-maturity Treasury yield from before the event date to after the event date,  and 
${} \Delta s {}$ : the change in the credit spreadbetweenbonds of similar ratings and Treasuries over the event date.

Let $P(y)$ denote the standard pricing function for a given yield-tomaturity,  y. For all monthly data,  abnormal returns were defined as

$$a=\{P_{+1}/P_{-1}\}-\{P(y_{-1}+\Delta y_{T}+\Delta s)/P_{-1}\}.$$

This definition adjusts for both interest rate changes and credit spread changes over the event date. Since credit spread data were not available on a daily basis,  daily abnormal returns were defined as

$$a=\{P_{+1}/P_{-1}\}-\{\mathrm{P}(y_{-1}+\Delta y_{T})/P_{-1}\}, $$

Which controls only for interest rate changes. Since the window around the event was typically set between 3 and 5 days,  the failure to control for credit spread changes should not have much of an effect on the results. If a solicitation event involved more than one debt issue,  the abnormal return for the event was taken as the average of the abnormal returns over the issues. Since the abnormal returns of different issues over the same event are likely tobe highly correlated,  the standard deviations of the abnormal returns from these conglomerate issues are comparable to those from individual issues. To the extent that the abnormal returns across issues for a given event are less than perfectly correlated,  the tests of significance reported below would be conservative.

### C.Results

Table 3，panelA,  reports that the average abnormal bond return around event dates was $2.34\%$ for the monthly data and $0.\1\%$ for the daily data. 13 The null hypothesis that these averages are negative can be rejected at the $5\%$ level. These results are not driven bya few positive outliers; 29 of the 42,  or $69\%$ of the abnormal returns are positive. Furthermore,  one can easily reject the hypothesis that the median of these returns is negative. Table 3,  panel B,  presents the results with respect to stock prices.

The average abnormal stockreturn was about $9.5\%14$ and significantly positive. Once again,  the result is not driven by outliers; 22 of the 28 abnormal returns are positive,  and one can reject the hypothesis that the median is negative. Is Positive abnormalstock and bondreturns are consistent with the

Hypothesis that bondholders are able to act in concert and vote in blocks. In that case,  the main results of Section II do not apply: bondholder coordination limits the ability of shareholders to expropriate bondholder wealth. Furthermore,  bondholders can demand a share of any gains which arise from the covenant modifications

### V.Direct Evidence against the Coercion Hypothesis

Abnormally positive stock and bond returns provide only indirect evidence in favor of the bondholder coordination hypothesis. This section reports direct evidence in support of this hypothesis. Direct evidence also serves to allay fears that the signaling effect,  introduced in the previous section,  dominates returns around the event dates. For if,  on average,  the signaling effect is positive and sufficiently large,  abnormally positive bondholder returns are not inconsistent with the coercion hypothesis; abnormal returns might be positive but less than they would have been in the absence of coercion. This possibility can be refuted by direct evidence against the coercion hypothesis.

## A.The Magnitude of Consent Payments

According to the theory of Section II,  consent payments of any magnitude cangenerate outcomes in which bondholders approve harmful indenture modifications. Therefore, "large" consent payments are more indicative of compensation for lost covenant protection and of

![500](CleanShot%202024-09-27%20-002937@2x.png)
Note. For one-sided tests,  $t_{gg}(21)\:=\:1.721$ $\iota_{, \mathrm{os}}(28)$ = 1.701. All stock returns were computed using daily data. Returns were adjusted，alternately,  for changes in thelevel of the S&P 50 o Index andNasdaq Composite Index. One outlier,  with an abnormal return of about 36096 was omitted from this table.

gains sharing than of coercion. But how large is“large''? While this question cannot be answered precisely,  it is useful to note that consent solicitations which ask for very minor and technical changes usually offer bondholders \$1 per $\$1, 000$ face amount aspaymentfor the time and effort expended in filling out the appropriate forms. This article's sample contained one solicitation of that type.) Therefore,  one might argue that consentpayments neednotbe much larger than Sl per $\$1, 000$ to generate coercive outcomes. But,  across 23 solicitations that made consent payments,  16 the average and median payments were $\$20.51$ and $\$15$ per $S1, 000$ face amount,  respectively. Only 2 of the 23 were below $S5$ and 9 of the 23 were above $s20$ .Thelargest two consent payments were \$60 and \$95. Therefore,  consent payments seem more indicative of efforts to satisfy bondholders than indicative of unnecessarily generous attempts at coercion. As evident from the statistics reported in the previous paragraph,

The size of the consent payments varied considerably across solicitations. This is also consistent with the gains-sharing hypothesis. Each set of bondholders had tobepersuaded to accept theunique set of risks and potential losses which arose from each firm's proposal.

1. The sample contained 30 solicitations that made consent payments. For three of them,  the size of the consent payment could not be ascertained. Another four were made in combination with tenderoffers subject to the restriction that bondholders could not consent without agreeing to tender. It follows that,  in those cases,  bondholders receive compensation for covenant changes both through the tender price and through the consent payment. Therefore,  these consent payments were omitted from the calculations reported in the text.

------------------------------------------------------------------

## B.The Emergence of Bondholder Groups

The mechanics of coercion require that bondholders notbe able to coordinate their votes. Yet for 12 of the sample events,  press releases. Indicated that bondholder groups did form in reaction to consent solici-. Tations. To the extent thatpress releases do not cover all bondholder meetings,  this number might underestimate the true number of meetings generated by the solicitations in the sample. And furthermore,  by establishing that bondholders can collude,  it is not unreasonable to suppose that less formal communication among bondholders,  or the possibility of such communication and coordination,  tends to dissuade firms from launching solicitations at unfair terms.

## $C$ .The Effectiveness of Bondholder Groups

Of the 12 solicitations which were followed by the formation of bondholder groups,  11 either failed or had their terms modified before being approved. The fate of the remaining solicitation could not be ascer-. Tained. It seems clear,  therefore,  that colluding bondholders have a great deal to say about the terms of any successful covenant modifica tion.

## $D$ .The Modification of Issuer Proposals

In 55 events for which data were available，23,  or $42\%$ , of the issuers modified solicitation terms after an initial failure to obtain a sufficient number of bondholder consents. Of these modified solicitations,  the following data were available about the changesproposed by thefirms: 17 increased payment terms (i.e.,  the consent payment,  the tender price,  the promised interest rate,  etc.),  3 requested more moderate covenant changes than initially sought,  and 2 both increased payment terms and requested more moderate covenant changes. The relatively frequent improvement of terms supports the view thatbondholders andstockholders arrive at a mutually satisfactory division of the gains which would result from the proposed transaction

## $E$ .Magnitude of Payment Term Modifications

Across 19 increases in payment terms after an initial unsuccessful solicitation,  the average and median increases were $S40.28$ and $\$18.40$ per $\$1, 000$ face amount,  respectively. The range of the increases was. $\$5-\$160.$ It seems highly unlikely that a median initial consent payment of $\$15$ could not induce coercion while an addition of $\$18.40$ could And the coercion hypothesis cannot explain the wide range ofimprovement in payment terms. The bondholder coordination hypothesis,  however,  easily explains these increases as efforts,  in each particular. Instance,  to satisfy bondholders In summary,  the empirical evidence is inconsistent with the hypothesis that firms systematically coerce bondholders into consenting to modifications at disadvantageous terms. This evidence also supports the hypothesis that actual or potential coordination allows bondholders to realize some of the gains expected from covenant modifications.

### VI. Conclusion

The structure of consent solicitations seems to enable firms to coerce bondholders into accepting detrimental covenant modifications. If so,  why don't bondholders demand covenants that prohibit coercive con-. Sent solicitations? This could easily be done by requiring that any consent payment be made to all bondholders and by prohibiting firms from requiring exit consents as a condition for participatingin an exchange or tender offer. Evidence from abnormal bondholder returns provides an answer to this question: firms have not systematically abused the coercive nature of these solicitations. But this answer raises another question. Why don't firms use their coercive power to transfer wealth from bondholders to their stockholders? The answer provided by more direct evidence of the solicitation process is that bondholders can coordinate their actions when faced with a disadvantageous proposal. Indeed,  far from being taken advantage of,  bondholders can extracta portion of the gains created by successful modifications. Thus,  the empiricalevidence does notdemonstrate the need for the kind ofprotective measures that have been recently proposed Thepractice of consent solicitations alsoindicates that the terms of

Public debt can be renegotiated more easily than has been assumed in the academic literature. This has important implications for models of. Optimal security design that may not have incorporated the ability to modify the covenants ofpublic debt after issuance.

### Proofs of Propositions 1 and 2

There are **N + 1** players with an approval threshold of **M + 1**. From the point of view of any player, the strategies of other players can be described by the number who plan to consent, **Y**, and the number who plan to withhold consent, **N - Y**. Let **q** be the probability that a particular player errs, that is, that he does not play his Nash strategy. Let **λ** be the probability that at least **M + 1** of the other **N** holders consent. Let **θ** be the probability that exactly **M** of the other **N** holders consent. Let **μ** be the probability that at most **M - 1** of the other **N** players consent.

### Proofs of Propositions 1 and 2

There are $N+1$ players with an approval threshold of $M+1$ From the point ofview of any player,  the strategies of other players can be described by the number who plan to consent,  $Y$ ,  and the number who plan to withhold consent,  $N-Y.$ Let $q$ be the probability that a particular player errs,  that is,  that he does not play his Nash strategy. Let 入 be the probability that at least $M+1$ of the other $N$ holders consent. Let $\theta$ be the probability that exactly M of the other $N$ holders consent. Let $\mu$ be the probability that at most $M-1$ of the other $N$ players consent LEMMA. If $Y\geq M+1$ , then $\Theta/\lambda\rightarrow0$ as $q\rightarrow0$ If $Y\leq M$ , then $\Theta/\lambda\rightarrow0$

as $q\rightarrow0$ Proof. The probabilities 0 and $\lambda$ are givenby the following expressions

$$\theta=\sum_{i+j=M}\binom{Y}{i}\binom{N-Y}{j}q^{Y-i+j}(1-q)^{i+N-Y-j}$$

$$ \lambda=\sum_{k=M+1}^{N}\sum_{i+j=k}\binom{Y}{i}\binom{N-Y}{j}q^{Y-i+j}(1-q)^{i+N-Y-j}. $$

As $q\to0$ , only the terms with the smallest exponents of $q$ contribute to the summations. Therefore,  as $q\rightarrow0$
$$\begin{align*}
\theta &\approx 
\begin{cases} 
\binom{N - Y}{M - Y} q^{M - Y} (1 - q)^{N - M + Y} & \text{if } M \geq Y \\[4mm]
\binom{Y}{M} q^{Y - M} (1 - q)^{M + N - Y} & \text{if } M < Y 
\end{cases} \\[6mm]
\lambda &\approx 
\begin{cases} 
\binom{N - Y}{M + 1 - Y} q^{M + 1 - Y} (1 - q)^{N - M - 1 + Y} & \text{if } M + 1 > Y \\[4mm]
(1 - q)^N & \text{if } M + 1 \leq Y
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

Finally,  taking the ratio $\theta/\lambda$ leaves a positive power of 9 in the numerator when $Y\boldsymbol{\geq}M+1$ and a positive power of 4 in the denominator when $Y\leq M$

Hence the ratio approaches Owhen $Y\geq M+1$ and the ratio approaches when $Y\leq M$ .Q.E.D

Proposition 1. Game 1 supports two THP Nash equilibria. In one all play ers consent and in the other all players withhold consent. Proof. It is easily verified that the following strategy vectors constitute

Nash equilibria: all players consent and at most M of the players consent while the rest withhold consent.

First,  consider the Nash equilibrium in which all players consent. A suffi cient condition for trembling hand perfection is that,  as $q\rightarrow0$，$C$ is the pre ferred strategy The expected value of consentingis

$$\lambda(B_n+p)\:+\:\theta(B_n\:+\:p)\:+\:\mu B.$$

The expected value of not consenting is

$$\lambda B^{\prime}\:+\:\theta B\:+\:\mu B.$$

Therefore,  $C$ may be chosen so longas

$$B_{n}+p-B^{\prime}>(\theta/\lambda)[B-(B_{n}+p)].$$

Note that the inequality conditions of the problem ensure that $B_{n}+p-B^{\prime}$ >0 and that $B-(B_{n}+p)>0$ .Since all players consent in the Nash equilib rium under consideration,  the lemma reveals that $\Theta/\lambda\rightarrow0$ as $q\rightarrow0$ .So,  in the limit,  (B 3) is satisfied and all consenting is THP Now consider the Nash equilibria in which,  at most,  $Y\leq M$ of the $N+1$

players consent. In this case,  the lemma reveals that $\hat{\theta}/\lambda\rightarrow00$ so that (B 3) is not satisfied. In other words,  consenters will switch to $NC$ for small $q$ .This implies that all $NC$ is THP. (To show that the other Nash equilibria with $Y\geq$ $M$ are not THP,  one must allow the tremble probabilities to differ across players and then,  as in this proof,  show that consenters will switch to $NC$ as the tremble probabilities get small.) Q.E.D PRoposrTioN 2. The unique,  symmetric THP Nash equilibrium of game 2 is

One in which all players consent. Proof. The payoff functions of the game are

$$\left.\pi_{i}(C, S_{-i})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}B_{n}+p&\text{if at least }M+1\text{other holders consent};\\B_{n}+p&\text{if exactly }M\text{other holders consent};\\B+p&\text{if at most }M-1\text{other holders consent};\end{array}\right.\right.$$

$$\left.\pi_{i}(NC, S_{-i})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}B'&\text{if at least}M+1\text{other holders consent};\\B&\text{if exactly}M\text{other holders consent};\\B&\text{if at most}M-1\text{other holders consent}.\end{array}\right.\right.$$

It is easy to verify that the only symmetric Nash equilibrium of this game has all players consenting. The expected value of consenting is

$$\lambda(B_{n}\:+\:p)\:+\:\theta(B_{n}\:+\:p)\:+\:\mu(B\:+\:p).$$

Using (2),  the expected value of not consenting,  players will consent so long as

$$B_{n}+p-B^{\prime}>(\theta/\lambda)[B_{n}+p)]-(\mu/\lambda)p.$$

From the probability expressions given in the proof of the lemma,  it follows directly that all consenting implies that $\theta\rightarrow0$ $\lambda\to1$ , and $\mu\rightarrow0$ . Therefore,  the right-hand side of (B 4) goes to 0 .Since the conditions of the problem ensure that $\bar{B}_{n}\:+\:p\:-\:B^{\prime}>0$ ,  (B 4) is satisfied and all consenting is THP. Q.E.D.
