# Oaktree And The Restructuring Of CIT Group (B)

On Wednesday,  July 15,  2009,  CIT announced the termination of its talks with the U.S.

Government,  in which it had attempted to receive a guarantee of newly issued debt under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP). On Monday,  July 20 th,  a group of six CIT creditors stepped in with a $3 billion rescue loan package. 1 Over the weekend,  CIT rejected a private offer from General Electric of over $2 billion in secured loans. While GE's offer was less costly and required less collateral than the loans from bondholders,  CIT rejected the offer because loan funds would not have been available until July 31.

## Terms Of The Rescue Loan

The loan package consisted of a $2 billion term-loan facility,  available immediately,  and a $1 billion delay-draw term loan facility,  available at the end of the month. A Other CIT unsecured creditors could participate in the syndication of the $1 billion delay-draw facility. Both facilities matured on January 20,  2012,  and both facilities set interest at LIBOR plus 1, 000 basis points,  with a 3% LIBOR floor,  payable monthly.

- b. The facility also included a variety of fees: (i) a commitment fee of 5%; (ii) an undrawn commitment fee of 1% per annum; (iii) a 2% exit fee on amounts prepaid or repaid; and (iv) a prepayment premium of 6.5% percent on the loan amount CIT might want to reduce.

The $3 billion loan was secured by all unencumbered CIT assets. The loan included a minimum collateral coverage covenant requiring the ratio of the book value of the collateral securing the loan to exceed a 5:1 ratio on a quarterly basis,  and for fair value to exceed a 3:1 ratio as of the end of each fiscal year. On July 31,  2009,  the ratio of the book value of the collateral securing the credit facility to the outstanding loans was estimated to be greater than 8:1. Through contractual mechanisms (see Exhibit 1),  fee schedule,  and collateral requirements,  the creditors effectively made any third-party follow-up financing unattractive,  and preserved the option of debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing for themselves.

The credit facility was arranged by Barclays,  and included among its lenders California-based Oaktree Capital Management,  Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO),  Capital Research & Management,  New York-based Centerbridge Partners,  Boston-based Baupost Group,  and Greenwich,  Connecticut-based Silver Point Capital. These six creditors collectively comprised the Lenders Steering Committee. Members of Steering Committee were restricted from changing their positions in CIT unsecured debt,  and would not be allowed to buy CIT assets in a direct sale.

The loan contained provisions requiring CIT to develop a restructuring plan that was acceptable to the majority (in number) of the Steering Committee by August 14,  2009. The plan would need to be adopted by October 1,  2009.

## Section 5. Affirmative Covenants

#### 5.17 **Approved Restructuring Plan.**

 Company will use its best efforts (subject to the directors' fiduciary duties and Lenders Steering Committee's obligation to negotiate in good faith) to have an Approved Restructuring Plan (which shall not require the sale of any assets to one or more of the Lenders Steering Committee) acceptable to Company adopted by August 14,  2009 and shall comply with such plan in all material respects at all times thereafter. Unless extended by the Lenders Steering Committee,  Company shall adopt such an Approved Restructuring Plan by October 1,  2009 and shall comply with such plan at all times thereafter.

## Section 7. Guaranty

### 7.1 **Guaranty of the Obligations**

Subject to the provisions of Section 7.2,  Guarantors jointly and severally hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guaranty to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Beneficiaries the due and punctual payment in full of all Obligations when the same shall become due,  whether at stated maturity,  by required prepayment,  declaration,  acceleration,  demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section 362 (a) of the Bankruptcy Code ,  11 U.S.C. §362 (a)) (collectively,  the "Guaranteed Obligations"). […]

#### 7.11 Bankruptcy,  Etc

- (a) So long as any Guaranteed Obligations remain outstanding,  no Guarantor shall,  without the prior written consent of Administrative Agent acting pursuant to the instructions of Requisite Lenders,  commence or join with any other Person in commencing any bankruptcy,  reorganization or insolvency case or proceeding against Borrowers or any other Guarantor. The obligations of Guarantors hereunder shall not be reduced,  limited,  impaired,  discharged,  deferred,  suspended or terminated by any case or proceeding,  voluntary or involuntary,  involving the bankruptcy,  insolvency,  receivership,  reorganization,  liquidation or arrangement of Borrowers or any other Guarantor or by any defense which Borrowers or any other Guarantor may have by reason of the order,  decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.
- (b) Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations which accrues after the commencement of any case or proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or,  if interest on any portion of the Guaranteed Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of law by reason of the commencement of such case or proceeding,  such interest as would have accrued on such portion of the Guaranteed Obligations if such case or proceeding had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guaranteed Obligations because it is the intention of Guarantors and Beneficiaries that the Guaranteed Obligations which are guaranteed by Guarantors pursuant hereto should be determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve Borrowers of any portion of such Guaranteed Obligations. Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy,  receiver,  debtor in possession,  assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay Administrative Agent,  or allow the claim of Administrative Agent in respect of,  any such interest accruing after the date on which such case or proceeding is commenced.
