# Breaking The Buck

On his way to the weekly meeting of the Investment Committee at Rich Passage Advisers, Inc. ("RPG Advisers"), Finbar McCall caught a glimpse out the window of the rain soaked streets below. 

Outside on that stormy day in February of 2009, some pedestrians on the streets of Seattle tilted their umbrellas into the wind as they tried to make headway into the storm, while others dashed their upended umbrellas to the pavement and forged ahead unarmed. Inside, the climate at RPG Advisers was equally challenging. Five months earlier, on September 14, 2008, Lehman Brothers, a financial services firm, filed for bankruptcy, freezing the short-term lending markets as the economy entered its weakest period since the Great Depression. 

As the investment manager of RPG Prime Reserve Fund, Inc. ("RPGXX"), a money market fund, McCall had closely followed the disastrous consequences of the Lehman bankruptcy on another money market fund, the Reserve Primary Fund, run by a veteran money manager at the Reserve Management Company. On Tuesday, September 16, 2008 the Reserve Primary Fund had "broken the buck" when losses on its holdings of Lehman bonds caused the value of the fund's assets to fall below $1 per share. 

Another fund, the Putnam Prime Money Market Fund, voted on September 17, 2008 to close its fund with $12.3 billion in assets and distribute its $12.3 billion to investors. Although the fund had no investment in Lehman bonds, a wave of redemption requests led Putnam to liquidate the fund --rather than risk significant losses in trying to liquidate a significant portion of the fund's investments very quickly.

With the help of the federal government, McCall managed to stave off a similar crisis for RPGXX in the calamitous weeks of 2008 that followed the Lehman bankruptcy filing. To stem the rising tide of money market fund redemptions, on September 19, 2008, the U.S. Treasury initiated an insurance program for money market funds. Redemptions in RPGXX slowed after McCall announced that the fund had paid the fees for federal insurance, and McCall had decided to extend the coverage through April 2009. 

As McCall strode down the hall to his meeting, he deliberated over the news he had just heard that the U.S. Treasury was extending the availability of insurance for eligible money market funds through September 18, 2009. McCall knew that the Investment Committee would expect a briefing on whether RPGXX should extend its coverage past its current April 30, 2009 expiration. Although McCall did not regret the decision to participate in the program in September 2008, market conditions had changed considerably since then. Did the benefit of federal insurance for RPGXX justify the expense?
McCall started to run through the numbers in his head as he approached the conference room to present his case

## How Money Market Funds Came To Be

Investment management companies created money market funds in the 1970 s as a cash management instrument that provided a stable principal value, with a share price of $1.00. Money market mutual funds invested in the market of debt securities which matured within a year or less, known as the "money market". Money market funds thus invested in short-term debt securities such as Treasury bills, the notes of various government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, variable rate demand notes issued by municipalities, large certificates of deposit issued by banks, as well as commercial paper issued by corporations which had a maturity of 270 days or less. The three varieties of money market funds - prime funds, government funds, and tax-exempt funds—differed in the types of securities held in their portfolios. Prime funds contained the widest range of securities and included corporate commercial paper. Government funds were primarily invested in Treasury securities and securities issued by government agencies (see **Exhibit 1)**. In general, government funds carried less risk, and a lower rate of return, than prime funds. Tax exempt funds invested in securities which were exempt from federal and/or state tax; the riskiness of these securities depended on the financial condition of the specific local or state entity issuing the securities. 

2 changed considerably since then. Did the benefit of federal insurance for RPGXX justify the expense? McCall started to run through the numbers in his head as he approached the conference room to present his case.

When money market funds became available in the 1970 s, they provided small investors with the ability to diversify their investments by investing in short-term debt instruments through a professionally managed mutual fund. Money market funds were designed to pay income with a yield that tracked market interest rates. The market-based yield of money market funds was generally higher than the interest rates that bank accounts were paying at that time. Until 1986, the Federal Reserve Bank under Regulation Q capped the interest rates that banks could pay on bank deposits. 

After the Federal Reserve Bank phased out the Regulation Q cap in 1986, banks could set their own interest rates for bank deposits, and did not necessarily track market rates, as money market funds did. 

Accordingly, money market fund yields were on average substantially higher than the rates banks offered on similar deposit accounts. Institutional money market funds were targeted at the needs of corporations, foundations, government agencies, and some large investors, whereas retail money market funds were sold to individuals. 1 In addition to offering investors a market rate of return, money market funds offered free check writing and wire transfer privileges. By contrast to the earlywithdrawal penalties which were imposed on the holders of bank certificates of deposit, shares in a money market fund were highly liquid. A money market shareholder could redeem his or her shares automatically without penalty, and receive next-day settlement. These features, together with the favorable return of money market funds, fueled the growth of assets in money market funds relative to bank deposits. 2 The money market fund industry grew from less than $2 billion in assets at the end of 1974 to $3.9 trillion in assets as of January 2009.3 Yet, money market funds differed from bank deposits in at least one critical respect. The FDIC  insured bank deposits up to a specified amount, whereas no federal agency had ever insured money market funds—until the U.S. Treasury established a temporary insurance program for money market funds on September 19, 2008. Instead of being insured by the FDIC, money market funds were subject to stringent regulations established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Certain of these regulations were aimed at limiting a money market fund's credit risk (the risk of default by an issuer of the security), and market risk (the risk that changes in interest rates would trigger a significant change in value). For example, the SEC rules controlled the quality of securities held in a money market fund by requiring that at least 95 percent of the assets held in a money market fund must be invested in the highest-quality tier of money market securities and no more than 5 per cent of its assets could be invested in the second-highest quality tier. 4 The rules further imposed a diversification standard on the holdings of a money market fund by prohibiting a fund from investing more than 5 percent of its assets with any single top-rated issuer (other than the federal government), 
And no more than 1 percent of its assets in any second tier issuer. 5 Third, the average maturity of the securities held in a money market fund could not exceed 90 days. 6 A key objective of these controls on the investments of money market funds, together with certain accounting conventions, was to maintain the stable $1 per share price of a money market fund.

Several accounting practices enabled money market funds to maintain a $1 per share price representing its net asset value ("NAV"). The NAV was the current value of the fund's portfolio divided by the number of shares of the fund outstanding. The NAV was required to be calculated and published daily. The accounting techniques used to maintain the $1 per share price included distributing the net income of the fund as it was earned, and rounding the NAV to the nearest penny. 

In addition, the accounting technique known as amortized cost allowed money market funds to value their securities by reference to their acquisition cost, as adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount. Amortized cost valuation and penny rounding pricing together permitted money market funds to maintain a constant value for each share, rather than the fluctuating values that characterized stock and bond funds. On at least a weekly basis, money market funds were required to reconcile any difference between the portfolio's value calculated on an amortized cost basis, and the portfolio's value based on available market quotations in a process known as shadow pricing. 

## When Has The Buck Been Broken?

A money market fund could break the buck at $0.9949 -- with a loss of just over .5 of 1 percent on the actual value of its portfolio securities. Even a small loss -- for example, a loss of $5 million on a $1 billion fund -- could force a money market fund to break the buck. A loss caused by a default on a substantial portion of a money market fund's portfolio could cause a fund to break the buck, as did the default of Lehman commercial paper which caused the Reserve Primary Fund, an institutional money market fund, to break the buck. A dramatic rise in interest rates could also present the risk of breaking the buck for a money market fund. Indeed, prior to the Reserve Primary Fund, the only other fund in history to break the buck did so after a sharp increase in short-term interest rates in 1994. Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund was an institutional money market fund which offered shares in its fund principally to small community banks. In 1994, about 27.5% of the assets of Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund were adjustable-rate derivative securities issued by the U.S. government. When a rise in short-term interest rates in early 1994 caused the value of these derivative securities to decline, the fund was forced to liquidate, and eventually paid investors 
$0.961 per share. 7 Faced with the prospect of breaking the buck, a money market fund's investment adviser might implement one of several immediate countermeasures. Otherwise, if the fund did in fact break the buck, the break would likely lead to a flood of shareholder redemptions that had to be met. SEC rules generally required all mutual funds to allow shareholders to redeem their shares at the NAV set on every business day. 8 As a result, it was not uncommon for an investment adviser to step in to save a money market fund under its management from breaking the buck. 9 Nevertheless, investment advisers were careful not to guarantee that they would always bail out their money market funds. The prospectuses for money market funds as a general rule disclosed that the fund and its investment adviser had no duty to maintain a $1 per share price, and provided no guarantee to that effect.

To avoid breaking the buck, the investment adviser of the fund would frequently buy the defaulted securities from the money market fund at face value. 10 For example, in 1990, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Bought the $65 million face value of the commercial paper of Mortgage & Realty Trust Co. Which was held in a money market fund and other investment advisory accounts managed by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. 11 In March of 1990, T. Rowe Price Prime Reserve Fund held $42 million face value of the commercial paper of Mortgage & Realty Trust Co. ("MRT"), and other investment advisory accounts managed by T. Rowe held $23 million face amount. When Standard & Poor's downgraded the rating of MRT paper from A-2 to A-3, MRT subsequently defaulted on $167 million of its outstanding commercial paper, which included T. Rowe's substantial holdings. Rather than allow Prime Reserve Fund to blemish its record by breaking the buck, however, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Had stepped in to buy the MRT paper from Prime Reserve Fund, allowing the price of a share of Prime Reserve Fund to remain at $1. 

Short of actually buying the defaulted securities, investment advisers could also guarantee the obligations of a money market fund, or provide some other form of credit support or backstop agreement, which would enable the money market fund to borrow money or obtain other liquidity in order to maintain its $1 NAV. 12 A third strategy was to close the fund. Putnam Investments exercised this option when its institutional money market fund, Putnam Prime Money Market Fund experienced significant redemptions following the September 2008 meltdown of the Primary Reserve Fund, which was also an institutional money market fund. 13 By closing the fund, Putnam avoided the risk of breaking the buck it would have faced if, in the rush to sell the fund's investments to meet redemption requests, the value of the fund's assets fell below its obligations.

## The Rich Passage Group

Based in Seattle, Washington, The Rich Passage Group ("RPG") was one of the largest financial services holding companies in the U.S. RPG's subsidiary investment advisers provided investment management services to both the RPG family of mutual funds and other separate investment portfolios, such as endowments and pension funds. As of December 31, 2008, RPG had $280 billion in assets under management, with mutual funds holding $168.4 billion of those assets, and separate accounts making up the remaining $111.6 billion. Equities represented the majority of assets under management, with $200.9 billion held in equity and blended investment portfolios, and fixed income portfolios comprising 
$79.1 billion. 

RPG's subsidiary, Rich Passage Advisers, Inc., was the investment adviser to all of RPG's domestic funds. Under investment management agreements between Rich Passage Advisers and each fund, Rich Passage Advisers provided investment services to each fund, such as selecting the fund's investments in accordance with the fund's objectives and restrictions, executing all security transactions on behalf of the funds, and fulfilling corporate administrative services such as recordkeeping, accounting, and fund registration. In return, the funds paid Rich Passage Advisers a monthly management fee.

There were twelve money market funds in the complex, the majority of which were tax-exempt money funds. The remaining money market funds were composed of one government money market fund called the U.S. Treasury Reserve, and two prime funds: RPGXX, and Rich Passage Cash Reserves. Unlike the two prime funds which held over 90% of their assets in commercial paper, medium term notes, CDs, and municipal securities, over 80% of U.S. Treasury Reserve was invested in obligations of the U.S. Treasury. 

## Rpg Prime Reserve Fund, Inc.—Rpgxx

RPGXX, launched in 1976, was one of RPG's oldest mutual funds. It was also one of RPG's larger mutual funds, with assets as of December 31, 2008 of $9.75 billion. The prospectus for the RPGXX dated October 1, 2008 described its objective as: "preservation of capital, liquidity, and consistent with these, the highest possible current income." RPGXX was a retail money market fund which was sold directly to investors without any form of sales charges or trailer fees. 14 The investment restrictions for the fund required it to hold at least 95% of its total assets in prime money market instruments, i.e., instruments in the highest rating category of at least two established rating agencies. The remaining 5% could be invested in securities rated in the second highest short-term rating category. 

Investments for RPGXX could be made in commercial paper, treasury bills, notes, and bonds, certificates of deposit, repurchase agreements, banker's acceptances, agency notes, medium term notes, bank notes, asset backed securities, and funding agreements. Consistent with SEC restrictions, the fund could not purchase an instrument with a maturity greater than 13 months, and had to maintain a weighted average portfolio maturity of 90 days or less. In addition, at most 5% of the portfolio could be invested (at the time of purchase) in the securities of any one issuer, and at most 25% in any one industry. 

RPGXX paid an annual investment management fee to RPG Advisers which was computed daily and paid monthly. The total management fee was .35% of RPGXX's daily net assets, comprised of a group fee of .30%, which reflected the economies of the pooled resources at RPG Advisers, and an individual fee, equal to .05% which took into account the unique features of the particular fund. For example, RPGXX's fund fee of .05% was much lower than Rich Passage Group's Africa and Middle East Fund, which had an individual fee of .75% reflecting the challenges of monitoring the securities of issuers from those distant countries. For the fiscal year ended in May 2008, RPGXX had paid RPG Advisers a total management fee of $35,000,000.

In addition to management fees, for the fiscal year ended in May 2008, RPGXX paid other operating expenses totaling .21%, representing the costs of servicing shareholder accounts, registering the shares of RPGXX with state and federal governments, issuing prospectuses and shareholder reports, and the legal, accounting, and custody expenses incurred for the fund. Thus, the total expenses for RPGXX, including management and "other" operating expenses, were .56% as of May 31, 2008. 

## Markets In Crisis: September 2008 To January 2009

McCall had seen RPGXX through a wild ride in the six months since September of 2008. On September 7, 2008, the federal government had put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship. 

One week later on September 15, 2008, after the federal government declined to offer financial assistance, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. The Reserve Primary Fund, an institutional money market fund which was the oldest money market fund in the country, held $785 million in Lehman bonds, comprising about 1.3 percent of the Reserve Primary Fund's total assets of $62.6 billion. 15 As word spread that the Reserve Primary Fund held substantial amounts of commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers, shareholders in the Reserve Primary Fund requested redemptions for their shares. By the end of the day on September 15 th, redemption requests at the Reserve Primary Fund totaled more than $20 billion. 16 At the same time, Reserve Management Company, Inc. ("RCMI"), the investment adviser to the Reserve Primary Fund, valued the fund's Lehman holdings at eighty cents on the dollar. At that price, the NAV for the Primary Fund was equal to $. 09975, which could be rounded up to maintain the $1 per price share of the money market fund.

By the next day, however, redemption requests at the Reserve Primary Fund were at $40 billion, and the market for the fund's Lehman paper was so thin that RCMI valued the Primary Fund's Lehman securities at zero. RCMI did not have adequate capital to buy the Lehman assets at par value, and the Primary Reserve Fund was not able to obtain any other form of credit support. 17 As a result, RCMI 
Issued the following press release at the end of the day on September 16, 2008:
The value of the debt securities issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (face value $785 million), and held by the Primary Fund has been valued at zero effective as of 4:00 p.m. New York time today. As a result, the NAV of the Primary Fund, effective as of 4:00 pm., is $0.97 a share. 18

## Government Rescue

Investors withdrew their money from money market funds at a record rate during the week of September 15, 2008, with redemptions reaching $144.5 billion compared to $7.1 billion the week before. 19 For a few months after the Lehman bankruptcy, it was close to impossible to sell even the highest quality commercial paper except at a huge discount. Rather than witness a run on prime money market funds nationwide, the federal government introduced several initiatives and policy changes aimed at stabilizing the money market fund industry. First, on September 19, 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it would insure shareholder assets held in money market funds under its Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds (the "Treasury Insurance Program"). 20 Under this program, the federal government guaranteed that eligible money market shareholders would receive $1.00 for each money market share held if the fund's NAV fell below $0.995 and the fund decided to liquidate. Eligible shareholders were shareholders in money market accounts on the day the program was announced, September 19, 2008. The maximum amount of insurance a shareholder could receive was equal to the amount held in the shareholder's account on September 19, 2008.21 Any money market shares not covered by insurance under the program would receive only the fund's net asset value per share in a liquidation of the fund. To participate in the program and offer this insurance to its shareholders for the initial three-month term of the program from September 19, 2008 through December 18, 2008, a money market fund had to pay a participation fee equal to 1 basis point 22 of its net assets if the fund had an NAV of $0.9975 or higher and therefore was not close to breaking the buck. For funds with an NAV greater than or equal to $0.995 and below $0.9975, a higher participation fee equal to 1.5 basis points applied since the fund was closer to breaking the buck. 

The second form of relief granted to money market funds was the SEC decision temporarily to relax the valuation requirements for money market funds. Although money market funds had been required to value their assets according to calculations that took into account the market values of those assets at least weekly, uncertainty in the markets in the fall of 2008 prompted the SEC to issue a noaction letter easing that requirement. 23 Specifically, the SEC no-action letter stated that until January 12, 2009, it would take no action against a money market fund that used amortized cost rather than available market quotations to value any portfolio security within 60 days of its maturity. 

Finally, the Federal Reserve allowed funds to address any short-term liquidity problems by making short-term exchanges of their highest quality commercial paper for U.S. Treasuries. Known as the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ("ABCPMMMFLF", 
or "AMLF"), the Federal Reserve had opened the facility on September 19, 2008. Under AMLF the Federal Reserve provided funding to U.S. banks to finance their purchases of high-quality asset-backed commercial paper from money market funds. 24 The asset-backed commercial paper had to carry a rating of at least A 1, F 1, or P 1, and the money market fund selling the paper had to be experiencing significant redemption pressure. A bank borrowing from the Federal Reserve under AMLF had to purchase the asset-backed commercial paper directly from the money market fund, and at a price equal to the amortized cost of the asset-backed commercial paper, rather than a value based on current market factors. 

At the same time, the Federal Reserve provided a wide array of liquidity facilities to commercial banks. The U.S. Treasury offered to buy preferred stock from all banks to boost their capital. In addition, Congress increased the maximum amount covered by FDIC insurance from $100,000 to $250,000 per bank account.

## Keeping Rpgxx Afloat

RPGXX experienced a surge of redemption requests in mid-September of 2008, putting pressure on McCall to maintain enough liquidity to execute the redemptions. Conversely, during the same period, Rich Passage's government money market fund, U.S. Treasury Reserve, experienced an even greater surge of new share purchases as investors sought the safety of government money market funds over prime money market funds. 25 As McCall was scrambling to maintain the cash levels necessary to meet redemption requests, his colleague, Skip Merton who managed U.S. Treasury Reserve was searching for vehicles to invest the proceeds from purchases of new shares in U.S. Treasury Reserve by investors. 

Other fund complexes encountered a similar shift, and in the ensuing weeks close to $500 billion moved from prime money market funds to government money market funds. 26 After the announcement of the Treasury Insurance Program, McCall lost no time applying for coverage for RPGXX. Indeed, all of the money market funds at Rich Passage applied for and received coverage for the initial term through December 18, 2008, as did almost all money market funds at other U.S. fund complexes. Since the NAV for RPGXX was $0.9967 at the time of the September application, RPGXX had been required to pay the premium fee of 1.5 basis points of the fund's net assets. When in December the Treasury Department offered an extension of the program from December 19, 2008 through April 30, 2009, McCall again obtained coverage for RPGXX, even though the fee for the first extension of the program had increased to 2.3 basis points for funds with an NAV between $0.9950 and $0.9975. Moreover, the extension of the Treasury Insurance Program still capped coverage at the amount in a shareholder's money market account as of September 19, 2008. While McCall was confident that RPGXX was not about to break the buck, McCall also believed that the additional expense was justified. Redemptions had slowed after RPGXX obtained the coverage, and with so many other funds participating, McCall did not want to unsettle investors by opting out of the Treasury Insurance Program. 

McCall took full advantage of the other assistance the government provided for money market funds in the fall of 2008 as well. As permitted by the SEC's no-action letter, RPGXX's portfolio securities within 60 days of maturity were valued based on their amortized cost rather than the prices that the securities would sell for in the uncertain market. For example, the fund's holding of $40,000,000 par value of the 1.5% commercial paper of a retail mall developer, due November 30 of 2008 was valued based on amortized cost at $38,975,000, rather than a market price -- because the market for commercial paper had deteriorated so much. 

McCall also made use of the Federal Reserve's AMLF facility to help RPGXX meet the spike in redemptions that had occurred on September 22, 2008 when net redemptions had reached 5.13% of RPGXX's NAV. Under the Federal Reserve AMLF facility, McCall sold $20,000,000 par value of the 1.00% asset-backed commercial paper of Gypco, a construction materials company, to a national bank at its amortized cost of $19,877,000. The bank in turn used the asset-backed commercial paper purchased from RPGXX in order to obtain advances at favorable rates from the Federal Reserve. 

McCall used the cash from the sale to fund redemptions. In the moribund commercial paper market, 7

## The Current Shifts: January To February 2009

8 it would have been impossible to sell the Gypco paper and raise the cash in the absence of the AMLF program, and RPGXX would have had limited options to meet the pitch of redemption requests.

After interest rates reached historic lows at the end of 2008, McCall had ceased to envy Skip Merton's position at the helm of U.S. Treasury Reserve. After many weeks chasing yield on threemonth Treasury bills, which languished in the range of 0.00% to 0.05% (down from 2.80% a year before), 27 many mutual fund complexes had been forced to close their government treasury funds to new investments (see **Exhibit** 2). Otherwise, the government funds risked diluting the profitability of the fund by investing the new money in U.S. Treasury bills which were at record lows. By mid-January of 2009, Merton had given up scouring a market at historic lows to invest any new money and Rich Passage decided to close U.S. Treasury Reserve to new purchases. 

That same week in January, the SEC's no-action letter allowing money market funds to use amortized cost in valuing their near-term securities expired. Yet, the climate for prime money market funds overall seemed to be stabilizing as investors returned to the funds. McCall was pleased to see that on February 28, 2009, RPGXX's net assets had returned to almost the $9.75 billion level that it reached prior to September's crisis.

Returning a yield on RPGXX's investments, however, was a daunting challenge. While the yields for prime funds were better than for government funds (**see Exhibit 3**), the average 7 day yield for prime funds was around 26 basis points. As a result, McCall was under intense pressure to preserve whatever yield could be obtained by reducing fund expenses. To provide some of the flexibility he needed, McCall signed off on a footnote to the supplement to the prospectus for RPGXX dated February 28, 2009 which contained the following table of fees and expenses:

|                                      | Annual fund operating expenses                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|                                      | (expenses that are deducted from fund assets) |
| Management feea                      | 0.35%                                         |
| Other Expenses                       | 0.23%                                         |
| Total annual fund operating expenses | 0.58%                                         |

A RPG Advisers may voluntarily waive all or a portion of the management fee it is entitled to receive to the extent necessary to maintain a net yield of 0.00% on any day a dividend is declared. At any time without prior notice, RPG Advisers may amend or terminate this voluntary waiver of its management fee.

Source: Casewriter.

With yields at record lows, RPG Advisers believed it had to waive the management fee it customarily charged RPGXX. It was understood that in the event yield on RPGXX's investments was so low that the fund couldn't pay "other expenses", RPG Advisers would subsidize the "other expenses." The "other expenses" included the 2.3 basis point fee RPGXX paid to obtain insurance under the Temporary Money Market Funds Guarantee Program through April 30, 2009. Total "other expenses" aside from the insurance cost were around 21 basis points.

## The Immediate Decision

Money markets funds had to submit their applications to renew coverage under the second extension of the Temporary Money Market Funds Guarantee Program by March 7, 2009. The participation fee to obtain coverage through September 18, 2009 was the same as it had been under the first extension, and again the insurance would apply at most to the amount in a shareholder's account at RPGXX as of September 19, 2008. Since RPGXX's NAV was now around $0.9971, RPGXX would still be subject to the premium fee of 2.3 basis points. As he waited for the remaining members of the Investment Committee to filter into the meeting, he jotted down a few proposals to present to the committee which would test their appetite to subsidize RPGXX's "other expenses" (**see Exhibit 4**).

McCall projected that if he shifted the mix of securities in the portfolio to a more conservative profile, he might be able to forego buying the insurance altogether. Investors in February of 2009 seemed calmer than in the previous fall, and the net assets of RPGXX were back at $9.75 billion. 

Although the risk of an issuer default was still possible given the fragile state of the economy, McCall believed that by increasing RPGXX's holdings of U.S. Treasury securities to 20%, and buying securities with shorter maturities overall such that the average weighted maturity was a short 40 days, RPGXX would have a yield of 19.3 basis points. With that type of conservative portfolio, McCall was confident that RPG Advisers would not be at risk of having to bail out RPGXX from breaking the buck. Instead, RPG Advisers would have to subsidize just 1.7 basis points of RPGXX's 21 basis point total of "other expenses" in order to supplement the gap left by a 19.3 basis point yield.

Alternatively, McCall estimated that he could boost RPG's yield to 21 basis points if he bought securities with longer maturities such that the weighted average maturity of the fund was 55 days. He would hold no U.S. Treasuries in the fund, and would instead buy securities from other issuers which paid a higher yield. With a 21 basis point yield, RPG Advisers would not have to subsidize operating expenses so long as the fund did not extend its insurance under the Temporary Money Market Funds Guarantee Program. Would investors head for the exits again if RPGXX did not renew the insurance? Were other money market funds planning to renew their insurance? 

Even if investors did start making redemption requests, McCall knew that he could access the Federal Reserve's AMLF facility to sell asset-backed commercial paper quickly and raise cash if the level of redemption requests became significant. But just thinking about the crazy day in September when McCall last had to access the AMLF facility in order to meet redemptions made his blood run cold. If he ran the riskier portfolio to capture the 21 basis point yield, should he ask Rich Passage Advisers to subsidize the 2.3 basis points it would cost to extend the insurance to September 18, 2009?

## Looking Down The Road

At the same time, McCall knew that the annual update for the fund would soon have to be distributed to all of its shareholders. McCall asked his general counsel to study the prospectuses of other money market funds to see what techniques they were using to address the potential stampedes of redeeming shareholders. For example, some fund prospectuses said that the independent directors of the fund could decide in an emergency to delay the payment on redemptions for up to 7 days or even to suspend redemptions for up to 3 days. Other funds catering to institutional investors provided that the fund could affect "redemption in kind" in response to a large redemption request. That meant that the fund would deliver to its redeeming shareholder a pro rata portion of all of its securities rather than cash.

10 However, the marketing chief of RPG strongly opposed the inclusion of these techniques in the fund's updated prospectuses. She felt that any public announcement of these techniques would drive away investors who were just starting to calm down. She pointed out that some banks were offering rates on insured deposits which exceeded the yield of RPGXX (**see Exhibit 5)**. To the contrary she recommended that the updated prospectus include new restrictions on the fund's investments to make it less likely to break a buck. For example, she wanted the fund to commit to buy only top-rated commercial paper and no second-rated paper. 

In addition, McCall recognized that there would be strong pressures on regulators to make more fundamental changes to the structure of money market funds. For instance, he read a recent report by the Group of 30, a non-profit organization composed of global financial experts, recommending that money market funds should not be permitted to use amortized cost pricing, and that they carry a fluctuating NAV rather than one that is set at US $1 per share. 28 There was also talk in the industry of shortening the maturity limits for money market funds, such that the maximum weighted average maturity of a fund's portfolio would be reduced from 90 days to 60 days. McCall was concerned that some of these changes might be adopted, and tried to anticipate how RPG might respond.
