Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust (the Trust) is a diversified closed-end management investment company which seeks as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital by acquiring,  as banks and other financial institutions currently do,  interests in senior collateralized corporate loans (Participation Interests). Each of these loans will be fully collateralized and will pay interest at a rate which floats primarily with the Prime Rate of a U.S. bank specified in the loan agreement or at the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate. The shares of the Trust are offered continuously at a price equal to its net asset value,  which,  as of the date of this Prospectus,  is $ 510.00 per share plus a varying sales charge of up to $3.000% of the public offering price of the shares purchased from the underwriter,  which will be paid to Pilgrim Distributors Corp.,  the principal underwriter of the shares. If your shares are purchased by the Trust pursuant to a quarterly tender offer,  an“Early Withdrawal Charge” will apply.

will be assessed if you have held your shares for less than one year. The Early Withdrawal Charge does not apply to shares held on record by persons other than the original purchasers from the Trust. The Early Withdrawal Charge plus the sales charge deducted from purchase payments will not exceed 80% of the original purchase amount (net asset value times the number of shares purchased). Please read this prospectus before investing and retain it for future reference. It is designed to provide you

with information about the Trust’s features,  including Participation Interests. There is no limitation on the percentage of the Trust‘s assets which may be invested in instruments which are not readily marketable or subject to restrictions on resale. This prospectus will help you decide if the Trust's goals match your own. Prior to this offering,  there has been no public market for the shares. It is not currently anticipated that a secondary market will develop for Trust shares and as such Trust shares may not be considered readily marketable. The Trustees of the Trust presently intend each quarter to consider the making of tender offers to purchase Trust shares from shareholders. See Tender Offers To Purchase Shares From Shareholders.

# Key Features

## What is the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust's Objective?

The Trust is a diversified closed-end management investment company which seeks as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital by acquiring,  as banks and other financial institutions currently do,  interests (Participation Interests) in senior collateralized corporate loans (Senior Corporate Loans"or Loans") the interest rates on which float primarily with the Prime Rate of a U.S. bank specified in the loan agreements for the Senior Corporate Loans (Loan Agreements) or the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate known as LiBOR. See The Trust’s investment Objective and Policies.

### Preservation of Capital-Portfolio Investment Standards

The Trust expects to provide you with preservation of capital by investing in Participation Interests in Senior Corporate Loans which are fully collateralized by the assets of a domestic corporation and which,  in the opinion of the Manager,  have adequate collateral and an ability to pay scheduled interest and principal. The value of such collateral,  which generally will be determined by an independent appraisal,  will equal or exceed the principal amount of the Senior Corporate Loan. See "How the Trust Works.” In a typical Senior Corporate Loan indebtedness,  a number of lenders,  usually commercial banks or other

commercial lending institutions (Co-Lenders),  lend a corporate borrower ("Corporate Issuer”) a specified sum pursuant to the terms and conditions of a Loan Agreement primarily negotiated by one of the Co-Lenders,  i.e.,  the "Lead Lender."The Loan Agreement among the Corporate Issuer and the Co-Lenders identifies the Lead Lender as well as sets forth the rights and duties of the parties. The Lead Lender or other Co-Lenders frequently sell Participation interests in Senior Corporate Loans to

third parties,  and the Participation Interests may in turn be sold to other persons. See “General Information on Senior Corporate Loan Participation Interests.” All such persons who acquire an interest in a Senior Corporate Loan,  except for Co-Lenders,  are referred to in this Prospectus as"Participants.” The instrument

By which they acquire is referred to as a "Participation Agreement." The Trust may acquire a Participation Interest either by acting as a Co-Lender or by purchasing a Participation Interest in a Co-Lender's interest in a Senior Corporate Loan. The Trust will only acquire a Participation Interest if the Co-Lender from which the Participation interest originates is a bank or other commercial lending institution which meets certain criteria.

The long-term debt of all Co-Lenders from which the Trust will acquire Participation Interests will be rated BBB or better by Standard and Poor's Corporation or Baa or better by Moody's Investors Service,  Inc.,  if theyhave along-term debtrating.In the absence of rated long-term debt,  the Co-Lenders or the holding company of such Co-Lenders will have commercial paper outstanding which is rated at least A-1 by Standard and Poor's Corporation or P-1 by Moody's Investors Service,  inc

Senior Corporate Loans are debt obligations of corporations denominated in U.S. dollars and are usually purchased from major money center banks,  selected regional banks,  and major foreign banks with branches in the U.S.,  which are regulated by the Federal Reserve System or appropriate state regulatory authorities. The Trust and the Manager believe that the credit standards imposed by such banks are comparable to the standards such banks use in connection with loans originated by them and in which they intend to maintain a full interest. The Trust may,  in accordance with a decision of the Board of Trustees of the Trust at its meeting on April 21,  1989,  also purchase Participation Interests in Senior Corporate Loans,  the Lead Lender for which is the finance subsidiary of a domestic corporation which has at least $5 billion in gross assets. This revised policy will not be implemented until the Trust receives certain no-action or exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Trust and the Manager believe that the credit standards imposed by such finance subsidiaries are comparable to the standards such finance subsidiaries use in connection with loans originated by them and in which they intend to maintain a full interest. Co-Lenders and the Trust will not guarantee principal or interest on the Participation Interests in which the Trust invests.

## Floating Rate

The interest rate of each Participation interest acquired by the Trust will float primarily with the Prime Rate of a specified U.S. reference bank as set forth in the Participation Agreement,  LIBOR,  or in some cases another base lending rate or the Certificate of Deposit rate. This means that as those interest rates rise,  your income level eventually should rise. If those interest rates fall,  your income level eventually should fall. It is expected that the compounded income yield net of expenses of the Trust's aggregate portfolio should approximate the average published Prime Rate of leading U.S. banks.

## How Do I Buy Shares of the Trust?

The Trust intends to offer its shares continuously through selected broker-dealers and financial services firms at their net set value,  which,  as of the date of this Prospectus,  is$10.00 per share plus a varying sales charge of up to $s.CO^{\circ/n} of the public offering price of the shares purchased. The minimum initial investment is$5.00 or$2,  000 in the case of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The minimum subsequent investment is$250. See “Shareholder’s Guide."

## When Do I Receive Income?

You can elect to receive monthly distributions from net investment income in cash or have them reinvested in additional shares of the Trust or the open-end funds in the Pilgrim Croup at net asset value. See Disbursements,  Taxes,  and Shareholder Communications.

## General Information on Senior Corporate Loan Participation Interests

Senior Corporate Loans are direct obligations of corporations and are arranged by banks or other commercial lending institutions and made generally to finance internal growth,  mergers,  acquisitions,  stock repurchases,  and leveraged buyouts. Senior Corporate Loans vary from other types of debt in that they hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a company,  i.e.,  because of the priority liens obtained by the senior lenders,  typically these lenders have the first right to cash flows or proceeds provided by the sale of a borrower's collateral if the borrower becomes insolvent. In addition,  the Loans usually include restrictive covenants which must be maintained by the borrowing corporation.

Such covenants,  in addition to the timely payment of interest and principal,  may include mandatory prepayment provisions arising from free cash flow,  restrictions on dividend payments,  and usually state that a company must maintain specific minimum financial ratios as well as establishing limits on total debt. A breach of a covenant,  which is not waived by the Lead Lender,  is normally an event of acceleration,  i.e.,  the Lead Lender has the right to call the outstanding loan. In addition,  loan covenants may include mandatory prepayment provisions stemming from free cash flow. Free cash flow is cash that is in excess of capital expenditures plus debt service requirements of principal and interest. The free cash flow shall be applied to prepay the Senior Corporate Loan in an order of maturity described in the loan documents

The Participation Interests acquired by the Trust may,  depending on the transaction,  take the form of either a direct co-lending relationship with the Corporate Issuer,  an assignment of an interest in the Senior Corporate Loan by a Co-Lender or another Participant that is in a direct relationship with a Co-Lender,  or as a participation in the Co-Lender’s share of the loan. The Trust will only acquire Participation Interests if the Co-Lender from which the Participation Interest originates is a bank or other commercial lending institution which meets certain criteria. In no circumstances,  however,  will the Trust be a Lead Lender or be the sole negotiator,  structurer,  or lender directly to a Corporate Issuer. In all instances,  the Trust will be a participant with a group of lenders and the Trust will acquire no more than a 100/0 interest in the principal amount of any Senior Corporate Loan. See Investment Restrictions.

The Lead Lender performs,  and the other Co-Lenders each perform a credit analysis before making a Senior Corporate Loan. In the opinion of the Manager,  the credit analysis performed by the Lead Lender and Co-Lenders with respect to a Senior Corporate Loan,  a portion of which will be sold,  is comparable to the analysis performed by such persons with respect to loans which they originated and in which they intend to retain a full interest.

In a typical Participation Interest,  the Lead Lender administers the loan and has the right to monitor the collateral. The Lead Lender is also required to segregate the principal and interest payments received from the Corporate Issuer and to hold these payments for the benefit of the Co-Lenders. The Trust will normally

look to the Lead Lender and/or Co-Lender to collect principal and interest on a Participation Interest. Furthermore,  the Trust will look to the Lead Lender to use normal credit remedies,  such as foreclosures on collateral;monitor credit loan covenants;and notify the Co-Lenders of any adverse changes in the corporation's financial condition or declarations of insolvency. At times,  the Trust may also negotiate with the Lead Lender and/or Co-Lenders regarding the Lead Lender's exercise of credit remedies under a Senior Corporate Loan. The Lead Lender is compensated for these services by the Corporate Issuer as is set forth in the Loan Agreement. Such compensation may take the form of a fee paid upon the making of the Senior Corporate Loan and/or an ongoing fee.

When the Trust acts as a Co-Lender or when the Trust acquires a Participation Interest the terms of which provide that the Trust will be in privity with the Corporate Issuer,  the Trust will have direct recourse against the Corporate Issuer in the event the Corporate Issuer fails to pay scheduled principal and interest. In all other cases,  the Trust will look to the Lead Lender to use appropriate credit remedies against the Corporate Issuer.

The Loan Agreements in connection with Senior Corporate Loans set forth the standard of care to be exercised by the Lead Lenders on behalf of the Co-Lenders and usually provide for the termination of the Lead Lender's agency status in the event that it fails to act properly,  becomes insolvent,  enters FDI receivership,  or if not FDIC insured,  enters into bankruptcy. Should a Lead Lenderor Co-Lender from which a Participation Interest originates become insolvent,  enter FDI receivership,  or bankruptcy,  any interest in the Senior Corporate Loan transferred by such person and any loan repayment held by the Lead Lender for the benefit of the Co-Lenders and Participants may be included in the Lead Lender or Co-Lender's estate. In such an event,  the Trust might incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest. In the event a Lead Lender is unable to perform its obligations as Lead Lender,  another Co-Lender would generally serve in that capacity.

The Trust believes that the principal credit risk associated with acquiring Participation Interests from a Co-lender is the credit risk associated with the Corporate Issuer of the underlying Senior Corporate Loan. The Trust may incur additional credit risk; however,  when the Trust is in the position of Participant rather than a Co-Lencer because the Trust must assume the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Co-Lender from which the Participation Interest was acquired. However,  in acquiring Participation Interests,  the Trust will conduct an analysis and evaluation of the financial condition of each such Co-Lender. In this regard,  the Long-term debt of all such Co-Lenders will be rated BBB or better by Standard and Poor's Corporation or Baa or better by Moody's Investors Service,  Inc.,  if the Co-Lenders have a long-term debt rating. In the absence of (rated long-term debt,  the Co-Lenders or,  with respect to a bank,  the holding company of such Co-Lenders will have commercial paper outstanding which is rated at least A-1 by Standard and Poor's Corporation or P1 by Moody's Investors Service,  Inc. Moreover. the Trust will diversify its portfolio with respect to Co-Lenders from which the Trust acquires Participation Interests. See “Investment Restrictions.”

Senior Corporate Loans,  unlike certain bonds,  do not have call protection. This means that Participation Interests comprising the Trust's portfolio,  while having a stated 1 to 7-year term,  may be prepaid,  often without penalty. The actual duration of Participation Interests purchased is expected to be 18 to 24 months. The Trust intends to hold Participation Interests to maturity unless it is necessary to sell them to satisfy shareholder tender offers. The Trust may also sell Participation Interests to adjust the Trust's portfolio in accordance with the Manager's view of current or expected economic or specific industry conditions.

Senior Corporate Loans usually require the prepayment of a loan when there is free cash flow,  asset sales,  or a securities issuance. Prepayments on Senior Corporate Loans may also be made by the Corporate Issuer at its election. The rate of such prepayments may be affected by,  among other things,  general business and economic conditions,  as well as the financial status of the Corporate Issuer. Prepayment would cause the

Actual duration of a Participation Interest to be shorter than its stated maturity. This should,  however,  allow the Trust to reinvest in a new loan. In many cases,  this will result in a new facility fee payable to the Trust. Because interest rates paid on these Participation Interests periodically fluctuate with the market,  it is expected that the prepayment and a subsequent purchase of a new Participation Interest by the Trust will not have a material adverse impact on the yield of the portfolio. (See Portfolio Transactions.)

Under a Senior Corporate Loan,  the Corporate Issuer generally must pledge as collateral assets,  which will be valued at market value,  including one or more of the following:trademarks,  accounts receivable,  inventory,  buildings,  real estate,  franchises,  and both common and preferred stock in its subsidiaries. The valuations of these assets,  which are generally performed by independent appraisers retained by the Lead Lender,  are required as a measure of the value of the collateral prior to granting any loan. If the Lead Lender becomes aware that the value of the collateral has declined,  the Lead Lender will normally take such action as it deems necessary for the protection of its own interests and the interests of the other Co-Lenders and Participants,  including,  for example,  giving the Corporate Issuer an opportunity to provide additional collateral or accelerating the loan. There is no assurance,  however,  that the Corporate Issuer would provide additional collateral or that the liquidation of the existing collateral would satisfy the Corporate Issuer’s obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled interest or principal,  or that such collateral could be readily liquidated.

The Trust may be required to pay and may receive various fees and commissions in the process of purchasing,  selling,  and holding Participation Interests. The fee component normally includes three elements: facility fees,  commitment fees,  and prepayment penalties. Facility fees are commission revenues paid to the Trust when it buys a Participation Interest or by the Trust when it sells a Participation Interest. Commitment fees are paid to the Trust on an ongoing basis based on the undrawn portion of the underlying loan. Prepayment penalties are paid to the Trust when a Corporate Issuer prepays a loan in which there are covenants which call for early payback charges.

### PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

The Trust will,  when it is not acting as Co-Lensor with respect to a Senior Corporate Loan,  acquire Participation Interests from major money center banks and selected regional banks which usually act as Co-Lenders on Senior Corporate Loans. The Trust may also purchase Participation Interests from U.S. branches of foreign banks which are regulated by the Federal Reserve System or appropriate state regulatory authorities. The Trust may also acquire assignments of Participation Interests from certain other commercial lending institutions. The Manager chooses the financial institutions from whom it purchases Participation Interests by considering their professional ability,  level of service,  relationship with the borrowing company,  financial condition,  credit standards,  and quality of management. While these institutions are not required to repurchase Participation Interests which they have sold,  historically many of them have frequently acted as sales agents in Participation Interests,  including interests with respect to which they acted as Lead Lender or Co-Lender. Under most Participation Interests,  it will be necessary for the Trust to obtain the consent of the Lead Lender or Co-Lender from whom the Trust purchased the Participation Interests prior to selling the Participation Interest to a third party.

The frequency of portfolio buys and sells,  known as the “turnover rate,  ”will vary from year to year. It is anticipated that the Trust's portfolio turnover rate will be between $50\%$ and $1000\%

To repurchase tendered shares,  the Trust may borrow money from banks in an amount up to 33/10/0 of total net assets. The Trust will not make additional purchases of Participation Interests or make other investments while borrowings exceed 50/0 of the Trust’s total assets. The Trust may not borrow more than the foregoing amounts without first obtaining the Majority Vote of shareholders.

### TENDER OFFERS TO PURCHASE SHARES FROM SHAREHOLDERS

In recognition of the possibility that a secondary market for the Trust‘s shares may not exist or that,  if a secondary market does develop,  the Trust's shares might trade at a discount,  the Trustees have determined that it would be in the best interest of shareholders for the Trust to take action to provide liquidity to shareholders or to attempt to reduce or eliminate the market value discount from net asset value,  respectively. To that end,  the Trustees presently contemplate that the Trust will take action to consider the making of tender offers to purchase its own shares at net asset value. The Trustees presently intend each quarter to consider the making of such tender offers. The Trustees will at no time be required to make such tender

Moreover,  there can be no assurance that tender offers will result in the Trust’s shares trading at a price which is equal to their net asset value. The Trust anticipates that the market price,  to the extent that a secondary market develops for Trust shares,  may from time to time vary from net asset value. The market price of the Trust shares may,  among other things,  be determined by the relative demand for and supply of such shares in the market,  the Trust’s investment performance,  the Trust’s yield,  and investor perception of the Trust's overall attractiveness as an investment as compared with other investment alternatives. Nevertheless,  the fact that the Trust‘s shares are likely to be the subject of tender offers at net asset value should enhance their attractiveness to investors and thus reduce the spread between market price and net asset value that might otherwise exist.

In deciding whether the Trust will entertain tender offers and whether it will accept shares tendered,  the Trustees will consider several factors. One of the principal factors in the Board’s determination on making quarterly offers will be the strength of the public market for the Trust’s shares. Other factors include the desire to reduce or eliminate a market value discount from net asset value. The Trust believes that potential sellers of Trust shares will be less inclined to accept a significant discount if they have a reasonable expectation of being able to recover net asset value in conjunction with a possible tender offer.

In addition,  the Trustees will take into consideration the liquidity of its assets in determining whether to make a tender offer or accept tendered shares. In paying shareholders for tendered shares,  the Trust anticipates that it will first use cash on hand,  such as proceeds from sales of new Trust shares and specified pay-downs from Participation Interests,  and then the proceeds from the sale of cash equivalents held by the Trust. To the extent more shares are anticipated to be tendered or are tendered than could be paid for out of such amounts,  the liquidity of the Participation Interests held by the Trust may be a consideration in the Trust's determination whether to make a tender offer or,  if an offer is made,  in its determination of whether it will accept shares tendered. Accepting tendered shares may require the Trust to sell portfolio investments and incur certain costs which it otherwise would not have. Under most Participation Interests,  it will be necessary for the Trust to obtain the consent of the Lead Lender or Co-Lender from whom the Trust purchased the Participation Interest prior to selling the Participation Interest to a third party. Participation Interests such as those the Trust intends to invest in have historically been considered by the investment community to be liquid assets,  although in certain instances,  the conversion of such instruments into cash has taken several days or longer. The market for Participation Interests is relatively new as compared to markets for more established debt instruments. Accordingly,  while the Manager does not anticipate any material difficulty in meeting the liquidity needs for tender offers,  there can be no guarantee that the Trust will be able to liquidate a particular Participation Interest it holds within a given period of time.

Furthermore,  even if a tender offer has been made,  it is the Trustees' announced policy,  which may be changed by the Trustees,  not to effect tender offers or accept tenders if:(1) such transactions,  if consummated,  would impair the Trust's status as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code(which would make the Trust a taxable entity,  causing the Trust’s income to be taxed at the corporate level in addition to the taxation of shareholders who receive dividends from the Trust);or (2) there is,  in the judgment of the Trustees,  any (a) material legal action or proceeding instituted or threatened challenging such transactions or otherwise materially adversely affecting the Trust,  (b) declaration of a banking moratorium by federal or state authorities or any suspension of payment by banks in the United States,  (c) limitation affecting the Trust or the issuers of its portfolio instruments imposed by federal or state authorities on the extension of credit by lending institutions or on the exchange of foreign currency,  (d) commencement of war,  armed hostilities,  or other international or national calamity directly or indirectly involving the United States,  or (e) other event or condition which would have a material adverse effect on the Trust or its shareholders if shares were repurchased. The Trustees may modify these conditions in light of experience.

Any tender offer made by the Trust will be at a price equal to the net asset value of the shares at the close of business on the day the tender offer terminates. Each shareholder will be notified in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940,  either by publication or mailing or both. Each offering document will contain such information as is prescribed by such laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Other procedures to be used in connection with a particular repurchase offer will be determined by the Trustees in accordance with the provisions of applicable law,  including the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Any tender offer that the Trust makes may have the effect of reducing shareholder return as a result of the expenses incurred with respect to the tender offers,  the reduced level of interest earned on money received by the Trust as payment for newly purchased shares which may be held in cash equivalents in anticipation of tender offers,  and the cost of borrowing money to fund the tender offers.

In order to minimize the registration expense associated with the filing of tender offers with the SEC,  the Trust may decide to tender for less than all of its issued and outstanding shares in connection with any tender offer it may conduct. The decision as to the amount of shares to be registered in any particular tender offer will be based upon the Trustees' evaluation of several factors,  the principal one being the Trustees' assessment of the level of shareholder desire to tender shares. Should the Trust receive a greater amount of tendered shares than had been registered in a filing with the SEC,  and assuming no change in the various factors which the Trustee originally considered when first deciding to make the tender offer,  the Trust would extend the tender offer period,  if necessary,  and amend its filing so as to increase the number of shares registered to be a free offer in this manner,  while potentially exposing shareholders to the inconvenience of a slight delay in receiving proceeds for their tendered shares,  is vastly outweighed by the benefit afforded all shareholders through a substantial reduction in the total cost of conducting tender offers. The Trust will purchase all shares tendered in accordance with the terms of the offer unless it determines to accept none of them. Payment for tendered shares accepted for repurchase will be made promptly after acceptance. Tendered shares that have been accepted and purchased by the Trust will be retired by the Trustees.

Q & A's on Senior Loan Participation Interests

1. Q. What is a fully collateralized senior loan participation interest?
- A. First of all,  it's nothing new. Loan participations have been around for more than twenty years.
- A loan participation interest is a piece of a bank loan that a U.S. corporation— large or small — has taken to finance growth,  buy another company,  acquire a new product,  or for any number of other business purposes.

1. Q. Is there a big market for these loans?
- A. Currently,  there are more than $250 billion in syndicated loans of the type we would consider for the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust portfolio,  and the market continues to rapidly grow.

1. Q. Why are these called senior collateralized loans?
- A. Because they have the first claim on assets of the borrower. This means these loans get paid before senior bank unsecured credits,  before all other loans,  before any interest is paid on corporate bonds,  before trade creditors are paid as before preferred or common stock.

1. Q. How do these loans work?
- A. Think of an adjustable-rate mortgage. A home buyer takes out a mortgage for $100,      000 and pays interest at 2% more than the prevailing Treasury rate. As interest rates go up and down,      the homeowner will pay more and then less interest,      but still has a mortgage which is valued by the bank at $100,  000 (less any payments of principal on the mortgage which have been made).
- Similarly,  the principal value of the loan participation interests in the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust portfolio should remain constant,  while the interest rate these loans pay will move up and down with the prime rate or some other benchmark rate. By investing in these loans,  the Trust is designed to keep a stable principal value,  while paying dividends that approximate the prime rate.

1. Q. What collateral backs the loans?
- A. The collateral can include plant,  equipment,  and real estate,  inventory,  accounts receivable,  trademarks,  patents,  franchises,  stock in subsidiaries,  and in the case of privately owned companies,  stock controlled by the owners.
- Appraisals and independent valuations are made of the collateral. In addition,  as you know if you've ever taken out a bank loan,  frequently the loans will be given for only a percentage of the value of the collateral.

1. Q. Is there any other protection on these loans?
- A. Generally,  the loans include all sorts of restrictions and criteria which must be met,  including ongoing detailed financial disclosure and review of business plans. There are cash flow requirements,  minimum working capital and net worth standards to be maintained ,  and limitations on taking out any additional loans,  as well as restrictions on dividend and other payments.

1. Q. Are there any types of loans you will exclude from the portfolio?
- A. Foreign loans will be excluded,  as well as energy loans,  loans to finance real estate construction,  high-tech companies,  farming,  single-product companies,  or fads such as toys or games.

1. Q. What kinds of loans will be included?
- A. Loans to manufacturers,  wholesalers,  distributors,  retailers,  media,  and selected service companies will be reviewed. From these,  we will select only those we feel are the strongest after a rigorous credit analysis. In addition to reviewing the financials,  we also look at the history of the borrower,  the quality and consistency of management,  the structure of the loan,  and what kind of other debt the company might have. We also consider the skill and quality of the main underwriting bank,  as well as the other lenders in the syndicate.
1. Q. What kind of diversification will the portfolio have?
- A. The Trust will invest no more than 5% of its total assets in any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities),  will not own more than 10% of any outstanding issue,  and will invest in no more than 25% of its total assets in any industry or industries.

1. Q. Under what circumstances could the net asset value of Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust change?
- A. Any loan is,  of course,  subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled interest or principal. Such an event could result in a decline in the market value of that particular participation interest,  and the Trust shares could therefore experience a decline in NAV.
- Because of the availability of legal remedies,  collateral coverage,  diversification,  and continual monitoring of the portfolio,  the banking industry's experience is that less than 1% of these types of loans have historically defaulted. (This figure includes loans to all of the chosen types of companies excluded from the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust portfolio.) As a result,  Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust management considers this possibility extremely remote.

1. Q. Why is Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust the only realistic way I can participate in this market as an individual or moderate-sized corporation?
- A. Loan participation interests have traditionally been sold by the underwriting bank to third parties such as other banks,  insurance companies,  or large institutions. Typically,  each loan interest is at least $ 55 million,  putting it outside the reach of most investors.
- Pilgrim has adapted existing loan structures to make this market available to individual and corporate investors. A minimum investment of $5,      000 ($2,  000 for IRAs) allows the average investor access to the stability and high yields available in this market,  with all the benefits of diversification and a professionally managed portfolio.

## Mutual Bonds-Portfolio Analysis of Selected Fixed-Income Funds

Last week’s boost in the bank prime lending rate,  to 10½% from 10%,  no doubt had more than a few business borrowers grumbling. And they were probably joined by the growing number of individuals whose home-equity loans are tied to the prime. But investors in the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust were enjoying themselves as much as the bankers who had just hiked their rates.
Pilgrim is a closed-end fund that invests in bank loans with rates tied to the prime rate. And last Monday's half-point rise in major banks' base lending rate pushed the yield on the fund's portfolio up to 10% from 9.69%,  according to Pilgrim's chief executive officer,  Palomba Wein-garten. That's pretty much the idea of the seven-month-old fund.
Investors get rates that are higher than those on bank certificates of deposit and keep pace with rising rates. In essence,  by investing in a portfolio of bank loans,  the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust is a bank in all but name,  Weinganen says.
It would appear that,  by investing in the typical assets of banks,  the Pilgrim Prime Rate is a mirror image of money-market funds,  which invest in such bank liabilities as CDs and commercial paper. But Pilgrim officials are quick to emphasize that the Prime Rate Trust is totally different from money funds,  whose main aim is instant liquidity rather than yield.
The fund's structure is unique and complicated. Unlike other closed-end funds,  which offer a set number of shares in an initial underwriting,
shares of the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust are offered on a continuous basis in a manner similar to an open-end fund—at net asset value,  plus a sales load of 3% for purchases under $100,      -
000. But there is no secondary market in the shares,      as there is with a typical closed-end fund.
Nor does Pilgrim redeem shares on a daily basis at NAV,      as do open-end funds.
Pilgrim instead makes quarterly tender offers to provide Prime Rate Trust holders the opportunity to redeem their shares. That gets around problems inherent in both the closedand open-end structures.
The fund would have to retain a substantial sum in liquid cash equivalents,      lowering its yield,      if it had to make daily redemptions. The managers can prepare for tenders relatively easily by building up cash prior to tenders. Redemptions are further discouraged by the load,      which would be lost when tendering,      and a penalty of one quarter's interest for shares held less than one year— something analogous to the carly-withdrawal penalties on CDs. The Prime Rate Trust is designed as a long-term investment,      not a short-term parking place like a money fund.
Closed-end funds don't suffer withdrawal pangs but tend to succumb to another malady,      a chronic tendency to sink to a discount from net asset value.
Lack of a secondary market prevents the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust from sinking to a discount.
The Byzantine arrangement so far has worked. The NAY,      and hence the price,      has held at the initial $10 per share. The first two tender offers have gone smoothly,  with $364,      000 c-deemed at the one ended last week and $296,  500 last August.
The fund's assets have grown 10% over $130 million. Weingarten says they're increasing at a rate of $2 million-$3 million a day and easily could accommodate withdrawals. Interest and amortization also provide cash flow,  and the fund can tap a credit line equal to one-third of the funds,  she adds. "We could redeem 50%-60% of the trust without selling one loan participation,  " she insists. The Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust similarly has benefited from the rising prime,  which has been raised four times since the fund debuted last spring. Its immunity from price fluctuations probably also has attracted investors,  including disgruntled holders of government bond funds who have left en masse after discovering that rising interest rates meant lower prices on their "riskless" investment. While immune to bond funds' interest-rate risk,  Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust is vulnerable to credit risk. Defaults on the loans it buys would mean a hit of 10% of the fund's net asset value.
The NAV has no upside,  however,  as the fund's assets cannot appreciate to a premium.
But the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust will be able to avoid losses by investing only in pieces of senior,  collateralized loans. That means the bankers and the fund are first in line to be paid in the event of credit problems,  ahead of bondholders. The debt securities also are usually unsecured while the bank loans the fund buys typically are equal to about 60% of the collateral backing them.

Weingarten says that while the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust will act like a bank lender,  it will avoid the areas that led to problem loans. "Our investment philosophy is only to buy loans where we can depend on operational and amortization payments to pay interest to depending on asset sales. We don't invest in energy,  real estate,  construction loans,  high-tech,  or single-product companies. This year's Cabbage Patch Doll can be next year's Chapter 11. We want boring old manufacturing,  distribution,  and wholesale companies." And definitely no foreign loans.
Restrictive covenants also make companies eager to pay off these loans. "Bankers are a pain,  " she says,  tongue firmly in check. "You can't dividend up or out. Sometimes they put 'comp caps' on you. You can't make acquisitions or assume more debt. Basically,  you have to call your banker every time you take a vacation." And if business is better than expected,  the bank can demand between 35% and 60% of excess cash flow for amortization payments.
Borrowers in the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust loan portfolio include Fort Howard Paper,  Viacom,  Singer,  Itel,  and a lesser-known firm,  Tom's Foods. ("They make the junk they serve on airplanes,  nuts,  the chips; great,  great business.") These borrowers also tend to sell junk of another sort: junk bonds. "These loans should not be compared to junk bonds,  " Weingarten contends.
"We have a call on their plant and equipment,  their inventories,  receivables,  the executives' first-born…"
Bank regulators are less glib about the risks of the secondary loan market. A recent Federal Reserve Board study noted a sharp expansion in the percentage of non-investment-grade loans being sold into the secondary market. No doubt an increasing portion of loans to fund leveraged buyouts will be sold by money center banks to smaller institutions. And to the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust: it has some now. How it will fare in the inevitable recession has yet to be demonstrated.

### Funds Under Investigation

A new investment product that has attracted billions of dollars from investors has sparked a widening controversy and has even prompted an investigation by the securities industry.
The issue is how these so-called prime-plus funds are marketed to the public,  the quality of the funds' investments,  and how easily investors can withdraw money. The mutual funds,  which are being sold by brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch & Company,  invest in bank loans to many of the lowest-rated,  most heavily indebted companies.
Some financial experts are worried about the public buying shares in funds that,  in turn,  buy loan participations from banks just as some highly leveraged companies like the Campeau Corporation are having trouble paying off debts in the "junk bond" market.

#### 'At Some Point,  It Stops Passing'

"This has all the rhythm of musical chairs,  " said Michael Lipper,  president of Lipper Analytical Services,  whose firm measures the investment performance of almost 2,  000 mutual funds. "The paper just keeps being passed around and inevitably at some point it stops passing."
Not for the first time,  Mr. Lipper added,  investors may not fully understand what they have bought. "I'd like to see some more experience with them,  " he said.
The National Association of Securities Dealers,  the self-policing organization for the securities industry,  is investigating the way the funds are being promoted. "One of our primary jobs is to protect the public by helping our members not become the center of controversy,  " said a spokeswoman for the Washington organization.
The N.A.S.D. plans to meet with brokers in the next few weeks to determine how these funds are being sold and whether they are explaining the potential pitfalls,  the spokeswoman said. Merrill Lynch declined to comment.
The prime-plus mutual funds are among this year's best sellers on Wall Street. In July,  an underwriting syndicate raised $900 million for the Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves Fund,      and in the last two months,      investors have directed $600 million more into the fund. "It's safe to say that it's our best-selling fund ever,  " said James B. Hawkes,  president of the Boston fund.

As a result of this reception,  Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. have filed prospectuses for similar funds with the Securities and Exchange Commission and hope to offer shares this month. An official at one mutual fund company predicted Wall Street brokers could raise $5 billion from individuals by the year's end.
The prime-plus funds offer a higher-than-average yield by buying participations in short-term bank

### Prime Rate Funds Difficult to Price

EXECUTIVES at some of the increasingly popular class of mutual funds known as prime rate funds are struggling to determine daily prices for their portfolios. These mutual funds invest in senior bank loans that rarely trade in any public market,  and calculating their daily value is "like getting a price on a 'junk bond' that doesn't trade,  " said Christopher L. Snyder Jr.,  president of the Loan Pricing Corporation,  a New York research firm.
Consequently,  the price investors pay to buy shares in some of these funds could be more than the funds' investments are worth,  debt traders say.
And,  of course,  those redeeming shares and getting out of the funds may be receiving more than they should be. In many cases,  the fund executives cannot obtain pricing help from the banks where the loans originated. Worried about possible lawsuits,  bankers at some of the largest money center banks,  including Citicorp,  have been reluctant to provide the funds with such "indicative” quotes on their loans,  bankers and fund managers say.
Because these closed-end mutual funds invest in short-term floating-rate bank loans,  their daily value,  like that of a money market fund,  is supposed to remain constant. But at some of these prime funds,  the net asset values — or the prices investors pay to buy new shares — have begun to fluctuate. The value of the $670 million Van Kampen Merritt Prime Rate Income Trust,      for instance,      has risen slightly above $10 a share because some of its loans have appreciated in value,  said Jeffrey W. Maillet,  the fund's portfolio manager.
But on occasion the net asset value of the $1.1 billion Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust has dropped slightly below 510 for two reasons,      a spokesman for the Pilgrim Group said. Pilgrim executives wrote down a $5 million loan to the Amdura Corporation in March after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. At the same time,  the firm changed its accounting method,  but executives would not discuss the reason for the change.
This year,  the five prime rate funds have been among the fastest growing of all funds and their investment returns have been the highest of all closed-end bond funds,  according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. For example,  after shutting the doors to new business last winter,  executives for the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserves Fund in Boston reopened the fund to investors on July 31 and promptly raised an additional $100 million in one week.
At the end of July,  according to Lipper,  the five funds had $5.5 billion in assets. The current yield was 10 percent for Van Kampen Merritt; 9.98 percent for the Merrill Lynch Prime Fund Inc.; 9.86 percent for the Pilgrim Fund; 9.78 percent for Eaton Vance,      and 9.75 percent for the Allstate Prime Income Trust.
As the name implies,      the goal of these funds is a yield that matches the prime lending rate,      the benchmark rate that banks charge their highest-rated customers,      currently at 10 percent. But to earn such a high yield after fees and expenses,      the fund managers invest in bank loans to many low-rated,      heavily indebted companies like Black & Decker,      Hospital Corporation of America,      and Stone Container.
Executives concede that pricing the loans can be a problem. James B. Hawkes,      president of the $1.7 billion Eaton Vance fund,  compared the task to pricing real estate every day. "The concept of a price today and a price tomorrow is not a helpful concept,  " he said. "They don't trade every day."
Nevertheless,  because these funds sell shares daily to the public,  the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned them to monitor the pricing of these loans carefully. So the funds have had to improvise. Executives of Van Kampen Merritt,  for instance,  use the services of a Wall Street firm that trades bank loans to price the 70 loans in their fund. "We wanted an arms-length procedure that is similar to pricing securities,  " Mr. Maillet said.
Executives at Eaton Vance and Allstate,  however,  calculate the daily values themselves by analyzing interest rates and other so-called "highly leveraged transactions,  " executives of these firms say. And unless a company has defaulted on a loan,  Merrill Lynch carries the loan at its face value,  said Gregg Durett,  a vice president.

As in any market,  of course,  changes in supply and demand determine these loan prices. And even in this thinly traded market,  some loans command a premium while others sell at a discount. These days,  some loans made to RJR Nabisco Inc. at the time of the 1989 leveraged buyout are considered "cool" and are less attractively priced than others,  Mr. Snyder of the loan pricing corporation said. “Hot” bank loans—those in high demand— include Gulfstream Aerospace,  he said.
Because some funds' holdings are substantial,  any discrepancies between a loan's market value and the price a fund uses to calculate its net asset value could be significant. For instance,  Merrill Lynch has about $90 million invested in a short-term loan to Scotsman Manufacturing,      which makes commercial prefabricated buildings. And Eaton Vance has $125 million,  or about 7 percent of its portfolio,  in one of the cool loans to RJR.
Because of their unusually strict policy on redemptions,  though,  it is unlikely that these fund managers will have to liquidate loans at market prices. But the price investors pay to buy new shares in these funds may not be exactly accurate.
