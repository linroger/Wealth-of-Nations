# Runs and Interventions in the Time of Covid 19 Evidence From Money Funds


# 3. Data

Our main data set is compiled from three sources. First, we obtain share-class level MMF information from iMoneyNet, at daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. Daily. And weekly data are available for both domestic MMFs (i.e., 2 a-7 funds defined by the SEC) and offshore USD MMFs, and include the following fund characteristics: assets under management (AUMs), weekly liquid assets (WLA), weighted average maturity (WAM), expense ratios, investor type (institutional or retail), as well as funds² portfolio composition, including shares of the portfolio invested in Treasuries, agency debt, repos, time deposits, unsecured CP, ABCP, CDs, and floating rate notes. Since one fund can have many share classes catering to the needs of various types of investors, we aggregate the share-class level data to the fund level, uniquely identified by the fund’s SEC filing ID.

We obtain MMFs' security-level holdings data from their SEC N-MFP filings. Each 2 a-7 MMF is required to report its portfolio holdings as of every month-end in the NMFP Form. For each security in their portfolios, MMFs report its CUSIP, asset type, amortized cost, market value, yield, and maturity among other characteristics. We merge the iMoneyNet data and N-MFP data based on the funds' SEC filing IDs.

Finally, we use confidential CP and CD micro level data from Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC). The DTCC data includes both transaction level data for each trade in CP and CDs, and daily data that provide total par amount outstanding for each instrument. The transaction data provide detailed information for each primary market trade, including CUSIP, transaction date and maturity date, yield, and quantity For CP, the data also include ratings assigned by both Moody's and S&P. For some tests, we merge the DTCC data with the N-MFP security-level holding data based on the securities' CUSIP information

# 4 Runs on prime MMFs: what is new this time?

From late February to early March, as equity and bond markets went into a tailspin (Figure 1), stress in short-term funding markets also mounted and prime MMFs saw large redemptions from their institutional investors in mid-March (Figure 2)-Prime MMFs have two ways to raise cash to meet investors redemptions. The first option is to tap into their liquid assets that are readily convertible into cash and the second option is to sell longer-term holdings, like CP and CDs. According to the 2016 SEC reform, institutional prime funds can apply liquidity fees and redemption gates when their WLA fall below $30\%$ of their total assets. Therefore, investors could get anxious and run preemptively when funds’ WLA approaches that threshold. As investors started to withdraw from prime funds, eroding their liquidity buffers, fund managers would try to sell their longer-term CP and CDs in an attempt to raise liquidity. However, CP and CD dealers, who act as intermediaries and often do not take one-sided bets, had difficulty in finding third parties interested in buying those securities. 5 A fight to liquidity emerged and the secondary markets for CP and CDs were essentially frozen. The frozen short-term funding markets in turn triggered even larger redemptions from investors

## 4.1 Empirical design and Summary Statistics.

To gauge the magnitude of MMF runs during the Covid-19 crisis and to explore whether the 2016 MMF reform changed the nature of runs on money funds, in this section we compare the Covid-19 MMF run with the previous two prominent MMF runs: the financial crisis run of September 2008 and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis run in the summer of 2011. A crucial difference between the Covid-19 crisis and the previous ones in 2008 and 2011 is that institutional prime MMF investors were not subject to contingent liquidity restrictions (gates and fees）in either 2008 or 2011.

We are interested in answering the following questions: First, did the liquidity restrictions (gates and fees) introduced by the 2016 SEC reform prevent runs from happening or at least alleviate the their severity? Second, did investors’ concerns about the potential imposition of gates and fees exacerbate the run on less liquid prime MMFs?

While the exact triggers of the three runs on prime MMFs differ somewhat, they share some common features. They all start with increasing concerns about credit quality and liquidity of the underlying assets that prime funds invest in, and quickly spiral into runs on liquidity. It should be noted that illiquidity can spread easily from one short-term funding market to another as their common lenders scramble for liquidity. Investors could run on a MMF for liquidity reasons even though the MMF has extremely low exposures to credit risk.

We focus on institutional prime funds for the tests on MMF runs. 6 As shown in Figure 3, the 2008 and 2020 runs are remarkably similar in their outfow patterns and magnitudes. They both spanned a period of about 20 days, over which they both saw outflows of more than $30\%$ of AUMs. On the other hand, the 2011 run on prime funds amid the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis was milder but lasted longer, resulting in a $17\%$ decline in AUMs over a 50 day horizon.

Table 1 presents summary statistics for the three MMF runs, with the month before crisis defined as the “normal" period. It shows that fund size is comparable across the three crises, all about $\$9$ billion for an average institutional prime MMF. During the “normal” periods before large redemptions begin, funds on average experience little fluctuations in their AUMs. However, during crisis periods, funds experience significant daily redemptions of 1.3%, 0.3%, and $2.4\%$ of their assets for 2008, 2011, and 2020 runs respectively

Compared to 2008, prime funds hold substantially more weekly liquid assets (WLAs) in 2011 and 2020. More interestingly, only $3\%$ of institutional prime funds have thein WLAs below $35\%$ in 2020 during the normal period, while $72\%$ (44 $\%$ ) of such funds have WLAs lower than $35\%$ in 2008 (2011). These findings suggest that institutional prime MMFs are extremely careful in managing their liquid asset holdings in the post-2016 reform era.

## 4.2 Regression Results

To assess whether the presence of contingent liquidity restrictions changed the nature of investor runs on prime funds, we run a set of regressions that compare the fow sensitivity to WLA during the 2020 run to that of the 2008 and 2011 runs. Specifically, we use daily and weekly MMF data from iMoneyNet and estimate the following regressions for the three subsamples:7

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i, t}&=\beta_{1}Crisis_{t}+\beta_{2}WLA_{i, t-1}+\beta_{3}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i, t-1}\\&(+\beta_{4}1(WLA<35)+\beta_{5}Crisis_{t}\times1(WLA<35))+\varepsilon_{i, t}, \end{aligned}$$

where $Flow_{i, t}$ is the daily percentage change in the AUM of fund $i$ , winsorized at the $1\%$ and 99% levels. 8 $WLA_{i, t-1}$ (in percent) is the share of weekly liquid assets to total assets of fund $i$ on the previous Tuesday, ? And 1 $(WLA<35)$ equals one if $WLA_{i, t-1}$ is below 35%. Crisis: equals one during each of the crisis periods: September 10-30 in 2008, June 10-August 1 in 2011 and March 624 in 2020

The coefficients of interest are the one on the interaction term between $Crisis_{t}$ and $WLA_{i, t-1}$ , which measures the additional sensitivity of flows to WLA during the crisis, as well as the one on the interaction term between $Crisis_{t}$ and 1 $(WLA<35)$ , which measures the additional daily outflows during the crisis when WLA falls below 35. For all specifications, standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level

Table 2 reports regression results, with Columns (1)-(3), (4)-(6), and (7)-(9) displaying results for the 2008, 2011, and 2020 runs, respectively. Comparing the results in Column (1), (4), and (7), we find that lower WLA during normal times is actually weakly associated with more inflows (although only significant for the 2011 sample), probably because lower WLA is sometimes associated with higher fund yields that attract investors

However, during crisis times the relation is reversed and lower liquidity leads to more outflows. The magnitude of such effect differs drastically across different crises. While in 2008 and 2011 institutional investors run only slightly more on funds with lower WLA, in 2020 they run substantially more on funds with lower WLA. In particular, a decrease of 10 percentage points of WLA is associated with an increase in daily outflows by 0.1 percentage points during the 2008 crisis and by 1 percentage point during the 2020 crisis (ten times the 2008 effect), both significant at the $5\%$ level. Considering that institutiona prime MMFs experienced on average daily outflows of about $2.4\%$ during the 2020 crisis a one standard deviation decline in WLA (equal to $8\%$ in 2020) explains $27\%$ of the average daily outflow.

Columns (2), (5) and (8) examine whether funds suffer more intense runs when thein WLA falls below $35\%$ during the crisis. While the coefficient on the interaction between $Crisis_{t}$ and 1 $1(WLA<35)$ is only mildly negative and not significant for the 2008 and 2011 samples, it is strongly negative and significant at the $5\%$ level for the 2020 sample In particular, a fund with below-35 WLA on average suffers an additional $1.4\%$ daily outflows during the 2020 run.

Columns (3), (6), and (9) test for the nonlinearity of runs when WLA approaches $30\%$ , the threshold that could trigger fees and gates after the 2016 SEC reform. While there is no significant result for the 2008 and 2011 sample, Column (9) shows that even after controlling for the linear effect of WLA, investors tend to run disproportionately more on funds with close-to-30 WLA during the crisis, suggesting an acceleration of runs when investors are concerned about potential fees and gates imposed by the MMFs.

In unreported tests, we also control for a battery of lagged fund characteristics and asset holdings, including MMFs' weighted average maturity, gross yields, charged expense ratios (i.e., management fees), age, whether associated with a bank, share of ABCP in their portfolios, and share of foreign CDs in their portfolios, and our results remain robust and similar.

Table 3 combines the three subsamples together to assess the difference in fow sensitivity to WLA across crises and how significant such difference is. In particular, we estimate the following regressions:

$$Flow_{i, t}=\beta_{1}Crisis_{t}+\beta_{2}Crisis_{t}\times Year_{t}+\beta_{3}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i, t-1}\\+\beta_{4}Crisis_{t}\times WLA_{i, t-1}\times Year_{t}+controls_{i, t-1}+FE_{i, t}+\varepsilon_{i, t}, $$

where controls include various fund characteristics and asset holdings, and year fixec effects are included in all specifications. In some specifications we use the dummy $1(WLA<35]$ ）instead of $WLA$ .The baseline Crisis dummy refers to the 2020 run, and the interactions with $Year=2008$ or $Year=2011$ estimate the additional effects of the 2008 and 2011 runs relative to the most recent one.

Columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 show that the difference in average outflows between the 2008 and the 2020 crisis is insignificant, while the 2011 MMF run is significantly milder. Columns (3)-(5) show that the fow sensitivity to WLA is significantly weaker in either 2008 or 2011 relative to the 2020 baseline sensitivity (in Column (5) we alsc control for fund fixed effects). Similarly, Columns (6)-(8) show that below-35 WLA triggers significantly larger outflows during the 2020 crisis relative to the 2008 or 2011 ones.

Combined, Table 2 and Table 3 show that institutional investors run substantially more on funds with lower WLA during the 2020 crisis. In addition, not only lower liquidity levels drive heavier redemptions, but WLA very close to the regulatory threshold can also trigger a disproportionate acceleration in runs. These findings are consistent with the conjecture that in the fear of imposed fees and gates, institutional investors run more heavily on funds with WLA approaching the triggering point (preemptive runs)

It is worth noting that the 2016 MMF reform not only allows institutional prime funds to impose gates and fees when their WLA falls below $30\%$ , but it also requires them to transact at a foating NAV, meaning that buying and selling shares must take into account the market value of the fund's assets. We also explore whether foating NAVs could be destabilizing, and do not find evidence that lower NAVs significantly drive outflows during the Covid-19 crisis, as shown in Appendix Table A.2

One possible reason for our finding is that MMFs' foating NAVs actually stayed far above the threshold for “breaking the buck” (i.e., falling below 0.995) during the crisis while WLAs have dropped close to or even below $30\%$ for some funds. Indeed, among all institutional prime MMFs, the lowest NAV ever observed during the crisis is 0.998, and the lowest WLA during the same crisis period is $27\%$ . Therefore, we focus the empirica analysis on the sensitivity of flows to WLA

# 5. The calming effects of the MMLF

In this section, we estimate the calming effects of the MMLF on prime funds and examine whether the stability effects of the MMLF accrued to a greater extent to funds holding more MMLF-eligible assets. We also study the spillover effect of the facility to offshore USD prime MMFs. The latter are characteristically similar to domestic prime MMFs and suffered similarly large outflows during the crisis, but are not covered by the MMLF.



## 5.1 Effects and channels of theMMLF on prime funds

Table 4 presents summary statistics for three diferent types of prime MMFs during the crisis and the post-MMLF period. With the MMLF becoming operational on March 23 we define the two weeks before the implementation of the MMLF as the “crisis” period (i.e., March 9 to March 20, business days only) and the two weeks immediately after implementation as the “MMLF" period (i.e., March 23 to April 3, business days only)

Table 4 shows that on average institutional funds suffered the most severe outflows during the crisis period, followed by offshore USD funds, while retail funds were much less affected. In the post-MMLF period, outflows slowed quite a bit for institutiona funds and offshore funds. It's interesting to see that all types of prime funds significantly boosted their liquid asset holdings in the post-MMLF period, increasing their WLAs by 4-8 percentage points

Weformally test the relation between the MMLF and prime fund flowsby estimating the following regressions

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i, t}&=\beta_{1}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{2}WLA_{i, t-1}+\beta_{3}MMLF_{t}\times WLA_{i, t-1}\\&+controls_{i, t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i, t}, \end{aligned}$$

where $Flow_{i, t}$ is the daily percentage change in the AUM of fund $i$ , $WLA_{i, t-1}$ (in percent is the share of weekly liquid assets to total assets of fund $\dot{i}$ on the previous Tuesday, and $MMLF_{t}$ is the dummy for the post-MMLF period (ie., equals one for the period of March 23 to April 3). We double cluster standard errors at fund and day levels.

Table 5 presents the regression results for Equation (3). The sample for Columns (1) and (2) includes both institutional and retail prime funds. Column (1) uses a simple specification to show that on average prime funds' daily outflows decline by 1 percentage point in the post-MMLF period. Column (2) includes the institutional dummy and its interaction term with $MMLF_{t}$ , and the estimation results show that all the reduction in outflows after the launch of the MMLF is concentrated among institutional funds. In particular, relative to retail funds, institutional funds see their daily outflows reduced by 2.3 percentage points after the launch of the MMLF, significant at the $1\%$ level.

Therefore, in Columns (3) to (6), we focus on institutional funds only. Column (3) repeats the specification of Column (1) within the institutional fund sample and shows that the MMLF effect on fund flows is doubled in terms of magnitude, significant at the $1\%$ level. Column (4) includes lagged WLA and its interaction with $MMLF_{t}$ .The results show that while higher WLA helps ease fund outflows during the whole sample period funds with lower WLA experience a stronger rebound in their AUMs after the launch of MMLF, significant at the $5\%$ level.

Column (5) repeats the test of Column (4) while controlling for various lagged fund characteristics, including gross yields, share of risky holdings (CP, CDs, and foating rate notes), share of safe holdings (Treasury and agency debt), charged expense ratios, fund age, and affiliation to banks, and Column (6) further controls for fund fixed effects. The coefficient on the interaction term remains negative and significant. Moreover, it's interesting to find that funds that charge higher management fees suffered less outflows during the sample period, significant at the $1\%$ level. 10 It's possible that funds' management fees are positively correlated with funds’ effort in managing relationships with their institutional investors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fund managers spend significant. Effort during the crisis time to calm down their anxious investors and persuade them not to withdraw

Overall, the results of Table 5 suggest that the MMLF significantly attenuated the sensitivity of flows to the liquidity of the fund (WLA), which characterized the crisis dynamics. Indeed, the ability of a fund to access the MMLF made its current liquidity less of a concern given the availability of plentiful “liquidity of last resort” at the MMLF

To test the potential channel for the MMLF effect on fund flows, we use the CUSIPlevel holding data of MMFs and calculate the share of assets that are MMLF-eligible at the end of February 2020, right before the run started. As described in the MMLF background section, to be MMLF-eligible, assets (including unsecured CP, ABCP, anc CDs) had to satisfy certain maturity, rating, and domicile criteria. Utilizing the granular security-level information in N-MFP, we are able to identify assets that are MMLF-eligible for each MMF. We then merge the N-MFP information with the iMoneyNet data and run the following regression

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i, t}=\beta_{1}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{2}EligiblePct_{i}+\beta_{3}MMLF_{t}\times EligiblePct_{i}\\&+controls_{i, t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i, t}, \end{aligned}$$

where $EligiblePct_{i}$ is defined as the share of MMLF-eligible assets relative to the fund AUM on February 28 for fund $i$ .In all specifications, standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.

Regression results of Equation (4) are reported in Table 6. Column (1) shows that the interaction term between $EligiblePct_{i}$ and $MMLF_{t}$ has a positive and significant effect on flows, indicating that MMFs with more MMLF-eligible holdings have a larger rebound in the post-MMLF period. This result is robust to including lagged controls of fund characteristics, as shown in Column (5).

In Columns (2)-(4) of Table 6, we break down MMLF-eligible assets into different security types, namely, eligible ABCP, eligible unsecured CP, and eligible CDs, and repeat our test with each of the subgroups of eligible assets. While the estimated coefficient on the interaction term between $MMLF_{t}$ and $EligiblePct_{i}$ remains positive for each asset category, it is only statistically significant for CDs.

Several reasons could explain our findings. First, ABCP and unsecured CP were announced to be eligible to the MMLF on March 18, the day MMLF was first announced to the public, while CDs were admitted to be eligible only on March 23, the day the MMLF started to operate. Outflows at funds with high shares of eligible ABCP and unsecured CP could have already slowed somewhat between March 18 and March 23 while funds with high shares of eligible CDs only started to recover after March 23.

Alternatively, MMFs saw the largest liquidity benefits from pledging the longest-teno. Assets in their portfolios, which are in most cases CDs.

Finally, in unreported results we show that the MMLF also had a positive effect on stabilizing foating NAVs, bringing them back up from the lower levels seen during the crisis. However, we do not emphasize this result since, as previously discussed, foating NAVs seem not to be significant drivers of outflows during the crisis

## 5.2 Spillover Effects of the MMLF on offshore USD MMFs

In mid-March, as institutional investors started to run on domestic prime MMFs, similan runs occurred on offshore USD prime MMFs, which invest in exactly the same pool of assets as their domestic counterparts and cater to global investors. L Moreover, as shown in Table 4, offshore USD prime funds on average invest in less liquid and riskier asset portfolios, as represented by their lower WLA, longer weighted average maturity, more risky assets, and less safe instruments. Assets in offshore USD prime funds also dropped by about $25\%$ during the crisis time.

The MMLF was designed to protect U.S. investors and MMFs, and thus offshore USD funds, although also investing in the U.S. short-term debt instruments, were not coverec by the MMLF. This fact offers us a great opportunity to study the potential spillover effects of the MMLF to similar but ineligible market participants, namely, offshore USD prime MMFs. Specifically, we estimate the following regression

$$\begin{aligned}Flow_{i, t}=\beta_{1}Offshore_{i}+\beta_{2}MMLF_{t}+\beta_{3}Offshore_{i}\times MMLF_{t}\\&+controls_{i, t-1}+FE_{i}+\varepsilon_{i, t}, \end{aligned}$$

where $Offshore_{i}$ equals one for offshore USD prime funds and $MMLF_{t}$ equals one after



The MMLF becomes operational on March 23, 2020. The sample for this test include both institutional prime MMFs and offshore USD prime funds. Standard errors are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.

Table 7 displays the regression results for Equation (5). Column (1) runs a simple test of the MMLF effect on all prime funds in the sample and shows that daily flows increase by 1.7 percentage points in the post-MMLF period. Column (2) shows how the MMLF affects domestic and offshore funds differently. While offshore funds on average have smaller outflows over the sample period, as shown by the positive and significant coefficient on the $Offshore_{i}$ dummy, offshore funds also experience a smaller rebound after the implementation of the MMLF. In particular, while domestics funds' daily flows recover by on average 2.2 percentage points in the post-MMLF period, an those of offshore funds recover only by 0.95 percentage points in the same post-MMLF period. These results are robust to the inclusion of lagged fund characteristics controls and fund family fixed effects, as shown in Columns (3)-(4)

Columns (5)-(8) are designed to test for the speed of investors’ reaction to the MMLF Column (5) shows that the slowdown of MMF outflows is not significant in the first week after the launch of the MMLF when pooling offshore and domestic prime funds together. But is highly significant, both statistically and economically, in the second week after the launch of MMLF. Column (6) includes the interaction terms between the $Offshore_{i}$ dummy and the two post-MMLF windows and shows that offshore fund investors almost did not respond to the MMLF over the first week of its operation. Specifically, while domestic funds’ daily flows recover by 1.7 percentage points in the first week after the launch of the MMLF, those of offshore funds barely change over the same time period. In the second week of the post-MMLF period, flows were not significantly different between offshore funds and domestics funds, as shown by the coefficient on the interaction term between $Offshore_{i}$ and $MMLF\_W2_{t}$ .These results are also robust to the inclusion of lagged fund characteristics controls and fund family fixed effects, as shown in Columns (7)-(8).

In sum, the MMLF had a calming effect on market participants beyond its direct coverage, although the magnitude of such effects is smaller and the reaction time is longer.

# 6. The Impact of MMLF on CP and CD Markets

As the MMLF stabilized MMF flows and liquidity conditions, these funds were able once again to purchase CP and CDs at tenors greater than one week. In this section, we conduct a battery of tests to evaluate the impact of MMLF on the CP and CD markets While MMLF might have had a stabilizing effect on the overall CP and CD markets such effect should be stronger within the set of instruments more heavily traded by money funds and therefore effectively pledgeable at the MMLF.

We rely on DTCC's transaction level data for trades in all U.S. commercial paper These data provide information regarding each trade such as yield and quantity, and the rating that the CP received from Moody's and S&P at the time of trade. As a CP can be rated differently by these two rating agencies, we follow the principle used by the MMLF in determining the CP's credit quality and assign a composite rating to each CP on each day 12 CP with ratings belonging to the top two notches together account for $91\%$ of the data, with those in the top notch alone accounting for $62\%$ .Based on the number of days to maturity, we also assign each CP to one of the following ten term buckets: overnight 1 and 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months. Trades in these 9 term buckets together account for over $97\%$ of the data. CP with time to maturity longer than 7 months are excluded from our study due to very limited issuance at those terms. For each trade. Its spread to OIS is calculated by subtracting from its yield the OIS rate for the same term bucket. To construct our sample, we calculate the volume weighted average spread across instruments issued by the same CP issuer $j$ , on the same day $t$ , and within the same term bucket $Trn.$ $(Spread_{j, t, m})$ .Our final dataset consists of all the issuer-day-term level estimates for the period that spans from two weeks before and two weeks after the launch of MMLF, namely from March 9, 2020 to April 3, 2020.

Our first identification strategy focuses on testing the differential effect of MMLF across CP with diferent credit quality. To be considered MMLF-eligible, CP must belong to the top rating category. If the MMLF stabilized the CP market following its launch on March 23, we should expect such effect to be stronger among MMLF-eligible CP, namely with top rating. To test this hypothesis, we create a dummy $TopRating_{t}$ that takes the value one if a CP's composite rating is equal to 1 on day $t$ , and estimate the following panel regression

$$Spread_{j, t, m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times TopRating_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j, t, m}$$

Where $MMLF_{t}$ is a dummy for the two weeks following the launch of MMLF, and $\mu_{j}$ $\mu_{t}$ , $\mu_{m}$ , $\mu_{T}$ represent issuer, day, maturity, and rating fixed effects, respectively. Standard errors are two-way clustered at the issuer and day level. Consistent with the MMLF design, Table & shows that spreads in top rated CP declined by more following the launch of the facility. The coefficient of the interation of $MMLF_{t}$ and $TopRating_{t}$ is negative and highly significant. The magnitude is also economically meaningful. A 1/P 1-rated CP experienced an additional 45 bps decline in rate spreads compared to other lower-rated CP during the two weeks post MMLF

Our second test identifies the MMLF effect by building on our earlier analysis on the impact of the MMLF on money fund flows. Since financial and non-financial borrowers rely on MMFs for funding to different degrees, we test whether borrowers that depend more on MMFs saw a greater benefit from the MMLF than borrowers less dependent on MMFs. For that purpose, we use data on security level holdings by MMFs from thein monthly N-MFP flings to the SEC. For each CP issuer, we aggregate the total amount of its CP held by money funds by the end of February 2020. We then normalize the number by the average daily CP outstanding amount during February 2020 for each issuer (data obtained from DTCC) and name it $(ShareMMF_{t}$ ). We hypothesize that if the MMLF has stabilized the CP market by stemming money fund outflows, its impact on spreads would be stronger for CP more heavily held by money funds prior to its implementation

To test this hypothesis, we replace $TopRating_{t}$ with $ShareMMF_{t}$ and reestimate Equation 6. Consistent with the MMLF lowering CP spreads through its impact on money fund flows, the coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is negative and highly significant (Table 8), suggesting that spreads declined more for CP more heavily held by money funds prior to the launch of the MMLF. As money funds are unlikely to sell CP with short maturity to the MMLF since they turn into cash quickly, we re-estimate Equation 6 by excluding overnight papers and get somewhat stronger results

It is worth noting that right before the launch of the MMLF, the Fed created the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) to aid primary dealers in supporting smooth market functioning. As the credit extended to primary dealers under the PDCF improvec dealers funding conditions, one might argue that it could have also contributed to the improvement in CP spreads during the post MMLF period. While we are not able to exclude the possibility that PDCF has also caused CP spreads to narrow, we also note that the MMLF effect we identified earlier is likely to be above and beyond the PDCF effect. Unlike the MMLF, the PDCF accepts both A 1/P 1 and A 2/P 2 CP as eligible collateral to pledge at the PDCF. Therefore, focusing on the additional decline in spread for A 1/P 1 CP allows us to identify the additional impact that the MMLF had on CP spreads. Moreover, dealers can pledge at the PDCF commercial paper that they bought from all sorts of market participants, not just money funds. Therefore, finding a stronger effect for CP more heavily held by prime funds suggests that the MMLF had a significant effect over and above the PDCF

In addition to cheaper credit, the MMLF was also believed to have contributed to more robust CP issuance across tenors. In the several days prior to the creation of the MMLF, new CP issuance dropped precipitously and many market participants viewed the CP market as being essentially frozen. Once the run on prime MMFs abated due to the enhanced liquidity provided by the MMLF, MMFs were once again willing to buy CP, knowing that they could pledge it back to the MMLF to monetize it in case of future runs.

To understand the MMLF impact on CP issuance, we use the same CP sample and estimate the following panel regression

$$Log (Issuance)_{j, t, m}=\beta MMLF_t\times TopRating_t+\mu_j+\mu_t+\mu_m+\mu_r+\varepsilon_{j, t, m}$$

Where $Log (Issuance)_{j, t, m}$ is is the log of one plus the amount issued by borrower $j$ on day $t$ with time to maturity within maturitybucket $mt$ .Since not issuing debt is valuable information, we consider issuer-day-term observations with no issuance as zero issuance leading to $Log (Issuance)_{j, t}$ being equal to zero in those cases.

Results in Table 9 support the view that the MMLF has improved the CP market by restarting new issuance. Top rated CP issuers experienced larger increase in issuance volume during the post MMLF period (column (1)). In addition, borrowers that rely more heavily on MMFs to obtain funding were able to borrow more after the introduction of the MMLF. When we replace $TopRating_{t}$ with $ShareMMF_{t}$ and reestimate Equation 7, the coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is indeed positive and highly significant (column (2)). The MMLF effects are evident when we focus only on term CP (column (3))

One salient feature of the MMLF is its pricing schedule. Banks can pledge CP and CDs and obtain funding by paying a rate of 125 bps (100 bps above the discount window's primary credit rate). Because of the MMLF pricing, CP issued at 125 bps or higher would be quite attractive for MMFs to buy because they could be liquidated to the MMLF without either the MMF or the bank incurring a loss. Anecdotally, industry strategists suggested that 125 bps could indeed be the foor for CP rates and as a result also for the London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR). Therefore, the MMLF effect, if any, should be stronger in CPs issued at 125 bps or higher

Using its pricing feature, we develop our third test toidentify the MMLF impact on the CP market. Specifically, we estimate $Log (Issuance)_{j, t, m}$ separately for CPs issued at rates greater than 125 bps and those below 125 bps, and name them $Log (HighRateIssuance)_{j, t, m}$ and $Log (LowRateIssuance)_{j, t, m}$ respectively. We then estimate the following panel re gressions:

$$Log (HighRateIssuance)_{j, t, m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times ShareMMF_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j, t}$$

$$og (LowRateIssuance)_{j, t, m}=\beta MMLF_{t}\times ShareMMF_{t}+\mu_{j}+\mu_{t}+\mu_{m}+\mu_{r}+\varepsilon_{j, t, m}$$
Where the explanatory variables are defined as in Equation 7. Consistent with the hypoth esis that CP more profitable to pledge (with rate above 125 bps) benefited particularly from the MMLF, we find that issuance restarted significantly more for CP issuers with more reliance on MMFs only when the CP yields more than 125 bps. The coefficient of the interaction of $MMLF_{t}$ and $ShareMMF_{t}$ is positive and highly significant in Equa tion 8, but negative and not significant in Equation 8 (columns (4) and (5)). Excluding overnight issuance yields similar findings. The limited effects of the MMLF on issuance of cheaper CP (with rate below 125 bps) suggests that MMFs were not particularly interested in purchasing these instruments since they may not have been able to liquidate them at the MMLF in case of need.

Similar MMLF effects are also evident in the CD market. Using the DTCC data for CDs, we estimate both spread to OIS and issuance volume at the issuer-term-day level and study the additional impact of $ShareMMF_{t}$ post MMLF. Results in Table 10 are again consistent with the stabilization effects that the MMLF had on short-term funding markets. Borrowers more reliant on funding from MMFs experienced significantly larger declines in borrowing costs and greater increase in issuance volume after the introduction of the MMLF (columns (1） and (2)). In addition, the issuance effect is concentrated among CD instruments offering more than 125 bps, similarly to what we found for CF instruments (columns (3) and (4)). 13

Once again, the fact that the spread reduction and increased issuance effects are concentrated among instruments that are economically viable to pledge at the MMLF and those more heavily purchased by MMLF eligible participants, namely money funds suggests that the MMLF provided stability benefits in addition to any effect coming from the PDCF.

## 7. Conclusion

Financial stability regulations are expected to curb excessive risk taking ex-ante so as to reduce the severity of a crisis whenever it occurs. It is therefore understood that some of these regulations create a trade-off: they reduce liquidity transformation and risk-taking. In normal times to provide more stability in bad times. We compare three runs on prime money funds, two of which happened prior to the introduction of strict liquidity restric tions on prime funds and one that occurred after these restrictions were put in place. We find evidence consistent with the fact that the introduction of gates and fees that was meant to curb runs actually created an incentive for investors to preemptively run on the less liquid funds. After documenting the run on prime funds that occurred during the Covid-19 crisis, we study the effectiveness of the introduction of the Money Market Mu tual Funds Liquidity Facility (MMLF). By providing “liquidity of last resort", it allowed prime funds to quickly rebuild liquidity buffers, improving investors' confidence. The. MMLF quickly stopped prime MMF outflows and allowed funds to restart the provisior of funding to banks and corporations in the CP and CD markets, and at cheaper rates. The recent Covid-19 crisis highlighted that ex-ante liquidity regulations could not achieve the goal of creating a system immune from runs. Ultimately, when liquidity concerns arise and investors run on money funds while dealers stop providing secondary market liquidity, ex-post interventions are necessary..

### Table 4: Summary Statistics -MMLF

This table reports summary statistics of the main variables in use for three types of MMFs: institutiona prime funds, retail prime funds, and offshore USD prime MMFs. The numbers reported are average within each fund types, and are calculated separately for the Crisis period (Mar 9 to Mar 20, 2020) anc the post-MMLF period (Mar 23 to Apr 3, 2020). WLA is weekly liquid assets as a percentage of total assets, and WAM is weighted average maturity. Bank Affliated is a dummy for money funds affiliated with banks

## Table 10: MMLFeffects on CD spreads and issuance

The daily sample goes from March 9, 2020 to April 3, 2020 and contains CD data at the issuer-day-term level. The sample includes CDs with maturities between 1 week and 1 year. Spread is the difference in percentage points between the CD yield and the OIS rate at equivalent maturity.Log (Issuance) is the log of one plus the amount issued by a certain firm in a given day. MMLF equals one after the MMLF implementation date of March 23, 2020. ShareMMF is the share of an issuer's CD held by MMFs by the end of February 2020. Standard errors (in parentheses) are two-way clustered at the issuer and day level.

# Appendix: MMLF and other emergency facilities

There are a couple of other Federal Reserve facilities that were announced around the time of the MMLF announcement and might also have some impact on the CP and CD markets. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was announced on March 17. CPFF supports liquidity in the CP market by purchasing paper directly from issuers and by giving investors confidence that issuers will be able to roll maturing CP. However. The CPFF was not operational until April 14, where the market conditions had improved substantially since MMLF operations began on March 23.

There are several important differences between CPFF and MMLF. First, while CPFF buys newly issued CP, MMLF loans are secured by assets that are purchased by banks from MMFs existing holdings. Second, collaterals under MMLF can have maturity ranging from overnight to 12 months, while CPFF only buys 3-month CP. Lastly, the pricing of CP under MMLF and CPFF are quite different. To access the CPFF, issuers must pay an upfront facility fee equal to 10 basis points of the maximum amount of its commercial paper that CPFF may own. Under CPFF, for A 1/P 1 rated commercial paper, pricing will be based on the then-current 3-month overnight index swap (OIS) rate plus 110 basis points and for commercial paper rated A 2/P 2/F 2, then-current 3-month OIS rate plus 200 basis points. On the other hand, MMLF has no facility fees. MMLF loans secured by CP are priced at PCR plus 100 bps.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) was also announced on March 17. PDCF provides credit to primary dealers of the New York Fed against a broad range of collateral including CP and CD. The maximum maturity of PDCF loans is 90 days and PDCF loans are priced at PCR regardless of loan maturity or collateral.

There are several important differences between PDCF and MMLF. First, PDCF is open only to the 24 primary dealers, while MMLF is accessible by all US banks, affliates of US bank holding companies, and US branches of foreign banks. Second, PDCF loans have maturity up to 90 days, while MMLF loans have maturity up to 12 months. Third



Under PDCF, primary dealers cannot pledge securities issued by themselves as collateral for loans. There is no such limitation on MMLF collateral. Fourth, PDCF loans do not have preferential treatment with respect to regulatory capital ratios, and are made with recourse beyond the pledged collateral to the primary dealers. MMLF loans do not affect banks capital ratios and have no recourse. Fifth, A 2/P 2-rates CP and CDs are eligible collateral for PDCF loans, while MMLF loans only accept A 1/Pl-rates CP and CDs as collateral. Last, the PDCF loans are priced at a fixed rate equal to the PCR. Regardless of collateral type or loan maturity and loan amount is limited to the amount of margin-adjusted eligible collateral. MMLF loans have no margin-adjustments and are priced at a fixed spread over PCR, depending on the type of the collateral.



## Table A.1: Timeline of Main Federal Reserve Interventions

This table summarizes the timeline of major interventions by the Federal Reserve during the Covid-19 crisis. CPFFrefers to the Commercial Paper Funding Facility; PDCF to Primary Dealer Credit Facility MMLF to Money MarketMutual Fund Liquidity Facility; PMCCF to Primary Market Corporate Credi Facility; SMCCF to Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility; TALF to Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; PPPLF to Paycheck Protection Program Lending Facility; MLF to Municipal Liquidity Facility; MSLP to Main Street Lending Program. Finally, VRDNs stands for variable rate discount notes and CDs for certificates of deposit.

### Table A.2: Effect of floating NAV on flows

The daily sample goes from February 4 to March 24, 2020 and contains institutional prime funds. Flow is the daily percentage change in assets under management. Crisis equals one from March 6 to March 24. NAV_to. L equals (1 lagged NAV) times 100 and I $\lfloor (NAV<1$ ) equals one if lagged NAV is below 1. WLA is the lagged share of weekly liquid assets to total assets. Controls include lagged WAM, GSY Expense Ratio, Fund Age, and Bank Affiliation, holdings of ABCP, and holdings of foreign CDs, as of the previous Tuesday. Standard errors (in parentheses) are two-way clustered at the fund and day level.
