Overview

- What is Commercial Paper? What is its significance?
- How are CP prices quoted?
- Where do CP prices come from?
- What are backup lines of credit,  and why do all CP issuers have them?
- What is meant by the "early-exit mechanism" of the CP market? What has been the default experience of CP investors?
- How do regulations affect the demand for different maturities?
- What happened in 2007-9 Crisis?
- Alternative
- - Extendible Commercial Notes CP is the simplest security that corporations issue. It is a short-term promissory note. As long as issuers obey certain guidelines,  their CP is exempt from the hassles and expense of registration requirements. The most important of these guidelines are
- Maturity is less than 270 days
- - Issued in denominations too big for individual investors Almost all CP meets these guidelines. In fact,  most CP satisfies the guidelines by a wide margin.
- Average maturity of outstanding CP is around 40 days
- Average trade size is around $20MM

CP Issuance Volume,  by Initial Maturity
The quantity of CP grew steadily and substantially until the 2001/2 recession,  and then it surged until its recent drop. Here's the growth in CP outstanding since the beginning of 1991:

![1_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png](1_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png)

At last count,  there was $1.85 Trillion in CP outstanding,     down 14% from its all-time high of $2.16 Trillion last July,  but up from its recent low of $1.79 Trillion in December.

The plunge in CP outstanding is due specifically to Asset-Backed Paper:

![2_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](2_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

Asset-Backed paper is sold not by a regular company,  but rather by a special-purpose vehicle,  or *conduit*

- Buys financial assets and finances by selling securities backed by these assets
- Separate legal entity from the sponsoring institution,  so the buyers of the securities have recourse only to the financial assets,  and not to the sponsoring institution We consider such securitizations in another class note Notice that,  compared to Tbills,  CP is issued in
- Generally shorter maturities
	 - Tbills are 28,  91,  or 182 days to maturity when issued
- Greater variety of maturities
	- Tbills mature only on Thursdays. You can buy CP maturing on any day you are interested in
- Greater frequency
 	- The government floats Tbills just once a week,  whereas there is new CP every day
- Larger trade sizes
 	- You can easily buy $10K face value of Tbills,  but not CP
In summary,  CP comes from three main categories of issuers Financial CP - issued by financial corporations such as bank holding companies,  GE Capital,  etc. Non-Financial CP - from any other kind of corporate issuer Asset-Backed CP 	- issued by a special-purpose entity that holds financial assets such as mortgage backed securities,  car loans,  etc.

Here are the quantities of these different kinds of CP over 2001-12:

![3_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](3_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

This graph makes several points The CP market is big - altogether it's about $1 Trillion,     though it is half of what it was (peak was $2.18 Trillion on 8/8/07)
 Non-financial issuers are not a big part of the market,  only about 18%
 All categories are about 2/3 of where they were 11 years ago Asset-backed paper fell off a cliff o Down about 70% from the 8/07 peak,  and $350BB of this fall occurred in just 4 months starting in early August 2007,     with $200BB of that in just 3 weeks

![4_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](4_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

It's worth focusing for a moment on the ABCP crash. Here's the weekly issuance volume:
You can see that in the early part of the decade,  there was $200 Billion or so of new ABCP sold each week,     which ramped up to $500 Billion at the peak. Now it's down to around $100 Billion each week. If we look just at 2007,  we don't see the issuance volume crash quite as hard as in the previous graph,  but that's because these numbers combine long-dated and short-dated paper. If we look at the distribution of maturities,  we see that in August 2007,  issuance abruptly shifted away from longer maturities:

![4_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png](4_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png)

You can see issuance tilting heavily toward shorter paper in the latter half of 2007. You can also see that,  in recent months,  issuance of 41+day paper has shrunk significantly,  in favor of shorter paper.

![5_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](5_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

Consider also the discount rates this paper paid over this period: This shows the rates for the three categories,  plus a fourth category "A2 nonfinancial" which is the lower-rated paper from non-financial issuers. The discount rates generally follow the prevailing money-

![5_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png](5_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png)

What happened to these issuers was essentially a bank run. Firms that go to the CP market know they are exposed to bank-run risk. This is because when they issue CP,  they expect to repay it by issuing CP
again,  i.e. by rolling it over. If they can't roll it over,  they've got a problem. For this reason,  a CP issuer generally has a committed bank facility at least as big as the amount of CP he has outstanding. This "backup line" plays exactly the role of the lender of last resort in the bank-run model: if the issuer needs extra cash to let investors out,  it doesn't have to sell assets for bad prices,  it just needs to borrow the necessary cash from the bank. Knowing this,  a CP investor calculates that there's no benefit from joining a run,  i.e. not rolling over his paper,  so he rolls over his paper and there's no run.

 The backup line is intended to be insurance against the market melting down,  not the CP issuer melting down,  and it often contains covenants that limit or revoke the issuer's right to take down the line if its condition has deteriorated sufficiently This limitation is known as a *Material Adverse Change* clause. You can read further in the discussions by Dominion Bond Rating Service and A M Best It's important to distinguish this backup line of credit from a *Letter* of credit,  which is explicitly a credit enhancement. A letter of credit says that if the issuer doesn't repay the paper,  the bank will. So the credit quality of the paper is at least as high as the credit quality of the bank.

 So a backup line of credit is more accurately viewed as a *liquidity facility*,  i.e. insurance against the market drying up,  than a credit enhancement,  i.e. insurance against the issuer going bad Backup lines became widespread in the CP business after the Penn Central Railroad default in 1970.

Penn Central was a big issuer of CP,  and this was the first default in many years,  and the CP market crashed. The Fed eased this crash by providing liquidity to banks so issuers could borrow to pay their

![6_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](6_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

In 1970 some CP issuers had backup lines,  and others did not. It was widely suspected during the Penn Central crisis that banks had an easier time borrowing at the discount window when they could show the Fed that they were borrowing more because issuers were taking down their lines.

- In other words,  if you *didn't* have a backup line,  and wanted a bank loan to pay off your maturing paper,  the bank might say "we're low on cash right now because of other issuers taking down their lines,  and if we try to borrow the money for you from the Fed,  they won't lend because you're not taking down a backup line" Ever since the Penn Central crisis,  it has been essentially impossible for issuers to sell CP without arranging a backup line of credit. Investors worry that a company without backup credit will have a financial crisis,  which could precipitate default,  if the CP market panics.
- The thing to remember of backup lines of credit is that they are not credit enhancements. If a company goes bankrupt,  the bank is not going to pay off its CP. They are insurance not against the company going bad,  but against the CP market going bad. If the CP market panics,  a backup line allows an issuer to substitute bank borrowing for his CP borrowing,  and the CP investor gets out whole.
- A backup line of credit is a CP issuer's indirect access to the lender of last resort
- Mercury Finance had backup lines,  but the banks cut off the lines when Mercury got into trouble (from fraudulent accounting).

So in today's market,  issuers have backup lines. Now consider the typical issuer. As we saw,  the typical issuer has the top credit rating,  so if it is downgraded,  it is generally still investment grade

- The issuer's banks are not unconditionally obligated to let the issuer use its backup lines,  but since the issuer is still investment grade,  they generally will let the issuer borrow There was a trend that grew over the last couple years of the ABCP boom,  which was a trend away from backup liquidity. That is,  a number of ABCP issuers decided to save the money they would have spent on a backup line,  and instead rely on what they called *internal liquidity*.

 So instead of a backup line,  these issuers would be *overcollateralized*,  which is to say that the assets they held (typically mortgage-backed securities) were worth sufficiently more than their liabilities Typically,  the issuer would value its portfolio each week,  and if the value exceeded the liabilities by more than a stated percentage,  then everything was considered to be fine This was considered to be "internal liquidity" because the issuer could,  in theory at least,  pay down its liabilities by selling its assets The proximate cause of the collapse of ABCP issuance in August,  2007,  was the failure by several ABCP issuers to meet this valuation test A related strategy to this "internal liquidity" is what was sometimes called "extendible commercial notes",  or just "extendible notes." This was a way to issue something almost like CP without paying for backup liquidity. It worked like this:
 Today,  I sell an extendible note In 30 days,  I can pay down the note. However,  I have the option to instead *extend* the note up to a year. That is,  instead of paying my creditors the principal amount,  I tell them "your security now matures in a year. Over that year,  I'll pay you interest keyed to the prevailing interest rate paid by paper with the same rating." These ended up getting extended during the crisis and that ended their use in new CP issues.

 Here's a typical schedule of interest rates for such paper:
Rating % of LIBOR Minimum Spread over LIBOR
A1+/P1 110 25 A1/P1 115 50 A2/P2 130 150 A3/P3 150 250
<A3/P3 175 400 The message the issuer sends is "A backup line of credit would give some assurance that the paper won't default if the market goes bad. Same here - if the market goes bad,  the paper won't default. But instead of paying off right away,  it will convert to longer-term paper with a high interest rate."

HEADLINE: **Commercial Paper Market Still in Distress**
Aug. 30,  2007 (felixsalmon.com delivered by Newstex) -- Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism Bloomberg tells us that the commercial paper market is shrinking.

This is a more serious issue than might appear. Commercial paper is an important,  if not the most important,  source of short-term funding for sizable corporations,  mainly because it's cheap and flexible. They can readily adjust the amount outstanding to reflect changes in their need for cash.

When CP matures,  and an issuer cannot "roll" it,  as in replace it with new CP,  he has two choices. If he has the option,  he can draw down standby lines of credit with his friendly bank. If he has no,  or insufficient,  backup lines,  he has to get the cash somehow. Both option 1 and option 2 have costs.

Option 1 means he is using higher-cost funding and has limited the company's alternatives for dealing with emergencies. But more important,  the demand for cash at banks means it crowds out other bank lending,  such as to small businesses. Option 2 means the company goes into crisis mode,  delaying payments to vendors,  trying to accelerate payment from customers,  possibly even deferring payroll if that is at all an option.

 Now on a small scale,  these moves would create a few casualties. But on a large scale,  as is happening now,  both will put a damper on the real economy. They suggest that the 4% GDP growth release for the second quarter may have perilous little relevance now. From The U.S. commercial paper market shrank for a third week,  extending the biggest slump in at least seven years,  as investors balked at buying short-term debt backed by mortgage assets. Asset-backed commercial paper,  which accounted for half the market,  tumbled $59.4 billion to $998 billion in the week ended yesterday,  the lowest since December,  according to the Federal Reserve. Total short-term debt maturing in 270 days or less fell $62.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $1.98 trillion. Commercial paper outstanding has fallen $244.1 billion,     or 11 percent,     in the past three weeks,     suggesting the Fed's Aug. 17 reduction in the discount rate has yet to entice buyers back into the market. More than 20 companies and funds including Cheyne Finance and Thornburg Mortgage (TMA) Co. failed to sell new paper as investors fled to safer investments. ''I don't think the Fed understands how critical the situation is,    '' said Neal Neilinger,     co-founder of NSM Capital Management in Greenwich,     Connecticut,     in an interview today. ''The market is going to overshoot itself and not lend money to people who deserve it.''… The 11 percent decline over three weeks is the biggest since 2000,     according to data compiled by Bloomberg…. In a sign that buyers are still favoring safer assets,     an $18 billion auction yesterday for two-year U.S. government debt drew the most demand since 1992. The sale drew $3.97 for every $1 sold,  the most since at least 1992,  according to Bloomberg data.

## The Globe And Mail (Canada)

September 26,  2007 Wednesday HEADLINE: Credit problems put companies on ice BYLINE: Bloomberg News On Baffin Island in the Arctic Circle,  Baffinland Iron Mines Corp. almost missed its window to ship provisions to workers before winter arrives. The delay came not from the weather,  but from a sudden freeze in the market for shortterm debt 3,  200 kilometres south in Toronto.

 Baffinland ran short of funds to pay for food,  fuel and drilling equipment after investing in commercial paper that borrowers couldn't repay. Without the money,  the company had to arrange an emergency line of credit before shipping lanes froze over. "We have 200 people to keep alive,  " chief executive officer Gordon McCreary said in Toronto. "Our lifeline to getting critical materials to the north" was the $43.8-million invested in commercial paper,     he said. Investors fled Canada's asset-backed commercial paper,     paralyzing the $40-billion market for debt that carried the highest credit ratings,  after losses from home loans to people with poor credit histories roiled global credit markets.

 That left Baffinland and other investors in the lurch because 17 funds run by finance companies,  including Torontobased Coventree Inc.,  Newshore Financial Corp. and Quanto Financial Corp.,  couldn't raise money to pay back lenders,  according to ratings company DBRS Ltd. No commercial paper borrower had failed to pay on time in two decades and Toronto-based DBRS gave the securities its top rating of R-1. The funds also had backup lines of credit from banks. "You can get what the bank pays you,  which is not very much,  or you can put it in asset-backed commercial paper,  which have always been rated as high as you can get,  " said Geoff Chapter,  a spokesman for Vancouver-based First Quantum Resources Minerals Ltd. First Quantum hasn't been repaid on $7.5-million of debt issued by Coventree that matured on Aug. 14 and Aug. 15,     he said. It had about 28 per cent of its cash in commercial paper. Starting in July,     growing defaults in U.S. home loans caused the cost of borrowing to increase for all but the most creditworthy companies. Rates on asset-backed commercial paper soared. Investors began demanding yields of about 6.03 per cent to own Coventree's commercial paper. On Aug. 13,     the company said it couldn't find enough buyers to refinance $950-million of short-term debt and its banks refused to provide emergency funds. Company spokesman Craig Armitage declined to comment. A group of 10 banks and pension funds agreed on Aug. 16 to convert $35-billion of debt into notes maturing in as much as 10 years. Terms of the debt won't be released until mid-October,  said Purdy Crawford,  a lawyer at the Toronto firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP,  who heads the group.

Until then,  investors won't know when they will get their money back,  or whether they will be repaid in full.

## From An H&R Block Earnings Conference Call,  August 30,  2007 –

… I want to comment on our announcement to draw $850 million on our committed backup lines of credit. These lines,     with total capacity of $2 billion,  were put in place to give us flexibility and assure adequate liquidity for short-term needs.

 In recent weeks,  the commercial paper market has become increasingly constrained and unstable,  especially for A2/P2 issuers like Block Financial. As a result,  we decided to substitute this more stable source of funds for our working capital needs. These lines of credit extend through August of 2010 and are accessed today at a rate of LIBOR plus 30.5 basis points.

 We're using proceeds to pay down commercial paper balances and to meet our ongoing working capital needs. We expect to have adequate liquidity for the upcoming tax season and into our fiscal fourth quarter when we typically become cash flow positive.

# How Cp Is Brought To Market

An issuer can sell its CP by hiring a dealer,  who then shows the issuer's paper along with the other issuer the dealer handles. An issuer can also sell its CP by itself. That is,  it has its own trading floor,  where its people show the issuer's rates on trading screens,  and interact directly with investors. Here is a Bloomberg screen showing the biggest such issuers:
You can see the size of the CP program on the far right,  and the program's ratings from S&P,  Moody's and Fitch just to the left of that These three are the major (but not only) raters of CP programs In order to be considered "top tier" for regulatory purposes,  a program needs at least two top ratings from "Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations" (i.e. NRSROs)
o Probably the most important of these regulatory purposes is to qualify for investment by money funds,  which are extremely limited in their ability to invest in CP that is not top tier by this definition o Top tier is A-1 (or A-1+) from S&P,  P-1 from Moody's,  and F1 (or F1+) from Fitch Sometimes A-1+ and F1+ are called "top top tier" You can see that Sears is "NP",  or "Not Prime",  and offers rates way above the top tier issuers o You almost never see junk CP like that. For the most part,  the lower tier of CP is the A2/P2 paper in the graph a few pages back

## Here Is How Cp Rates Fit Into The Money Market In General

Who buys CP,  if not individuals? The biggest customers are money market mutual funds,  managing the cash of individuals. The Federal Reserve attempted to identify the owners of the $1.79 Trillion of CP outstanding on 12/31/07,  and found

- $711B held by money funds - $85B held by pension funds
- $42B held by life insurance companies - $125B held by mutual funds other than money funds
- $83B by brokers and dealers and so on.

In other words,  the investors in CP are big institutional investors with some short-term money. Selling CP is very much like selling corporate bonds - a short list of potential investors who buy in big lots.

- The difference is that CP matures very quickly,  so sellers are going back to the short list of investors many times a year.

CP pays no coupons,  it just pays face value at maturity. If you buy $10M face value of CP from GE Capital (the biggest issuer,     by the way) maturing on April 18 (i.e.,     30-day paper),     then you will get $10M on 4/18. It is therefore issued and traded at a discount,  and when traders quote prices to each other,  they talk in terms of *discount rates*,  just like Tbills. So again if we call the face value F,  then number of days to maturity n,  and the discount rate d,  then the price P is P = F - (d/100)(n/360)F
So for example,  if the discount rate for the $10M of GECC paper is 2.63%,
then the price is $10M - (2.63/100)(30/360)$10M = $9,  978,  083 Compared to Treasury bills of the same maturity,  CP has the exact same promised cash flows,  but also has three disadvantages,  each of which imposes a discount when investors purchase

- CP issues can default,  and sometimes they do.
- Biggest ever was $457MM of Pacific Gas & Electric paper in 2001 - Treasury bills are widely regarded as free of default risk
- CP is less liquid. The secondary market for CP is not as active as the secondary market for Treasury bills.
- On any given day,  an investor can buy CP maturing on any near-term date he wants
- He can customize his CP investment to his liquidity needs,  so there is little chance he will bring it back to the market
- CP interest is subject to the income taxes of many states and municipalities,  but TB interest is not As a result of the credit risk,  liquidity,  and taxation drawbacks,  CP trades at a discount relative to Tbills with the same maturity

Here are the CP and TB rates of recent years:
The magnitude of this spread has varied considerably over this period:

![16_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png](16_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_1.png)

It was quite high,  over 100bp,  in the 90-91 recession but it has been even higher lately. Notice the volatility around year-ends. Some of this is due to variation in the TB rate. Notice that,  if the state tax on CP interest is 8% (about what it is here in PA),  then

- if TB is paying 8%,  CP has to pay 8.70% to have the same after-state-tax return. That is,  (1-)(8.70) = 8.00,  so after paying your state tax you'll have the same return as a TB investor
- If TB is paying 3%,  CP has to pay 3.26% to have the same after-state-tax return So in other words,  the spread has to be higher when rates in general are higher,  just to keep the after-tax returns the same. It is therefore useful to consider not only the spread itself,  but the spread divided by the TB rate:

![17_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](17_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

By this measure,  the spread is somewhat steadier over time,  generally oscillating around 8%.

- Spread was so low during the recession because the short rate was so low,  so the portion of the spread driven by taxes was small But the recent spike looks even *more* extreme by this measure,  given the decreases in short rates.

Spikes during higher market uncertainty (esp. the big defaults)
Like other corporate debt,  CP is rated by the major agencies. Drexel Burnham sometimes issued unrated CP,  but now it is almost unheard-of. All rating agencies have four main categories,  which correspond to the categories of Moody's:

- P-1 Top of Investment-Grade,  corresponding roughly to the longterm ratings A3 though Aaa (A-1 by S&P)
- P-2 Middle to bottom of Investment-Grade,  corresponding roughly to long-term ratings Baa2 through A2 (A-2)
- P-3 Very bottom of Investment-Grade (A-3) - NP Not Prime,  corresponding to Speculative-Grade (B)
Not only is CP always rated,  but almost all of the outstanding volume is highly-rated. As of 2/29/08 the Fed reports
- $1,  599B of Tier 1 paper (Rated A1 or P1)
- $66B of Tier 2 paper (A2 or P2) - Minimal amount below that

![18_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png](18_Class_Note_12_Commercial_Paper_0.png)

Of course the lower-rated paper trades at a discount. Here's the spread between 30-day P2 and P1 paper over the past ten years:
This spread has of course gone nuts too. Notice the run-up in the spread before each year-end,  and in particular before this past year-end. Investors are especially reluctant to hold risky paper at disclosure time

## Regulations That Affect Demand For Cp

Money market mutual funds do everything they can to maintain their share prices at exactly $1.

- Quoting a lower share price is known as *breaking the buck*. No retail money fund has ever broken the buck The SEC helps them in this regard by allowing an account standard known as *straight-line amortization* for instruments with 60 days or fewer to maturity. It works like this: suppose you buy n-day CP with face value F at a discount D. In other words,  you paid F-D for it today,  and in n days you'll get F.

As long as n is no more than 60,  you can

- Value the investment at F-D
- Book D/n of interest every day for those n days Investors will get interest at the rate D over those n days,  *even if the market* rate has changed. If you bought all your paper at 5% and rates go to 4%,
your investors keep getting 5% until that paper matures.

The virtue of doing your valuations this way is that you know that your valuation of the CP will not decrease,  which could threaten your $1 share price

- This accounting rule makes money funds especially interested in buying CP with 60 or fewer days to maturity
- Or in other words,  if you as a CP issuer keep your maturities in this range,  you'll get better prices from the biggest part of your customer base Another influence on CP maturities is the Fed's rule that banks can use CP as collateral for borrowing at the discount rule as long as its maturity is not greater than 90 days
- Banks therefore have little interest in buying longer-maturity CP SEC regulations also affect the relative demand for highand low-rated paper. The SEC divides all CP into three categories
- Tier-1: At least two ratings of A-1 or the equivalent from NRSROs - Tier-2: At least two ratings of A-2,  but not two of A-1 - Everything else A money fund can invest only in Tier-1 and Tier-2,  and can invest only 1% of its money in any one Tier-2 issuer,  and only 5% of its money in all Tier-2 issuers put together
- So the investment of money funds in Tier-2 paper is limited to 5% of their total assets. This holds down demand for Tier-2 paper
- This is part of why demand goes down abruptly when paper is downgraded
