Why bankers are scarce in Silicon Valley
To understand what **was a risky venture in 19th-century** America, visit the Whaling Museum in Nantucket. The industry thrived on this Massachusetts island, now transformed from an outpost for coarse sailors into a swanky beach spot. Two centuries ago, whales were valuable because of the lucrative oil in their heads. Captains amassed fleets of sloops and dozens of men armed with harpoons to hunt them. For lucky crews that found their "white whales," the rewards were enormous, but so were the risks of losing ships and souls in the hunt. In "Moby Dick," Herman Melville admonishes the reader: "for God's sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! Not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was spilled for it." The risk of losing all was too great for bankers, who refused to lend money to whalers. So a new breed, the whaling agent, stepped in to provide captains with capital in return for a share of profits. Although stakes in many voyages might be lost, they spread the capital so that one successful voyage made up for it. This model was an oddity in the 1800s, but the tradeoff will sound familiar to venture capitalists today. In their business, low-probability, high-payoff outcomes are the "allure of the long tail". Venture capitalists fund startups by investing in a broad portfolio in hopes of finding the next Google or Amazon.

The difference between whaling agents of 19th-century New England and today's venture capitalists is their importance. Even at its peak in the 1850s, whaling contributed only 1.7% of American industrial output. Bankers financed the behemoths such as railroads, manufacturers, and farmers. The first recognisable venture capital fund, and **in Boston, was created in 1946, but its successors** loom much larger. Just shy of half all listed American companies were once venture-backed. The ascent of venture capital has come, in some ways, at the expense of other financiers. Bankers are conspicuous by their absence in Silicon Valley.

Why has venture capital boomed? One theory, posited in "Capitalism without Capital" by Jonathan Haskel, at Imperial College London, and Stian Westlake, a researcher at Nesta, a think tank, begins with the shift in how businesses invest. Firms once mostly invested in physical stuff ("tangible capital") like railroads, equipment, vehicles, or machinery to make things. Now they increasingly invest in research, branding, and software ("intangible capital") to produce intellectual property. According to data from Lee Branstetter of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Dan Sichel of Wellesley College, 1314% of the output of businesses in 1980 was invested in tangible assets and just 9% in intangible assets. By the mid-2010s, these shares had switched: around 14% was spent on intangibles, and 9% on tangibles. 

The rise of intangible capital may explain several capital market trends, including the fact that private firms are tending to stay private for longer and the popularity of mergers. Software companies find it easier to protect intellectual property in private markets. Rigid accounting rules do not cope well with intangible capital, for instance, by mostly booking spending on research as an expense, discouraging it. 

The shift has other broad implications. Lenders like collateral:
Whenever financiers make loans, they worry about being repaid, but they can take valuable property in case of default. Most consumer lending is secured against houses or cars. But businesses that create intangible assets do not have such collateral. This can make it harder to secure debt financing, which is often not available unsecured for new businesses at a reasonable rate. Stephen Cecchetti, an economist at Brandeis University, calls this the "tyranny of collateral.” 

American software firms have debt worth just 10% of equity. By contrast, restaurants often have debt worth 95% of their assets.

Tech firms frequently rely on seed funding and venture capital. This cannot be explained solely by a lack of demand: the tech firms might like to borrow if they could. "The companies that we are talking to today believe their valuations will be a lot higher next year," says Scott Bluestein, boss of Hercules Capital, which lends to software and biotech firms. "If they can use structured debt to get there without having to raise equity, they can limit a significant amount of dilution, which can be very valuable for management and early investors."
Some niche lenders manage. "We do lend secured," says Greg Becker, boss of Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara. "We are often secured by intellectual property, which, for a software company, is their ability to generate revenue from code." This comes with other risks. "We will take losses in situations where software once had value, but the industry was disrupted in a way that it no longer does. That is just harder for traditional banks to get their arms around versus hard assets." Most banks are less flexible.

Public v private money: Will banks survive the transition to a new monetary system? 

Eagle-eyed beach combers may recognise the round white shells etched with a five-petal flower. These erstwhile homes of sea urchins resemble a silver dollar, earning them the nickname "sand dollars" and the myth that they are the money of mermaids or the long-lost city of Atlantis. They pile up on the shores of the 700 islands in the Bahamas, so its central bank picked the sand dollar as its logo. In October 2020, when the Bahamas launched the world's first central bank digital currency (CBDC), the authorities chose to adorn the app with the familiar floral pattern and call it the sand dollar.

CBDCs are a digital version of cash—the physical money issued
by central banks. In most countries, their design will resemble existing online platforms, but with a difference: money held as a CBDCis equivalent to a deposit with the central bank. In China,
more than 100,000 people have downloaded a similar trial mobile phone app, enabling them to spend small government handouts of digital cash, or “e-yuan". The app, like the paper yuan, depicts Mao Zedong. European officials want to launch a digital euro by 2025. On April 19th, the Bank of England and the British Treasury launched a task force to consider the idea. In America, the Fed is also looking into it. A survey by the Bank for International Settlements finds a large majority of central banks researching or experimenting with CBDCs. They may be in use by countries with a
fifth of the world's population in as little as three years' time. 

Until recently, the concept of a retail CBDCwas the province of…
Solely of starry-eyed economists, an interesting but impractical idea. But "in just two years, we have seen a dramatic change in the way people and authorities think and talk about money," says Jean-Pierre Landau, a former deputy governor of the Banque de France. "I cannot think—in peacetime and outside of a crisis—of a recent period where so much has changed in the way people think about money." 
What has prompted the shift? Mr. Landau thinks it was "the wake-up call that Libra represented." Libra was the first name for a digital currency and payments network announced in June 2019 by Facebook, which planned to issue tokens backed by a basket of currencies. "This was a real shock for most of the international monetary community," says Mr. Landau. A second driver was the decline in the use of cash. If cash can no longer be used for transactions, it loses much potency, as it has to be a means of exchange if it is to be a store of value. 

Yet it is still a radical intervention to issue CBDCs, which threaten the traditional banking system. This underpins much lending,
For two centuries, most monetary systems have relied on the framework of credit. For two centuries, most monetary systems have relied on the framework of a lender of last resort in the form of a government-backed body that can step in to save solvent financial institutions. The modern iteration of this is an independent central bank. It provides money both in cash and by creating bank reserves (cash deposits that banks. 

The private bits of the monetary system are the banks. They provide banking services by collecting deposits and making loans. By holding only a portion of these deposits and lending the rest, banks create money: the original deposits remain ready to be called on in full, but there are now new deposits from the proceeds.
