**Technical Analysis:**

- **Overview:** Technical analysis is a trading strategy that uses past price movements to predict future price movements. Technical analysts believe that exchange rates move in trends,  and that these trends can be identified by studying historical price data.
- **How to Use:** Technical analysts use a variety of tools to identify trends,  including moving averages,  trendlines,  and support and resistance levels. They may also use technical indicators,  such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) or the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD),  to help them make trading decisions.
- **Empirical Effectiveness:** The effectiveness of technical analysis is a matter of debate. Some studies have shown that technical analysis can be profitable,  while others have found that it is no more effective than random guessing. The success or failure of technical analysis depends on a number of factors,  including the skill of the analyst,  the market conditions,  and the time frame of the trade.

**The frequency of winning and losing trades has a significant impact on the profitability of moving average trading rules.**

- Studies have shown that moving-average trading rules can generate significant risk-adjusted excess returns over relatively long periods.
- However,  these studies also find that losing trades tend to occur far more frequently than winning trades,  in many cases by a factor of 3 to 1.
- This high frequency of losing trades suggests that moving-average trading rules can be risky over short periods and that an investor would need considerable risk capital on hand to absorb such losses to stay in the game until exchange rates eventually become more highly trended.
- Long-term investors who use moving-average trading rules should be aware of the high frequency of losing trades and should have a trading plan in place to manage risk.

**Key Aspects to Consider with Moving-Average Crossover Trading Rules**

- **Risk-adjusted returns:** Moving-average trading rules have a history of generating profitable risk-adjusted returns over the long run,  but it's worth noting that losing trades occur more frequently than winning trades,  potentially leading to substantial short-term risks.
- **Sharpe ratios:** When assessing the profitability of moving-average trading rules,  Sharpe ratios are a valuable metric. Higher Sharpe ratios indicate a more attractive risk-adjusted return.
- **Market conditions:** Moving-average trading rules may not perform consistently in all market conditions. Periods of low price volatility or a lack of long-term trends can hinder the profitability of these rules.
- **False signals and whipsaws:** False signals and whipsaws,  which can lead to losses due to incorrect trend identification,  remain a challenge for moving-average trading rules.
- **Trend persistence:** The success of moving-average trading rules heavily relies on the persistence of trends in exchange rates. When trends are sustained and pronounced,  these rules tend to perform better.
- **Patience and staying power:** Using moving-average trading rules effectively requires patience and the ability to withstand frequent short-term losses. Investors need adequate risk capital to sustain these losses until exchange rates exhibit more pronounced trends.
- **Potential benefits of filters:** Adding filters or technical indicators to moving-average trading rules may reduce false signals and improve performance,  but it's important to consider the potential trade-off of limiting profit potential.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Fundamental Analysis:**

- **Overview:** Fundamental analysis is a trading strategy that uses economic factors to determine the value of a currency. Fundamental analysts believe that exchange rates are driven by economic factors,  such as interest rates,  inflation,  and trade balances.
- **How to Use:** Fundamental analysts use a variety of economic data to analyze the strength of a currency. They may also use economic models to forecast future economic conditions.
- **Empirical Effectiveness:** Fundamental analysis is generally considered to be more reliable than technical analysis. However,  it is important to note that economic data can be volatile,  and that economic forecasts are not always accurate. The success or failure of fundamental analysis depends on a number of factors,  including the skill of the analyst,  the market conditions,  and the time frame of the trade.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Sentiment and Positioning Surveys:**

- **Overview:** Sentiment and positioning surveys track investor sentiment and positioning in order to identify potential shifts in currency values. Sentiment surveys measure the level of optimism or pessimism among investors,  while positioning surveys measure the amount of money that investors have invested in a particular currency.
- **How to Use:** Sentiment and positioning surveys can be used to identify potential trading opportunities. For example,  if a sentiment survey shows that investors are becoming more optimistic about a particular currency,  this could be a sign that the currency is likely to appreciate in value.
- **Empirical Effectiveness:** Sentiment and positioning surveys can be useful in identifying potential trends,  but they are not always accurate. The success or failure of sentiment and positioning surveys depends on a number of factors,  including the accuracy of the survey data,  the skill of the analyst,  and the market conditions.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**Currency Option Markets:**

- **Overview:** Currency option markets allow investors to speculate on future exchange rate movements. Currency options give the holder the right,  but not the obligation,  to buy or sell a currency at a specified price on or before a specified date.
- **How to Use:** Currency options can be used to hedge against exchange rate risk or to speculate on future exchange rate movements. To hedge against exchange rate risk,  an investor can buy a currency option that gives them the right to sell the currency at a fixed price in the future. To speculate on future exchange rate movements,  an investor can buy a currency option that gives them the right to buy the currency at a fixed price in the future.
- **Empirical Effectiveness:** Currency option markets can be a profitable way to trade exchange rates. However,  it is important to note that currency options are also a risky investment. The success or failure of currency option trading depends on a number of factors,  including the skill of the trader,  the market conditions,  and the time frame of the trade.

## INTRODUCTION
- Deviations from estimated PPP values have tended to be large and persistent,  suggesting that fundamental forces other than relative national inflation rates have played a key role in driving the long-term path that exchange rates have taken
- We investigate a variety of fundamental variables that have had some success in explaining the long-term path that currencies have taken,  including relative productivity growth,  persistent trends in a country's terms of trade,  long-term trends in net foreign asset and liability positions,  and long-term trends in national savings and investment.
- The overall conclusion one draws from a variety of empirical studies is that the success of early-warning systems in terms of generating correct out-of-sample projections is mixed. While most early-warning models can point to a significant number of correctly predicted crises,  those same models also have a tendency to generate a sizable number of false alarms and missed crises.
- We find that medium-term trends are influenced by a variety of macroeconomic indicators such as the trend in real interest-rate differentials,  current and capital-account balances,  relative monetary and fiscal policies,  relative economic growth,  and portfolio-balance considerations.
- Empirical research finds that crises-prone currencies typically display a number of classic symptoms that warn of an impending attack.
- Those symptoms include
	- excessive real appreciation of the emerging-market currency,
	- weak domestic economic growth,
	- rising unemployment,
	- an adverse terms of trade shock,
	- deteriorating current-account balances,
	- excessive domestic credit expansion,
	- banking-system difficulties,
	- unsustainably large government budget deficits,
	- overly expansionary monetary policies,
	- a high ratio of M2 money supply to reserves,
	- foreign-exchange reserve losses,  falling asset prices,
	- and/or a huge build-up in short-term liabilities by either the private or public sector.

## SHORT-RUN FORECASTING TOOLS
- One of the reasons why researchers have not been able to unearth any significant relationship between changes in macroeconomic variables and changes in exchange rates over short periods is that exchange rates often exhibit much greater variability than do macroeconomic time series in the short run. The often chaotic behavior of exchange rates is capable of generating so much noise that it may obscure any discernible relationship between macroeconomic time series and the short-term movement of exchange rates.
- Bandwagon effects are also capable of causing exchange rates to wander away from fundamental equilibrium values in the short run
- Survey studies find that FX market participants tend to have extrapolative expectations over short-term horizons and mean-reverting or regressive expectations over longer horizons. If investors have extrapolative expectations over short horizons,  they may tend to accentuate and perpetuate exchange-rate movements in the short run far beyond the path justified by fundamentals alone.
- Indeed,  if a significant number of investors engaged in extrapolative/trend-following trading strategies,  exchange rates might tend to overshoot on both the upside and downside,  which could further obscure the relationship between macroeconomic fundamentals and the short-term movement of exchange rates.
- When exchange rates fluctuate inside the band of agnosticism,  trading tends to be dominated by short-term technically oriented traders since fundamental-based investors will refrain from joining the fray until the actual exchange rate moves outside of the band.
- When the actual exchange rate moves outside the qU-qL equilibrium range,  fundamental-based investors will tend to shed their agnosticism and become more willing to take on aggressive long positions if the actual exchange rate falls below qL and aggressive short positions if the actual exchange rate rises above qU.
- In times of greater market uncertainty,  however,  the band of agnosticism is likely to widen since investor confidence regarding estimates of fair value is likely to be less strongly held than in tranquil environments. In such cases,  technically oriented traders would tend to dominate trading activity over even wider ranges (q'U-qL'>qUqL). That,  in turn,  would likely lead to even greater FX volatility in the short run.
- Different exchange-rate models can and often do yield quite different estimates of a currency's long-run equilibrium value. In most cases,  the marketplace will have only a rough idea of where a currency's long-run equilibrium value lies.
	- Because of this,  fundamental-based investors will not set their sights on an imprecise point estimate of fair value,  but rather on an equilibrium range or band. Within this equilibrium range or band,  fundamental-based investors will presume that the true but unknown equilibrium exchange rate,  q,  lies somewhere between an upper bound,  qU,  and a lower bound,  qL.
- One of the key problems for fundamental-based investors is that even if the exchange rate moved outside of the band of agnosticism,  there is no guarantee that it would move back inside the band anytime soon.
	- Indeed,  fundamental-based investors run the risk that an overvalued currency might get even more overvalued if the exchange rate moved deeper into overvalued territory,  and vice versa.
- Since large financial resources are likely to be needed for investors to position themselves against an overshooting exchange rate,  one has to wonder how many fund managers would be willing to risk their clients' capital on the basis of long-run valuation considerations,  particularly if clients evaluate their fund manager’s investment performance over a relatively short time span.
	- If fund managers view it as simply too risky to take on long or short currency positions on the basis of long-run valuation considerations,  then there might be several occasions when exchange rates could wander far from any semblance of fair value,  and yet very few investors would be willing to risk their clients' capital to bring the exchange rate back into line with fair value.
- When exchange rates trade inside the qU-qL band,  fundamentalbased investors tend to be agnostic in terms of their currency positioning,  accepting the fact that the actual exchange rate is probably trading close to its fair value.
- Fundamental-based investors would thus not feel compelled to take on either aggressive long or short currency positions when exchange rates are trading inside the band. Instead,  they would more likely adopt a neutral stance toward currency positioning.
## HOW FX DEALERS VIEW THE DETERMINATION OF EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SHORT RUN
- Technical models generate exchange-rate forecasts by extrapolating past sequences of exchange-rate movements into the future. For example,  if a currency begins to edge higher and rises above some critical value,  a technical model will typically issue a recommendation to go long that currency,  the presumption being that the newly formed trend will continue to carry the currency higher in the future. Similarly,  a sell signal would be issued if the currency began to edge lower and fell below some critical value.
- Trend-following trading rules will be profitable as long as the ensuing trend does indeed move in the same direction as the preceding trend,  which would be the case if exchange rates moved in broad,  well-defined cycles. But that is not to say that exchange rates must always move in large swings for trend-following trading rules to be profitable.
	- What matters for long-term profitability is that large exchange-rate upswings and downswings must occur on a frequent enough basis to overcome those occasions when currency movements are not highly trended.
- As long as a confirmed uptrend (or downtrend) is in place,  a recommended long (short) position will be maintained even if the prevailing trend carries the exchange rate well above (below) its long-run fair value.
## THE IDENTIFICATION OF FX MARKET TRENDS AND REVERSALS
- Trend-following trading rules come in many forms. But what all trend-following trading rules have in common is that they seek to identify the direction in which the broad trend in exchange rates is heading. One can visualize the trend in exchange rates as a series of primary and secondary waves. The primary wave refers to the large,  broad moves in exchange rates that carry the underlying trend in currency values either upward or downward. The secondary waves refer to the temporary corrections or partial retracements of the primary trend that typically take place over the course of longer-run exchange-rate cycles. What trend-following trading rules attempt to do is to identify the direction in which the primary waves are heading.
- Markets reverse in many different ways,  but all reversals have one thing in common—all reversals of valid uptrends (downtrends) must be preceded by the failure of market prices to achieve successively higher peaks and troughs (lower troughs and peaks). In the case of a reversal of a previous valid uptrend,  when the wavelike series of rising peaks and troughs is broken,  it indicates that selling pressure is finally beginning to overcome buying pressure.
- One of the most recognizable reversal patterns is the headand-shoulders pattern. A head-and-shoulders pattern is essentially a series of three successive rallies with the second stronger than the first,  and the third weaker than the second. Because the third rally fails to carry as far as the second,  the string of successively higher peaks is broken. This is an initial indication of weak demand,  and the eventual drop in market prices to levels below the preceding trough (or neckline) is confirmation that a reversal is taking place
- In a rising market,  each rally and partial retracement will be higher than its predecessor. As long as advancing prices achieve successively higher peaks and troughs,  they indicate that buying pressure is overcoming selling pressure. In such a case,  the uptrend will be presumed to be intact,  until a reversal is signaled. The opposite would be the case in a declining market.
- A recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York study (Osler and Chang,  1995) found that head-and-shoulders patterns have been successful in anticipating reversals in trend for the yen and Deutschemark.
## TREND-FOLLOWING TRADING RULES AND THE PRINCIPLE OF EXTRAPOLATION
- One popular computer-based technical model is the filter rule,  which issues a buy recommendation if an exchange rate rises by x% above its most recent trough,  and issues a sell recommendation if the exchange rate falls by x% below its most recent peak
- Another popular computer-based technical model is the moving-average crossover model. By constructing longer-run moving averages of daily exchangerate movements,  one can more easily isolate the primary trend from short-run noise. If the short-run moving average of the exchange rate rises above its long-run moving average,  it is an indication that buying pressure is overcoming selling pressure,  and vice versa.

## POTENTIAL PITFALLS FROM FOLLOWING TECHNICAL TRADING RULES
- When exchange-rate swings are sustained and pronounced,  the profitability of most technical trading rules will not be seriously undermined if the trading rule tends to be a bit late in drawing attention to a shift in market direction.
- In markets that exhibit little overall price variation or are not highly trended,  an investor who adheres to a trend-following trading rule will find his portfolio vulnerable to potential whipsaw losses caused by frequent false signals.
## SHOULD MOVING-AVERAGE TRADING RULES BE VIEWED AS SHORT OR LONG-RUN FORECASTING TOOLS?

- Second,  it is possible that since the frequency of losing trades is so large,  this might actually dissuade investors from using technical models in formulating currency investment strategies. If investors shy away from using technical models because of the high frequency of shortterm losses,  this might explain why excess returns in the long run from technical-based models are not completely arbitraged away.
- In order to successfully trade currencies using a technicalbased moving-average trading rule,  an investor needs to have staying power—considerable risk capital on hand to absorb possible frequent short-term trading losses—and patience. There might be other technical tools that could be used to cut down on the number of frequent losses on short-term trading positions,  but one needs to be mindful of the fact that attempts to add "filters" or other types of technical bells and whistles to limit the frequency of false signals might hinder the upside potential of correctly predicted winning trades.
- Our analysis raises several interesting issues. First,  should technical-based moving-average trading rules be viewed as short-term forecasting tools or instead would it be better to view such trading rules as long-term forecasting tools? The results here suggest that technical-based moving-average trading rules work best in the long run,  not in the short run. Indeed,  the odds that a moving-average trading rule recommendation will generate a profit appear to be no better than 25%-35% in most cases in the short run.

## RANDOM WALK TESTS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF TECHNICAL TRADING RULES

- A random walk (serial correlation) test seeks to investigate whether there exists a positive,  negative,  or zero linear relationship between today’s change in the exchange rate and yesterday’s change in the exchange rate. Evidence of a positive linear relationship would indicate the existence of trend persistence since a positive change in a currency's value yesterday would tend to be followed by a positive change today.
- Estimated serial correlation coefficients could vary between +1,  0,  and -1 depending on whether there exists a strong positive relationship,  no relationship,  or a strong negative relationship between successive exchange-rate changes.
- The weight of evidence generally supports the view that for most currencies,  the estimated serial correlation coefficients are often quite small and in many cases statistically insignificant from zero.

## ARE SENTIMENT AND POSITIONING INDICATORS USEFUL IN PREDICTING FX MOVEMENTS?

- In most cases,  exchange rates move in the same direction that sentiment and positioning surveys are moving in the short run.
- For example,  when sentiment toward the dollar becomes increasingly bullish—as reported in the weekly Consensus Inc. Survey of Bullish Market Opinion—the dollar tends to rise. Similarly,  when long U.S. dollar speculative positions are undertaken on the IMM (money-market futures exchange),  the dollar tends to rise as well.
- Our analysis,  listed in the table below,  finds that changes in sentiment and positioning surveys are statistically significant,  for the most part,  in explaining contemporaneous changes in exchange rates,  but that lagged values of sentiment and positioning survey data are statistically insignificant in predicting current changes in exchange rates. This suggests that sentiment/positioning survey data cannot be relied upon as forecasting tools
- Although trends in sentiment and positioning surveys may not help us in forecasting future movements in exchange rates,  they may nevertheless be useful as trend confirmation indicators. Because of the strong positive contemporaneous correlation between the sentiment and positioning data,  on the one hand,  and the trend in exchange rates on the other,  sentiment and positioning data could be used in conjunction with a moving-average model to confirm whether an exchange-rate uptrend or downtrend is intact.
## CAN ONE EXTRACT INFORMATION FROM THE CURRENCY OPTIONS MARKET TO PREDICT FUTURE EXCHANGE-RATE MOVEMENTS?

- Information on future interest-rate and exchange-rate movements can also be gleaned from the options market. Whereas interest-rate futures,  yield-curve slopes,  and yield spreads provide point estimates regarding expected future values,  the options market provides a different piece of information—the market's expectation of the probability distribution of future interest rates and exchange rates
- For example,  in the FX market,  data on implied volatility for a range of maturities and strike prices are readily available. Implied volatility provides us with a measure of the marketplace's uncertainty regarding future exchange-rate movements. If implied volatility is rising,  it "implies" greater uncertainty about future exchange-rate movements,  and vice versa.
- One could construct a forward implied volatility curve to glean expected future volatility movements by stringing together implied volatilities for a range of maturities with the same strike price. If the forward implied volatility curve were steeply upward sloping,  the market would be pricing in the expectation of a future jump in currency volatility. If the forward implied volatility curve were flat,  the marketplace would be pricing in no change in the level of currency volatility in the future

## INFERRING INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE EXCHANGE-RATE MOVEMENTS FROM CURRENCY RISK REVERSALS

- The key issue for traders and investors is whether the level or trend in currency risk reversals can be used to correctly anticipate future exchange-rate movements. The evidence indicates a high contemporaneous correlation between the trend in risk reversals and the trend in exchange rates,  but no statistically significant relationship exists between lagged risk reversal data and future exchange-rate movements. Therefore,  risk reversals are capable of confirming an exchange rate’s trend,  but not predicting it.
- FX traders often use risk reversals to glean information on whether the market might be attaching a higher probability to a large currency appreciation than to a large currency depreciation,  or vice versa
- A risk reversal is a currency option position that consists of the purchase of an out-ofthe-money (25 delta) call and the simultaneous sale of an out-of-the-money (25 delta) put,  both in equal amounts and both with the same expiration date.
- Risk reversals are quoted in terms of the implied volatility spread between the 25 delta call and 25 delta put.
	- For example,  if the implied volatility on the call were 2% larger than the implied volatility on the put,  the risk reversal would be quoted at +2.0%. If the implied volatility on the put were 2% greater than the implied volatility on the call,  the risk reversal would be quoted at -2%.
- A risk reversal quoted at +2% would indicate that the market was attaching a higher probability to a large currency appreciation than to a large currency depreciation.
	- This would indicate that the market was willing to pay more to insure against the risk that the currency will rise sharply than it was willing to pay to insure against the risk that the currency will fall sharply.

## RISK REVERSAL

1. **Understanding Implied Volatility**

	 - **Definition**: Implied volatility (IV) is an estimation of a security's volatility as derived from the price of its options.
	 - **Relation to Option Price**: Higher IV indicates a higher option price,  reflecting greater uncertainty or expected fluctuation in the underlying asset's price.
	 - **Application in Currency Options**: In currency options,  IV indicates the market's expectation of how drastically the currency's value may change.
1. **Positive Risk Reversal Quote (+2.0%)**

	 - **Higher Implied Volatility for the Call Option**
		  - A positive risk reversal quote,  like +2.0%,  means the IV of the call option is higher than that of the put option by 2%.
		  - This disparity in IV is significant because it shows a market inclination towards one direction over the other.
	 - **Implication of Higher IV in Call Option**
		  - A higher IV in the call option suggests that traders anticipate more significant movement in the currency's value upwards.
		  - As options are more expensive when larger movements are expected,  a higher IV for calls implies that traders are willing to pay more for the chance to buy the currency at a predetermined price,  expecting it to increase.
	 - **Expectation of Currency Appreciation**
		  - When traders are willing to pay more for call options (betting on the currency's rise),  it directly reflects their expectation of currency appreciation.
		  - This expectation could be due to various factors,  including economic indicators,  geopolitical events,  or market trends.
1. **Negative Risk Reversal Quote (-2%)**

	 - **Higher Implied Volatility for the Put Option**
		  - Conversely,  a negative quote like -2% indicates that the IV for the put option is higher than that of the call option by 2%.
		  - This suggests that the market perceives a greater risk or likelihood of the currency's value decreasing.
	 - **Implication of Higher IV in Put Option**
		  - A higher IV in the put option implies that traders anticipate a significant downward movement in the currency's value.
		  - Traders are willing to pay more for put options as they bet on the currency's fall,  expecting to sell it at a predetermined price before it decreases further.
	 - **Expectation of Currency Depreciation**
		  - When the market is willing to pay more for put options (betting on the currency's fall),  it indicates an expectation of currency depreciation.
		  - This sentiment can be driven by various economic factors,  including declining economic forecasts,  political instability,  or other adverse market conditions.

#### KEY TAKEAWAY

- The risk reversal quote is an indicator of market sentiment. A positive quote suggests a bullish outlook (currency appreciation),  whereas a negative quote indicates a bearish outlook (currency depreciation). The greater the absolute value of the quote,  the stronger the market sentiment in that direction.

 Large FX dealers can use the information gleaned from the change in their customer order flow to drive their own short-run strategies,  which can then add to the upward or downward pressure on the exchange rate's value.

- A recent survey of FX dealers indicated that most traders believe that large FX dealers have a comparative advantage over smaller dealers because they have a large customer base that gives them privileged information about customer orders.
- However,  there may be microeconomic-related information that is important for exchange rates,  but is not - publicly available.
- Examples of microeconomic-related information are
	- shifts in risk appetite,
	- liquidity needs,
	- hedging demands,
	- and institutional portfolio rebalancings
- Such microeconomic-related FX flows give rise to buy or sell orders that influence the short-term trend in exchange rates,  just as investor responses to macroeconomic-related information do.
- One could envisage a marketplace where there exists both private and publicly available information. Publicly available information consists largely of macroeconomic-related data,  which is available to all market participants at the same time

Carry trades (long positions in high-yield currencies funded by short positions in lowyield currencies) work best in benign risk-appetite environments.
	- That is,  when investors have a strong appetite to take on risk,  they are more apt to engage in riskier strategies such as carry trades,  and if their level of confidence is high,  they may engage in such trades in a leveraged manner.
	- In contrast,  during periods of high risk aversion,  investors are more likely to cut risky positions,  particularly positions that might be highly leveraged.
- Thus,  if the inclination to take on carry trades tends to move positively with investors’ appetite to take on risk,  we would expect to find a close relationship between the profitability of carry trades and the trend in risk appetite indicators.
- the rolling returns from being long the three highest yielding currencies in the industrial world and being short the three lowest yielding currencies in the industrial world closely tracks the trend in the Deutsche Bank Risk Appetite index.
	- Given this tight fit,  fund managers who undertake carry trades on a frequent basis might find it useful to initiate carry trades when the risk appetite index is trading upward,  and to cut such positions when the risk appetite index is trending downward.
