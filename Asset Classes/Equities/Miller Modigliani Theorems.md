**The Miller Modigliani Theorems**

# Miller Modigliani Theorems

- Miller and Modigliani argue that,  in a frictionless world (i.e.,  no taxes,  no bankruptcy costs,  and capital markets are perfectly competitive),  a firm's value is determined by its real assets,  not by its capital structure.
- To put it mathematically,  let's denote the value of a levered firm (i.e.,  a firm with debt) as$V_L$﻿ and an unlevered firm (i.e.,  a firm without debt) as$V_U$﻿. Then,  the theorem states:
	 - $V_L=V_U$﻿
- Here's why this holds true: Suppose we have two firms,  Firm A (levered) and Firm B (unlevered). Both have identical assets and operating income. Firm A finances its assets partly with debt and equity,  while Firm B uses only equity.
- According to the M&M theorem,  investors are indifferent between investing in Firm A or Firm B. If Firm A’s shares are too expensive,  investors would purchase Firm B’s shares and borrow money on their own (in the perfect capital market) to mimic the returns of Firm A,  driving down the price of Firm A’s shares. This arbitrage process continues until the prices reach equilibrium,  making the values of the two firms the same.
- In an ideal,  frictionless world,  the capital structure (i.e.,  how a firm finances its operations and growth with different sources of funds,  such as debt and equity) is irrelevant to the overall value of the firm. The proposition states that the value of a firm is independent of its debt-equity mix and is determined solely by its real assets.

The theorem is based on a number of assumptions:

1. **No taxes**: In reality,  corporate taxes and personal taxes exist and can impact the capital structure decision. For instance,  in many countries,  interest payments on debt are tax-deductible,  reducing the overall tax liability of the firm,  which is an incentive to take on debt.
1. **No bankruptcy costs**: In the real world,  if a firm defaults on its debt obligations,  it may have to go through bankruptcy,  which can involve substantial costs. These costs reduce the value of the firm and make debt less attractive.
1. **Homogeneous expectation**: This implies all investors have the same expectations for future investments and profits.
1. **No transaction costs**: This includes costs such as brokerage fees,  which can impact the ability of investors to engage in arbitrage.
1. **Perfect capital markets**: All investors have access to information and can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate.

## **UNDERSTANDING THE PROPOSITION WITH ARBITRAGE**

- The principle of arbitrage is crucial to understanding this proposition. Arbitrage involves taking advantage of price differences in different markets.
- Suppose we have two identical firms - Firm A (levered) and Firm B (unlevered). The only difference between the two firms is that Firm A has debt while Firm B does not. According to the M&M theorem,  the market value of both firms should be the same due to arbitrage.
- Let's say that the market value of Firm A (levered) is higher than Firm B (unlevered). This price discrepancy sets up an opportunity for arbitrage. Investors can borrow money at the risk-free rate,  buy shares in the unlevered firm (Firm B),  and replicate the cash flows of the levered firm (Firm A). The increased demand for Firm B's shares will drive its price up,  while the decreased demand for Firm A's shares will drive its price down. This arbitrage process continues until the prices reach equilibrium and the values of the two firms are equal.
- The key takeaway is that in a frictionless world,  how a firm finances its operations does not matter because investors can replicate the firm's capital structure on their own.

**In the Real World**

- In the real world,  the assumptions of the M&M theorem seldom hold. Taxes,  bankruptcy costs,  and market imperfections can influence the firm's value and optimal capital structure. However,  the M&M theorem is a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the potential effects of capital structure on firm value. It provides the fundamental insight that,  without taxes and bankruptcy costs,  how a firm finances its investments does not matter. The value of the firm is determined solely by the cash flows generated by its assets.

# **2. DEBT-EQUITY IRRELEVANCE THEOREM**

Miller and Modigliani's second proposition,  in the absence of taxes,  states that the cost of equity for a levered firm is a linear function of its Debt/Equity (D/E) ratio. Furthermore,  the overall cost of capital for the firm (known as the weighted average cost of capital or WACC) remains constant,  regardless of changes in the firm's capital structure.

- The cost of equity capital,  $r_E$,  for a levered firm is given by:

$r_E=r_0+(r_0−r_D)\frac{D}{E}$

	 - $r_0$﻿ is the cost of capital for an unlevered firm,     
	 - $r_D$﻿ is the cost of debt,     
	 - $D$﻿ is the market value of debt,     
	 - $E$﻿ is the market value of equity.
- As the firm increases its debt ($D$﻿),  the risk (and hence the return required by shareholders) increases. This equation demonstrates that as a firm takes on more debt,  the risk (and hence the required return by shareholders) increases linearly. This is because equity holders have a residual claim on the firm's income: they receive what's left after all obligations,  including debt,  are met. More debt implies that there are more fixed obligations,  and hence more risk to equity holders.
- The firm's overall cost of capital (WACC),  denoted ($r_A$﻿),  which is a weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt,  remains constant:$r_A=\frac{D}{V} * r_D + \frac{E}{V} r_E=r_0$﻿

$r_A=\frac{D}{V} * r_D + \frac{E}{V} r_E=r_0$

	 - Here,     $V$﻿ is the total market value of the firm ($V = D + E$﻿). This equation indicates that the firm's weighted average cost of capital is independent of its capital structure and equal to the firm's cost of capital as if it were all-equity financed.
	 
	 **Assumptions Behind Proposition II**
	 
	 1. **Perfect capital markets**: There are no taxes,      no bankruptcy costs,      investors can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate,      and there is no information asymmetry.
	 2. **Homogeneous expectations**: All investors have the same expectations regarding the firm's future earnings and risks.
	 3. **100% payout ratio**: All earnings are distributed to the investors. This assumption is needed to conclude that the cost of equity increases linearly with the debt-equity ratio.
	 
	 **Implications and Criticisms**
	 
	 - Proposition II provides the base theory that underpins the risk and return trade-off in capital structure decisions. As the firm leverages up,      the equity holders bear more risk,      which should be compensated by a higher expected return,      increasing the cost of equity. However,      the firm's overall cost of capital remains constant and is not affected by the capital structure changes.
	 - It's important to note that in the real world,      the assumptions of the M&M Proposition II do not hold. For example,      interest expenses are tax-deductible,      which reduces the cost of debt and,      consequently,      the WACC. This gives firms an incentive to use debt in their capital structure,      leading to a deviation from the M&M proposition II. Additionally,      increasing debt increases the risk of bankruptcy,      which can lead to bankruptcy costs,      further complicating the relationship between capital structure and firm value.

**3. Dividend Irrelevance Theorem**

- Miller and Modigliani's third proposition,  in a world without taxes and other market imperfections,  states that the firm's dividend policy does not affect its share price or overall value. In essence,  whether a firm retains its earnings or pays them out as dividends does not impact its market value.
- Suppose$P_0$﻿ is the initial share price,  $D$﻿ is the dividend paid,  and$P_1$﻿ is the share price after the dividend. Then,  $P_0=D+P_1$﻿

$P_0=D+P_1$

	 - This equation means that an investor's total wealth (the sum of the value of the shares after the dividend and the dividend itself) does not change due to the payment of dividends. It reflects the assumption that investors are indifferent between dividends and capital gains.
- Whether a firm retains its earnings or pays them out as dividends does not affect its value. This is because shareholders can create their own dividend policy. If a firm doesn't pay dividends,  a shareholder can create a "homemade dividend" by selling shares.

**Homemade Dividends**

- A key concept behind this theorem is the idea of homemade dividends. According to this principle,  investors can sell a portion of their shares if they want cash dividends. This process of selling shares to create personal cash flow is termed as homemade dividends.
- For example,  if an investor owns shares worth$1000 and desires a$50 dividend,  they can sell$50 worth of shares,  thereby creating a homemade dividend.

**Assumptions of the Dividend Irrelevance Theory**

The key assumptions of the dividend irrelevance theory are:

1. **Perfect capital markets**: Investors can buy and sell securities without transaction costs and can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate. Also,  all investors have access to the same information.
1. **Rational behavior**: Investors are rational and look to maximize their wealth.
1. **No taxes**: There are no taxes,  which implies that dividends and capital gains are taxed at the same rate.
1. **Fixed investment policy**: The firm's investment policy is fixed and is not affected by its dividend policy.

**Real World Implications and Limitations**

- The Dividend Irrelevance Theorem provides a baseline theory on the impact of dividend policy on a firm's value. However,  in reality,  their assumptions rarely hold due to taxes,  bankruptcy costs,  information asymmetry,  and agency costs. These factors can influence the capital structure and dividend policies of firms and hence their market values.
- For example,  because interest on debt is tax-deductible,  firms often have a tax incentive to increase debt. This contradicts the M&M capital structure irrelevance theorem,  leading to the trade-off theory of capital structure,  which balances the tax advantages of debt with the costs of financial distress. If the tax rate on dividends is higher than that on capital gains,  investors might prefer firms that retain earnings or repurchase shares rather than those that pay out dividends.
- Furthermore,  in the presence of information asymmetry between management and shareholders,  dividends may serve as a signaling mechanism. A firm with good prospects might increase its dividend to signal its positive future prospects to the market.
